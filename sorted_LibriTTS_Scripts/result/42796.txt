little village of Middlesex Nobody knew where they came from or who they were But the neighbors soon made up their minds what they thought of the strangers for the father was very drunk He could hardly walk up the rickety front steps of the old tumble down house and his thirteen year old son had to help him Toward eight o clock a pretty capable looking girl of twelve came out of the house and bought a loaf of bread at the baker s And that was all the villagers learned about the newcomers that night There are four children said the bakeshop woman to her husband the next day and their mother is dead They must have some money for the girl paid for the bread with a dollar bill Make them pay for everything they get growled the baker who was a hard man The father is nearly dead with drink now and soon they will be only beggars This happened sooner than he thought The next day the oldest boy and girl came to ask the bakeshop woman to come over Their father was dead She went over willingly enough for someone had to go But it was clear that she did not expect to be bothered with four strange children with the bakery on her hands and two children of her own Haven t you any other folks she asked the children We have a grandfather in Greenfield spoke up the youngest child before his sister could clap her hand over his mouth Hush Benny she said anxiously This made the bakeshop woman suspicious What s the matter with your grandfather she asked He doesn t like us replied the oldest boy reluctantly He didn t want my father to marry my mother and if he found us he would treat us cruelly Did you ever see him Jess has Once she saw him Well did he treat you cruelly asked the woman turning upon Jess Oh he didn t see me replied Jess He was just passing through our where we used to live and my father pointed him out to me Where did you use to live went on the questioner But none of the children could be made to tell We will get along all right alone won t we Henry declared Jess Indeed we will said Henry I will stay in the house with you tonight said the woman at last and tomorrow we will see what can be done The four children went to bed in the kitchen and gave the visitor the only other bed in the house They knew that she did not at once go to bed but sat by the window in the dark Suddenly they heard her talking to her husband through the open window They must go to their grandfather that s certain Jess heard her say Of course agreed her husband Tomorrow we will make them tell us what his name is Soon after that Jess and Henry heard her snoring heavily They sat up in the dark Mustn t we surely run away whispered Jess in Henry s ear Yes whispered Henry Take only what we need most We must be far off before morning or they will catch us Jess sat still for a moment thinking for every motion she made must count I will take both loaves of bread she thought and Violet s little workbag Henry has his knife And all Father s money is in my pocket She drew it out and counted it in the dark squinting her eyes in the faint light of the moon It amounted to nearly four dollars You ll have to carry Benny until he gets waked up whispered Jess If we wake him up here he might cry She touched Violet as she spoke Sh Violet Come We re going to run away she whispered The little girl made no sound She sat up obediently and tried to make out the dim shadow of her sister What shall I do she said light as a breath Carry this said Jess handing her the workbag and a box of matches Jess tiptoed over to the tin box on the table drew out the two loaves of bread and slipped them into the laundry bag She peered around the room for the last time and then dropped two small clean towels and a cake of soap into the bag All right Pick him up she said to Henry Henry bent over the sleeping child and lifted him carefully Jess took the laundry bag turned the doorknob ever so softly opened the door ever so slowly and they tiptoed out in a ghostly procession Jess shut the door with as much care as she had opened it listened to the bakeshop woman s heavy snoring for a moment and then they turned and picked their way without a sound to the country road She may wake up before morning you know whispered Henry We must do our fastest walking before then If we can only get to another town before they find out we re gone they won t know which way to go Jess agreed and they all walked briskly along in the faint moonlight How far can you carry Benny asked Violet Oh at least a mile said Henry confidently although his arms were beginning to ache Benny was five years old and he was a fat healthy boy as well I think we could all walk faster if we woke him up said Jess decidedly We could each take his hand and almost carry him along Henry knelt by the roadside and set the little fellow against his knee Come Benny you must wake up now and walk said Jess coaxingly Go away Benny mumbled with his eyes shut trying to lie down again Let me try Violet offered softly Say Benny you know little Cinnamon Bear ran away to find a nice warm bed for the winter Now you play you re Cinnamon and Henry and Jess will help you along and we ll find a bed Violet s little plan worked Benny was never too cross to listen to the wonderful stories his sister Violet could tell about Cinnamon Bear He stood up bravely and marched along yawning while his big brother and sister almost swung him between them Not a soul passed them on the country road All the houses they saw were dark and still And when the first faint streaks of morning light showed in the sky all four children were almost staggering with sleep I must go to sleep Henry murmured Jess at last Little Benny was asleep already and Henry was carrying him again The first place we come to then panted Henry Violet said nothing but she kept her eyes open Finally she caught Henry s sleeve Couldn t we make that haystack do she asked pointing across a newly mown field Indeed we could said Henry thankfully What a big enormous one it is I was too sleepy to see it I guess And see how far away from the farmhouse and barn it is too echoed Jess The sight gave them new courage They climbed over two stone walls got across a brook somehow with the heavy child and arrived at the haystack Henry laid his brother down and stretched his aching arms while Jess began to burrow into the haystack Violet after a moment of watching her did the same Here s his nest said Jess sleepily taking her head out of the deep round hole she had made Henry lifted the child into the opening and was pleased to see that he curled up instantly smiling in his sleep Jess pulled wisps of hay over the opening so that it was absolutely invisible and then proceeded to dig out a similar burrow for herself We can stay here just as long as we like can t we Henry she murmured digging with her eyes shut We sure can replied Henry You re an old brick Jess Get in and I ll pull the hay over the hole Violet was already curled up in her nest which was hidden so completely that Henry spoke to her to see if she were there Then he wriggled himself backward into the haycock without stopping to hollow it out pulled a handful of hay over his head and laid his head on his arm Just as he did so he heard a heavy voice say Now then lass git along Then he heard the rumble of a milk wagon coming down a near by lane and he realized thankfully that they had hidden themselves just before the first farmer in the neighborhood had set off toward Middlesex with his milk cans He will say he didn t meet us coming this way thought Henry so they will hunt for us the other way And that will give us time to cover a lot more ground He dropped asleep just as the roosters all over the valley began to answer each other THE SECOND NIGHT The roosters crowed and the hens clucked the farmer s wife began to get breakfast and the four children slept on Dinner time came and went and still they slept for it must be remembered that they had been awake and walking during the whole night In fact it was nearly seven o clock in the evening when they awoke Luckily all the others awoke before Benny Can you hear me Jess said Henry speaking very low through the wall of hay Yes answered Jess softly Let s make one big room of our nests No sooner said than done The boy and girl worked quickly and quietly until they could see each other They pressed the hay back firmly until they had made their way into Violet s little room And then she in turn groped until she found Benny Hello little Cinnamon whispered Violet playfully And Benny at once made up his mind to laugh instead of cry But laughing out loud was almost as bad so Henry took his little brother on the hay beside him and talked to him seriously You re old enough now Benny to understand what I say to you Now listen When I tell you to keep still after this that means you re to stop crying if you re crying or stop laughing if you re laughing and be just as still as you possibly can If you don t mind you will be in danger Do you understand Don t I have to mind Jess and Violet too asked Benny Absolutely said Henry You have to mind us all every one of us Benny thought a minute Can t I ask for what I want any more he said Indeed you can cried Jess and Henry together What is it you want I m awful hungry said Benny anxiously Henry s brow cleared Good old Benny he said We re just going to have supper or is it breakfast Jess drew out the fragrant loaf of bread She cut it with Henry s jackknife into four quarters and she and Henry took the two crusty ends themselves That s because we have to be the strongest and crusts make you strong explained Jess Violet looked at her older sister She thought she knew why Jess took the crust but she did not speak We will stay here till dark and then we ll go on with our journey said Henry cheerfully I want a drink announced Benny A drink you shall have Henry promised but you ll have to wait till it s really dark If we should creep out to the brook now and any one saw us He did not finish his sentence but Benny realized that he must wait He was much refreshed from his long sleep and felt very lively Violet had all she could do to keep him amused even with Cinnamon Bear and his five brothers At last Henry peeped out It was after nine o clock There were lights in the farmhouse still but they were all upstairs We can at least get a drink now he said And the children crept quietly to the noisy little brook not far from the haystack Cup said Benny No you ll have to lie down and drink with your mouth Jess explained And so they did Never did water taste so cool and delicious as it did that night to the thirsty children When they had finished drinking they jumped the brook ran quickly over the fields to the wall and once more found themselves on the road If we meet any one said Jess we must all crouch behind bushes until he has gone by They walked along in the darkness with light hearts They were no longer tired or hungry Their one thought was to get away from their grandfather if possible If we can find a big town said Violet won t it be better to stay in than a little town Why asked Henry puffing up the hill Well you see there are so many people in a big town nobody will notice us And in a little village everyone would be talking about us finished Henry admiringly You ve got brains Violet He had hardly said this when a wagon was heard behind them in the distance It was coming from Middlesex Without a word the four children sank down behind the bushes like frightened rabbits They could plainly hear their hearts beat The horse trotted nearer and then began to walk up the hill If we hear nothing in Townsend they heard a man say we have plainly done our duty It was the baker s voice More than our duty said the baker s wife tiring out a horse with going a full day from morning until night There was silence as the horse pulled the creaky wagon At least we will go on to Townsend tonight continued the baker and tell them to watch out We need not go to Intervale for they never could walk so far We are well rid of them I should say replied his wife They may not have come this way The milkman did not see them did he The baker s reply was lost for the horse had reached the hilltop where he broke into a canter It was some minutes before the children dared to creep out of the bushes again One thing is sure said Henry when he got his breath We will not go to Townsend And we will go to Intervale said Jess With a definite goal in mind at last the children set out again with a better spirit They walked until two o clock in the morning stopping often this time to rest and to drink from the horses watering troughs And then they came upon a fork in the road with a white signpost shining in the moonlight Townsend four miles Intervale six miles read Henry aloud Any one feel able to walk six more miles He grinned No one had the least idea how far they had already walked We ll go that way at least said Jess finally That we will agreed Henry picking up his brother for a change and carrying him pig back Violet went ahead The new road was a pleasant woody one with grass growing in the middle The children could not see the grass but they could feel it as they walked Not many people pass this way I guess remarked Violet Just then she caught her toe in something and almost fell but Jess caught her The two girls stooped down to examine the obstruction Hay said Jess Hay repeated Violet Hey cried Henry coming up What did you say It must have fallen off somebody s load said Jess We ll take it with us Henry decided wisely Load on all you can carry Jess For Benny thought Violet to herself So the odd little party trudged on for nearly three hours laden with hay until they found that the road ended in a cart path through the woods Oh dear exclaimed Jess almost ready to cry with disappointment What s the matter demanded Henry in astonishment Isn t the woods a good place to sleep We can t sleep in the road you know It does seem nice and far away from people admitted Jess and it s almost morning As they stood still at the entrance to the woods they heard the rumble of a train It roared down the valley at a great rate and passed them on the other side of the woods thundering along toward the city Never mind the train either remarked Henry It isn t so awfully near and even if it were it couldn t see us He set his brother down and peered into the woods It was very warm Lizzen said Benny Listen echoed Violet More water Benny cried catching his big brother by the hand It is only another brook said Henry with a thankful heart He wants a drink The trickle of water sounded very pleasant to all the children as they lay down once more to drink Benny was too sleepy to eat Jess quickly found a dry spot thick with moss between two stones Upon this moss the three older children spread the hay in the shape of an oval bed Benny tumbled into it with a great sigh of satisfaction while his sisters tucked the hay around him Pine needles up here Jess called Henry from the slope Each of them quickly scraped together a fragrant pile for a pillow and once more lay down to sleep with hardly a thought of fear I only hope we won t have a thunderstorm said Jess to herself as she shut her tired eyes And she did not open them for a long time although the dark gray clouds piled higher and more thickly over the sleeping children SHELTER When Jess opened her eyes it must have been about ten o clock in the morning She sat up and looked all around her She could see dimly the opening where they had come into the woods She looked around to see that her family was still safely by her Then she looked up at the sky At first she thought it must still be night and then she realized that the darkness was caused by an approaching storm Whatever whatever shall we do now demanded Jess of the air She got up and looked in every direction for shelter She even walked quite a little way into the woods and down a hill And there she stood not knowing what to do next I shall have to wake Henry up she said at last Only how I hate to As she spoke she glanced into the forest and her feet felt as if they were nailed to the ground She could not stir Faintly outlined among the trees Jess saw an old freight or box car Her first thought was one of fear her second hope for shelter As she thought of shelter her feet moved and she stumbled toward it It really was a freight car She felt of it It stood on rusty broken rails which were nearly covered with dead leaves Then the thunder cracked overhead Jess came to her usual senses and started back for Henry flying like the wind He was awake looking anxiously overhead He had not noticed that Jess was missing Come panted Jess I ve found a place Hurry hurry Henry did not stop to ask questions He picked up Benny telling Violet to gather up the hay And then they ran headlong through the thick underbrush in Jess wake seeing their way only too well by the sharp flashes of lightning It s beginning to sprinkle gasped Henry We ll get there all right Jess shouted back It s not far Be all ready to help me open the door when we get there By sheer good fortune a big tree stump stood under the door of the freight car or the children never could have opened it As it was Jess sprang on the stump and Henry pausing to lay Benny down did likewise Together they rolled back the heavy door about a foot That s enough panted Jess I ll get in and you hand Benny up to me No said Henry quietly I must see first if any one is in there It will rain protested Jess Nothing will hurt me But she knew it was useless to argue with Henry so she hastily groped in the bag for the matches and handed them to her brother It must be confessed that Jess held her breath while Henry struck one and peered about inside the car All s well he reported Come in everybody Violet passed the hay up to her brother and crawled in herself Then Jess handed Benny up like a package of groceries and taking one last look at the angry sky and waving trees she climbed in after him The two children managed to roll the door back so that the crack was completely closed before the storm broke But at that very instant it broke with a vengeance It seemed to the children that the sky would split so sharp were the cracks of thunder But not a drop of rain reached them in their roomy retreat They could see nothing at all for the freight car was tightly made and all outside was nearly as black as night Through it all Benny slept on Presently the thunder grew fainter and rumbled away down the valley and the rain spent itself Only the drip from the trees on the top of the car could be heard Then Henry ventured to open the door He knelt on his hands and knees and thrust his head out The warm sunlight was filtering through the trees making golden pools of light here and there The beautiful trees pines and white birches and oaks grew thickly around and the ground was carpeted with flowers and wonderful ferns more than a yard high But most miraculous of all was a miniature waterfall small but perfect where the same little brown brook fell gracefully over some ledges and danced away down the glen In an instant Jess and Violet were looking over Henry s shoulder at the pretty sight How different everything looks with the sun shining exclaimed Jess Things will soon be dry at this rate It must be about noon observed Henry looking at the sun And as he spoke the faint echo of mill bells in the distance was heard Henry said Jess sharply Let s live here Live here repeated Henry dully Yes Why not replied Jess Nobody uses this car and it s dry and warm We re quite far away And yet we are near enough to a town so we can buy things And we re near water added Violet Jess hugged her sister So we are little mouse she said the most important thing of all But began Henry Please Henry said Jess excitedly I could make this old freight car into the dearest little house with beds and chairs and a table and dishes I d like to live here too said a determined little voice from the corner but I don t want to unless Unless what asked Henry panic stricken Unless I can have my dinner Benny finished anxiously We ll have something to eat right away old fellow said Henry thankful it was no worse For he himself was beginning to see what a cozy home the car really would make Jess cut the last loaf of bread into four pieces but alas it was very dry The children were so hungry that they tore it with their teeth like little dogs but Benny was nearly crying He did not actually cry however for just at the crucial moment Violet started a funny story about Cinnamon Bear eating bread crusts out of the ash can He ought to have milk said Jess quietly to Henry He shall have milk replied Henry I ll go down the railroad track to the town and get some Jess counted out a dollar in ten dimes and handed it to Henry By the time our four dollars are gone you will have some work to do she said All the same Henry did not like to begin his trip How I hate to leave you alone Jess he said miserably Oh don t you worry began Jess lightly We ll have a surprise for you when you come back You just wait and see And she nodded her head wisely as Henry walked slowly off through the woods The moment he was out of sight she turned to Benny and Violet Now children she said what do you think we re going to do Do you know what I saw over in the sunny part of the woods I saw some blueberries Oh oh cried Benny who knew what blueberries were Can t we have some blueberries and milk We certainly began Jess But the sentence never was finished for a sharp crackle of dry leaves was heard Something was moving in the woods A NEW HOME Keep still whispered Jess Benny obeyed The three children were as motionless as stone images huddled inside the freight car Jess opened her mouth in order to breathe at all her heart was thumping so wildly She watched like a cat through the open door in the direction of the rustling noise And in a moment the trembling bushes parted and out crawled a dog He was an Airedale and was pulling himself along on three legs whimpering softly Jess drew a long breath of relief and said to the children It s all right Only a dog But he seems to be hurt At the sound of her voice the dog lifted his eyes and wagged his tail feebly He held up his front foot Poor doggie murmured Jess soothingly as she clambered out of the car Let Jess see your poor lame foot She approached the dog carefully for she remembered that her mother had always told her never to touch a strange dog unless he wagged his tail But this dog s tail was wagging certainly so Jess bent over without fear to look at the paw An exclamation of pity escaped her when she saw it for a stiff sharp thorn had been driven completely through one of the cushions of the dog s foot and around it the blood had dried I guess I can fix that said Jess briskly But taking the thorn out is going to hurt you old fellow The dog looked up at her as she laid his paw down and licked her hand Come here Violet and Benny directed Jess She took the animal gently in her lap and turned him on his side She patted his head and stroked his nose with one finger and offered him the rest of her breadcrust which she had put in her apron pocket The dog snapped it up as if he were nearly starved Then she held the soft paw firmly with her left hand and pulled steadily on the thorn with her right hand The dog did not utter a sound He lay motionless in her lap until the thorn suddenly let go and lay in Jess hand Good good cried Violet Wet my handkerchief Jess ordered briskly Violet did so dipping it in the running brook Jess wrapped the cool wet folds around the hot paw and gently squeezed it against the wound the dog meanwhile trying to lick her hands We ll s prise Henry won t we laughed Benny delightedly Now we got a dog To be sure said Jess struck with the thought but that isn t what I intended for a surprise You know I was intending to get a lot of blueberries and maybe find some old dishes in a dump or something Can t we look while you hold the dog asked Violet anxiously Of course you can Pet said Jess Look over there by those rocks Benny and Violet scrambled through the underbrush to the place Jess pointed out and investigated But they did not hunt long for the blueberries were so thick that the bushes almost bent over with their weight O Jessy screamed Benny you never saw so many in your life What ll we pick em into Come and get a clean towel said Jess who noticed that Benny was already picking into his own mouth But that s just as well she thought Because he won t get so hungry waiting for the milk She watched the two children a moment as they dropped handfuls of the bluish globes on the towel Then she carefully got up with her little patient and went over and sat down in the center of the patch The berries were so thick she did not have to change her position before the towel held over a quart Oh dear sighed Jess I wish I could hunt for some dishes so we could have blueberries and milk Never mind tonight said Violet We can just eat a handful of berries and then take a drink of milk when Henry comes But it was even better than that for when Henry came he had two bottles of milk under one arm a huge loaf of brown bread under the other and some golden cheese in waxed paper in his pocket But you should have seen Henry stare when he saw what Jess was holding Where in the world began the boy He camed to us volunteered Benny He camed for a s prise for you And he s a nice doggie Henry knelt down to look at the visitor who wagged his tail It wouldn t be a bad thing to have a watchdog said Henry I worried about you all the time I was gone Did you bring some milk inquired Benny trying to be polite but looking at the bottles with longing eyes Bless his heart said Jess struggling to her feet with the dog We ll have dinner right away or is it supper Call it supper suggested Henry for it s the last thing we ll have to eat today And then tomorrow we ll start having three meals every day laughed Jess It was certainly a queer meal whatever it was Jess who liked above all things to be orderly spread out the big gray laundry bag on the pine needles for a tablecloth The brown loaf was cut by a very excited little hostess into five thick squares the cheese into four Dogs don t eat cheese Benny remarked cheerfully The poor little fellow was glad of it too for he was very hungry He could hardly wait for Jess to set the milk bottles in the center of the table and heap the blueberries in four little mounds one at each place I m sorry we haven t cups Jess remarked We ll just have to drink out of the same bottle No we won t said Henry We ll drink half of each bottle so that will make at least two things to drink out of Good for you Henry said Jess much relieved You and Benny use one and Violet and I will use the other So the meal began Look Benny directed Henry Eat a handful of blueberries then take a bite of brown bread then a nibble of cheese Now a drink of milk It s good It s good mumbled Benny to himself all through the meal You must not imagine that the poor wandering dog was neglected for Jess fed him gently as he lay in her lap poking morsels of bread into his mouth and pouring milk into her own hand for him to lap up When the meal was over and exactly half of each bottle of milk remained Jess said We are going to sleep on beds tonight and just as soon as we get our beds made we are all going to be washed That ll be fun Benny added Violet We ll wash our paws in the brook just the way Cinnamon does First let s gather armfuls of dry pine needles ordered Jess Get those on top that have been lying in the sunshine Jess laid the dog down on a bed of moss as she spoke and started energetically to scoop up piles of the fragrant needles Soon a pile as high as her head stood just under the freight car door I think we have enough she said at last Taking the scissors from Violet s workbag she cut the laundry bag carefully into two pieces saving the cord for a clothesline One of the big squares was laid across Benny s hay and tucked under That was the softest bed of all Violet s apron and her own she cut off at the belt I ll sleep next to Benny said Henry with my head up by the door Then I can hear what is going on A big pile of pine needles was loaded into the freight car for Henry s bed and covered with the other half of the laundry bag The remainder of the needles Jess piled into the farthest corner of the car for herself and Violet We ll all sleep on one side so we can call it the bedroom What ll be the other side inquired Benny The other side repeated Jess Let me think I guess that ll be the sitting room and perhaps some of the time the kitchen On rainy days maybe the dining room added Henry with a wink Couldn t it be the parlor begged Benny Certainly the parlor We forgot that agreed Jess returning the wink She was covering the last two soft beds with the two aprons The tops of these aprons are washcloths she said severely Then armed with the big cake of soap she led the way to the brook The dog watched them anxiously but when Jess said Lie still he obeyed From the moment Jess drew the thorn from his foot he was her dog to obey her slightest command and to follow her wherever she went The clean cool brook was delightful even to Benny The children rolled up their sleeves and plunged their dusty arms into its waters quarreling good naturedly over the soap and lathering their stained faces and necks with it When they were well rinsed with clear water they dried themselves with the towel Then Jess washed both towels nicely with soap rinsed them and hung them on the clothesline of tape which she had stretched between two slender birch trees They flapped lazily in the wind Looks like home already Jess said Henry smiling at the washing The tired children clambered into the bedroom Jess coming last with the wounded dog We ll have to leave the door open it s so hot said Henry lying down with a tired sigh And in less than ten minutes they were fast asleep dog and all asleep at six o clock asleep without naming the dog without locking the door without fear for this was the first night in four that they had been able to go to sleep at night as children should HOUSEKEEPING The next morning Jess was up before the others as was fitting for a little housekeeper That is she was first if we except the dog who had opened one eye instantly every time his little mistress stirred in her sleep He sat watching gravely in the door of the car as Jess descended to get breakfast She walked from the little waterfall quite a distance down the brook looking at it with critical eyes This will be the well she said to herself regarding a small but deep and quiet basin just below the falls Below that she found a larger basin lined with gravel with flat stones surrounding it This will be the washtub she decided And now I must go back to the refrigerator This was the strangest spot of all for behind the little waterfall was a small quiet pool in which Jess had set the milk bottles the night before Not a drop of water could get in but all night long the cool running water had surrounded the bottles They were now fairly icy to the touch Jess smiled as she drew them out Is it good asked Benny s voice There he sat in the door of the car swinging his legs his arm around the shaggy dog It s delicious declared Jess Cold as ice She climbed up beside him as she spoke bringing the breakfast with her The other two children sat up and looked at it Today Jess began Henry I will go back to town and try to get a job mowing lawns or something Then we can afford to have something besides milk for breakfast Milk suited Benny very well however so the older children allowed him to drink rather more than his share Henry did not waste any time talking He brushed his hair as well as he could without a brush rolled down his sleeves and started for town with the second dollar Glad you ve got a dog Jess he called back as he waved his straw hat The children watched him disappear around the curve and then turned to Jess expectantly They were not mistaken Jess had a plan We ll explore she began mysteriously We ll begin here at the car and hunt all over these woods until we find a dump What s a dump inquired Benny O Benny answered Violet You know what a dump is All old bottles and papers and broken dishes And wheels asked Benny interestedly Will there be any old wheels Yes maybe assented Violet But cups Benny Think of drinking milk out of a cup again Oh yes said Benny politely But it was clear that his mind was centered on wheels rather than cups The exploring party started slowly down the rusty track with the dog hopping happily on three legs The fourth paw nicely bandaged with Jess handkerchief he held up out of harm s way I think this is a spur track said Jess They built it in here so they could load wood on the cars and then when they had cut all the wood they didn t need the track any more This explanation seemed very likely for here and there were stumps of trees and decaying chips Violet took note of these chips and remembered them some days later In fact both girls kept their eyes open and pointed out things of interest to each other Remember these logs Violet if we should ever need any said Jess pointing Blackberry blossoms returned Violet briefly turning one over gently with her foot Big flat stones remarked Jess later on as they came upon a great heap of them Here the track came out into the open sunshine and broken pieces of rail showed clearly where it had joined the main track at some time in the past And here from the top of the wooded hill the children could plainly see the city in the valley They walked along the track picking out a church steeple here and there forgetting for a moment the object of their search There s a wheel Benny cried triumphantly from behind The girls looked down and with a glad cry of surprise Jess recognized a dump at the foot of the hill They found it not composed entirely of ashes and tin cans either although both of these were there in great profusion It was a royal dump containing both cups and wheels O Benny cried Jess if it hadn t been for you She hugged him wheel and all and began turning over the rubbish with great delight Here s a white pitcher Jess Violet called holding up a perfect specimen with a tiny chip in its nose Here s a big white cup said Jess delightedly laying it aside Want a teapot Jessy inquired Benny offering her an enormous blue enameled affair without a handle Yes indeed cried Jess We can use that for water I ve found two cups and a bowl already And Violet we ought to be looking for spoons too Violet pointed without speaking to her little pile of treasures There were five iron spoons covered with rust Wonderful pronounced Jess with rapture Indeed it is doubtful if collectors of rare and beautiful bits of porcelain ever enjoyed a search as much as did these adventurers in the dump heap Benny actually found four wheels exactly alike probably from the same cart and insisted upon carrying them back To please him Jess allowed him to add them to the growing pile Here s a big iron kettle observed Violet But we won t really cook with a fire will we Jess We ll take it back though replied Jess with a knowing look We can pile lots of dishes in it They could and did but not until after Benny had discovered his beloved pink cup It was a tea party cup of bright rose color with a wreath of gorgeous roses on it and a little shepherdess giving her lamb a drink from a pale blue brook It had a perfectly good handle gold into the bargain Its only flaw was a dangerous crack through the lamb s nose and front feet Jess made a cushion for it out of grass and laid it on top of the kettle full of treasures All the things even the wheels were laid on a wide board which the two girls carried between them Illustration Benny discovered his beloved pink cup Can you imagine the dishwashing when the gay party returned to the freight car Children do not usually care for dishwashing But never did a little boy hand dishes to his sister so carefully as Benny did On their hands and knees beside the clear cool little washtub the three children soaped and rinsed and dried their precious store of dishes Jess scoured the rust from the spoons with sand There she said drying the last polished spoon The children sat back and looked admiringly at their own handiwork But they did not look long There was too much to be done Jess exclaimed Violet I ll tell you Violet seldom spoke so excitedly Even Benny turned around and looked at her Come and see what I noticed inside the car last night Both children followed her and peered in at the door See on the wall right over on the other door Jess Now all Jess could see were two thick chunks of wood nailed securely to the closed door opposite the open one But she whirled around and around as fast as she could clapping her hands When she could get her breath however she skipped over to the board they had carried dusted it nicely and laid it carefully across the two wooden projections It was a perfect shelf There said Jess The children could hardly wait to arrange the shining new dishes on the shelf Violet quietly gathered some feathery white flowers a daisy or two and some maidenhair ferns which she arranged in a glass vase filled with water from the well This she put in the middle with the broken edge hidden There said Jess You said there three times Jessy remarked Benny contentedly So I did replied Jess laughing but I m going to say it again She pointed and said There Henry was coming up the path EARNING A LIVING Henry had all sorts of packages under his arm and in his pockets But he wouldn t open them or tell a thing about his adventures until dinner was ready he said Jess you re a wonder he exclaimed when he saw the dishes and the shelf The big kettle was selected and they all began to pick blueberries as fast as they could telling Henry meanwhile all about the wonderful dump 
8072-284670-0000	train-other-500	At last the tablecloth was spread and Henry unwrapped his parcels before the whole excited family I bought some more brown bread he said producing the loaves
none	none	 and some more milk 
8072-284670-0001	train-other-500	in the same little store where I went yesterday It s kept by a little old man and it s called a Delicatessen Shop He has everything in his store to eat I bought some dried beef because we can eat it in our fingers
8072-284670-0002	train-other-500	And I bought a big bone for the dog His name is Watch Jess interrupted All right said Henry accepting the name I bought a bone for Watch Watch fell on the bone as if he were famished
8072-284670-0003	train-other-500	which indeed he nearly was It was a rapturous moment when Jess poured the yellow milk into four cups or bowls and each child proceeded to crumble the brown bread into it with a liberal scattering of blueberries
8072-284670-0004	train-other-500	And then when they ate it with spoons Nobody was able to speak a word for several minutes Then Henry began slowly to tell his tale
none	none	 I earned a dollar just this morning he began proudly 
8072-284670-0005	train-other-500	I walked along the first shady street I came to
none	none	 nice houses you know 
8072-284670-0006	train-other-500	And there was a fellow out mowing his own lawn He s a nice fellow too I can tell you a young doctor Henry paused to chew blissfully He was pretty hot Henry went on
8072-284670-0007	train-other-500	And just as I came to the gate his telephone rang I heard it and called after him and asked if he didn t want me to finish up And he said he did cried Jess Yes He said For goodness sake yes
8072-284670-0008	train-other-500	Henry answered smiling You see he wasn t used to it So I mowed the lawn and trimmed the edges and he said he never had a boy trim it as well as I did And then he asked me if I wanted a steady job
8072-284670-0009	train-other-500	O Henry cried Violet and Jess together I told him I did so he said to come back this afternoon any time I wanted or tomorrow he said he didn t care just when any time
8072-284670-0010	train-other-500	Henry gave his cup a last polish with his spoon and set it down dreamily It s a pretty house he went on and there s a big garden behind it vegetable garden And an orchard behind that cherry orchard
8072-284670-0011	train-other-500	You ought to see the cherry trees Well when I was trimming the edges near the kitchen door the cook came and watched me She s a fat Irishwoman Henry laughed at the recollection She asked me if I liked cookies
8072-284670-0012	train-other-500	Oh if you had smelled them baking you d have died laughing Benny Dee licious
none	none	 So I said I did and she passed me out one and when she went back I put it in my pocket Did she see you asked Jess anxiously 
8072-284670-0013	train-other-500	Oh no said Henry confidently For I carefully chewed away for a long time on nothing at all Benny began to look fixedly at Henry s pocket It certainly was still rather bulgy
8072-284670-0014	train-other-500	When I went the doctor paid me a dollar and the cook gave me this bag Henry grinned as he tossed the paper bag to Jess
none	none	 Inside were twelve ginger cookies with scalloped edges smelling faintly of cinnamon and sugar 
8072-284670-0015	train-other-500	I m going to keep track of everything I earn and spend said Henry watching Jess as she handed around the cookies with reverence How are you going to write without a pencil asked Jess
none	none	 There are pieces of tailor s chalk in my workbag said Violet Henry gave his younger sister a gentle pat 
8072-284670-0016	train-other-500	as she returned with her workbag and fished for the chalk While the girls rinsed the empty dishes in the brook and stored away the food for supper Henry was beginning his cash account on the wall of his bedroom It was never erased
none	none	 and Henry often now looks at the account with great affection Soon the girls came to inspect it Meanwhile Benny looked on with great delight as Watch tried to bury his bone with only one paw to dig with Earned one dollar Cash on hand three dollars eighty five cents read Jess aloud Below he had written Milk twenty four Bread ten Bread twenty Cheese ten Milk twenty four Beef twenty Bone five Cloth ten Cloth exclaimed Violet What on earth Henry laughed a little and watched her face as he drew out his last package and handed it to her I thought we ought to have a tablecloth he explained So I got a yard at the ten cent store but it isn t hemmed of course With a cry of delight Violet unwrapped the brown cloth with its edge of blue 
8072-284670-0017	train-other-500	Her clever fingers were already evening the two ends She was never so happy as when with a needle Henry set off again with a light heart Here was one sister curled up happily against a big tree
8072-284670-0018	train-other-500	setting tiny stitches into a very straight hem Here was another sister busily gathering pliant twigs into a bundle for a broom with which to sweep the stray pine needles from the house
none	none	 And here was Benny curled up sound asleep on the ground 
8072-284670-0019	train-other-500	with the dog for a pillow It was quite late when Henry returned In fact it was nearly seven o clock although he didn t know that Several treasures had been added in his absence
8072-284670-0020	train-other-500	The broom stood proudly in the corner with a slim stick for a handle The new tablecloth had been washed
none	none	 and was drying on the line 
8072-284670-0021	train-other-500	And Jess who had decided to wash one garment a day had begun with Benny s stockings
none	none	 When Henry came they were being put on again with much pride by Benny himself 
8072-284670-0022	train-other-500	Violet had darned a big hole in each This time Henry himself could not wait to tell his sisters what he had He passed them the package at once with shining eyes
none	none	 Butter cried Jess with a radiant face 
8072-284670-0023	train-other-500	It was butter cool and sweet Nobody remembered that they had been a week without tasting either butter or meat
none	none	 when at last they sat down to their royal supper 
8072-284670-0024	train-other-500	These are trick spoons explained Henry
none	none	 Turn them upside down and use the handle 
8072-284670-0025	train-other-500	and they become knives They were knives anyway they were used to spread the delicious morsels of butter on the brown loaf With dried beef and a cookie for dessert who could ask for better fare
8072-284670-0026	train-other-500	Certainly not the four children who enjoyed it more than the rarest dainties I washed the doctor s automobile this afternoon Henry related Then I washed both piazzas with the hose
none	none	 and tomorrow I m going to hoe in the garden 
8072-284670-0027	train-other-500	Oh wouldn t I love to have a nice cold swim in that brook Henry was hot and sticky certainly He looked with longing eyes at the waterfall as he finished the last crumbs of his supper
8072-284670-0028	train-other-500	I wonder if we couldn t fix up a regular swimming pool he said half to himself
none	none	 Of course we could replied Violet as if nothing were too difficult Jess and I know where there are big logs and big flat stones You do hey said Henry staring at his gentle little sister Well why couldn t we Henry struck in Jess 
8072-284670-0029	train-other-500	Just a little below this there is a sort of pool already only not big enough
none	none	 We sure could cried Henry Some day I ll stay home from work and we ll see Nobody realized that Henry had been working only one day in all 
8072-284670-0030	train-other-500	Anyway it seemed as if they had always lived in the comfortable home in the freight car with Henry plying back and forth from the city each day bringing them new surprises
none	none	 Henry went to bed that night 
8072-284670-0031	train-other-500	with a head full of plans for damming up the brook He almost shouted when he thought suddenly of Benny s wheels He began to plan to make a cart to carry the heavy stones to the brook And that was when he first noticed that Watch was not asleep
8072-284670-0032	train-other-500	He could see his eyes shining red in the darkness It must have been around eleven o clock Henry reached over and patted his rough little back Watch licked the hand but didn t close his eyes
8072-284670-0033	train-other-500	Suddenly he began to growl softly Sh said Henry to the dog Now thoroughly startled he sat up Jess sat up
none	none	 They did not hear a sound Better shut the door breathed Henry Together they rolled the door very slowly and softly until it was shut 
8072-284670-0034	train-other-500	Still they did not hear anything But still Watch continued his uneasy growling Violet and Benny slumbered on Jess and Henry sat motionless with their hearts in their mouths
none	none	 Supposing it was some other tramp whispered Jess 
8072-284670-0035	train-other-500	somebody else that wanted to sleep here Watch would bite em whispered Henry briefly Jess never knew what confidence Henry had in the faithful dog
8072-284670-0036	train-other-500	Then a branch cracked sharply outside and Watch barked out loud Jess smothered the dog instantly in her arms But it had been a bark and it was loud clear and unmistakable
8072-284670-0037	train-other-500	That settles it thought Henry Whoever it is knows there s someone in here And the boy waited with the new broom in his hand expecting every moment to see the door opened from the outside But nothing happened Nothing at all
none	none	 The children sat in perfect silence for at least a half hour 
8072-284670-0038	train-other-500	and nothing more was heard Watch sniffed a little when Henry finally rolled the door open again But he then turned around three times and lay down beside Jess apparently satisfied at last
8072-284670-0039	train-other-500	Taking the dog s conduct
none	none	 as a sure guide Henry composed himself for sleep It must have been a rabbit or something he said to Jess The occupants of the freight car slept peacefully until morning AT HOME Jess and Henry had a short committee meeting next morning before the others awoke It was agreed that nobody should be allowed to stray off into the woods alone not even the dog And with much mystery Henry left some orders with all of them as to what they should build for him during the morning What for asked Benny Shan t tell old fellow teased Henry You just build it and you ll see later So Henry walked briskly through the woods feeling sure that the noise in the night had been made by a rabbit Having no watch Henry made a slight mistake by appearing at the young doctor s door before eight o clock He was just in time to meet the doctor coming in from a night call If Henry had not been so eager to begin work he would have noticed how the young man s dark eyes examined him from head to foot even to his plastered hair wet with brook water It was not the doctor who directed his work but the doctor s mother the sweet faced missus Mc Allister whose heart was centered in her son and her vegetable garden Her heart warmed to the boy when she saw how carefully he thinned out the carrots which had been sadly neglected I have been so busy she declared that I have actually stayed awake nights worrying about these carrots There see that She pulled out a fairly good sized carrot as she spoke It had to come out for it was much too near its neighbors In fact when Henry had thinned out half a row he had quite a little pile of eatable carrots each as large as his thumb When missus Mc Allister saw Henry deftly press the earth back again around the carrots which remained standing she left him quietly with a smile Here was a gardener whom she could trust Henry worked steadily in the hot sun completing row after row of carrots parsnips and onions When the mill bells rang at noon he worked on without noticing that his employer was again watching him When he did at last notice her he asked her smiling what she wanted done with the things he had pulled up Oh throw them away she said indifferently Toss them over into the orchard and sometime we ll burn them when they get dry Do you mind if I take them myself asked Henry hesitatingly Oh no said missus Mc Allister cordially Have you chickens That will be fine Henry was thankful that she went right along without waiting for an answer But in a way he did have chickens he thought You must stop working now she said Any time you want to do something there will be a place for you here She gave him a dollar bill and left the delighted boy with the piles of precious little vegetables As long as Henry expected to return so soon he hastily selected an orderly bunch of the largest of the carrots and the smallest of the onions He added a few of the miniature parsnips for good measure They looked like dolls vegetables When Henry walked down the drive with his bouquet he would have seen a face at the window if he had looked up But he did not look up He was too anxious to get to the little old man s shop and order his meat So it happened that Henry walked in upon his little family at about two o clock with all the materials for a feast The feast could not be made ready before night Jess hastened to explain to Benny who was perfectly satisfied anyway with bread and milk in his pink cup Your building is done Benny informed his brother I builded lots of it He really did agreed Violet leading the way to the sunny open spot a trifle behind the house The building was a fireplace With an enormous amount of labor the children had made quite a hollow at the base of a rock This was lined completely with flat stones More flat stones had been set on end to keep out the wind On top of the stones lay the most wonderful collection of firewood that you can imagine all ready to light There were chips and bits of crumpled paper pine cones and dry twigs Beside the big rock was a woodpile The children had apparently been working like beavers all the morning Jess had found a heavy wire in the dump and had fastened it between two trees On the wire the kettle swung merrily Fine Fine shouted Henry when he saw it I couldn t have done it so well myself And he honestly believed it We have dinner at night here observed Jess impressively What did you buy When the girls saw the tiny vegetables they began with cries of delight to cut them from their stalks with Henry s knife and a broken paring knife They scrubbed them in the washtub filled the kettle half full of water from the well and proceeded in great excitement to cut the raw meat into cubes When this had been dropped into the kettle Henry lighted the fire It burned frantically as if it were trying to encourage the stew to do its best Violet laid the tin plate over the top for a cover and they all stood by to hear the first bubble Soon the savory stuff in the kettle began to boil in good earnest Watch sat down gravely near it and gave an approving sniff at intervals Keep it boiling advised Henry as he departed again When I come home tonight I ll bring some salt And for mercy s sake don t get on fire Violet pointed silently at the big teapot The little girl had filled it with water in case of emergency That s if Benny gets on fire she explained or Watch Henry laughed and went on his way happily enough He wished he might share the delightful task of keeping the fire going and sniffing the stew but when he found out his afternoon s duties he changed his mind abruptly Think you can clean up this garage asked doctor Mc Allister quizzically when he appeared Henry flashed a look around the place and met the young man s eyes with a smile It did need cleaning rather badly When its owner purred out in his high powered little car Henry drew a long breath and began in earnest He opened all the chests of drawers to begin with Then he arranged all the tools in the largest deep drawer and with a long handled brush and a can of black paint that was nearly dry he labeled the drawer TOOLS with neat lettering Another drawer he lettered NAILS and assorted its contents into a few of the many boxes that were lying around He folded up the robes he found swept off the shelves and arranged the oil cans in orderly ranks sorted out innumerable pairs of gloves and then swept the floor He washed the cement floor with the hose and while waiting for it to dry he rinsed his brushes in turpentine To tell the truth Henry had found a few things in the rubbish which he had stored in his own pocket The treasure consisted in this case of a quantity of bent and rusty nails of all sizes and a few screws and nuts When doctor Mc Allister returned at six o clock he found Henry corking up the turpentine and arranging the brushes on the shelf My word he exclaimed staring at his garage with his mouth open Then he threw back his head and laughed till his mother came down the walk to see what the matter was Look at my gloves Mother he said wiping his eyes All mated up They never met each other before that I remember missus Mc Allister looked the garage over and observed the newly labeled drawers Her son opened one of them and looked at his four hammers My tack hammer Mother he said your tack hammer and two other hammers That last one I never expected to see again If you can use it you may have it my boy Now it is no exaggeration to say that at that moment if Henry had been asked what he wanted most of anything in the world he would have answered without any hesitation whatever A hammer He accepted it gratefully hardly able to stand still so anxious was he to put it into use on the hill he called home Tomorrow s Sunday said the doctor Shall I see you on Monday Oh yes replied Henry who had lost all track of the days The cherries need picking said his new friend We could use any number of cherry pickers if they were as careful as you He gave him an odd look Could you asked Henry eagerly I ll surely come down With that he bade his friends good by and started for home richer by another dollar two doughnuts the cook had given him a pocket full of crooked nails and the rest of the vegetables When he reached his freight car home a delicious savor greeted him Onions he shouted running up to the kettle The cook stood by and took off the cover and put in the salt It was absolutely the most tantalizing odor that Henry had ever smelled Years afterward Jess tried to duplicate it with the same kettle vegetables from the same garden and all stirred with the same spoon but it didn t equal this stew in flavor A ladle as sure as I live gasped Henry Jess had found a tin cup in the dump and fastened on a wooden handle with a bit of wire And when she ladled out four portions on four plates of all sizes some of them tin and laid a spoon in each the children felt that the world held no greater riches The tiny onions floated around like pearls the carrots melted in your mouth and the shreds of meat were as tender as possible from long boiling A bit of bread in one hand helped the feast along wonderfully The little wanderers ate until they could eat no more I have time before dark to make Benny s cart observed Henry biting a crisp sweet carrot With my wheels asked Benny Yes sir with your wheels agreed Henry Only when it s done you ll have to cart stones in it Sure said Benny with satisfaction Cart stones or anything We ll need it in making the dam explained Henry for the benefit of his sisters Tomorrow s Sunday so I shan t work down in the town Do you think it s all right to build the pool on Sunday Jess I certainly do replied Jess with emphasis We re just building the dam so we can keep clean I guess if Sunday is your only day off it ll be all right Henry s conscience was set at rest as he began with great delight to hammer out his bent nails He and Benny ran about finding pieces of wood to fasten the wheels on A visit to the dump was necessary at last in order to find just the right piece of timber for a tongue but before it was too dark to see Henry had pounded the last nail in place and trundled the flat cart back and forth just to see it go The cart seemed valuable enough to all of them to take into the house for the night And Henry could not afford to laugh at Benny for going to sleep with his hand upon one of his precious wheels for he himself had tucked his new hammer under his pillow BUILDING THE DAM Even a hammer makes a good pillow if one is tired enough and the freight car family slept until the nine o clock church bells began to ring faintly in the valley There were at least a dozen churches and their far away bells sounded sweetly harmonious in so many different keys They almost play a tune said Violet as she listened I like music all right replied Henry in a business like way but I for one shall have to get to work This will be a good day to wash all the stockings said Jess We ll all be wading so much in the brook anyway After breakfast the first thing Henry did was to survey with critical eyes the spot they had chosen for a pool It was a hollow about three yards across There were no stones in it at all It s big enough already remarked Henry at last but it hasn t enough water in it He measured its depth with a stick We ll have to guess at inches he said I have a little tape measure in my workbag ventured his sister Violet Henry flashed a smile at her Is there anything you haven t got in your workbag he asked her The children measured the wet stick carefully The water was just ten inches deep in the deepest part Henry explained his plan of engineering to his sisters We will have to haul some big logs across this narrow part and stuff them from this end with stones and underbrush It ought to be three feet deep before we get through O Henry protested Jess Benny would get drowned Drowned echoed Henry How tall do you think he is anyhow They measured the little boy and found him to be forty two inches tall That settled it the pool was designed to be three feet in depth Luckily the largest logs were not far away but as it was it was a matter of great labor for the builders to drag them to the scene of operations Let s get all the logs up here first suggested Jess Then we can have the fun of laying them across The two older children dragged all the logs while Violet and Benny attended to the stones with the help of the cart Occasionally Henry was called upon to assist with a heavy stone but for the most part Benny puffed out his cheeks and heaved the stones himself In fact Henry decided at this point to let Benny drop them into the water as he gathered them Splash em right in old fellow he directed Only keep them in a nice straight line right across this place between these two trees It won t make any difference how wet he gets he added in an aside to Jess We can dry him in the sun Jess thought a little differently although she said nothing She took off Benny s little crinkled blouse and one pair of bloomers and started to hang them on the line Good time to wash them she exclaimed Let me wash them begged Violet You re more useful building the dam There was wisdom in this suggestion so Jess accepted it gratefully and even added Henry s blouse to the laundry When we finish the dam they will surely be dry she said As for Henry he was only too glad to work without it Makes me feel lighter he declared Rare and beautiful birds came and watched the barefooted children as they scurried around building their wall of masonry But the children did not have any eyes for birds then They watched with delighted eyes as each stone was added to the wall under the clear water and it began to rise almost to the surface That makes a solid foundation for the logs you see explained Henry with pride They won t be floating off downstream the minute we lay them on Then at last the time arrived when they were to lay the logs on Let s wedge the first one between these two trees said Jess with a happy thought Then if each end of the log is on the upper side of the trees the harder the water pounds the tighter the dam gets Good work exclaimed Henry admiringly That s just what we ll do But the children were not at all prepared for what happened the moment the first big log was splashed into its place on top of the stone wall The water defeated in its course down the rocky bed gurgled and chased about as it met the opposing log and found every possible hole to escape Leaks said Henry briefly as the water began to rush around both ends and pour over the top of the log We ll make the logs so thick it can t get through We ll lay three logs across with three logs on top of them and three more on top of that The children set about stubbornly to accomplish this Violet held great sprays of fine underbrush in place until each log was laid Wetter children never were seen But nobody cared They resolutely plugged the ends with more stones more underbrush and more logs Each time a leak was discovered someone dropped a stone over it Even Benny caught the fever of conquering the mischievous water which slipped from their grasp like quicksilver When the three top logs were at last dropped into place the excited children sat down to watch the pool fill This it did slowly Finding now no means of exit the water was quieter It rose steadily up the barricade of logs It widened beautifully Henry could not sit still It slopes he cried See how clear it is And still See how still it is And then the water began to overflow the logs It spilled over the top with a delightful curve And on the other side it formed a second waterfall not high and narrow and graceful like the natural fall above but very low and wide Just like a regular mill dam said Henry He held the measuring stick out as far as he could and plunged it into the water It lacked an inch of being three feet deep Deep enough he declared In fact it looked so deep that Benny could not conceal a slight fear That s the beauty of the slope observed Jess Benny can wade in just as far as he wants to and no farther We all know what the bed of the pool is like no holes or stones The girls had to leave to prepare dinner but Henry could not be persuaded to leave the wonderful swimming pool I d rather swim than eat he said Luckily for the children their supply of provisions was the largest of any day since their flight The girls lighted the fire and heated up the remainder of the stew and cut the bread The butter hard and cold in the refrigerator was taken out and four portions cut from it The two doughnuts made four half rings for dessert The cooks rang the dinner bell This was an ingenious arrangement hung on a low branch It consisted of a piece of bent steel swung on a string Violet hit it sharply with another piece of steel It sounded deeply and musically through the woods and the boys understood it and obeyed at once It was evident the moment they appeared that at least three of the family had been swimming Watch shook himself violently at intervals spattering water drops in all directions Henry and Benny fresh and radiant with plastered hair and clean dry stockings and blouses apparently liked to swim and eat too You can actually swim a few strokes in it Jess if you re careful Henry said with excusable pride as he sat down to dinner Building a dam is wonderful sauce for a dinner I think stew is much better the second day observed Benny eating hungrily There remained two more adventures for the eventful day The girls cut their hair Violet s dark curls came off first They re awfully in the way explained Violet and so much trouble when you re working They were tangled too and Jess cut them off evenly by a string with Violet s little scissors Jess chestnut hair was long and silky and nicely braided but she never murmured as it came off too The two girls ran to the brook mirror to see how they looked The new haircut was very becoming to both I like you better that way said Henry approvingly Lots more sensible when you re living in the woods Around four o clock the children took a long walk in the opposite direction from any of their other explorations They were rewarded by two discoveries One was a hollow tree literally filled with walnuts gathered presumably by a thrifty squirrel the previous fall The other discovery frightened them a little just at first For with bristling back and a loud bark Watch suddenly began to rout out something in the leaves and that something began to cackle and half run and half fly from the intruders It was a runaway hen The children succeeded in catching the dog and reducing him to order although it was clear he liked very much to chase hens She had some eggs too remarked Benny as if trying to make pleasant conversation Jess bent over incredulously and saw a rude nest in the moss in which there were five eggs A runaway hen said Henry hardly believing his eyes She wants to hide her nest and raise chickens The children had no scruples at all about taking the eggs Almost a gift from heaven said Violet stroking one of the eggs with a delicate finger It wouldn t be polite to refuse them Scrambled eggs made a delicious supper for the children Jess broke all the eggs into the biggest bowl and beat them vigorously with a spoon until they were light and foamy Then she added milk and salt and delegated Violet to beat them some more while she prepared the fire The big kettle empty and clean was hung over the low fire and butter was dropped in Jess watched it anxiously tipping the kettle slightly in all directions When the butter had reached the exact shade of brown Jess poured in the eggs and stirred them carefully holding her skirts away from the fire She was amply repaid for her care when she saw her family attack the meal Clearly this was a feast day We shall have to be satisfied tomorrow to live on bread and milk she observed scraping up the last delicious morsel But when tomorrow came they had more than bread and milk as you will soon see CHERRY PICKING Henry meditated awhile all to himself early the next morning as to whether he ought to take any one with him for the cherry picking He certainly said he could use more than one he mused Failing to decide the question he laid it before his sisters as they ate bread and milk for breakfast I can t see any reason except one why we shouldn t all go said Jess What s that asked Henry Well you see there are four of us and supposing grandfather is looking for us it will be easier to find four than one True agreed Henry But supposing we went down the hill and through the streets two by two And you took Watch It was finally agreed that Henry and Benny would attract very little attention together Violet and Jess would follow with the dog who would trace Henry And so they set out They took down the clothesline and closed the car door Everything instantly looked as lonesome as heart could wish Even the merry little brook looked deserted When the children arrived at the Mc Allister orchard they soon saw that they were not the only workers Two hired men and the young doctor himself were carrying ladders and baskets from the barn and the Irish cook was bringing piles of square baskets from the house the kind that strawberries are sold in The girls can pick cherries as well as I can said Henry introducing his sisters Benny ought not to climb very tall trees but we had to bring him Benny can carry the baskets perhaps suggested the doctor much amused You see this is a cherry year and we have to work quickly when we once begin Perhaps he could fill the small baskets from the big ones It was a cherry year certainly There were two varieties in the orchard the pale yellow kind with a red cheek and the deep crimson ones which were just as red in the center as they were on the outside The red ones were huge bursting with juice and the trees were laden full with the luscious fruit Even the air was perfumed It was a pretty sight that the doctor finally turned his back upon when he went on his calls Henry slim tanned and graceful picked rapidly from the tallest ladder in the largest tree The two girls in their sensible bloomer suits could climb like cats They leaned against the ladders easily about halfway up their fluffy short hair gleaming in the sun Benny trotted to and fro waiting upon the busy pickers his cheeks as red as the cherries themselves Eat all you want doctor Mc Allister called back They did not really obey this command but occasionally a set of white teeth bit into one of the glorious oxhearts In less than an hour Benny had made five firm friends The hired men joked with him the cook petted him the young doctor laughed at him delightedly and sweet missus Mc Allister fell in love with him Finally he seated himself comfortably at her side under the trees and filled square boxes with great care under her direction I never had such a cheerful crowd of cherry pickers before missus Mc Allister said at last I d much rather stay out here than go into the house where it is cool Evidently Mary the cook felt the same way for she kept coming to the orchard for some reason or other When the doctor returned at lunch time his orchard was ringing with laughter and good natured barks from Watch who could not feel easy in his mind with his mistress so high up in a tree where he couldn t follow doctor Mc Allister paused in the garage long enough to give a sniff to the boiling cherries in the kitchen and then made his way to the orchard where he received a warm welcome There s no use in your going home to lunch he smilingly observed at the same time watching Henry s face carefully You can eat right here in the orchard unless your mother will be worrying about you This remark met with an astounding silence Henry was the first to collect his wits No our mother is dead he said evenly without embarrassment It was the doctor who hastened to change the subject he had introduced I smelled something when I came in he said to Benny What did it smell like inquired Benny It smelled like cherry slump replied the doctor with twinkling eyes Cherry what asked Jess struggling down her ladder with a full basket I think that s what they call it slump repeated doctor Mc Allister Do you care to try it At this moment Mary appeared in the orchard with an enormous tray And at the first sight of her cookery nobody cared the least what its name was It was that rare combination of dumpling beaten with stoned cherries and cooked gently in the juice of the oxheart cherries in a real cherry year It was steaming in the red juice with the least suspicion of melted butter over the whole Do get two more Mary begged missus Mc Allister laughing It tastes so much better under the cherry trees This was another meal that nobody ever forgot Even the two hired men sitting under another tree devouring the delicious pudding paused to hear Benny laugh Nowadays those two men sometimes meet Henry but that s another story Anyway they never will forget that cherry slump made by Irish Mary Almost as soon as lunch was over Benny rolled over on the grass and went to sleep his head as usual on the dog s back But the others worked on steadily missus Mc Allister kept an eye on them from the screened porch without their knowledge Just see how those children keep at it she said to her son There is good stuff in them I should like to know where they come from doctor Mc Allister said nothing He sauntered out into the orchard when he thought they had worked long enough He paid them four dollars and gave them all the cherries they could carry although they tried to object You see you re better than most pickers because you re so cheerful He noticed that they did not all leave the yard at the same time When the cherry pickers returned to their little home they examined everything carefully Nothing had been disturbed The door was still shut and the milk and butter stood untouched in the refrigerator They made a hilarious meal of raw cherries and bread and butter and before the stars came out they were fast asleep happy and dreamless That evening very much later a young man sat in his study with the evening paper He read the news idly and was just on the point of tossing the paper aside when this advertisement caught his eye Lost Four children aged thirteen twelve ten and five Somewhere around the region of Middlesex and Townsend five thousand dollars reward for information JAMES HENRY CORDYCE Whew whistled the young man James Henry Cordyce He sat in perfect silence for a long time thinking Then he went to bed But long after he had gone upstairs he whistled again and could have been heard to say if anyone had been awake to hear it James Henry Cordyce Of all people THE RACE The Cordyce Steel Mills stood a little aside from the city of Greenfield as if they were a little too good to associate with common factories James Henry Cordyce sat in a huge leather chair in his private office He was a man nearly sixty years of age whose dark brown hair was still untouched by gray 
8414-284674-0000	train-other-500	He had rather hard lines around his mouth but softer ones around his eyes Printed on the ground glass top of his door were these words in black and gold J H CORDYCE President Private
8414-284674-0001	train-other-500	Once a year J H Cordyce allowed himself a holiday If he had a weakness it was for healthy boys boys running without their hats boys jumping boys throwing rings boys swimming boys vaulting with a long pole
8414-284674-0002	train-other-500	And in company with three other extremely rich men he arranged once a year a Field Day for the town of Intervale
none	none	 The men attended it in person and supplied all the money This was Field Day All through the spring and early summer months 
8414-284674-0003	train-other-500	boys were in training for miles around getting ready for Intervale s Field Day And not only boys but men also old and young and girls of all ages into the bargain
8414-284674-0004	train-other-500	Prizes were offered for tennis baseball rowing swimming running and every imaginable type of athletic feat But usually the interest of the day centered on a free for all race of one mile which everyone enjoyed and a great many people entered
none	none	 A prize of twenty five dollars was offered to the winner of this race and also a silver trophy cup with little wings on its handles Sometimes this cup was won by a middle aged man sometimes by a girl and sometimes by a trained athlete 
8414-284674-0005	train-other-500	mister Cordyce smiled about his eyes as he closed his desk ordered his limousine and went out and locked the door of his office The mill had been closed down for the day
none	none	 Everyone attended Field Day Henry was washing the concrete drives at doctor Mc Allister s at this moment 
8414-284674-0006	train-other-500	He heard the doctor call to him from the road so he promptly turned off the hose and ran out to see what was wanted Hop in commanded the doctor not stopping his engine You ought to go to see the stunts at the athletic meet It s Field Day Henry did not wish to delay the doctor
8414-284674-0007	train-other-500	so he hopped in Can t go myself said doctor Mc Allister I ll just drop you at the grounds There s no charge for admittance You just watch all the events and report to me who wins Henry tried to explain to his friend that he ought to be working but there was actually no time
8414-284674-0008	train-other-500	And when he found himself seated on the bleachers and the stunts began he forgot everything in the world except the exciting events before his eyes Henry had no pencil but he had an excellent memory
8414-284674-0009	train-other-500	He repeated over and over the name of each winner as it appeared on the huge signboard It was nearly eleven o clock when the free for all running race was announced What do they mean free for all asked Henry of a small boy at his side
8414-284674-0010	train-other-500	Why just anybody explained the boy curiously Didn t you ever see one Didn t you see the one last year No said Henry The boy laughed That was a funny one he said There was a college runner in it and a couple of fat men and some girls lots of people
8414-284674-0011	train-other-500	And the little colored boy over there won it You just ought to have seen that boy run He went so fast you couldn t see his legs Beat the college runner you know Henry gazed at the winner of last year s race He was smaller than Henry but apparently older
none	none	 In a few minutes Henry had quietly left his place on the bleachers When the boy turned to speak to him again he was gone 
8414-284674-0012	train-other-500	He had gone in fact to the dressing room where boys of all sizes were putting on sandals and running trunks A man stepped up to him quickly
none	none	 Want to enter he asked No time to waste Yes replied Henry The man tossed him a pair of white shoes and some blue trunks 
8414-284674-0013	train-other-500	He liked the look of Henry s face as he paused to ask in an undertone Where did you train Never trained replied Henry I suppose you know these fellows have been training all the year observed the man You don t expect to win
none	none	 Oh no replied Henry apparently shocked at the idea 
8414-284674-0014	train-other-500	But it s lots of fun to run you know He was dressed and ready by this time How light he felt He felt as if he could almost fly Presently the contestants were all marshalled out to the running track Henry was Number four
8414-284674-0015	train-other-500	Now Henry had never been trained to run but the boy possessed an unusual quantity of common sense
none	none	 It s a mile race he thought to himself and it s the second half mile that counts 
8414-284674-0016	train-other-500	So it happened that this was the main thought in his mind when the starter s gong sounded and the racers shot away down the track
none	none	 In almost no time Henry was far behind the first half of the runners 
8414-284674-0017	train-other-500	But strangely enough he did not seem to mind this greatly It s fun to run anyhow he thought It was fun certainly He felt as if his limbs were strung together on springs
8414-284674-0018	train-other-500	He ran easily without effort each step bounding into the next like an elastic After a few minutes of this Henry had a new thought Now you ve tried how easy you can run let s see how fast you can run
8414-284674-0019	train-other-500	And then not only Henry himself but the enormous crowd as well began to see how fast he could run Slowly he gained on the fellow ahead of him and passed him With the next fellow as a goal he gradually crept alongside and passed him with a spurt The crowd shouted itself hoarse
8414-284674-0020	train-other-500	The field all along the course was black with people Henry could hear them cheering for Number four as he pounded by Six runners remained ahead of him Here was the kind of race the crowd loved not an easily won affair between two runners
none	none	 but a gradual victory between the best runner and overpowering odds Henry could see the finish flag now in the distance 
8414-284674-0021	train-other-500	He began to spurt He passed Numbers fourteen and three He passed twenty five six and one almost in a bunch Number sixteen remained ahead Then Henry began to think of winning
8414-284674-0022	train-other-500	How much the twenty five dollar prize would mean to Jess and the rest Number sixteen must be passed I m going to win this race he said quietly in his own mind I ll bet you I am The thought lent him speed Number four Number four yelled the crowd
8414-284674-0023	train-other-500	Henry did not know that the fellow ahead had been ahead all the way and just because he Henry
none	none	 had slowly gained over them all the crowd loved him best Henry waited until he could have touched him He was within three yards of the wire 
8414-284674-0024	train-other-500	He bent double and put all his energy into the last elastic bound He passed Number sixteen and shot under the wire Then the crowd went wild It scrambled over and under the fence cheering and blowing its horns
none	none	 Henry felt himself lifted on many shoulders and carried panting up to the reviewing stand He bowed laughing at the sea of faces and took the silver cup with its little wings in a sort of dream It is a wonder he did not lose the envelope containing the prize for he hardly realized when he took it what it was Then someone said What s your name boy Illustration Henry felt himself lifted on many shoulders That called him to earth He had to think quickly under cover of getting his breath Henry James he replied This was perfectly true as far as it went In a moment the enormous signboard flashed out the name HENRY JAMES No four AGE thirteen WINNER OF FREE FOR ALL Meanwhile the man of the dressing room was busy locating mister Cordyce of the Cordyce Mills He knew that was exactly the kind of story that old James Henry would like Yes sir he said smiling I says to him You don t expect to win of course And he says to me Oh no but it s lots of fun to run you know Thank you sir returned mister Cordyce That s a good story Bring the youngster over here if you don t mind When Henry appeared a trifle shaken out of his daze and anxious only to get away mister Cordyce stretched out his hand I like your spirit my boy he said I like your running too But it s your spirit that I like best Don t ever lose it Thank you said Henry shaking hands And there was only one in the whole crowd that knew who was shaking hands with whom least of all James Henry and Henry James 
8414-284675-0000	train-other-500	MORE EDUCATION With twenty five dollars in his hand Henry felt like a millionaire as he edged through the crowd to the gate That s the boy he heard many a person say when he was forced to hold his silver cup in view out of harm s way
8414-284675-0001	train-other-500	When doctor Mc Allister drove into his yard he found a boy washing the concrete drives as calmly as if nothing had happened He chuckled quietly for he had stopped at the Fair Grounds for a few minutes himself and held a little conversation with the score keeper
8414-284675-0002	train-other-500	When Henry faithfully repeated the list of winners however he said nothing about it What are you going to do with the prize queried doctor Mc Allister Put it in the savings bank I guess replied Henry Have you an account asked his friend
none	none	 No but Jess says it s high time we started one Good for Jess said the doctor absently 
8414-284675-0003	train-other-500	I remember an old uncle of mine who put two hundred dollars in the savings bank and forgot all about it He left it in there till he died and it came to me It amounted to sixteen hundred dollars Whew said Henry
8414-284675-0004	train-other-500	He left it alone for over forty years you see explained doctor Mc Allister When Henry arrived at his little home in the woods with the twenty five dollars
none	none	 for he never thought of putting it in the bank before Jess saw it he found a delicious lunch waiting for him Jess had boiled the little vegetables in clear water 
8414-284675-0005	train-other-500	and the moment they were done she had drained off the water in a remarkable drainer and heaped them on the biggest dish with melted butter on top
none	none	 His family almost forgot to eat while Henry recounted the details of the exciting race And when he showed them the silver cup and the money they actually did stop eating hungry as they were 
8414-284675-0006	train-other-500	I said my name was Henry James repeated Henry That s all right So it is affirmed Jess It s clever too You can use that name for your bank book So I can said Henry delighted I ll put it in the bank this very afternoon
8414-284675-0007	train-other-500	And by the way I brought something for dinner tonight Jess looked in the bag There were a dozen smooth brown potatoes I know how to cook those said Jess nodding her head wisely You just wait Can t wait hardly
8414-284675-0008	train-other-500	Henry called back as he went to work When he had gone Benny frolicked around noisily with the dog
none	none	 Benny Jess exclaimed suddenly as she hung her dish towels up to dry it s high time you learned to read 
8414-284675-0009	train-other-500	No school now said Benny hopefully No but I can teach you
none	none	 If I only had a primer 
8414-284675-0010	train-other-500	Let s make one suggested Violet shaking her hair back We have saved all the wrapping paper off the bundles you know Jess was staring off into space as she always did when she had a bright idea Violet she cried at last remember those chips
8414-284675-0011	train-other-500	We could whittle out letters like type make each letter backwards you know And stamp them on paper finished Violet There would be only twenty six in all It wouldn t be awfully hard said Jess We wouldn t bother with capitals
8414-284675-0012	train-other-500	What could we use for ink Violet wondered wrinkling her forehead
none	none	 Blackberry juice cried Jess 
8414-284675-0013	train-other-500	The two girls clapped their hands Won t Henry be surprised when he finds that Benny can read Now from this conversation Benny gathered that this type business would take his sisters quite a while to prepare So he was not much worried about his part of the work In fact
8414-284675-0014	train-other-500	he sorted out chips very cheerfully and watched his teachers with interest as they dug carefully around the letters with the two knives We ll teach him two words to begin with said Jess Then we won t have to make the whole alphabet at once Let s begin to teach him see
none	none	 That s easy agreed Violet And then we won t have to make but two letters s and e And the other word will be me cried Jess 
8414-284675-0015	train-other-500	So only three pieces of type in all Violet Jess cut the wiggly s because she had the better knife
none	none	 while Violet struggled with the e Then Jess cut a wonderful m while Violet sewed the primer down the back 
8414-284675-0016	train-other-500	and gathered a cupful of blackberries
8414-284675-0017	train-other-500	As she sat by crushing the juice from the berries with a stick Jess planned the ink pad We ll have to use a small piece of the wash cloth I m afraid she said at last But finally they were obliged to cut off only the uneven bits of cloth which hung around the edges
none	none	 These they used for stuffing for the pad and covered them with a pocket which Violet carefully ripped from her apron 
8414-284675-0018	train-other-500	When this was sewed firmly into place and put into a small saucer Jess poured on the purple juice Even Benny came up on his hands and knees to watch her stamp the first s It came out beautifully on the first page of the primer
none	none	 purple and clean cut The e was almost as good and as for the m 
8414-284675-0019	train-other-500	Jess hand shook with pure pride as she stamped it evenly on the page At last the two words were completed In fact they were done long before Benny had the slightest idea his sisters were ready for him He came willingly enough for his first lesson
8414-284675-0020	train-other-500	but he could not tell the two words apart Don t you see Benny Jess explained patiently This one with the wiggly s says see But Benny did not see I ll tell you Jess said Violet at last Let s print each word again on a separate card
8414-284675-0021	train-other-500	That s the way they do at school And then let him point to see The girls did this using squares of stiff brown paper Then they called Benny Very carefully Jess explained again which word said see hissing like a huge snake
8414-284675-0022	train-other-500	to show him how the s sounded Then she mixed the cards and said encouragingly Now Benny
none	none	 point to s s s ee Benny did not move 
8414-284675-0023	train-other-500	He sat with his finger on his lip But the children were nearly petrified with astonishment to see Watch cock his head on one side and gravely put his paw on the center of the word Now this was only an accident
8414-284675-0024	train-other-500	Watch did not really know one of the words from the other But Benny thought he did
none	none	 And was he going to let a dog get ahead of him Not Benny In less time than it takes to tell it 
8414-284675-0025	train-other-500	Benny had learned both words perfectly Good old Watch said Jess It isn t really hard at all said Benny Is it Watch During all this experiment Jess had not forgotten her dinner When you are living outdoors all the time you do not forget things like that
8414-284675-0026	train-other-500	In fact both girls had learned to tell the time very accurately by the sun Jess started up a beautiful little fire of cones As they turned into red hot ashes and began to topple over one by one into the glowing pile Jess laughed delightedly
8414-284675-0027	train-other-500	She had already scrubbed the smooth potatoes and dried them carefully She now poked them one by one into the glowing ashes with a stick from a birch tree Whenever a potato lit up dangerously she gave it a poke into a new position
8414-284675-0028	train-other-500	And when Henry found her she was just rolling the charred balls out onto the flat stones Burned em up queried Henry Burned nothing cried Jess energetically You just wait Can t wait hardly replied Henry smiling
8414-284675-0029	train-other-500	You said that a long time ago said Benny Well isn t it true demanded Henry rolling his brother over on the pine needles Come said Violet breathlessly forgetting to ring the bell Hold them with leaves directed Jess because they re terribly hot
8414-284675-0030	train-other-500	Knock them on the side and scoop them out with a spoon and put butter on top The children did as the little cook requested sprinkled on a little salt from the salt shaker and took a taste Ah said Henry It s
none	none	 good said Benny blissfully 
8414-284675-0031	train-other-500	It was about the most successful meal of all in fact When the children in later years recalled their different feasts they always came back to the baked potatoes roasted in the ashes of the pine cones Henry said it was because they were poked with a black birch stick
8414-284675-0032	train-other-500	Benny said it was because Jess nearly burned them up
none	none	 Jess herself said maybe it was the remarkable salt shaker 
8414-284675-0033	train-other-500	which had to stand on its head always because there was no floor to it After supper the children still were not too sleepy to show Henry the new primer
8414-284675-0034	train-other-500	and allow Benny to display his first reading lesson Henry greatly taken with the idea sat up until it was almost dark chipping out the remaining letters of the alphabet If you should ever care to see this interesting primer which was finally ten pages in length
8414-284675-0035	train-other-500	you might examine this faithful copy of its first page which required four days for its completion Illustration page one See me See me
8414-284675-0036	train-other-500	O O See me Come Come to me Come to see me cat rat
none	none	 Henry always insisted that the rat s tail was too long but Jess said his knife must have slipped when he was making the a so they were even after all GINSENG What doctor Mc Allister ever did before Henry began to work for him would be hard to guess There were certainly as many duties always waiting for him as he had time to do And it made no difference to the industrious boy what the job was Nothing was too hard or too dirty for him to attempt One day the doctor set him at the task of clearing out his little laboratory The boy washed bottles pasted labels and cleaned instruments for one whole morning And more than one broken flask on its way to the rubbish heap was carefully carried up the hill to the hidden family While Henry was busy carefully lettering a sticky label he noticed a young man in the outer office who was talking with the doctor Can you tell me if this is real ginseng Henry heard him say It certainly is returned doctor Mc Allister They will give you two dollars a pound for the root at any of the drug stores Henry ventured to steal a peep and found he could readily see the plant the man was holding It was about a foot high with branching leaves and a fine feathery white flower Henry knew it was exactly the same white puffball that he had noticed in Violet s vase that very morning When the young man had gone Henry said I know where I can find a whole lot of that plant Is that so replied the doctor kindly It s only the root you know that is valuable But any one who wants the bother of digging it up can sell any quantity of that When Henry went home at noon he related enough of this incident to set his sisters to work in good earnest They started out with both knives and two strong iron spoons and the kettle And with Benny to run about finding every white flower he could the girls succeeded with a great deal of hard digging in finding enormous quantities of ginseng root In fact that first afternoon s work resulted in a kettle full not counting a single leaf or stem Henry was delighted when he saw the result of their work and took it next day to the largest drug store where he received three dollars for the roots Without any hesitation Henry paid a visit to the dry goods store and came home with a pair of new brown stockings for Benny That was a great day in the woods Benny gave them no peace at all until they had admired his wonderful new stockings and felt of each rib There had been one other thing that Benny had given them no peace about On the night when the children had crept so quietly away from the baker s wife Jess had forgotten to take Benny s bear This bear was a poor looking creature which had once been an expensive bright eyed Teddy bear made of brown plush But Benny had taken it to bed every single night for three years and had loved it by day so that it was not attractive to any one but himself Both eyes were gone and its body was very limp but Benny had certainly suffered a great deal trying to sleep in a strange bed without his beloved bear Jess therefore had plans on foot the moment she saw Benny s new stockings She washed the old brown stockings with their many neat darns and hung them up to dry And early in the afternoon she and Violet sat with the workbag between them each with a stocking With Benny sitting by to watch proceedings Jess mapped out a remarkable Teddy bear One stocking carefully trimmed made the head and body while the other furnished material for two arms two legs and the stuffing Jess worked hard over the head pushing the padding well into the blunt nose Violet embroidered two beautiful eyes in black and white and a jet black nose tip You must make a tail too Jessy said Benny watching her snip the brown rags Bears don t have tails Benny argued Jess although she wasn t exactly sure she was right Your old bear didn t have any tail you know But this bear has a tail though returned Benny knowing that Jess would put on two tails if he insisted And it was true His bear finally did have a tail What kind of tail asked Jess helplessly at last Bushy long and slim or cotton tail Long and slim decided Benny with great satisfaction so I can pull it Benny cried Jess laughing in spite of herself But she made a tail long and slim exactly as Benny ordered and sewed it on very tightly so that it might be pulled if desired She fastened on the legs and arms with flat hinges so the bear might sit down easily and added at last a pair of cunning flappy ears and a gay collar of braided red string from a bundle What s his name Jessy inquired Benny when the wonderful bear was finally handed over to him His name repeated Jess Well you know he s a new bear he isn t your old one so I wouldn t call him Teddy Oh no said Benny shocked This is not Teddy This has a pretty tail Of course agreed Jess trying not to laugh Well you know we sold that ginseng to pay for your new stockings And if you hadn t had your new ones we couldn t have made this bear out of your old ones You want his name to be Stockings asked Benny politely Stockings No answered Jess I was thinking of Ginseng Ginseng echoed Benny thinking deeply That s a nice name All right I think Ginseng will be a good bear if Watchie doesn t bark at him And from that moment the bear s name was Ginseng as long as he lived and he lived to be a very old bear indeed TROUBLE The days went merrily by for the freight car family Hardly a day passed however without some exciting adventure missus Mc Allister finding out in some way that Violet was a clever seamstress sent home fine linen handkerchiefs for her to hem Each one had a tiny colored rose in the corner and Violet was delighted with the dainty work She sat sewing daily by the swimming pool while Benny sailed wonderful boats of chips and waded around to his heart s content The freight car pantry now held marvelous dishes rescued from the dump such rarities as a regular bread knife a blue and gold soap dish and half of a real cut glass bowl Henry proudly deposited thirty one dollars in the savings bank under the name of Henry James and worked eagerly for his kind friend who never asked him any more embarrassing questions Benny actually learned to read fairly well The girls occupied their time making balsam pillows for the four beds and trying to devise wonderful meals out of very little material Violet kept a different bouquet daily in the little vase She had a perfect genius for arranging three purple irises to look like a picture or a single wood lily with its leaves like a Japanese print Each day the children enjoyed a cooked dinner filling in the chinks with perfect satisfaction with bread and butter or bread and milk or bread and cheese They named their queer house Home for Tramps and printed this title in fancy lettering inside the car One day Jess began to teach Benny a little arithmetic He learned very readily that two and one make three I knew that before he said cheerfully But it was a different matter when Jess proposed to him that two minus one left one No it does not left one said Benny indignantly It left two Why Benny cried Jess in astonishment Supposing you had two apples and I took away one wouldn t you have one left You never would objected Benny with confidence No but supposing Watch took one suggested Jess Illustration One day the stranger was allowed to see Violet Watchie wouldn t take one neither said Benny Would you doggie Watch opened one eye and wagged his tail Jess looked at Violet in despair What shall I do with him she asked Violet took out her chalk and printed clearly on the outside of the freight car the following example two one Now Benny don t you see she began that if you have two things and somebody takes away one that you must have one left I ll show you myself agreed Benny finally with resignation Now see the two He actually made a respectable figure two on the freight car Now here s a nice one Now s posen I take away the one don t you see the two s left right on the car He covered the figure one with his chubby hand and looked about at his audience expectantly Jess rolled over against a tree trunk and laughed till she nearly cried Violet laughed until she really did cry And here we come to the first unpleasant incident in the story of the runaway children Violet could not stop crying apparently and Jess soon made up her mind that she was really ill She helped her carefully into the car and heaped all the pine needles around and under her making her the softest bed she could Then she wet cloths in the cool water of the brook and laid them across her little sister s hot forehead How glad I am that it is time for Henry to come she said to herself holding Violet s slender brown hands in her cool ones Henry came promptly at the usual time He thought she had a cold he said And this seemed likely for Violet began to cough gently while the rest ate a hasty supper We don t want to let her go to a hospital if we can possibly help it said Henry more troubled than he cared to show If she goes there we ll have to give her name and then Grandfather will find us surely Jess agreed and together the two older children kept changing the cool cloths on Violet s aching head But about ten o clock that night Violet had a chill She shivered and shook and her teeth chattered so that Jess could plainly hear them Apparently nothing could warm the little girl although she was completely packed in hay and pine needles I m going down to doctor Mc Allister s said Henry quietly I m afraid Violet is very ill Nobody ever knew how fast he ran down the hill Even in his famous race Henry hardly touched his present speed He was so thoroughly frightened that he never stopped to notice how quickly the doctor seemed to understand what was wanted He did not even notice that he did not have to tell the doctor which way to drive his car in order to reach the hill When the car reached the road at the base of the hill doctor Mc Allister said shortly Stay here in the car and disappeared up the hill alone When the doctor returned he was carrying Violet in his arms Jess and Benny and Watch were following closely Nobody spoke during the drive to the Mc Allister house as they flew through the darkness When they stopped at last the doctor said three words to his mother who opened the door anxiously The three words were Pneumonia I m afraid They all heard it Irish Mary appeared from the kitchen with hot water bottles and warm blankets and missus Mc Allister flew around opening beds and bringing pillows A trained nurse in a white dress appeared like magic from nowhere in particular They all worked as best they could to get the sick child warmed up Soon the hot blankets hot water and steaming drinks began to take effect and the shivering stopped missus Mc Allister left the sick room then to attend to the other children Henry and Benny were left in a large spare room with a double bed Jess was put in a little dressing room just out of missus Mc Allister s own room Upon receiving assurances that Violet was warm again they went to sleep But Violet was not out of danger for she soon grew as hot as she had been cold And the doctor never left her side until ten o clock the next morning Violet although very ill did not have pneumonia At about nine o clock the doctor had a visitor It was a man who said he would wait He did wait in the cool front parlor for over half an hour Then Benny drifted in Where is the doctor asked the man sharply of Benny He s nupstairs answered Benny readily This means a lot of money to him if he only knew it said the visitor impatiently Oh that wouldn t make any difference Benny replied with great assurance as he started to go out again But the man caught him What do you mean by that sonny he asked curiously What s he doing He s taking care of my sister Violet She s sick And you mean he wouldn t leave her even if I gave him a lot of money Yes that s it said Benny politely That s what I mean The visitor seemed to restrain his impatience with a great effort You see I ve lost a little boy somewhere he said The doctor knows where he is I think He would be about as old as you are Well if you don t find him you can have me I shouldn t wonder observed Benny comfortingly I like you You do said the man in surprise That s because you ve got such a nice soft suit on explained Benny stroking the man s knee gently The gentleman laughed heartily No I guess it s because you have such a nice soft laugh said Benny changing his mind The fact was that Benny himself did not know why he liked this stranger who was so gruff at times and so pleasant at others He finally accepted the man s invitation and climbed into his lap to see his dog s picture in his watch feeling of the nice soft suit on the way The doctor found him here when he came down at ten o clock Better go and find Watch Benny suggested the doctor Perhaps some day I ll come again observed Benny to his new friend I like your dog and I m sorry he s dead With that he scampered off to find Watch who was very much alive I expected you mister Cordyce said the doctor smiling only not quite so soon I came the moment I heard your name hinted at said James Cordyce My chauffeur heard two workmen say that you knew where my four grandchildren were That s all I waited to hear Is it true And where are they That was one of them said the doctor quietly That was one of them repeated the man That beautiful little boy Yes he is beautiful assented doctor Mc Allister They all are The only trouble is they re all frightened to death to think of your finding them How do you know that said mister Cordyce sharply They ve changed their name At least the older boy did In public too What did he change it to doctor Mc Allister watched his visitor s face closely while he pronounced the name clearly Henry James A flood of recollections passed over the man s face and he flushed deeply That boy he exclaimed That wonderful running boy Then events began to move along rapidly CAUGHT They never will go with you in this world declared missus Mc Allister finally to the distracted grandfather 
8009-284678-0000	train-other-500	unless you give us time to break the news gradually And above all when Violet is so ill Couldn t I see them begged the man almost like a boy
none	none	 I could pretend I was a friend of yours visiting you who liked children 
8009-284678-0001	train-other-500	I would promise not to tell them until you consented That might do said doctor Mc Allister If they grew to like you before they knew who you were it would make things easier certainly
none	none	 So James Henry Cordyce s chauffeur was sent for a gold monogrammed suitcase 
8009-284678-0002	train-other-500	and his young man to wait upon him and Irish Mary held up her hands in despair when she learned for whom she must cook Don t you worry Mary Bridget Flynn said doctor Mc Allister with emphasis You could cook for the King of England
8009-284678-0003	train-other-500	Just make one of your peach shortcakes for lunch and broil a chicken and I ll answer for him
none	none	 When lunch time came J H Cordyce saw all his grandchildren except Violet He smiled with delight when he saw Jess coming down the stairs in her womanly fashion 
8009-284678-0004	train-other-500	Henry shook hands with him before he sat down but he kept glancing at the stranger all through the meal Where have I seen that man before he thought missus Mc Allister
8009-284678-0005	train-other-500	had given the children s names clearly when she introduced them Jess Benny and Henry
none	none	 Henry James she had added 
8009-284678-0006	train-other-500	But she had not added the man s name She forgot thought Jess Because she knows him so well she thinks we do
none	none	 But although nameless the stranger caught their attention He told them wonderful stories about a steel rail which held up an entire bridge until the people had time to get off about his collie dog about a cucumber in his garden growing inside of a glass bottle 
8009-284678-0007	train-other-500	Henry was interested Benny was fascinated I d like to see the cucumber said Benny pausing in the middle of his shortcake Would you indeed said mister Cordyce delighted Some day if missus Mc Allister is willing
none	none	 you and I will ride over to my garden and pick it 
8009-284678-0008	train-other-500	And we ll bring it to Violet asked Benny waiting breathlessly for an answer We ll bring it to Violet
none	none	 agreed mister Cordyce resuming his shortcake After lunch he went to sleep in the easy chair in the doctor s big office 
8009-284678-0009	train-other-500	That is he threw his head back and shut his eyes and breathed very heavily
none	none	 Jess went through the room once with ice water 
8009-284678-0010	train-other-500	humming for Violet was better But the moment she saw the stranger asleep she stopped her singing abruptly and tiptoed the rest of the way Then as suddenly she turned around and came back
none	none	 and very carefully shoved a cushion under the man s feet 
8009-284678-0011	train-other-500	It was so gently done that even if he had been really asleep he would never have wakened As it was he could not resist opening one eye the slightest crack to see the bright chestnut hair
none	none	 as it passed out of sight No he thought to himself if she really hated me she would never have done that But the children were very far from hating him They liked him immensely And when at last one day he was allowed to see Violet 
8009-284678-0012	train-other-500	and came softly into her room with a nosegay of fragrant English double violets for her they loved him He won all their hearts when he patted her dark head and told her very simply that he was sorry she had been sick
none	none	 It would be hard to say that J H Cordyce ever had a favorite grandchild 
8009-284678-0013	train-other-500	but certainly his manner with Violet was very gentle It was clear to every one even to the anxious nurse that the stranger was not tiring the sick child He told her in a pleasant everyday voice
8009-284678-0014	train-other-500	about his garden and his greenhouses where the violets came from about the old Swede gardener who always said he must
none	none	 vater the wi lets 
8009-284678-0015	train-other-500	I d love to see him said Violet earnestly How long you going to stay here Benny piped up It was not altogether a polite question
none	none	 but it was clear to them all that Benny wanted him to stay so they all laughed 
8009-284678-0016	train-other-500	As long as they ll let me my boy answered the stranger quietly Then he left the sick room for he knew he should not stay long
none	none	 But something in the man s last sentence rang in Henry s ears 
8009-284678-0017	train-other-500	He repeated it over and over in his mind trying to remember where he had heard that same voice say my boy He
none	none	 made an excuse to work in the flower beds along the veranda in order to glance occasionally at the man s face as he sat under a tree reading 
8009-284678-0018	train-other-500	Often Henry thought he had caught hold of his truant memory Then the man turned his head and he lost it again altogether
none	none	 But suddenly it came to him 
8009-284678-0019	train-other-500	as the man smiled over his book
none	none	 it was the man who had shaken hands with him on the day of the race 
8009-284678-0020	train-other-500	And he had said I like your spirit my boy That
none	none	 was it 
8009-284678-0021	train-other-500	Henry sat down out of sight and weeded geraniums for a few moments It is a wonder he did not pull up geraniums instead of weeds his mind was so far away I didn t remember him at first because I was so jolly excited when he shook hands with me decided Henry
8009-284678-0022	train-other-500	Then he was apparently thunderstruck afresh
none	none	 He sat with his weeder on his knee and his mouth open 
8009-284678-0023	train-other-500	He s the man who passed me the cup with the wings
none	none	 He stole another look around the corner 
8009-284678-0024	train-other-500	and this satisfied him Same man exactly he said When he had finished the flower bed he thought he heard the young doctor moving in the office He stuck his head in the open door
none	none	 The doctor sat at his desk taking notes from a book 
8009-284678-0025	train-other-500	Do you know who presented the prizes Field Day asked Henry curiously Know what his name was James Cordyce of the Steel Mills replied the doctor carelessly J H Cordyce over in Greenfield
none	none	 doctor Mc Allister to all appearances returned to his notes His eyes were lowered at any rate 
8009-284678-0026	train-other-500	But for Henry the skies were reeling
none	none	 He withdrew his head and sat still on the step That delightful man 
8009-284678-0027	train-other-500	his grandfather It was impossible
none	none	 He was too young to begin with Henry expected a white haired gentleman with a cane and a terrible voice 
8009-284678-0028	train-other-500	But all the time he knew in his soul
none	none	 that it was not only possible but really true He recalled the man s reply to Benny s direct question 
8009-284678-0029	train-other-500	he had said he was going to stay as long as they would let him
none	none	 Could it be that the man knew them without introducing himself A perfect torrent of thoughts assailed Henry as he sat crouched on the office steps It was clear to him now that missus Mc Allister 
8009-284678-0030	train-other-500	had failed to mention his name on purpose It was a wonder Benny hadn t asked what it was long before this
none	none	 He noticed that the man was getting out of his chair under the trees 
8009-284678-0031	train-other-500	It s now or never thought Henry I ve got to know He walked eagerly after the man who was going toward the garden with his back turned Henry easily caught up with him breathing with difficulty The man turned around Are you
8009-284678-0032	train-other-500	James Henry Cordyce of Greenfield panted Henry I am my boy returned the man with a long look Does that question of yours mean that you know that I know that you
8009-284678-0033	train-other-500	are Henry James Cordyce Yes said Henry simply
none	none	 The man s eyes filled with tears and J H Cordyce of the Steel Mills shook hands for the third time with his grandson H J Cordyce of the Home for Tramps A NEW GRANDFATHER In less than an hour the town was buzzing with the news The chauffeur told the maids and the maids told the grocery man and the grocery man went from house to house telling that old James Cordyce had found his four grandchildren at last In fact the biggest part of the town knew it before the children themselves Jess and Benny came across the lawn to select some white moonflowers for Violet s tray They were just in time to hear Henry say But Grandfather Grandfather echoed Jess whirling around to gaze at them Yes Jess said Henry eagerly He s the man we ve been running away from all this time I thought you was old observed Benny And awf ly cross Jess said so I didn t know Benny said Jess turning pink To think of running away from this kind friend But her grandfather did not seem to mind He stroked her short silky hair and proposed that they all go up into Violet s room with the moonflowers There was no stopping Benny He rushed into Violet s room dragging his grandfather by one hand and shouting It s Grandfather Violet and he s nice after all I shouldn t wonder When Violet at last understood just what Benny was trying to tell she was perfectly happy to rest against her ruffled pillows with one hand curled about her grandfather s arm and listen to the rest Where have you been living demanded mister Cordyce at last The whole company looked at each other even doctor Mc Allister and his mother Then they all laughed as if they never would stop You just ought to see observed doctor Mc Allister wiping his eyes What said the children all at once You never saw it in the daytime You don t mean it returned the doctor teasing them I have seen it quite a number of times in the daytime Seen what in heaven s name asked mister Cordyce at last Then they told him interrupting each other to tell about the beds of pine needles the wonderful dishes the freight car roof over all the fireplace and the swimming pool That s where Violet got her bronchitis observed the doctor sitting by that pool She shouldn t have done it I thought so from the first You thought so repeated Henry puzzled How did you know she sat by it I m sure I didn t myself I was your most frequent visitor declared the doctor enjoying himself hugely I hope you were our only one said Jess with her mouth open Well I think I was said the doctor The first night after Henry mowed my lawn I followed him as far as the hill to see where he lived Why did you do that interrupted mister Cordyce I liked his looks returned the doctor And I noticed that he didn t tell much about himself so I was curious But you surely didn t see the freight car then said Jess No but I came back that night and hunted around replied doctor Mc Allister At about eleven o clock Henry cried The doctor assented Our rabbit said Henry and Jess together I made as little noise as possible when I saw the freight car Then I saw the door move so I thought some one was inside And when I heard the dog bark I was sure of it and went home But you came back questioned Jess Yes every time I knew all of you were safe in my garden I made you a little visit just to be sure you were having enough to eat and enough dishes The doctor laughed When I found you had a strainer and a vase of flowers and a salt shaker and a cut glass punch bowl I stopped worrying Didn t you suspect they were my children demanded mister Cordyce Didn t you see my advertisement Why didn t you notify me at once They were having such a good time confessed the doctor And I was too I just wanted to see how long they could manage their own affairs It was all tremendously interesting Why that boy and girl of yours are born business managers mister Cordyce mister Cordyce took note of this But I don t see yet how you knew Violet sat by the pool said Jess curiously You couldn t know that of course replied the doctor I went up twice when I knew Henry had taken the dog down to my barn to catch rats I hid behind the big white rock with the flat top That s Lookout Rock explained Jess where we used to let Benny watch for Henry But we didn t hear you No said doctor Mc Allister I didn t even snap a twig those times But I had the very best time when I went with Mother Have you seen it too cried the children I have indeed returned missus Mc Allister I have even had a drink from your well Every one has seen it but me said mister Cordyce patiently We ll show it to you screamed Benny And I ll show you my wheels made on a cart and my bed out of hay and my pink cup Good for you Benny said mister Cordyce pleased When Violet gets well we ll all go up there and if you ll show me your house I ll show you mine Have you got a house asked Benny in surprise Yes You can live there with me if you like it replied mister Cordyce I have been looking for you for nearly two months Under missus Mc Allister s wonderful care Violet soon became strong again But she had been skipping around the garden for several days before the doctor would allow the visit to the freight car house When at last the whole party started out in the great limousine many people looked out of their windows to watch after mister Cordyce and his grandchildren Many of them knew Henry as the boy who won the race and were glad that he had found such a friend But when the children reached their beloved home they were like wild things Watch capered about furiously taking little swims in the pool and sniffing at all the dear old familiar things mister Cordyce seated himself on a rock and watched them all exchanging a glance now and then with missus Mc Allister and her son See our building shouted Benny for that was what he always called the fireplace It burns really too And this is the well and this is the dishpan and this is the frigerator At last every one climbed into the car itself and mister Cordyce saw the beds the cash account on the wall the wonderful shelf and each separate dish Each dish had a story of its own That s more than my dishes have observed mister Cordyce missus Mc Allister who knew what his dishes were was silent They ate chicken sandwiches on the very same tablecloth and Benny drank from his pink cup and Watch couldn t understand why they went away at all But it was a trifle cool on the hill now when the sun began to sink and after rolling the door shut they left regretfully Tomorrow suggested mister Cordyce as they drove home will you all come and see my house Oh yes agreed the children happily little dreaming what was in store for them on the next day and all the days to come A UNITED FAMILY mister Cordyce had been planning this day for more than a week He had sent his most trusted foreman to his own beautiful home to superintend matters there The house was being remodeled entirely after mister Cordyce s own plans and everywhere were carpenters painters and decorators On the very day that mister Cordyce received word that it was finished he suggested the drive Do you live all alone Grandfather asked Benny All alone answered mister Cordyce No company at all At first Benny did not consider this the exact truth He considered a cook company and also a butler and a housekeeper And when he saw the array of maids he kept perfectly quiet The house was enormous certainly It was at least a quarter of a mile from its own front gate and everywhere were gardens Do you live here said Henry thunderstruck as they rolled quietly along the beautiful drive You do too if you like it observed his grandfather watching his face The inside of the house was more wonderful than even the older children had ever dreamed The velvet rugs were so thick and soft that no footfall could be heard Everywhere were flowers The great stairway with steps of marble rose from the center of the big hallway But it was upstairs that the children felt most at home Here the rooms were not quite so large They were sunny and homelike This is Violet s room cried Benny It was unmistakable There were violets on the wallpaper The bed was snow white with a thick quilt of violet silk On the little table were English violets pouring their fragrance into the room What a beautiful room sighed Violet sinking down into one of the soft cushioned chairs But all the children shouted when they saw Benny s room The wallpaper was blue covered with large figures of cats and dogs the Three Bears and Peter Rabbit There was a swinging rocking horse nearly as large as a real horse a blackboard a tool chest and low tables and chairs exactly the right size for Benny There was an electric train with cars nearly as large as the little boy himself Can I run the cars all day asked Benny Oh no replied Henry quickly You re going to school as soon as it begins This was the first that his grandfather had heard about school but he agreed with Henry and chuckled to himself The finest schools in the country he said This came true for all the children finally went to the public schools and are they not the finest schools in the country In Jess room Benny discovered a bed for Watch It was in fact a regular dog s straw hamper but it was lined with heavy quilted silk and padded with wool Watch got in at once sniffed in every corner turned around three times and lay down Just then a distant doorbell rang It had such a low musical chime that the children listened delightedly never once giving a thought as to who it might be But almost at once a soft footed servant appeared saying that a man wanted to see mister Cordyce about the dog The moment Jess heard that word dog she was frightened She had never thought Watch a common runaway dog and it always made her uncomfortable to see passers by gaze curiously at him as he ran by her side They won t take Watch away she whispered to Henry her breath almost gone Indeed they will not declared Henry We ll never never give him up However Henry followed his grandfather and Jess with great anxiety It was indeed about Watch that the man wanted to talk and Jess heart sank again when she saw the dog jump delightedly upon the man and return his caresses with short barks He s a runaway sir from my kennels out in Townsend the man explained to mister Cordyce I have two hundred Airedales out there and this one was sold the day before he ran away So you see I have to turn him over to the lady I sold him to Oh no you don t returned mister Cordyce quickly I will give you three times what the dog is worth The man glanced around uneasily I couldn t do that sir he explained You see it isn t a question of money it s a question of my promised word to the lady mister Cordyce failed to see She can find another dog among two hundred Airedales I guess he returned And besides you don t know positively that this is the right dog Excuse me replied the man very much embarrassed he s the dog all right He knows me as you see His name is Rough No three He has a black spot inside his ear It was too true Indeed at the mere mention of his name the dog cocked an ear and wagged his tail But he had seated himself as close to Jess as possible and licked her hand when she patted him But it appeared that Henry could understand the man s position even if mister Cordyce could not He now put in a timid word of his own If the lady would agree to let the dog go would you be willing Sure said the man shooting a glance at Henry I almost know any one would let us keep Watch Grandfather said Henry earnestly if they knew how much he had done for us I m sure of it my boy returned mister Cordyce kindly The fact that Henry had been the first to make headway with the dog fancier had not escaped him But it was clear that Jess would not be able to sleep until the matter had been settled so the moment the man had gone the children set out from their beautiful new home to the address of the lady who had bought Watch The big car purred along from Greenfield to Townsend in no time And the whole family including Watch himself trooped up the veranda steps to interview the lady who held it in her power to break their hearts or to make them very happy She was not terrible to look at In fact she was quite young quite lively and very very pretty She asked them all to sit down which they did gravely for even Benny was worried about losing Watchie his favorite pillow He could not wait for his grandfather to begin He struggled down from his chair and dashed over to the young lady saying in one breath You ll let us keep Watchie please won t you because we want him so bad and Jess didn t know he was your dog By degrees the lady understood just what dog it was We have had him so long explained Henry eagerly it would be almost like letting Benny go away Watch never leaves us even for a minute ever since Jess took the briar out of his foot So you are the children who lived in the freight car observed the lively young lady I ve heard all about that How did you like it All right replied Henry with an effort But we never could have done it without Watch He stayed and looked after the girls while I was away and he just thinks everything of Jess Well said the young lady laughing I can see you re worrying terribly about that dog Now listen I wouldn t take that dog away from you any more than I d take Benny In fact not so much I think maybe I d like to keep Benny instead Benny was apparently quite willing that she should He climbed into her lap before any one could stop him and gave her one of his best bear hugs And from that moment they were firm friends But the children always spoke of her as the lady who owns Watch although mister Cordyce paid for the dog in less time than you can imagine It made no difference to the children that Watch was a very valuable dog They had loved him when he had not been worth a cent and now they loved him more simply because they had so nearly lost him It was a happy and reunited family which gathered around the Cordyce dining table that evening The maids smiled in the kitchen to hear the children laugh and the children laughed because Watch actually sat up at the table in the seat of honor beside Jess and was waited upon by a butler SAFE Would you ever dream that four children could be homesick in such a beautiful house as mister Cordyce s Jess was the first one to long for the old freight car O Grandfather she said one morning I wish I could cook something once more in the old kettle Go out in the kitchen said her grandfather and mess around all you like The maids will help you Jess brightened up at once and flew out into the kitchen where three or four maids brought her everything she wanted to cook with And Benny was the last one to wish for his old home Grandfather he said one day I wish I could drink this milk out of my own pink cup This set mister Cordyce to thinking He had plenty of pink cups it is true but none of them were as dear to Benny as his own I think I shall have to surprise you children said mister Cordyce at last But before the surprise comes perhaps you would like to see Benny s pony Then he led the way to the stables He owned several beautiful horses already and nearly a dozen wonderful cars But nothing was half so interesting as the pony He was very small and very fat and black His wavy tail was so long that it nearly touched the ground And his name was Cracker because his birthday fell on the Fourth of July when firecrackers were popping Benny took a short ride around the stable being held on by a groom But the second time around he said Cracker doesn t need you to hold onto him I shouldn t wonder and trotted around with great delight without help All the others sat down on the fragrant hay to watch him ride What am I going to do when I grow up Grandfather asked Henry You re going to take my place Henry as president of the steel mills replied mister Cordyce You will do it better than I ever have And one day this came true just as most of mister Cordyce s prophecies did And what am I going to do asked Jess curiously All you children must go to school and then to college Then you may do whatever you choose for a living replied mister Cordyce This also came true Of course I have more than enough money to support us all went on mister Cordyce but if you have something to do you will be happier This not only came true but it is always and forever true all over the world Am I going to college tomorrow asked Benny stopping his little pony in front of the group Not tomorrow Benny said his grandfather laughing But I m glad you reminded me All you children must go over to doctor Mc Allister s tomorrow and stay while the surprise comes Is the surprise very nice asked Benny No not very replied mister Cordyce with a twinkle Did it cost a great deal asked Jess It didn t cost me anything answered her grandfather The only thing I shall have to pay will be express He didn t tell them that the express cost him several hundred dollars However next day the children rode gladly over to see the kind doctor They stayed until mister Cordyce telephoned to them that the surprise was ready And then missus Mc Allister and her son rode back with them in the big car mister Cordyce was as happy as a boy He led the merry little procession out through his many gardens past the rose garden through the banks of purple asters Then they came to an Italian garden with a fountain in the middle and a shady little wood around the edge Among the trees was the surprise It was the old freight car The children rushed over to it with cries of delight pushed back the dear old door and scrambled in Everything was in place Here was Benny s pink cup and here was his bed Here was the old knife which had cut butter and bread and vegetables and firewood and string and here were the letters for Benny s primer Here was the big kettle and the tablecloth And hanging on a near by tree was the old dinner bell Benny rang the bell over and over again and Watch rolled on the floor and barked himself hoarse The children were never homesick after that To be sure a dull and ugly freight car looked a little strange in a beautiful Italian garden But it was never dull or ugly to the Cordyce children or their dog They never were so happy as when showing visitors each beauty of their beloved old home And there were many visitors Some of them were fascinated by the stories of the wonderful dishes and the shelf And the children never grew tired of telling them over and over again One summer day many years afterward Watch climbed out of his beautiful padded silk bed and barked until Henry lifted him into the freight car There he lay down on the hard splintery floor blinking his eyes in the sun and watching the children as they sat studying by the fountain He likes the old home best said Jess Cordyce smiling at him and patting his rough back And as Benny would say if he hadn t grown up That s true I shouldn t wonder End of Project Gutenberg s The Box Car Children by Gertrude Chandler Warner END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BOX CAR CHILDREN This file should be named forty
