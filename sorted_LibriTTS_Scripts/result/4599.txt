none	none	CHAPTER LIV CHAPTER I THE SQUIRE OF ALLINGTON ILLUSTRATION untitled Of course there was a Great House at Allington How otherwise should there have been a Small House Our story will as its name imports have its closest relations with those who lived in the less dignified domicile of the two but it will have close relations also with the more dignified and it may be well that
5712_48842_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I should 
none	none	in the first instance say a few words as to the Great House and its owner The squires of Allington had been squires of Allington since squires such as squires are now were first known in England From father to son and from uncle to nephew and in one instance from second cousin to second cousin the sceptre had descended in the family of the Dales and the acres had remained intact growing in value and not decreasing in number though guarded by no entail and protected by no wonderful amount of prudence or wisdom The estate of Dale of Allington had been coterminous with the parish of Allington for some hundreds of years and though as I have said the race of squires had possessed nothing of superhuman discretion and had perhaps been guided in their walks through life by no very distinct principles still there had been with them so much of adherence to a sacred law that no acre of the property had ever been parted from the hands of the existing squire Some futile attempts had been made to increase the territory as indeed had been done by Kit Dale the father of Christopher Dale who will appear as our squire of Allington when the persons of our drama are introduced Old Kit Dale who had married money had bought outlying farms a bit of ground here and a bit there talking as he did so much of political influence and of the good old Tory cause But these farms and bits of ground had gone again before our time To them had been attached no religion When old Kit had found himself pressed in that matter of the majority of the Nineteenth Dragoons in which crack regiment his second son made for himself quite a career he found it easier to sell than to save seeing that that which he sold was his own and not the patrimony of the Dales At his death the remainder of these purchases had gone Family arrangements required completion and Christopher Dale required ready money The outlying farms flew away as such new purchases had flown before but the old patrimony of the Dales remained untouched as it had ever remained It had been a religion among them and seeing that the worship had been carried on without fail that the vestal fire had
5867_48852_000092_000000	train-clean-100	 never 
none	none	gone down upon the hearth I should not have said that the Dales had walked their ways without high principle To this religion they had all adhered and the new heir had ever entered in upon his domain without other encumbrances than those with which he himself was then already burdened And yet there had been no entail The idea of an entail was not in accordance with the peculiarities of the Dale mind It was necessary to the Dale religion that each squire should have the power of wasting the acres of Allington and that he should abstain from wasting them I remember to have dined at a house the whole glory and fortune of which depended on the safety of a glass goblet We all know the story If the luck of Edenhall should be shattered the doom of the family would be sealed Nevertheless I was bidden to drink out of the fatal glass as were all guests in that house It would not have contented the chivalrous mind of the master to protect his doom by lock and key and padded chest And so it was with the Dales of Allington To them an entail would have been a lock and key and a padded chest but the old chivalry of their house denied to them the use of such protection I have spoken something slightingly of the acquirements and doings of the family and indeed their acquirements had been few and their doings little At Allington Dale of Allington had always been known as a king At Guestwick the neighbouring market town he was a great man to be seen frequently on Saturdays standing in the market place and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among men who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he At Hamersham the assize town he was generally in some repute being a constant grand juror for the county and a man who paid his way But even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had at most periods begun to pale for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the county and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of jurisprudence in the grand jury room Beyond Hamersham their fame had not spread itself They had been men generally built in the same mould inheriting each from his father the same virtues and the same vices men who would have lived each as his father had lived before him had not the new ways of the world gradually drawn away with them by an invisible magnetism the upcoming Dale of the day not indeed in any case so moving him as to bring him up to the spirit of the age in which he lived but dragging him forward to a line in advance of that on which his father had trodden They had been obstinate men believing much in themselves just according to their ideas of justice hard to their tenants but not known to be hard even by the tenants themselves for the rules followed had ever been the rules on the Allington estate imperious to their wives and children but imperious within bounds so that no missus Dale had fled from her lord s roof and no loud scandals had existed between father and sons exacting in their ideas as to money expecting that they were to receive much and to give little and yet not thought to be mean for they paid their way and gave money in parish charity and in county charity They had ever been steady supporters of the Church graciously receiving into their parish such new vicars as from time to time were sent to them from King s College Cambridge to which establishment the gift of the living belonged but nevertheless the Dales had ever carried on some unpronounced warfare against the clergyman so that the intercourse between the lay family and the clerical had seldom been in all respects pleasant Such had been the Dales of Allington time out of mind and such in all respects would have been the Christopher Dale of our time had he not suffered two accidents in his youth He had fallen in love with a lady who obstinately refused his hand and on her account he had remained single that was his first accident The second had fallen upon him with reference to his father s assumed wealth He had supposed himself to be richer than other Dales of Allington when coming in upon his property and had consequently entertained an idea of sitting in Parliament for his county In order that he might attain this honour he had allowed himself to be talked by the men of Hamersham and Guestwick out of his old family politics and had declared himself a Liberal He had never gone to the poll and indeed had never actually stood for the seat But he had come forward as a liberal politician and had failed and although it was well known to all around that Christopher Dale was in heart as thoroughly conservative as any of his forefathers this accident had made him sour and silent on the subject of politics and had somewhat estranged him from his brother squires In other respects our Christopher Dale was if anything superior to the average of the family Those whom he did love he loved dearly Those whom he hated he did not ill use beyond the limits of justice He was close in small matters of money and yet in certain family arrangements he was as we shall see capable of much liberality He endeavoured to do his duty in accordance with his lights and had succeeded in weaning himself from personal indulgences to which during the early days of his high hopes he had become accustomed And in that matter of his unrequited love he had been true throughout In his hard dry unpleasant way he had loved the woman and when at last he learned to know that she would not have his love he had been unable to transfer his heart to another This had happened just at the period of his father s death and he had endeavoured to console himself with politics with what fate we have already seen A constant upright and by no means insincere man was our Christopher Dale thin and meagre in his mental attributes by no means even understanding the fulness of a full man with power of eye sight very limited in seeing aught which was above him but yet worthy of regard in that he had realized a path of duty and did endeavour to walk therein And moreover our mister Christopher Dale was a gentleman Such in character was the squire of Allington the only regular inhabitant of the Great House In person he was a plain dry man with short grizzled hair and thick grizzled eyebrows Of beard he had very little carrying the smallest possible gray whiskers which hardly fell below the points of his ears His eyes were sharp and expressive and his nose was straight and well formed as was also his chin But the nobility of his face was destroyed by a mean mouth with thin lips and his forehead which was high and narrow though it forbad you to take mister Dale for a fool forbad you also to take him for a man of great parts or of a wide capacity In height he was about five feet ten and at the time of our story was as near to seventy as he was to sixty But years had treated him very lightly and he bore few signs of age Such in person was Christopher Dale esquire the squire of Allington and owner of some three thousand a year all of which proceeded from the lands of that parish And now I will speak of the Great House of Allington After all it was not very great nor was it surrounded by much of that exquisite nobility of park appurtenance which graces the habitations of most of our old landed proprietors But the house itself was very graceful It had been built in the days of the early Stuarts in that style of architecture to which we give the name of the Tudors On its front it showed three pointed roofs or gables as I believe they should be called and between each gable a thin tall chimney stood the two chimneys thus raising themselves just above the three peaks I have mentioned I think that the beauty of the house depended much on those two chimneys on them and on the mullioned windows with which the front of the house was closely filled The door with its jutting porch was by no means in the centre of the house As you entered there was but one window on your right hand while on your left there were three And over these there was a line of five windows one taking its place above the porch We all know the beautiful old Tudor window with its stout stone mullions and its stone transoms crossing from side to side at a point much nearer to the top than to the bottom Of all windows ever invented it is the sweetest And here at Allington I think their beauty was enhanced by the fact that they were not regular in their shape Some of these windows were long windows while some of them were high That to the right of the door and that at the other extremity of the house were among the former But the others had been put in without regard to uniformity a long window here and a high window there with a general effect which could hardly have been improved Then above in the three gables were three other smaller apertures But these also were mullioned and the entire frontage of the house was uniform in its style Round the house there were trim gardens not very large but worthy of much note in that they were so trim gardens with broad gravel paths with one walk running in front of the house so broad as to be fitly called a terrace But this though in front of the house was sufficiently removed from it to allow of a coach road running inside it to the front door The Dales of Allington had always been gardeners and their garden was perhaps more noted in the county than any other of their properties But outside the gardens no pretensions had been made to the grandeur of a domain The pastures round the house were but pretty fields in which timber was abundant There was no deer park at Allington and though the Allington woods were well known they formed no portion of a whole of which the house was a part They lay away out of sight a full mile from the back of the house but not on that account of less avail for the fitting preservation of foxes And the house stood much too near the road for purposes of grandeur had such purposes ever swelled the breast of any of the squires of Allington But I fancy that our ideas of rural grandeur have altered since many of our older country seats were built To be near the village so as in some way to afford comfort protection and patronage and perhaps also with some view to the pleasantness of neighbourhood for its own inmates seemed to be the object of a gentleman when building his house in the old days A solitude in the centre of a wide park is now the only site that can be recognized as eligible No cottage must be seen unless the cottage orne of the gardener The village if it cannot be abolished must be got out of sight The sound of the church bells is not desirable and the road on which the profane vulgar travel by their own right must be at a distance When some old Dale of Allington built his house he thought differently There stood the church and there the village and pleased with such vicinity he sat himself down close to his God and to his tenants As you pass along the road from Guestwick into the village you see the church near to you on your left hand but the house is hidden from the road As you approach the church reaching the gate of it which is not above two hundred yards from the high road you see the full front of the Great House Perhaps the best view of it is from the churchyard The lane leading up to the church ends in a gate which is the entrance into mister Dale s place There is no lodge there and the gate generally stands open indeed always does so unless some need of cattle grazing within requires that it should be closed But there is an inner gate leading from the home paddock through the gardens to the house and another inner gate some thirty yards farther on which will take you into the farm yard Perhaps it is a defect at Allington that the farm yard is very close to the house But the stables and the straw yards and the unwashed carts and the lazy lingering cattle of the homestead are screened off by a row of chestnuts which when in its glory of flower in the early days of May no other row in England can surpass in beauty Had any one told Dale of Allington this Dale or any former Dale that his place wanted wood he would have pointed with mingled pride and disdain to his belt of chestnuts Of the church itself I will say the fewest possible number of words It was a church such as there are I think thousands in England low incommodious kept with difficulty in repair too often pervious to the wet and yet strangely picturesque and correct too according to great rules of architecture It was built with a nave and aisles visibly in the form of a cross though with its arms clipped down to the trunk with a separate chancel with a large square short tower and with a bell shaped spire covered with lead and irregular in its proportions Who does not know the low porch the perpendicular Gothic window the flat roofed aisles and the noble old gray tower of such a church as this As regards its interior it was dusty it was blocked up with high backed ugly pews the gallery in which the children sat at the end of the church and in which two ancient musicians blew their bassoons was all awry and looked as though it would fall the pulpit was an ugly useless edifice as high nearly as the roof would allow and the reading desk under it hardly permitted the parson to keep his head free from the dangling tassels of the cushion above him A clerk also was there beneath him holding a third position somewhat elevated and upon the whole things there were not quite as I would have had them But nevertheless the place looked like a church and I can hardly say so much for all the modern edifices which have been built in my days towards the glory of God It looked like a church and not the less so because in walking up the passage between the pews the visitor trod upon the brass plates which dignified the resting places of the departed Dales of old Below the church and between that and the village stood the vicarage in such position that the small garden of the vicarage stretched from the churchyard down to the backs of the village cottages This was a pleasant residence newly built within the last thirty years and creditable to the ideas of comfort entertained by the rich collegiate body from which the vicars of Allington always came Doubtless we shall in the course of our sojourn at Allington visit the vicarage now and then but I do not know that any further detailed account of its comforts will be necessary to us Passing by the lane leading to the vicarage the church and to the house the high road descends rapidly to a little brook which runs through the village On the right as you descend you will have seen the Red Lion and will have seen no other house conspicuous in any way At the bottom close to the brook is the post office kept surely by the crossest old woman in all those parts Here the road passes through the water the accommodation of a narrow wooden bridge having been afforded for those on foot But before passing the stream you will see a cross street running to the left as had run that other lane leading to the house Here as this cross street rises the hill are the best houses in the village The baker lives here and that respectable woman missus Frummage who sells ribbons and toys and soap and straw bonnets with many other things too long to mention Here too lives an apothecary whom the veneration of this and neighbouring parishes has raised to the dignity of a doctor And here also in the smallest but prettiest cottage that can be imagined lives missus Hearn the widow of a former vicar on terms however with her neighbour the squire which I regret to say are not as friendly as they should be Beyond this lady s modest residence Allington Street for so the road is called turns suddenly round towards the church and at the point of the turn is a pretty low iron railing with a gate and with a covered way which leads up to the front door of the house which stands there I will only say here at this fag end of a chapter that it is the Small House at Allington Allington Street as I have said turns short round towards the church at this point and there ends at a white gate leading into the churchyard by a second entrance So much it was needful that I should say of Allington Great House of the Squire and of the village Of the Small House I will speak separately in a further chapter CHAPTER II THE TWO PEARLS OF ALLINGTON But mister Crosbie is only a mere clerk This sarcastic condemnation was spoken by Miss Lilian Dale to her sister Isabella and referred to a gentleman with whom we shall have much concern in these pages I do not say that mister Crosbie will be our hero seeing that that part in the drama will be cut up as it were into fragments Whatever of the magnificent may be produced will be diluted and apportioned out in very moderate quantities among two or more probably among three or four young gentlemen to none of whom will be vouchsafed the privilege of much heroic action

none	none	know what you call a mere clerk Lily mister Fanfaron is a mere barrister and mister Boyce is a mere clergyman mister Boyce was the vicar of Allington and mister Fanfaron was a lawyer who had made his way over to Allington during the last assizes You might as well say that Lord De Guest is a mere earl So he is only a mere earl Had he ever done anything except have fat oxen one wouldn t say so You know what I mean by a mere clerk It isn t much in a man to be in a public office and yet mister Crosbie gives himself airs You don t suppose that mister Crosbie is the same as John Eames said Bell who by her tone of voice did not seem inclined to undervalue the qualifications of mister Crosbie Now John Eames was a young man from Guestwick who had been appointed to a clerkship in the Income tax Office with eighty pounds a year two years ago Then Johnny Eames is a mere clerk said Lily and mister Crosbie is After all Bell what is mister Crosbie if he is not a mere clerk Of course he is older than John Eames and as he has been longer at it I suppose he has more than eighty pounds a year I am not in mister Crosbie s confidence He is in the General Committee Office I know and I believe has pretty nearly the management of the whole of it I have heard Bernard say that he has six or seven young men under him and that but of course I don t know what he does at his office I ll tell you what he is Bell mister Crosbie is a swell And Lilian Dale was right mister Crosbie was a swell And here I may perhaps best explain who Bernard was and who was mister Crosbie Captain Bernard Dale was an officer in the corps of Engineers was the first cousin of the two girls who have been speaking and was nephew and heir presumptive to the squire His father Colonel Dale and his mother Lady Fanny Dale were still living at Torquay an effete invalid listless couple pretty well dead to all the world beyond the region of the Torquay card tables He it was who had made for himself quite a career in the Nineteenth Dragoons This he did by eloping with the penniless daughter of that impoverished earl the Lord De Guest After the conclusion of that event circumstances had not afforded him the opportunity of making himself conspicuous and he had gone on declining gradually in the world s esteem for the world had esteemed him when he first made good his running with the Lady Fanny till now in his slippered years he and his Lady Fanny were unknown except among those Torquay Bath chairs and card tables His elder brother was still a hearty man walking in thick shoes and constant in his saddle but the colonel with nothing beyond his wife s title to keep his body awake had fallen asleep somewhat prematurely among his slippers Of him and of Lady Fanny Bernard Dale was the only son Daughters they had had some were dead some married and one living with them among the card tables Of his parents Bernard had latterly not seen much not more that is than duty and a due attention to the fifth commandment required of him He also was making a career for himself having obtained a commission in the Engineers and being known to all his compeers as the nephew of an earl and as the heir to a property of three thousand a year And when I say that Bernard Dale was not inclined to throw away any of these advantages I by no means intend to speak in his dispraise The advantage of being heir to a good property is so manifest the advantages over and beyond those which are merely fiscal that no man thinks of throwing them away or expects another man to do so Moneys in possession or in expectation do give a set to the head and a confidence to the voice and an assurance to the man which will help him much in his walk in life if the owner of them will simply use them and not abuse them And for Bernard Dale I will say that he did not often talk of his uncle the earl He was conscious that his uncle was an earl and that other men knew the fact He knew that he would not otherwise have been elected at the Beaufort or at that most aristocratic of little clubs called Sebright s When noble blood was called in question he never alluded specially to his own but he knew how to speak as one of whom all the world was aware on which side he had been placed by the circumstances of his birth Thus he used his advantage and did not abuse it And in his profession he had been equally fortunate By industry by a small but wakeful intelligence and by some aid from patronage he had got on till he had almost achieved the reputation of talent His name had become known among scientific experimentalists not as that of one who had himself invented a cannon or an antidote to a cannon but as of a man understanding in cannons and well fitted to look at those invented by others who would honestly test this or that antidote or if not honestly seeing that such thin minded men can hardly go to the proof of any matter without some pre judgment in their minds at any rate with such appearance of honesty that the world might be satisfied And in this way Captain Dale was employed much at home about London and was not called on to build barracks in Nova Scotia or to make roads in the Punjaub He was a small slight man smaller than his uncle but in face very like him He had the same eyes and nose and chin and the same mouth but his forehead was better less high and pointed and better formed about the brows And then he wore moustaches which somewhat hid the thinness of his mouth On the whole he was not ill looking and as I have said before he carried with him an air of self assurance and a confident balance which in itself gives a grace to a young man He was staying at the present time in his uncle s house during the delicious warmth of the summer for as yet the month of July was not all past and his intimate friend Adolphus Crosbie who was or was not a mere clerk as my readers may choose to form their own opinions on that matter was a guest in the house with him I am inclined to say that Adolphus Crosbie was not a mere clerk and I do not think that he would have been so called even by Lily Dale had he not given signs to her that he was a swell Now a man in becoming a swell a swell of such an order as could possibly be known to Lily Dale must have ceased to be a mere clerk in that very process And moreover Captain Dale would not have been Damon to any Pythias of whom it might fairly be said that he was a mere clerk Nor could any mere clerk have got himself in either at the Beaufort or at Sebright s The evidence against that former assertion made by Lily Dale is very strong but then the evidence as to her latter assertion is as strong mister Crosbie certainly was a swell It is true that he was a clerk in the General Committee Office But then in the first place the General Committee Office is situated in Whitehall whereas poor John Eames was forced to travel daily from his lodgings in Burton Crescent ever so far beyond Russell Square to his dingy room in Somerset House And Adolphus Crosbie when very young had been a private secretary and had afterwards mounted up in his office to some quasi authority and senior clerkship bringing him in seven hundred a year and giving him a status among assistant secretaries and the like which even in an official point of view was something But the triumphs of Adolphus Crosbie had been other than these Not because he had been intimate with assistant secretaries and was allowed in Whitehall a room to himself with an arm chair would he have been entitled to stand upon the rug at Sebright s and speak while rich men listened rich men and men also who had handles to their names Adolphus Crosbie had done more than make minutes with discretion on the papers of the General Committee Office He had set himself down before the gates of the city of fashion and had taken them by storm or perhaps to speak with more propriety he had picked the locks and let himself in In his walks of life he was somebody in London A man at the West End who did not know who was Adolphus Crosbie knew nothing I do not say that he was the intimate friend of many great men but even great men acknowledged the acquaintance of Adolphus Crosbie and he was to be seen in the drawing rooms or at any rate on the staircases of Cabinet Ministers Lilian Dale dear Lily Dale for my reader must know that she is to be very dear and that my story will be nothing to him if he do not love Lily Dale Lilian Dale had discovered that mister Crosbie was a swell But I am bound to say that mister Crosbie did not habitually proclaim the fact in any offensive manner nor in becoming a swell had he become altogether a bad fellow It was not to be expected that a man who was petted at Sebright s should carry himself in the Allington drawing room as would Johnny Eames who had never been petted by any one but his mother And this fraction of a hero of ours had other advantages to back him over and beyond those which fashion had given him He was a tall well looking man with pleasant eyes and an expressive mouth a man whom you would probably observe in whatever room you might meet him And he knew how to talk and had in him something which justified talking He was no butterfly or dandy who flew about in the world s sun warmed into prettiness by a sunbeam Crosbie had his opinion on things on politics on religion on the philanthropic tendencies of the age and had read something here and there as he formed his opinion Perhaps he might have done better in the world had he not been placed so early in life in that Whitehall public office There was that in him which might have earned better bread for him in an open profession But in that matter of his bread the fate of Adolphus Crosbie had by this time been decided for him and he had reconciled himself to fate that was now inexorable Some very slight patrimony a hundred a year or so had fallen to his share Beyond that he had his salary from his office and nothing else and on his income thus made up he had lived as a bachelor in London enjoying all that London could give him as a man in moderately easy circumstances and looking forward to no costly luxuries such as a wife a house of his own or a stable full of horses Those which he did enjoy of the good things of the world would if known to John Eames have made him appear fabulously rich in the eyes of that brother clerk His lodgings in Mount Street were elegant in their belongings During three months of the season in London he called himself the master of a very neat hack He was always well dressed though never over dressed At his clubs he could live on equal terms with men having ten times his income He was not married He had acknowledged to himself that he could not marry without money and he would not marry for money He had put aside from him as not within his reach the comforts of marriage But We will not however at the present moment inquire more curiously into the private life and circumstances of our new friend Adolphus Crosbie After the sentence pronounced against him by Lilian the two girls remained silent for awhile Bell was perhaps a little angry with her sister It was not often that she allowed herself to say much in praise of any gentleman and now that she had spoken a word or two in favour of mister Crosbie she felt herself to be rebuked by her sister for this unwonted enthusiasm Lily was at work on a drawing and in a minute or two had forgotten all about mister Crosbie but the injury remained on Bell s mind and prompted her to go back to the subject I don t like those slang words Lily What slang words You know what you called Bernard s friend Oh a swell I fancy I do like slang I think it s awfully jolly to talk about things being jolly Only that I was afraid of your nerves I should have called him stunning It s so slow you know to use nothing but words out of a dictionary I don t think it s nice in talking of gentlemen Isn t it Well I d like to be nice if I knew how If she knew how There is no knowing how for a girl in that matter If nature and her mother have not done it for her there is no hope for her on that head I think I may say that nature and her mother had been sufficiently efficacious for Lilian Dale in this respect mister Crosbie is at any rate a gentleman and knows how to make himself pleasant That was all that I meant Mamma said a great deal more about him than I did mister Crosbie is an Apollo and I always look upon Apollo as the greatest you know what that ever lived I mustn t say the word because Apollo was a gentleman At this moment while the name of the god was still on her lips the high open window of the drawing room was darkened and Bernard entered followed by mister Crosbie Who is talking about Apollo said Captain Dale The girls were both stricken dumb How would it be with them if mister Crosbie had heard himself spoken of in those last words of poor Lily s This was the rashness of which Bell was ever accusing her sister and here was the result But in truth Bernard had heard nothing more than the name and mister Crosbie who had been behind him had heard nothing As sweet and musical as bright Apollo s lute strung with his hair said mister Crosbie not meaning much by the quotation but perceiving that the two girls had been in some way put out and silenced What very bad music it must have made said Lily unless indeed his hair was very different from ours It was all sunbeams suggested Bernard But by that time Apollo had served his turn and the ladies welcomed their guests in the proper form Mamma is in the garden said Bell with that hypocritical pretence so common with young ladies when young gentlemen call as though they were aware that mamma was the object specially sought Picking peas with a sun bonnet on said Lily Let us by all means go and help her said mister Crosbie and then they issued out into the garden The gardens of the Great House of Allington and those of the Small House open on to each other A proper boundary of thick laurel hedge and wide ditch and of iron spikes guarding the ditch there is between them but over the wide ditch there is a foot bridge and at the bridge there is a gate which has no key and for all purposes of enjoyment the gardens of each house are open to the other And the gardens of the Small House are very pretty The Small House itself is so near the road that there is nothing between the dining room windows and the iron rail but a narrow edge rather than border and a little path made with round fixed cobble stones not above two feet broad into which no one but the gardener ever makes his way The distance from the road to the house is not above five or six feet and the entrance from the gate is shut in by a covered way But the garden behind the house on to which the windows from the drawing room open is to all the senses as private as though there were no village of Allington and no road up to the church within a hundred yards of the lawn The steeple of the church indeed can be seen from the lawn peering as it were between the yew trees which stand in the corner of the churchyard adjoining to missus Dale s wall But none of the Dale family have any objection to the sight of that steeple The glory of the Small House at Allington certainly consists in its lawn which is as smooth as level and as much like velvet as grass has ever yet been made to look Lily Dale taking pride in her own lawn has declared often that it is no good attempting to play croquet up at the Great House The grass she says grows in tufts and nothing that Hopkins the gardener can or will do has any effect upon the tufts But there are no tufts at the Small House As the squire himself has never been very enthusiastic about croquet the croquet implements have been moved permanently down to the Small House and croquet there has become quite an institution And while I am on the subject of the garden I may also mention missus Dale s conservatory as to which Bell was strenuously of opinion that the Great House had nothing to offer equal to it For flowers of course I mean she would say correcting herself for at the Great House there was a grapery very celebrated On this matter the squire would be less tolerant than as regarded the croquet and would tell his niece that she knew nothing about flowers Perhaps not uncle Christopher she would say All the same I like our geraniums best for there was a spice of obstinacy about Miss Dale as indeed there was in all the Dales male and female young and old It may be as well to explain that the care of this lawn and of this conservatory and indeed of the entire garden belonging to the Small House was in the hands of Hopkins the head gardener to the Great House and it was so simply for this reason that missus Dale could not afford to keep a gardener herself A working lad at ten shillings a week who cleaned the knives and shoes and dug the ground was the only male attendant on the three ladies But Hopkins the head gardener of Allington who had men under him was as widely awake to the lawn and the conservatory of the humbler establishment as he was to the grapery peach walls and terraces of the grander one In his eyes it was all one place The Small House belonged to his master as indeed did the very furniture within it and it was lent not let to missus Dale Hopkins perhaps did not love missus Dale seeing that he owed her no duty as one born a Dale The two young ladies he did love and also snubbed in a very peremptory way sometimes To missus Dale he was coldly civil always referring to the squire if any direction worthy of special notice as concerning the garden was given to him All this will serve to explain the terms on which missus Dale was living at the Small House a matter needful of explanation sooner or later Her husband had been the youngest of three brothers and in many respects the brightest Early in life he had gone up to London and there had done well as a land surveyor He had done so well that Government had employed him and for some three or four years he had enjoyed a large income but death had come suddenly on him while he was only yet ascending the ladder and when he died he had hardly begun to realize the golden prospects which he had seen before him This had happened some fifteen years before our story commenced so that the two girls hardly retained any memory of their father For the first five years of her widowhood missus Dale who had never been a favourite of the squire s lived with her two little girls in such modest way as her very limited means allowed Old missus Dale the squire s mother then occupied the Small House But when old missus Dale died the squire offered the place rent free to his sister in law intimating to her that her daughters would obtain considerable social advantages by living at Allington She had accepted the offer and the social advantages had certainly followed missus Dale was poor her whole income not exceeding three hundred a year and therefore her own style of living was of necessity very unassuming but she saw her girls becoming popular in the county much liked by the families around them and enjoying nearly all the advantages which would have accrued to them had they been the daughters of Squire Dale of Allington Under such circumstances it was little to her whether or no she were loved by her brother in law or respected by Hopkins Her own girls loved her and respected her and that was pretty much all that she demanded of the world on her own behalf And uncle Christopher had been very good to the girls in his own obstinate and somewhat ungracious manner There were two ponies in the stables of the Great House which they were allowed to ride and which unless on occasions nobody else did ride I think he might have given the ponies to the girls but he thought differently And he contributed to their dresses sending them home now and again things which he thought necessary not in the pleasantest way in the world Money he never gave them nor did he make them any promises But they were Dales and he loved them and with Christopher Dale to love once was to love always Bell was his chief favourite sharing with his nephew Bernard the best warmth of his heart About these two he had his projects intending that Bell should be the future mistress of the Great House of Allington as to which project however Miss Dale was as yet in very absolute ignorance We may now I think go back to our four friends as they walked out upon the lawn They were understood to be on a mission to assist missus Dale in the picking of the peas but pleasure intervened in the way of business and the young people forgetting the labours of their elder allowed themselves to be carried away by the fascinations of croquet The iron hoops and the sticks were fixed The mallets and the balls were lying about and then the party was so nicely made up I haven t had a game of croquet yet said mister Crosbie It cannot be said that he had lost much time seeing that he had only arrived before dinner on the preceding day And then the mallets were in their hands in a moment We ll play sides of course said Lily Bernard and I ll play together But this was not allowed Lily was well known to be the queen of the croquet ground and as Bernard was supposed to be more efficient than his friend Lily had to take mister Crosbie as her partner Apollo can t get through the hoops Lily said afterwards to her sister but then how gracefully he fails to do it Lily however had been beaten and may therefore be excused for a little spite against her partner But it so turned out that before mister Crosbie took his final departure from Allington he could get through the hoops and Lily though she was still queen of the croquet ground had to acknowledge a male sovereign in that dominion That s not the way we played at said Crosbie at one point of the game and then stopped himself Where was that said Bernard A place I was at last summer in Shropshire Then they don t play the game mister Crosbie at the place you were at last summer in Shropshire said Lily You mean Lady Hartletop s said Bernard Now the Marchioness of Hartletop was a very great person indeed and a leader in the fashionable world Oh Lady Hartletop s said Lily Then I suppose we must give in which little bit of sarcasm was not lost upon mister Crosbie and was put down by him in the tablets of his mind as quite undeserved He had endeavoured to avoid any mention of Lady Hartletop and her croquet ground and her ladyship s name had been forced upon him Nevertheless he liked Lily Dale through it all But he thought that he liked Bell the best though she said little for Bell was the beauty of the family During the game Bernard remembered that they had especially come over to bid the three ladies to dinner at the house on that day They had all dined there on the day before and the girls uncle had now sent directions to them to come again I ll go and ask mamma about it said Bell who was out first And then she returned saying that she and her sister would obey their uncle s behest but that her mother would prefer to remain at home There are the peas to be eaten you know said Lily Send them up to the Great House said Bernard Hopkins would not allow it said Lily He calls that a mixing of things Hopkins doesn t like mixings And then when the game was over they sauntered about out of the small garden into the larger one and through the shrubberies and out upon the fields where they found the still lingering remnants of the haymaking And Lily took a rake and raked for two minutes and mister Crosbie making an attempt to pitch the hay into the cart had to pay half a crown for his footing to the haymakers and Bell sat quiet under a tree mindful of her complexion whereupon mister Crosbie finding the hay pitching not much to his taste threw himself under the same tree also quite after the manner of Apollo as Lily said to her mother late in the evening Then Bernard covered Lily with hay which was a great feat in the jocose way for him and Lily in returning the compliment almost smothered mister Crosbie by accident Oh Lily said Bell I m sure I beg your pardon mister Crosbie It was Bernard s fault Bernard I never will come into a hayfield with you again And so they all became very intimate while Bell sat quietly under the tree listening to a word or two now and then as mister Crosbie chose to speak them There is a kind of enjoyment to be had in society in which very few words are necessary Bell was less vivacious than her sister Lily and when an hour after this she was dressing herself for dinner she acknowledged that she had passed a pleasant afternoon though mister Crosbie had not said very much CHAPTER III THE WIDOW DALE OF ALLINGTON As missus Dale of the Small House was not a Dale by birth there can be no necessity for insisting on the fact that none of the Dale peculiarities should be sought for in her character These peculiarities were not perhaps very conspicuous in her daughters who had taken more in that respect from their mother than from their father but a close observer might recognize the girls as Dales They were constant perhaps obstinate occasionally a little uncharitable in their judgment and prone to think that there was a great deal in being a Dale though not prone to say much about it But they had also a better pride than this which had come to them as their mother s heritage missus Dale was certainly a proud woman not that there was anything appertaining to herself in which she took a pride In birth she had been much lower than her husband seeing that her grandfather had been almost nobody Her fortune had been considerable for her rank in life and on its proceeds she now mainly depended but it had not been sufficient to give any of the pride of wealth And she had been a beauty according to my taste was still very lovely but certainly at this time of life she a widow of fifteen years standing with two grown up daughters took no pride in her beauty Nor had she any conscious pride in the fact that she was a lady That she was a lady inwards and outwards from the crown of her head to the sole of her feet in head in heart and in mind a lady by education and a lady by nature a lady also by birth in spite of that deficiency respecting her grandfather I hereby state as a fact meo periculo And the squire though he had no special love for her had recognized this and in all respects treated her as his equal But her position was one which required that she should either be very proud or else very humble She was poor and yet her daughters moved in a position which belongs as a rule to the daughters of rich men only This they did as nieces of the childless squire of Allington and as his nieces she felt that they were entitled to accept his countenance and kindness without loss of self respect either to her or to them She would have ill done her duty as a mother to them had she allowed any pride of her own to come between them and such advantage in the world as their uncle might be able to give them On their behalf she had accepted the loan of the house in which she lived and the use of many of the appurtenances belonging to her brother in law but on her own account she had accepted nothing Her marriage with Philip Dale had been disliked by his brother the squire and the squire while Philip was still living had continued to show that his feelings in this respect were not to be overcome They never had been overcome and now though the brother in law and sister in law had been close neighbours for years living as one may say almost in the same family they had never become friends There had not been a word of quarrel between them They met constantly The squire had unconsciously come to entertain a profound respect for his brother s widow The widow had acknowledged to herself the truth of the affection shown by the uncle to her daughters But yet they had never come together as friends Of her own money matters missus Dale had never spoken a word to the squire Of his intention respecting the girls the squire had never spoken a word to the mother And in this way they had lived and were living at Allington The life which missus Dale led was not altogether an easy life was not devoid of much painful effort on her part The theory of her life one may say was this that she should bury herself in order that her daughters might live well above ground And in order to carry out this theory it was necessary that she should abstain from all complaint or show of uneasiness before her girls Their life above ground would not be well if they understood that their mother in this underground life of hers was enduring any sacrifice on their behalf It was needful that they should think that the picking of peas in a sun bonnet or long readings by her own fire side and solitary hours spent in thinking were specially to her mind Mamma doesn t like going out I don t think mamma is happy anywhere out of her own drawing room I do not say that the girls were taught to say such words but they were taught to have thoughts which led to such words and in the early days of their going out into the world used so to speak of their mother But a time came to them before long to one first and then to the other in which they knew that it was not so and knew also all that their mother had suffered for their sakes And in truth missus Dale could have been as young in heart as they were She too could have played croquet and have coquetted with a haymaker s rake and have delighted in her pony ay and have listened to little nothings from this and that Apollo had she thought that things had been conformable thereto Women at forty do not become ancient misanthropes or stern Rhadamanthine moralists indifferent to the world s pleasures no not even though they be widows There are those who think that such should be the phase of their minds I profess that I do not so think I would have women and men also young as long as they can be young It is not that a woman should call herself in years younger than her father s family Bible will have her to be Let her who is forty call herself forty but if she can be young in spirit at forty let her show that she is so I think that missus Dale was wrong She would have joined that party on the croquet ground instead of remaining among the pea sticks in her sun bonnet had she done as I would have counselled her Not a word was spoken among the four that she did not hear Those pea sticks were only removed from the lawn by a low wall and a few shrubs She listened not as one suspecting but simply as one loving The voices of her girls were very dear to her and the silver ringing tones of Lily s tongue were as sweet to her ears as the music of the gods She heard all that about Lady Hartletop and shuddered at Lily s bold sarcasm And she heard Lily say that mamma would stay at home and eat the peas and said to herself sadly that that was now her lot in life Dear darling girl and so it should be It was thus her thoughts ran And then when her ear had traced them as they passed across the little bridge into the other grounds she returned across the lawn to the house with her burden on her arm and sat herself down on the step of the drawing room window looking out on the sweet summer flowers and the smooth surface of the grass before her Had not God done well for her to place her where she was Had not her lines been set for her in pleasant places Was she not happy in her girls her sweet loving trusting trusty children As it was to be that her lord that best half of herself was to be taken from her in early life and that the springs of all the lighter pleasures were to be thus stopped for her had it not been well that in her bereavement so much had been done to soften her lot in life and give it grace and beauty Twas so she argued with herself and yet she acknowledged to herself that she was not happy She had resolved as she herself had said often to put away childish things and now she pined for those things which she so put from her As she sat she could still hear Lily s voice as they went through the shrubbery hear it when none but a mother s ears would have distinguished the sound Now that those young men were at the Great House it was natural that her girls should be there too The squire would not have had young men to stay with him had there been no ladies to grace his table But for her she knew that no one would want her there Now and again she must go as otherwise her very existence without going would be a thing disagreeably noticeable But there was no other reason why she should join the party nor in joining it would she either give or receive pleasure Let her daughters eat from her brother s table and drink of his cup They were made welcome to do so from the heart For her there was no such welcome as that at the Great House nor at any other house or any other table Mamma will stay at home to eat the peas And then she repeated to herself the words which Lily had spoken sitting there leaning with her elbow on her knee and her head upon her hand Please ma am cook says can we have the peas to shell and then her reverie was broken ILLUSTRATION Please ma am can we have the peas to shell Whereupon missus Dale got up and gave over her basket Cook knows that the young ladies are going to dine at the Great House Yes ma am She needn t mind getting dinner for me I will have tea early And so after all missus Dale did not perform that special duty appointed for her But she soon set herself to work upon another duty When a family of three persons has to live upon an income of three hundred a year and nevertheless makes some pretence of going into society it has to be very mindful of small details even though that family may consist only of ladies Of this missus Dale was well aware and as it pleased her that her daughters should be nice and fresh and pretty in their attire many a long hour was given up to that care The squire would send them shawls in winter and had given them riding habits and had sent them down brown silk for dresses from London so limited in quantity that the due manufacture of two dresses out of the material had been found to be beyond the art of woman and the brown silk garments had been a difficulty from that day to this the squire having a good memory in such matters and being anxious to see the fruits of his liberality All this was doubtless of assistance but had the squire given the amount which he so expended in money to his nieces the benefit would have been greater As it was the girls were always nice and fresh and pretty they themselves not being idle in that matter but their tire woman in chief was their mother And now she went up to their room and got out their muslin frocks and but perhaps I should not tell such tales She however felt no shame in her work as she sent for a hot iron and with her own hands smoothed out the creases and gave the proper set to the crimp flounces and fixed a new ribbon where it was wanted and saw that all was as it should be Men think but little how much of this kind is endured that their eyes may be pleased even though it be but for an hour Oh mamma how good you are said Bell as the two girls came in only just in time to make themselves ready for returning to dinner Mamma is always good said Lily I wish mamma I could do the same for you oftener and then she kissed her mother But the squire was exact about dinner so they dressed themselves in haste and went off again through the garden their mother accompanying them to the little bridge Your uncle did not seem vexed at my not coming said missus Dale We have not seen him mamma said Lily We have been ever so far down the fields and forgot altogether what o clock it was I don t think uncle Christopher was about the place or we should have met him said Bell But I am vexed with you mamma Are not you Bell It is very bad of you to stay here all alone and not come I suppose mamma likes being at home better than up at the Great House said Bell very gently and as she spoke she was holding her mother s hand Well good by dears I shall expect you between ten and eleven But don t hurry yourselves if anything is going on And so they went and the widow was again alone The path from the bridge ran straight up towards the back of the Great House so that for a moment or two she could see them as they tripped on almost in a run And then she saw their dresses flutter as they turned sharp round up the terrace steps She would not go beyond the nook among the laurels by which she was surrounded lest any one should see her as she looked after her girls But when the last flutter of the pink muslin had been whisked away from her sight she felt it hard that she might not follow them She stood there however without advancing a step She would not have Hopkins telling how she watched her daughters as they went from her own home to that of her brother in law It was not within the capacity of Hopkins to understand why she watched them Well girls you re not much too soon I think your mother might have come with you said uncle Christopher And this was the manner of the man Had he known his own wishes he must have acknowledged to himself that he was better pleased that missus Dale should stay away He felt himself more absolutely master and more comfortably at home at his own table without her company than with it And yet he frequently made a grievance of her not coming and himself believed in that grievance I think mamma was tired said Bell Hem It s not so very far across from one house to the other If I were to shut myself up whenever I m tired But never mind Let s go to dinner mister Crosbie will you take my niece Lilian And then offering his own arm to Bell he walked off to the dining room If he scolds mamma any more I ll go away said Lily to her companion by which it may be seen that they had all become very intimate during the long day that they had passed together missus Dale after remaining for a moment on the bridge went in to her tea What succedaneum of mutton chop or broiled ham she had for the roast duck and green peas which were to have been provided for the family dinner we will not particularly inquire We may however imagine that she did not devote herself to her evening repast with any peculiar energy of appetite She took a book with her as she sat herself down some novel probably for missus Dale was not above novels and read a page or two as she sipped her tea But the book was soon laid on one side and the tray on which the warm plate had become cold was neglected and she threw herself back in her own familiar chair thinking of herself and of her girls and thinking also what might have been her lot in life had he lived who had loved her truly during the few years that they had been together It is especially the nature of a Dale to be constant in his likings and his dislikings Her husband s affection for her had been unswerving so much so that he had quarrelled with his brother because his brother would not express himself in brotherly terms about his wife but nevertheless the two brothers had loved each other always Many years had now gone by since these things had occurred but still the same feelings remained When she had first come down to Allington she had resolved to win the squire s regard but she had now long known that any such winning was out of the question indeed there was no longer a wish for it missus Dale was not one of those soft hearted women who sometimes thank God that they can love any one She could once have felt affection for her brother in law affection and close careful sisterly friendship but she could not do so now He had been cold to her and had with perseverance rejected her advances That was now seven years since and during those years missus Dale had been at any rate as cold to him as he had been to her But all this was very hard to bear That her daughters should love their uncle was not only reasonable but in every way desirable He was not cold to them To them he was generous and affectionate If she were only out of the way he would have taken them to his house as his own and they would in all respects have stood before the world as his adopted children Would it not be better if she were out of the way It was only in her most dismal moods that this question would get itself asked within her mind and then she would recover herself and answer it stoutly with an indignant protest against her own morbid weakness It would not be well that she should be away from her girls not though their uncle should have been twice a better uncle not though by her absence they might become heiresses of all Allington Was it not above everything to them that they should have a mother near them And as she asked of herself that morbid question wickedly asked it as she declared to herself did she not know that they loved her better than all the world beside and would prefer her caresses and her care to the guardianship of any uncle let his house be ever so great As yet they loved her better than all the world beside Of other love should it come she would not be jealous And if it should come and should be happy might there not yet be a bright evening of life for herself If they should marry and if their lords would accept her love her friendship and her homage she might yet escape from the deathlike coldness of that Great House and be happy in some tiny cottage from which she might go forth at times among those who would really welcome her A certain doctor there was living not very far from Allington at Guestwick as to whom she had once thought that he might fill that place of son in law to be well beloved Her quiet beautiful Bell had seemed to like the man and he had certainly done more than seem to like her But now for some weeks past this hope or rather this idea had faded away missus Dale had never questioned her daughter on the matter she was not a woman prone to put such questions But during the month or two last past she had seen with regret that Bell looked almost coldly on the man whom her mother favoured In thinking of all this the long evening passed away and at eleven o clock she heard the coming steps across the garden The young men had of course accompanied the girls home and as she stepped out from the still open window of her own drawing room she saw them all on the centre of the lawn before her There s mamma said Lily Mamma mister Crosbie wants to play croquet by moonlight I don t think there is light enough for that said missus Dale There is light enough for him said Lily for he plays quite independently of the hoops don t you mister Crosbie There s very pretty croquet light I should say said mister Crosbie looking up at the bright moon and then it is so stupid going to bed Yes it is stupid going to bed said Lily but people in the country are stupid you know Billiards that you can play all night by gas is much better isn t it Your arrows fall terribly astray there Miss Dale for I never touch a cue you should talk to your cousin about billiards Is Bernard a great billiard player asked Bell Well I do play now and again about as well as Crosbie does croquet Come Crosbie we ll go home and smoke a cigar Yes said Lily and then you know we stupid people can go to bed Mamma I wish you had a little smoking room here for us I don t like being considered stupid And then they parted the ladies going into the house and the two men returning across the lawn Lily my love said missus Dale when they were all together in her bedroom it seems to me that you are very hard upon mister Crosbie She has been going on like that all the evening said Bell I m sure we are very good friends said Lily Oh very said Bell Now Bell you re jealous you know you are And then seeing that her sister was in some slight degree vexed she went up to her and kissed her She shan t be called jealous shall she mamma I don t think she deserves it said missus Dale Now you don t mean to say that you think I meant anything said Lily As if I cared a buttercup about mister Crosbie Or I either Lily Of course you don t But I do care for him very much mamma He is such a duck of an Apollo I shall always call him Apollo Phoebus Apollo And when I draw his picture he shall have a mallet in his hand instead of a bow Upon my word I am very much obliged to Bernard for bringing him down here and I do wish he was not going away the day after to morrow The day after to morrow said missus Dale It was hardly worth coming for two days No it wasn t disturbing us all in our quiet little ways just for such a spell as that not giving one time even to count his rays But he says he shall perhaps come again said Bell There is that hope for us said Lily Uncle Christopher asked him to come down when he gets his long leave of absence This is only a short sort of leave He is better off than poor Johnny Eames Johnny Eames only has a month but mister Crosbie has two months just whenever he likes it and seems to be pretty much his own master all the year round besides And uncle Christopher asked him to come down for the shooting in September said Bell And though he didn t say he d come I think he meant it said Lily There is that hope for us mamma Then you ll have to draw Apollo with a gun instead of a mallet That is the worst of it mamma We shan t see much of him or of Bernard either They wouldn t let us go out into the woods as beaters would they You d make too much noise to be of any use Should I I thought the beaters had to shout at the birds I should get very tired of shouting at birds so I think I ll stay at home and look after my clothes I hope he will come because uncle Christopher seems to like him so much said Bell I wonder whether a certain gentleman at Guestwick will like his coming said Lily And then as soon as she had spoken the words she looked at her sister and saw that she had grieved her Lily you let your tongue run too fast said missus Dale I didn t mean anything Bell said Lily I beg your pardon It doesn t signify said Bell Only Lily says things without thinking And then that conversation came to an end and nothing more was said among them beyond what appertained to their toilet and a few last words at parting But the two girls occupied the same room and when their own door was closed upon them Bell did allude to what had passed with some spirit Lily you promised me she said that you would not say anything more to me about doctor Crofts I know I did and I was very wrong I beg your pardon Bell and I won t do it again not if I can help it Not help it Lily But I m sure I don t know why I shouldn t speak of him only not in the way of laughing at you Of all the men I ever saw in my life I like him best And only that I love you better than I love myself I could find it in my heart to grudge you his Lily what did you promise just now Well after to night And I don t know why you should turn against him I have never turned against him or for him There s no turning about him He d give his left hand if you d only smile on him Or his right either and that s what I should like to see so now you ve heard it You know you are talking nonsense So I should like to see it And so would mamma too I m sure though I never heard her say a word about him In my mind he s the finest fellow I ever saw What s mister Apollo Crosbie to him And now as it makes you unhappy I ll never say another word about him As Bell wished her sister good night with perhaps more than her usual affection it was evident that Lily s words and eager tone had in some way pleased her in spite of their opposition to the request which she had made And Lily was aware that it was so CHAPTER IV missus ROPER S BOARDING HOUSE ILLUSTRATION untitled I have said that John Eames had been petted by none but his mother but I would not have it supposed on this account that John Eames had no friends There is a class of young men who never get petted though they may not be the less esteemed or perhaps loved They do not come forth to the world as Apollos nor shine at all keeping what light they may have for inward purposes Such young men are often awkward ungainly and not yet formed in their gait they straggle with their limbs and are shy words do not come to them with ease when words are required among any but their accustomed associates Social meetings are periods of penance to them and any appearance in public will unnerve them They go much about alone and blush when women speak to them In truth they are not as yet men whatever the number may be of their years and as they are no longer boys the world has found for them the ungraceful name of hobbledehoy Such observations however as I have been enabled to make on this matter have led me to believe that the hobbledehoy is by no means the least valuable species of the human race When I compare the hobbledehoy of one or two and twenty to some finished Apollo of the same age I regard the former as unripe fruit and the latter as fruit that is ripe Then comes the question as to the two fruits Which is the better fruit that which ripens early which is perhaps favoured with some little forcing apparatus or which at least is backed by the warmth of a southern wall or that fruit of slower growth as to which nature works without assistance on which the sun operates in its own time or perhaps never operates if some ungenial shade has been allowed to interpose itself The world no doubt is in favour of the forcing apparatus or of the southern wall The fruit comes certainly and at an assured period It is spotless speckless and of a certain quality by no means despicable The owner has it when he wants it and it serves its turn But nevertheless according to my thinking the fullest flavour of the sun is given to that other fruit is given in the sun s own good time if so be that no ungenial shade has interposed itself I like the smack of the natural growth and like it perhaps the better because that which has been obtained has been obtained without favour But the hobbledehoy though he blushes when women address him and is uneasy even when he is near them though he is not master of his limbs in a ball room and is hardly master of his tongue at any time is the most eloquent of beings and especially eloquent among beautiful women He enjoys all the triumphs of a Don Juan without any of Don Juan s heartlessness and is able to conquer in all encounters through the force of his wit and the sweetness of his voice But this eloquence is heard only by his own inner ears and these triumphs are the triumphs of his imagination The true hobbledehoy is much alone not being greatly given to social intercourse even with other hobbledehoys a trait in his character which I think has hardly been sufficiently observed by the world at large He has probably become a hobbledehoy instead of an Apollo because circumstances have not afforded him much social intercourse and therefore he wanders about in solitude taking long walks in which he dreams of those successes which are so far removed from his powers of achievement Out in the fields with his stick in his hand he is very eloquent cutting off the heads of the springing summer weeds as he practises his oratory with energy And thus he feeds an imagination for which those who know him give him but scanty credit and unconsciously prepares himself for that latter ripening if only the ungenial shade will some day cease to interpose itself Such hobbledehoys receive but little petting unless it be from a mother and such a hobbledehoy was John Eames when he was sent away from Guestwick to begin his life in the big room of a public office in London We may say that there was nothing of the young Apollo about him But yet he was not without friends friends who wished him well and thought much of his welfare And he had a younger sister who loved him dearly who had no idea that he was a hobbledehoy being somewhat of a hobbledehoya herself missus Eames their mother was a widow living in a small house in Guestwick whose husband had been throughout his whole life an intimate friend of our squire He had been a man of many misfortunes having begun the world almost with affluence and having ended it in poverty He had lived all his days in Guestwick having at one time occupied a large tract of land and lost much money in experimental farming and late in life he had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town and there had died some two years previously to the commencement of this story With no other man had mister Dale lived on terms so intimate and when mister Eames died mister Dale acted as executor under his will and as guardian to his children He had moreover obtained for John Eames that situation under the Crown which he now held And missus Eames had been and still was on very friendly terms with missus Dale The squire had never taken quite kindly to missus Eames whom her husband had not met till he was already past forty years of age But missus Dale had made up by her kindness to the poor forlorn woman for any lack of that cordiality which might have been shown to her from the Great House missus Eames was a poor forlorn woman forlorn even during the time of her husband s life but very wobegone now in her widowhood In matters of importance the squire had been kind to her arranging for her her little money affairs advising her about her house and income also getting for her that appointment for her son But he snubbed her when he met her and poor missus Eames held him in great awe missus Dale held her brother in law in no awe and sometimes gave to the widow from Guestwick advice quite at variance to that given by the squire In this way there had grown up an intimacy between Bell and Lily and the young Eames and either of the girls was prepared to declare that Johnny Eames was her own and well loved friend Nevertheless they spoke of him occasionally with some little dash of merriment as is not unusual with pretty girls who have hobbledehoys among their intimate friends and who are not themselves unaccustomed to the grace of an Apollo I may as well announce at once that John Eames when he went up to London was absolutely and irretrievably in love with Lily Dale He had declared his passion in the most moving language a hundred times but he had declared it only to himself He had written much poetry about Lily but he kept his lines safe under double lock and key When he gave the reins to his imagination he flattered himself that he might win not only her but the world at large also by his verses but he would have perished rather than exhibit them to human eye During the last ten weeks of his life at Guestwick while he was preparing for his career in London he hung about Allington walking over frequently and then walking back again but all in vain During these visits he would sit in missus Dale s drawing room speaking but little and addressing himself usually to the mother but on each occasion as he started on his long hot walk he resolved that he would say something by which Lily might know of his love When he left for London that something had not been said He had not dreamed of asking her to be his wife John Eames was about to begin the world with eighty pounds a year and an allowance of twenty more from his mother s purse He was well aware that with such an income he could not establish himself as a married man in London and he also felt that the man who might be fortunate enough to win Lily for his wife should be prepared to give her every soft luxury that the world could afford He knew well that he ought not to expect any assurance of Lily s love but nevertheless he thought it possible that he might give her an assurance of his love It would probably be in vain He had no real hope unless when he was in one of those poetic moods He had acknowledged to himself in some indistinct way that he was no more than a hobbledehoy awkward silent ungainly with a face unfinished as it were or unripe All this he knew and knew also that there were Apollos in the world who would be only too ready to carry off Lily in their splendid cars But not the less did he make up his mind that having loved her once it behoved him as a true man to love her on to the end One little word he had said to her when they parted but it had been a word of friendship rather than of love He had strayed out after her on to the lawn leaving Bell alone in the drawing room Perhaps Lily had understood something of the boy s feeling and had wished to speak kindly to him at parting or almost more than kindly There is a silent love which women recognize and which in some silent way they acknowledge giving gracious but silent thanks for the respect which accompanies it I have come to say good by Lily said Johnny Eames following the girl down one of the paths
5867_48852_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Good by John 
none	none	said she turning round You know how sorry we are to lose you But it s a great thing for you to be going up to London Well yes I suppose it is I d sooner remain here though What stay here doing nothing I am sure you would not Of course I should like to do something I mean You mean that it is painful to part with old friends and I m sure that we all feel that at parting with you But you ll have a holiday sometimes and then we shall see you Yes of course I shall see you then I think Lily I shall care more about seeing you than anybody Oh no John There ll be your own mother and sister Yes there ll be mother and Mary of course But I will come over here the very first day that is if you ll care to see me We shall care to see you very much You know that And dear John I do hope you ll be happy There was a tone in her voice as she spoke which almost upset him or I should rather say which almost put him up upon his legs and made him speak but its ultimate effect was less powerful
5712_48842_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you 
none	none	said he as he held her hand for a few happy seconds And I m sure I hope you ll always be happy Good by Lily Then he left her returning to the house and she continued her walk wandering down among the trees in the shrubbery and not showing herself for the next half hour How many girls have some such lover as that a lover who says no more to them than Johnny Eames then said to Lily Dale who never says more than that And yet when in after years they count over the names of all who have loved them the name of that awkward youth is never forgotten That farewell had been spoken nearly two years since and Lily Dale was then seventeen Since that time John Eames had been home once and during his month s holiday had often visited Allington But he had never improved upon that occasion of which I have told It had seemed to him that Lily was colder to him than in old days and he had become if anything more shy in his ways with her He was to return to Guestwick again during this autumn but to tell honestly the truth in the matter Lily Dale did not think or care very much for his coming Girls of nineteen do not care for lovers of one and twenty unless it be when the fruit has had the advantage of some forcing apparatus or southern wall John Eames s love was still as hot as ever having been sustained on poetry and kept alive perhaps by some close confidence in the ears of a brother clerk but it is not to be supposed that during these two years he had been a melancholy lover It might perhaps have been better for him had his disposition led him to that line of life Such however had not been the case He had already abandoned the flute on which he had learned to sound three sad notes before he left Guestwick and after the fifth or sixth Sunday he had relinquished his solitary walks along the towing path of the Regent s Park Canal To think of one s absent love is very sweet but it becomes monotonous after a mile or two of a towing path and the mind will turn away to Aunt Sally the Cremorne Gardens and financial questions I doubt whether any girl would be satisfied with her lover s mind if she knew the whole of it I say Caudle I wonder whether a fellow could get into a club This proposition was made on one of those Sunday walks by John Eames to the friend of his bosom a brother clerk whose legitimate name was Cradell and who was therefore called Caudle by his friends Get into a club Fisher in our room belongs to a club That s only a chess club I mean a regular club One of the swell ones at the West End said Cradell almost lost in admiration at the ambition of his friend I shouldn t want it to be particularly swell If a man isn t a swell I don t see what he gets by going among those who are But it is so uncommon slow at Mother Roper s Now missus Roper was a respectable lady who kept a boarding house in Burton Crescent and to whom missus Eames had been strongly recommended when she was desirous of finding a specially safe domicile for her son For the first year of his life in London John Eames had lived alone in lodgings but that had resulted in discomfort solitude and alas in some amount of debt which had come heavily on the poor widow Now for the second year some safer mode of life was necessary She had learned that missus Cradell the widow of a barrister who had also succeeded in getting her son into the Income tax Office had placed him in charge of missus Roper and she with many injunctions to that motherly woman submitted her own boy to the same custody And about going to church missus Eames had said to missus Roper I don t suppose I can look after that ma am missus Roper had answered conscientiously Young gentlemen choose mostly their own churches But they do go asked the mother very anxious in her heart as to this new life in which her boy was to be left to follow in so many things the guidance of his own lights They who have been brought up steady do so mostly He has been brought up steady missus Roper He has indeed And you won t give him a latch key Well they always do ask for it But he won t insist if you tell him that I had rather that he shouldn t have one missus Roper promised accordingly and Johnny Eames was left under her charge He did ask for the latch key and missus Roper answered as she was bidden But he asked again having been sophisticated by the philosophy of Cradell and then missus Roper handed him the key She was a woman who plumed herself on being as good as her word not understanding that any one could justly demand from her more than that She gave Johnny Eames the key as doubtless she had intended to do for missus Roper knew the world and understood that young men without latch keys would not remain with her I thought you didn t seem to find it so dull since Amelia came home said Cradell Amelia What s Amelia to me I have told you everything Cradell and yet you can talk to me about Amelia Roper Come now Johnny He had always been called Johnny and the name had gone with him to his office Even Amelia Roper had called him Johnny on more than one occasion before this You were as sweet to her the other night as though there were no such person as L D in existence John Eames turned away and shook his head Nevertheless the words of his friend were grateful to him The character of a Don Juan was not unpleasant to his imagination and he liked to think that he might amuse Amelia Roper with a passing word though his heart was true to Lilian Dale In truth however many more of the passing words had been spoken by the fair Amelia than by him missus Roper had been quite as good as her word when she told missus Eames that her household was composed of herself of a son who was in an attorney s office of an ancient maiden cousin named Miss Spruce who lodged with her and of mister Cradell The divine Amelia had not then been living with her and the nature of the statement which she was making by no means compelled her to inform missus Eames that the young lady would probably return home in the following winter A mister and missus Lupex had also joined the family lately and missus Roper s house was now supposed to be full And it must be acknowledged that Johnny Eames had in certain unguarded moments confided to Cradell the secret of a second weaker passion for Amelia She is a fine girl a deuced fine girl Johnny Eames had said using a style of language which he had learned since he left Guestwick and Allington mister Cradell also was an admirer of the fair sex and alas that I should say so missus Lupex at the present moment was the object of his admiration Not that he entertained the slightest idea of wronging mister Lupex a man who was a scene painter and knew the world mister Cradell admired missus Lupex as a connoisseur not simply as a man By heavens Johnny what a figure that woman has he said one morning as they were walking to their office Yes she stands well on her pins I should think she did If I understand anything of form said Cradell that woman is nearly perfect What a torso she has From which expression and from the fact that missus Lupex depended greatly upon her stays and crinoline for such figure as she succeeded in displaying it may perhaps be understood that mister Cradell did not understand much about form It seems to me that her nose isn t quite straight said Johnny Eames Now it undoubtedly was the fact that the nose on missus Lupex s face was a little awry It was a long thin nose which as it progressed forward into the air certainly had a preponderating bias towards the left side I care more for figure than face said Cradell But missus Lupex has fine eyes very fine eyes And knows how to use them too said Johnny Why shouldn t she And then she has lovely hair Only she never brushes it in the morning Do you know I like that kind of deshabille said Cradell Too much care always betrays itself But a woman should be tidy What a word to apply to such a creature as missus Lupex I call her a splendid woman And how well she was got up last night Do you know I ve an idea that Lupex treats her very badly She said a word or two to me yesterday that and then he paused There are some confidences which a man does not share even with his dearest friend I rather fancy it s quite the other way said Eames How the other way That Lupex has quite as much as he likes of missus L The sound of her voice sometimes makes me shake in my shoes I know I like a woman with spirit said Cradell Oh so do I But one may have too much of a good thing Amelia did tell me only you won t mention it Of course I won t She told me that Lupex sometimes was obliged to run away from her He goes down to the theatre and remains there two or three days at a time Then she goes to fetch him and there is no end of a row in the house The fact is he drinks said Cradell By George I pity a woman whose husband drinks and such a woman as that too Take care old fellow or you ll find yourself in a scrape I know what I m at Lord bless you I m not going to lose my head because I see a fine woman Or your heart either Oh heart There s nothing of that kind of thing about me I regard a woman as a picture or a statue I dare say I shall marry some day because men do but I ve no idea of losing myself about a woman I d lose myself ten times over for L D said Cradell That I would And yet I know I shall never have her I m a jolly laughing sort of fellow and yet do you know Caudle when that girl marries it will be all up with me It will indeed Do you mean that you ll cut your throat No I shan t do that I shan t do anything of that sort and yet it will be all up with me You are going down there in October why don t you ask her to have you With ninety pounds a year His grateful country had twice increased his salary at the rate of five pounds each year With ninety pounds a year and twenty allowed me by my mother She could wait I suppose I should ask her and no mistake If one is to love a girl it s no good one going on in that way It isn t much good certainly said Johnny Eames And then they reached the door of the Income tax Office and each went away to his own desk From this little dialogue it may be imagined that though missus Roper was as good as her word she was not
5618_48830_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 exactly 
none	none	the woman whom missus Eames would have wished to select as a protecting angel for her son But the truth I take to be this that protecting angels for widows sons at forty eight pounds a year paid quarterly are not to be found very readily in London missus Roper was not worse than others of her class She would much have preferred lodgers who were respectable to those who were not so if she could only have found respectable lodgers as she wanted them mister and missus Lupex hardly came under that denomination and when she gave them up her big front bedroom at a hundred a year she knew she was doing wrong And she was troubled too about her own daughter Amelia who was already over thirty years of age Amelia was a very clever young woman who had been if the truth must be told first young lady at a millinery establishment in Manchester missus Roper knew that missus Eames and missus Cradell would not wish their sons to associate with her daughter But what could she do She could not refuse the shelter of her own house to her own child and yet her heart misgave her when she saw Amelia flirting with young Eames I wish Amelia you wouldn t have so much to say to that young man Laws mother So I do If you go on like that you ll put me out of both my lodgers Go on like what mother If a gentleman speaks to me I suppose I m to answer him I know how to behave myself I believe And then she gave her head a toss Whereupon her mother was silent for her mother was afraid of her CHAPTER V ABOUT L D Apollo Crosbie left London for Allington on the thirty first of August intending to stay there four weeks with the declared intention of recruiting his strength by an absence of two months from official cares and with no fixed purpose as to his destiny for the last of those two months

5725-48803-0002	train-other-500	having before him when he left London no other fixed engagement than that which took him to Allington On the first of October we shall also find ourselves at Allington in company with Johnny Eames and Apollo Crosbie will still be there
5725-48803-0003	train-other-500	by no means to the comfort of our friend from the Income tax Office Johnny Eames cannot be called unlucky in that matter of his annual holiday seeing that he was allowed to leave London in October a month during which few chose to own that they remain in town
none	none	 For myself I always regard May as the best month for holiday making but then no Londoner cares to be absent in May 
5725-48803-0004	train-other-500	Young Eames though he lived in Burton Crescent and had as yet no connection with the West End had already learned his lesson in this respect Those fellows in the big room want me to take May he had said to his friend Cradell They must think I m uncommon green

none	none	 I shall go down by the mail train to morrow night he said to Amelia Roper 
5725-48803-0007	train-other-500	on the evening before his departure At that moment he was sitting alone with Amelia in missus Roper s back drawing room In the front room Cradell was talking to missus Lupex but as Miss Spruce was with them
5725-48803-0008	train-other-500	it may be presumed that mister Lupex need have had no cause for jealousy Yes said Amelia I know how great is your haste to get down to that fascinating spot
none	none	 I could not expect that you would lose one single hour in hurrying away from Burton Crescent Amelia Roper was a tall well grown young woman with dark hair and dark eyes 
5725-48803-0009	train-other-500	not handsome for her nose was thick and the lower part of her face was heavy but yet not without some feminine attractions Her eyes were bright but then also they were mischievous She could talk fluently enough but then also she could scold
none	none	 She could assume sometimes the plumage of a dove but then again she could occasionally ruffle her feathers like an angry kite 
5725-48803-0010	train-other-500	I am quite prepared to acknowledge that John Eames should have kept himself clear of Amelia Roper but then young men so frequently do those things which they should not do After twelve months up here in London one is glad to get away to one s own friends
5725-48803-0011	train-other-500	said Johnny Your own friends mister Eames What sort of friends Do you suppose I don t know Well no I don t think you do know
none	none	 L D 
5725-48803-0012	train-other-500	said Amelia showing that Lily had been spoken of among people who should never have been allowed to hear her name But perhaps after all no more than those two initials were known in Burton Crescent From the tone which was now used in naming them
5725-48803-0013	train-other-500	it was sufficiently manifest that Amelia considered herself to be wronged by their very existence L S D said Johnny attempting the line of a witty gay young spendthrift That s my love
5725-48803-0014	train-other-500	pounds shillings and pence and a very coy mistress she is Nonsense sir Don t talk to me in that way As if I didn t know where your heart was What right had you to speak to me if you had an L D down in the country
none	none	 It should be here declared on behalf of poor John Eames that he had not ever spoken to Amelia he had not spoken to her in any such phrase as her words seemed to imply 
5725-48803-0015	train-other-500	But then he had written to her a fatal note of which we will speak further before long and that perhaps was quite as bad or worse Ha ha ha laughed Johnny But the laugh was assumed and not assumed with ease
5725-48803-0016	train-other-500	Yes sir it s a laughing matter to you I dare say It is very easy for a man to laugh under such circumstances that is to say if he is perfectly heartless if he s got a stone inside his bosom instead of flesh and blood
5725-48803-0017	train-other-500	Some men are made of stone I know and are troubled with no feelings What is it you want me to say You pretend to know all about it and it wouldn t be civil in me to contradict you
5725-48803-0018	train-other-500	What is it I want You know very well what I want or rather I don t want anything What is it to me It is nothing to me about L D You can go down to Allington and do what you like for me Only
5725-48803-0019	train-other-500	I hate such ways What ways Amelia What ways Now look here Johnny I m not going to make a fool of myself for any man When I came home here three months ago and I wish I never had
5725-48803-0020	train-other-500	she paused here a moment waiting for a word of tenderness but as the word of tenderness did not come she went on
none	none	 but when I did come home I didn t think there was a man in all London could make me care for him that I didn t And now you re going away without so much as hardly saying a word to me 
5725-48803-0021	train-other-500	And then she brought out her handkerchief What am I to say when you keep on scolding me all the time Scolding you
none	none	 And me too No Johnny I ain t scolding you and don t mean to 
5725-48803-0022	train-other-500	If it s to be all over between us say the word and I ll take myself away out of the house before you come back again I ve had no secrets from you
none	none	 I can go back to my business in Manchester

none	none	 If L D is more to you than I am I won t stand in your way 
5725-48803-0024	train-other-500	Only say the word L D was more to him than Amelia Roper ten times more to him L D would have been everything to him and Amelia Roper was worse than nothing He felt all this at the moment
5725-48803-0025	train-other-500	and struggled hard to collect an amount of courage that would make him free Say the word said she rising on her feet before him and all between you and me shall be over I have got your promise but I d scorn to take advantage
5725-48803-0026	train-other-500	If Amelia hasn t got your heart she d despise to take your hand Only I must have an answer It would seem that an easy way of escape was offered to him
none	none	 but the lady probably knew that the way as offered by her was not easy to such an one as John Eames Amelia he said still keeping his seat Well sir You know I love you And about L D If you choose to believe all the nonsense that Cradell puts into your head I can t help it If you like to make yourself jealous about two letters it isn t my fault And you love me said she ILLUSTRATION And you love me said she Of course I love you 
5725-48803-0027	train-other-500	And then upon hearing these words Amelia threw herself into his arms As the folding doors between the two rooms were not closed
none	none	 and as Miss Spruce was sitting in her easy chair immediately opposite to them 
5725-48803-0028	train-other-500	it was probable that she saw what passed But Miss Spruce was a taciturn old lady
none	none	 not easily excited to any show of surprise or admiration 
5725-48803-0029	train-other-500	and as she had lived with missus Roper for the last twelve years she was probably well acquainted with her daughter s ways You ll be true to me said Amelia during the moment of that embrace true to me for ever
5725-48803-0030	train-other-500	Oh yes that s a matter of course said Johnny Eames And then she liberated him and the two strolled into the front sitting room I declare mister Eames said missus Lupex I m glad you ve come
5725-48803-0031	train-other-500	Here s mister Cradell does say such queer things Queer things said Cradell Now Miss Spruce I appeal to you Have I said any queer things If you did sir I didn t notice them said Miss Spruce
5725-48803-0032	train-other-500	I noticed them then said missus Lupex An unmarried man like mister Cradell has no business to know whether a married lady wears a cap or her own hair has he mister Eames I don t think I ever know
5725-48803-0033	train-other-500	said Johnny not intending any sarcasm on missus Lupex I dare say not sir said the lady We all know where your attention is riveted
none	none	 If you were to wear a cap my dear somebody would see the difference very soon 
5725-48803-0034	train-other-500	wouldn t they Miss Spruce I dare say they would said Miss Spruce If I could look as nice in a cap as you do missus Lupex I d wear one to morrow said Amelia who did not wish to quarrel with the married lady at the present moment
none	none	 There were occasions however on which missus Lupex and Miss Roper were by no means so gracious to each other 
5725-48803-0035	train-other-500	Does Lupex like caps
none	none	 asked Cradell If I wore a plumed helmet on my head it s my belief he wouldn t know the difference 
5725-48803-0036	train-other-500	nor yet if I had got no head at all That s what comes of getting married If you ll take my advice Miss Roper you ll stay as you are even though somebody should break his heart about it Wouldn t you Miss Spruce
5725-48803-0037	train-other-500	Oh as for me I m an old woman you know said Miss Spruce which was certainly true I don t see what any woman gets by marrying continued missus Lupex But a man gains everything
5725-48803-0038	train-other-500	He don t know how to live unless he s got a woman to help him But is love to go for nothing said Cradell Oh love I don t believe in love
none	none	 I suppose I thought I loved once but what did it come to after all Now there s mister Eames we all know he s in love It comes natural to me missus Lupex 
5725-48803-0039	train-other-500	I was born so said Johnny And there s Miss Roper one never ought to speak free about a lady but perhaps she s in love too Speak for yourself missus Lupex said Amelia There s no harm in saying that is there
5725-48803-0040	train-other-500	I m sure if you ain t you re very hard hearted for if ever there was a true lover I believe you ve got one of your own My if there s not Lupex s step on the stair What can bring him home at this hour If he s been drinking he ll come home as cross as anything
5725-48803-0041	train-other-500	Then mister Lupex entered the room and the pleasantness of the party was destroyed It may be said that neither missus Cradell nor missus Eames would have placed their sons in Burton Crescent if they had known the dangers into which the young men would fall
none	none	 Each it must be acknowledged was imprudent but each clearly saw the imprudence of the other Not a week before this Cradell had seriously warned his friend against the arts of Miss Roper 
5725-48803-0042	train-other-500	By George Johnny you ll get yourself entangled with that girl One always has to go through that sort of thing said Johnny Yes but those who go through too much of it never get out again
5725-48803-0043	train-other-500	Where would you be if she got a written promise of marriage from you Poor Johnny did not answer this immediately for in very truth Amelia Roper had such a document in her possession
none	none	 Where should I be said he Among the breaches of promise I suppose 
5725-48803-0044	train-other-500	Either that or else among the victims of matrimony
none	none	 My belief of you is that if you gave such a promise you d carry it out Perhaps I should said Johnny but I don t know 
5725-48803-0045	train-other-500	It s a matter of doubt what a man ought to do in such a case But there s been nothing of that kind yet Oh dear no
5712_48848_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear no

5725-48803-0046	train-other-500	Where would you be now with such a girl as that for your wife Such had been the caution given by Cradell to his friend And now just as he was starting for Allington Eames returned the compliment
5725-48803-0047	train-other-500	They had gone together to the Great Western station at Paddington and Johnny tendered his advice as they were walking together up and down the platform

5725-48803-0048	train-other-500	But I shall take care of myself There s nothing so safe as a little nonsense with a married woman Of course it means nothing you know between her and me I don t suppose it does mean anything
5725-48803-0049	train-other-500	But she s always talking about Lupex being jealous and if he was to cut up rough you wouldn t find it pleasant Cradell however seemed to think that there was no danger His little affair with missus Lupex was quite platonic and safe
5725-48803-0050	train-other-500	As for doing any real harm his principles as he assured his friend were too high missus Lupex was a woman of talent whom no one seemed to understand

5725-48803-0051	train-other-500	It was merely a study of character and nothing more Then the friends parted and Eames was carried away by the night mail train down to Guestwick

5725-48803-0052	train-other-500	how her maternal heart was rejoicing at seeing the improvement in his gait and the manliness of appearance imparted to him by his whiskers I need not describe at length Many of the attributes of a hobbledehoy had fallen from him
5725-48803-0053	train-other-500	and even Lily Dale might now probably acknowledge that he was no longer a boy All which might be regarded as good if only in putting off childish things he had taken up things which were better than childish On the very first day of his arrival
5725-48803-0054	train-other-500	he made his way over to Allington He did not walk on this occasion as he had used to do in the old happy days
none	none	 He had an idea that it might not be well for him to go into missus Dale s drawing room with the dust of the road on his boots 
5725-48803-0055	train-other-500	and the heat of the day on his brow So he borrowed a horse and rode over taking some pride in a pair of spurs which he had bought in Piccadilly and in his kid gloves which were brought out new for the occasion Alas alas
5725-48803-0056	train-other-500	I fear that those two years in London have not improved John Eames and yet I have to acknowledge that John Eames is one of the heroes of my story On entering missus Dale s drawing room he found missus Dale and her eldest daughter
5725-48803-0057	train-other-500	Lily at the moment was not there and as he shook hands with the other two of course he asked for her She is only in the garden said Bell She will be here directly She has walked across to the Great House with mister Crosbie said missus Dale
5725-48803-0058	train-other-500	but she is not going to remain She will be so glad to see you John We all expected you to day Did you said Johnny whose heart had been plunged into cold water at the mention of mister Crosbie s name
5725-48803-0059	train-other-500	He had been thinking of Lilian Dale ever since his friend had left him on the railway platform and as I beg to assure all ladies who may read my tale the truth of his love for Lily

5725-48803-0061	train-other-500	and now he heard that she was walking alone about the gardens with a strange gentleman That mister Crosbie was very grand and very fashionable he had heard but he knew no more of him Why should mister Crosbie be allowed to walk with Lily Dale And why should missus Dale mention the circumstance
none	none	 as though it were quite a thing of course

none	none	 Lily Dale was engaged to be married to mister Crosbie He knew that he should have spoken when he heard the tidings He knew that the moments of silence as they passed by told his secret to the two women before him

none	none	 And then without waiting for another word he escaped out of the drawing room CHAPTER VI BEAUTIFUL DAYS I am well aware that I have not as yet given any description of Bell and Lilian Dale and equally well aware that the longer the doing so is postponed the greater the difficulty becomes I wish it could be understood without any description that they were two pretty fair haired girls of whom Bell was the tallest and the prettiest whereas Lily was almost as pretty as her sister and perhaps was more attractive They were fair haired girls very like each other of whom I have before my mind s eye a distinct portrait which I fear I shall not be able to draw in any such manner as will make it distinct to others They were something below the usual height being slight and slender in all their proportions Lily was the shorter of the two but the difference was so trifling that it was hardly remembered unless the two were together And when I said that Bell was the prettier I should perhaps have spoken more justly had I simply declared that her features were more regular than her sister s The two girls were very fair so that the soft tint of colour which relieved the whiteness of their complexion was rather acknowledged than distinctly seen It was there telling its own tale of health as its absence would have told a tale of present or coming sickness and yet nobody could ever talk about the colour in their cheeks The hair of the two girls was so alike in hue and texture that no one not even their mother could say that there was a difference It was not flaxen hair and yet it was very light Nor did it approach to auburn and yet there ran through it a golden tint that gave it a distinct brightness of its own But with Bell it was more plentiful than with Lily and therefore Lily would always talk of her own scanty locks and tell how beautiful were those belonging to her sister Nevertheless Lily s head was quite as lovely as her sister s for its form was perfect and the simple braids in which they both wore their hair did not require any great exuberance in quantity Their eyes were brightly blue but Bell s were long and soft and tender often hardly daring to raise themselves to your face while those of Lily were rounder but brighter and seldom kept by any want of courage from fixing themselves where they pleased And Lily s face was perhaps less oval in its form less perfectly oval than her sister s The shape of the forehead was I think the same but with Bell the chin was something more slender and delicate But Bell s chin was unmarked whereas on her sister s there was a dimple which amply compensated for any other deficiency in its beauty Bell s teeth were more even than her sister s but then she showed her teeth more frequently Her lips were thinner and as I cannot but think less expressive Her nose was decidedly more regular in its beauty for Lily s nose was somewhat broader than it should have been It may therefore be understood that Bell would be considered the beauty by the family But there was perhaps more in the general impression made by these girls and in the whole tone of their appearance than in the absolute loveliness of their features or the grace of their figures There was about them a dignity of demeanour devoid of all stiffness or pride and a maidenly modesty which gave itself no airs In them was always apparent that sense of security which women should receive from an unconscious dependence on their own mingled purity and weakness These two girls were never afraid of men never looked as though they were so afraid And I may say that they had little cause for that kind of fear to which I allude It might be the lot of either of them to be ill used by a man but it was hardly possible that either of them should ever be insulted by one Lily as may perhaps have been already seen could be full of play but in her play she never so carried herself that any one could forget what was due to her And now Lily Dale was engaged to be married and the days of her playfulness were over It sounds sad this sentence against her but I fear that it must be regarded as true And when I think that it is true when I see that the sportiveness and kitten like gambols of girlhood should be over and generally are over when a girl has given her troth it becomes a matter of regret to me that the feminine world should be in such a hurry after matrimony I have however no remedy to offer for the evil and indeed am aware that the evil if there be an evil is not well expressed in the words I have used The hurry is not for matrimony but for love Then the love once attained matrimony seizes it for its own and the evil is accomplished And Lily Dale was engaged to be married to Adolphus Crosbie to Apollo Crosbie as she still called him confiding her little joke to his own ears And to her he was an Apollo as a man who is loved should be to the girl who loves him He was handsome graceful clever self confident and always cheerful when she asked him to be cheerful But he had also his more serious moments and could talk to her of serious matters He would read to her and explain to her things which had hitherto been too hard for her young intelligence His voice too was pleasant and well under command It could be pathetic if pathos were required or ring with laughter as merry as her own Was not such a man fit to be an Apollo to such a girl when once the girl had acknowledged to herself that she loved him She had acknowledged it to herself and had acknowledged it to him as the reader will perhaps say without much delay But the courtship had so been carried on that no delay had been needed All the world had smiled upon it When mister Crosbie had first come among them at Allington as Bernard s guest during those few days of his early visit it had seemed as though Bell had been chiefly noticed by him And Bell in her own quiet way had accepted his admiration saying nothing of it and thinking but very little Lily was heart free at the time and had ever been so No first shadow from Love s wing had as yet been thrown across the pure tablets of her bosom With Bell it was not so not so in absolute strictness Bell s story too must be told but not on this page But before Crosbie had come among them it was a thing fixed in her mind that such love as she had felt must be overcome and annihilated We may say that it had been overcome and annihilated and that she would have sinned in no way had she listened to vows from this new Apollo It is almost sad to think that such a man might have had the love of either of such girls but I fear that I must acknowledge that it was so Apollo in the plenitude of his power soon changed his mind and before the end of his first visit had transferred the distant homage which he was then paying from the elder to the younger sister He afterwards returned as the squire s guest for a longer sojourn among them and at the end of the first month had already been accepted as Lily s future husband It was beautiful to see how Bell changed in her mood towards Crosbie and towards her sister as soon as she perceived how the affair was going She was not long in perceiving it having caught the first glimpses of the idea on that evening when they both dined at the Great House leaving their mother alone to eat or to neglect the peas For some six or seven weeks Crosbie had been gone and during that time Bell had been much more open in speaking of him than her sister She had been present when Crosbie had bid them good by and had listened to his eagerness as he declared to Lily that he should soon be back again at Allington Lily had taken this very quietly as though it had not belonged at all to herself but Bell had seen something of the truth and believing in Crosbie as an earnest honest man had spoken kind words of him fostering any little aptitude for love which might already have formed itself in Lily s bosom But he is such an Apollo you know Lily had said He is a gentleman I can see that Oh yes a man can t be an Apollo unless he s a gentleman And he s very clever I suppose he is clever There was nothing more said about his being a mere clerk Indeed Lily had changed her mind on that subject Johnny Eames was a mere clerk whereas Crosbie if he was to be called a clerk at all was a clerk of some very special denomination There may be a great difference between one clerk and another A Clerk of the Council and a parish clerk are very different persons Lily had got some such idea as this into her head as she attempted in her own mind to rescue mister Crosbie from the lower orders of the Government service I wish he were not coming missus Dale had said to her eldest daughter I think you are wrong mamma But if she should become fond of him and then Lily will never become really fond of any man till he shall have given her proper reason And if he admires her why should they not come together But she is so young Bell She is nineteen and if they were engaged perhaps they might wait for a year or so But it s no good talking in that way mamma If you were to tell Lily not to give him encouragement she would not speak to him I should not think of interfering No mamma and therefore it must take its course For myself I like mister Crosbie very much So do I my dear And so does my uncle I wouldn t have Lily take a lover of my uncle s choosing I should hope not But it must be considered a good thing if she happens to choose one of his liking In this way the matter had been talked over between the mother and her elder daughter Then mister Crosbie had come and before the end of the first month his declared admiration for Lily had proved the correctness of her sister s foresight And during that short courtship all had gone well with the lovers The squire from the first had declared himself satisfied with the match informing missus Dale in his cold manner that mister Crosbie was a gentleman with an income sufficient for matrimony It would be close enough in London missus Dale had said He has more than my brother had when he married said the squire If he will only make her as happy as your brother made me while it lasted said missus Dale as she turned away her face to conceal a tear that was coming And then there was nothing more said about it between the squire and his sister in law The squire spoke no word as to assistance in money matters did not even suggest that he would lend a hand to the young people at starting as an uncle in such a position might surely have done It may well be conceived that missus Dale herself said nothing on the subject And indeed it may be conceived also that the squire let his intentions be what they might would not divulge them to missus Dale This was uncomfortable but the position was one that was well understood between them Bernard Dale was still at Allington and had remained there through the period of Crosbie s absence Whatever words missus Dale might choose to speak on the matter would probably be spoken to him but then Bernard could be quite as close as his uncle When Crosbie returned he and Bernard had of course lived much together and as was natural there came to be close discussion between them as to the two girls when Crosbie allowed it to be understood that his liking for Lily was becoming strong You know I suppose that my uncle wishes me to marry the elder one Bernard had said I have guessed as much And I suppose the match will come off She s a pretty girl and as good as gold Yes she is I don t pretend to be very much in love with her It s not my way you know But some of these days I shall ask her to have me and I suppose it ll all go right The governor has distinctly promised to allow me eight hundred a year off the estate and to take us in for three months every year if we wish it I told him simply that I couldn t do it for less and he agreed with me You and he get on very well together Oh yes There s never been any fal lal between us about love and duty and all that I think we understand each other and that s everything He knows the comfort of standing well with the heir and I know the comfort of standing well with the owner It must be admitted I think that there was a great deal of sound common sense about Bernard Dale What will he do for the younger sister asked Crosbie and as he asked the important question a close observer might have perceived that there was some slight tremor in his voice Ah that s more than I can tell you If I were you I should ask him The governor is a plain man and likes plain business I suppose you couldn t ask him No I don t think I could It is my belief that he will not let her go by any means empty handed Well I should suppose not But remember this Crosbie I can say nothing to you on which you are to depend Lily also is as good as gold and as you seem to be fond of her I should ask the governor if I were you in so many words what he intends to do Of course it s against my interest for every shilling he gives Lily will ultimately come out of my pocket But I m not the man to care about that as you know What might be Crosbie s knowledge on this subject we will not here inquire but we may say that it would have mattered very little to him out of whose pocket the money came so long as it went into his own When he felt quite sure of Lily having in fact received Lily s permission to speak to her uncle and Lily s promise that she would herself speak to her mother he did tell the squire what was his intention This he did in an open manly way as though he felt that in asking for much he also offered to give much I have nothing to say against it said the squire And I have your permission to consider myself as engaged to her If you have hers and her mother s Of course you are aware that I have no authority over her She would not marry without your sanction She is very good to think so much of her uncle said the squire and his words as he spoke them sounded very cold in Crosbie s ears After that Crosbie said nothing about money having to confess to himself that he was afraid to do so And what would be the use said he to himself wishing to make excuses for what he felt to be weak in his own conduct If he should refuse to give her a shilling I could not go back from it now And then some ideas ran across his mind as to the injustice to which men are subjected in this matter of matrimony A man has to declare himself before it is fitting that he should make any inquiry about a lady s money and then when he has declared himself any such inquiry is unavailing Which consideration somewhat cooled the ardour of his happiness Lily Dale was very pretty very nice very refreshing in her innocence her purity and her quick intelligence No amusement could be more deliciously amusing than that of making love to Lily Dale Her way of flattering her lover without any intention of flattery on her part had put Crosbie into a seventh heaven In all his experience he had known nothing like it You may be sure of this she had said I shall love you with all my heart and all my strength It was very nice but then what were they to live upon Could it be that he Adolphus Crosbie should settle down on the north side of the New Road as a married man with eight hundred a year If indeed the squire would be as good to Lily as he had promised to be to Bell then indeed things might be made to arrange themselves But there was no such drawback on Lily s happiness Her ideas about money were rather vague but they were very honest She knew she had none of her own but supposed it was a husband s duty to find what would be needful She knew she had none of her own and was therefore aware that she ought not to expect luxuries in the little household that was to be prepared for her She hoped for his sake that her uncle might give some assistance but was quite prepared to prove that she could be a good poor man s wife In the old colloquies on such matters between her and her sister she had always declared that some decent income should be considered as indispensable before love could be entertained But eight hundred a year had been considered as doing much more than fulfilling this stipulation Bell had had high flown notions as to the absolute glory of poverty She had declared that income should not be considered at all If she had loved a man she could allow herself to be engaged to him even though he had no income Such had been their theories and as regarded money Lily was quite contented with the way in which she had carried out her own In these beautiful days there was nothing to check her happiness Her mother and sister united in telling her that she had done well that she was happy in her choice and justified in her love On that first day when she told her mother all she had been made exquisitely blissful by the way in which her tidings had been received Oh mamma I must tell you something she said coming up to her mother s bedroom after a long ramble with mister Crosbie through those Allington fields Is it about mister Crosbie Yes mamma And then the rest had been said through the medium of warm embraces and happy tears rather than by words As she sat in her mother s room hiding her face on her mother s shoulders Bell had come and had knelt at her feet Dear Lily she had said 
5712_48848_000043_000001	train-clean-360	I am so glad 
none	none	And then Lily remembered how she had as it were stolen her lover from her sister and she put her arms round Bell s neck and kissed her I knew how it was going to be from the very first said Bell Did I not mamma I m sure I didn t said Lily I never thought such a thing was possible But we did mamma and I Did you said Lily Bell told me that it was to be so said missus Dale But I could hardly bring myself at first to think that he was good enough for my darling Oh mamma you must not say that You must think that he is good enough for anything I will think that he is very good Who could be better And then when you remember all that he is to give up for my sake And what can I do for him in return What have I got to give him Neither missus Dale nor Bell could look at the matter in this light thinking that Lily gave quite as much as she received But they both declared that Crosbie was perfect knowing that by such assurances only could they now administer to Lily s happiness and Lily between them was made perfect in her happiness receiving all manner of encouragement in her love and being nourished in her passion by the sympathy and approval of her mother and sister And then had come that visit from Johnny Eames As the poor fellow marched out of the room giving them no time to say farewell missus Dale and Bell looked at each other sadly but they were unable to concoct any arrangement for Lily had run across the lawn and was already on the ground before the window As soon as we got to the end of the shrubbery there were uncle Christopher and Bernard close to us so I told Adolphus he might go on by himself And who do you think has been here said Bell But missus Dale said nothing Had time been given to her to use her own judgment nothing should have been said at that moment as to Johnny s visit Has anybody been here since I went Whoever it was didn t stay very long Poor Johnny Eames said Bell Then the colour came up into Lily s face and she bethought herself in a moment that the old friend of her young days had loved her that he too had had hopes as to his love and that now he had heard tidings which would put an end to such hopes She understood it all in a moment but understood also that it was necessary that she should conceal such understanding Dear Johnny she said Why did he not wait for me We told him you were out said missus Dale He will be here again before long no doubt And he knows Yes I thought you would not object to my telling him No mamma of course not And he has gone back to Guestwick There was no answer given to this question nor were there any further words then spoken about Johnny Eames Each of these women understood exactly how the matter stood and each knew that the others understood it The young man was loved by them all but not loved with that sort of admiring affection which had been accorded to mister Crosbie Johnny Eames could not have been accepted as a suitor by their pet missus Dale and Bell both felt that And yet they loved him for his love and for that distant modest respect which had restrained him from any speech regarding it Poor Johnny But he was young hardly as yet out of his hobbledehoyhood and he would easily recover this blow remembering and perhaps feeling to his advantage some slight touch of its passing romance It is thus women think of men who love young and love in vain But Johnny Eames himself as he rode back to Guestwick forgetful of his spurs and with his gloves stuffed into his pocket thought of the matter very differently He had never promised to himself any success as to his passion for Lily and had indeed always acknowledged that he could have no hope but now that she was actually promised to another man and as good as married he was not the less broken hearted because his former hopes had not been high He had never dared to speak to Lily of his love but he was conscious that she knew it and he did not now dare to stand before her as one convicted of having loved in vain And then as he rode back he thought also of his other love not with many of those pleasant thoughts which Lotharios and Don Juans may be presumed to enjoy when they contemplate their successes I suppose I shall marry her and there ll be an end of me he said to himself as he remembered a short note which he had once written to her in his madness There had been a little supper at missus Roper s and missus Lupex and Amelia had made the punch After supper he had been by some accident alone with Amelia in the dining parlour and when warmed by the generous god he had declared his passion she had shaken her head mournfully and had fled from him to some upper region absolutely refusing his proffered embrace But on the same night before his head had found its pillow a note had come to him half repentant half affectionate half repellent If indeed he would swear to her that his love was honest and manly then indeed she might even yet see him through the chink of the doorway with the purport of telling him that he was forgiven Whereupon a perfidious pencil being near to his hand he had written the requisite words My only object in life is to call you my own for ever Amelia had her misgivings whether such a promise in order that it might be used as legal evidence should not have been written in ink It was a painful doubt but nevertheless she was as good as her word and saw him through the chink forgiving him for his impetuosity in the parlour with perhaps more clemency than a mere pardon required By George how well she looked with her hair all loose he said to himself as he at last regained his pillow still warm with the generous god But now as he thought of that night returning on his road from Allington to Guestwick those loose floating locks were remembered by him with no strong feeling as to their charms And he thought also of Lily Dale as she was when he had said farewell to her on that day before he first went up to London I shall care more about seeing you than anybody he had said and he had often thought of the words since wondering whether she had understood them as meaning more than an assurance of ordinary friendship And he remembered well the dress she had then worn It was an old brown merino which he had known before and which in truth had nothing in it to recommend it specially to a lover s notice Horrid old thing had been Lily s own verdict respecting the frock even before that day But she had hallowed it in his eyes and he would have been only too happy to have worn a shred of it near his heart as a talisman How wonderful in its nature is that passion of which men speak when they acknowledge to themselves that they are in love Of all things it is under one condition the most foul and under another the most fair As that condition is a man shows himself either as a beast or as a god And so we will let poor Johnny Eames ride back to Guestwick suffering much in that he had loved basely and suffering much also in that he had loved nobly Lily as she had tripped along through the shrubbery under her lover s arm looking up every other moment into his face had espied her uncle and Bernard Stop she had said giving him a little pull at the arm I won t go on Uncle is always teasing me with some old fashioned wit And I ve had quite enough of you to day sir Mind you come over to morrow before you go to your shooting And so she had left him We may as well learn here what was the question in dispute between the uncle and cousin as they were walking there on the broad gravel path behind the Great House Bernard the old man had said I wish this matter could be settled between you and Bell Is there any hurry about it sir Yes there is hurry or rather as I hate hurry in all things I would say that there is ground for despatch Mind I do not wish to drive you If you do not like your cousin say so But I do like her only I have a sort of feeling that these things grow best by degrees I quite share your dislike to being in a hurry But time enough has been taken now You see Bernard I am going to make a great sacrifice of income on your behalf I am sure I am very grateful I have no children and have therefore always regarded you as my own But there is no reason why my brother Philip s daughter should not be as dear to me as my brother Orlando s son Of course not sir or rather his two daughters You may leave that matter to me Bernard The younger girl is going to marry this friend of yours and as he has a sufficient income to support a wife I think that my sister in law has good reason to be satisfied by the match She will not be expected to give up any part of her small income as she must have done had Lily married a poor man I suppose she could hardly give up much People must be guided by circumstances I am not disposed to put myself in the place of a parent to them both There is no reason why I should and I will not encourage false hopes If I knew that this matter between you and Bell was arranged I should have reason to feel satisfied with what I was doing From all which Bernard began to perceive that poor Crosbie s expectations in the matter of money would not probably receive much gratification But he also perceived or thought that he perceived a kind of threat in this warning from his uncle I have promised you eight hundred a year with your wife the warning seemed to say But if you do not at once accept it or let me feel that it will be accepted it may be well for me to change my mind especially as this other niece is about to be married If I am to give you so large a fortune with Bell I need do nothing for Lily But if you do not choose to take Bell and the fortune why then And so on It was thus that Bernard read his uncle s caution as they walked together on the broad gravel path I have no desire to postpone the matter any longer said Bernard I will propose to Bell at once if you wish it If your mind be quite made up I cannot see why you should delay it And then having thus arranged that matter they received their future relative with kind smiles and soft words CHAPTER VII THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLES ILLUSTRATION untitled Lily as she parted with her lover in the garden had required of him to attend upon her the next morning as he went to his shooting and in obedience to this command he appeared on missus Dale s lawn after breakfast accompanied by Bernard and two dogs The men had guns in their hands and were got up with all proper sporting appurtenances but it so turned out that they did not reach the stubble fields on the farther side of the road until after luncheon And may it not be fairly doubted whether croquet is not as good as shooting when a man is in love It will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love but they who bring such accusation against him will bring it falsely He was in love with his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion It was not his nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily but then neither would his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the charms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the Income tax Office Johnny was susceptible as the word goes whereas Captain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control He was not one to make a fool of himself about a girl or to die of a broken heart but nevertheless he would probably love his wife when he got a wife and would be a careful father to his children They were very intimate with each other now these four It was Bernard and Adolphus or sometimes Apollo and Bell and Lily among them and Crosbie found it to be pleasant enough A new position of life had come upon him and one exceeding pleasant but nevertheless there were moments in which cold fits of a melancholy nature came upon him He was doing the very thing which throughout all the years of his manhood he had declared to himself that he would not do According to his plan of life he was to have eschewed marriage and to have allowed himself to regard it as a possible event only under the circumstances of wealth rank and beauty all coming in his way together As he had expected no such glorious prize he had regarded himself as a man who would reign at the Beaufort and be potent at Sebright s to the end of his chapter But now It was the fact that he had fallen from his settled position vanquished by a silver voice a pretty wit and a pair of moderately bright eyes He was very fond of Lily having in truth a stronger capability for falling in love than his friend Captain Dale but was the sacrifice worth his while This was the question which he asked himself in those melancholy moments while he was lying in bed for instance awake in the morning when he was shaving himself and sometimes also when the squire was prosy after dinner At such times as these while he would be listening to mister Dale his self reproaches would sometimes be very bitter Why should he undergo this he Crosbie of Sebright s Crosbie of the General Committee Office Crosbie who would allow no one to bore him between Charing Cross and the far end of Bayswater why should he listen to the long winded stories of such a one as Squire Dale If indeed the squire intended to be liberal to his niece then it might be very well But as yet the squire had given no sign of such intention and Crosbie was angry with himself in that he had not had the courage to ask a question on that subject And thus the course of love was not all smooth to our Apollo It was still pleasant for him when he was there on the croquet ground or sitting in missus Dale s drawing room with all the privileges of an accepted lover It was pleasant to him also as he sipped the squire s claret knowing that his coffee would soon be handed to him by a sweet girl who would have tripped across the two gardens on purpose to perform for him this service There is nothing pleasanter than all this although a man when so treated does feel himself to look like a calf at the altar ready for the knife with blue ribbons round his horns and neck Crosbie felt that he was such a calf and the more calf like in that he had not as yet dared to ask a question about his wife s fortune I will have it out of the old fellow this evening he said to himself as he buttoned on his dandy shooting gaiters that morning How nice he looks in them Lily said to her sister afterwards knowing nothing of the thoughts which had troubled her lover s mind while he was adorning his legs I suppose we shall come back this way Crosbie said as they prepared to move away on their proper business when lunch was over Well not exactly said Bernard We shall make our way round by Darvell s farm and so back by Gruddock s Are the girls going to dine up at the Great House to day The girls declared that they were not going to dine up at the Great House that they did not intend going to the Great House at all that evening Then as you won t have to dress you might as well meet us at Gruddock s gate at the back of the farmyard We ll be there exactly at half past five That is to say we re to be there at half past five and you ll keep us waiting for three quarters of an hour said Lily Nevertheless the arrangement as proposed was made and the two ladies were not at all unwilling to make it It is thus that the game is carried on among unsophisticated people who really live in the country The farmyard gate at Farmer Gruddock s has not a fitting sound as a trysting place in romance but for people who are in earnest it does as well as any oak in the middle glade of a forest Lily Dale was quite in earnest and so indeed was Adolphus Crosbie only with him the earnest was beginning to take that shade of brown which most earnest things have to wear in this vale of tears With Lily it was as yet all rose coloured And Bernard Dale was also in earnest Throughout this morning he had stood very near to Bell on the lawn and had thought that his cousin did not receive his little whisperings with any aversion Why should she Lucky girl that she was thus to have eight hundred a year pinned to her skirt I say Dale Crosbie said as in the course of their day s work they had come round upon Gruddock s ground and were preparing to finish off his turnips before they reached the farm yard gate And now as Crosbie spoke they stood leaning on the gate looking at the turnips while the two dogs squatted on their haunches Crosbie had been very silent for the last mile or two and had been making up his mind for this conversation I say Dale your uncle has never said a word to me yet as to Lily s fortune As to Lily s fortune The question is whether Lily has got a fortune He can hardly expect that I am to take her without something Your uncle is a man of the world and he knows Whether or no my uncle is a man of the world I will not say but you are Crosbie whether he is or not Lily as you have always known has nothing of her own I am not talking of Lily s own I m speaking of her uncle I have been straightforward with him and when I became attached to your cousin I declared what I meant at once You should have asked him the question if you thought there was any room for such a question Thought there was any room Upon my word you are a cool fellow Now look here Crosbie you may say what you like about my uncle but you must not say a word against Lily Who is going to say a word against her You can little understand me if you don t know that the protection of her name against evil words is already more my care than it is yours I regard Lily as my own I only meant to say that any discontent you may feel as to her money or want of money you must refer to my uncle and not to the family at the Small House I am quite well aware of that And though you are quite at liberty to say what you like to me about my uncle I cannot say that I can see that he has been to blame He should have told me what her prospects are But if she have got no prospects It cannot be an uncle s duty to tell everybody that he does not mean to give his niece a fortune In point of fact why should you suppose that he has such an intention Do you know that he has not because you once led me to believe that he would give his niece money Now Crosbie it is necessary that you and I should understand each other in this matter But did you not Listen to me for a moment I never said a word to you about my uncle s intentions in any way until after you had become fully engaged to Lily with the knowledge of us all Then when my belief on the subject could make no possible difference in your conduct I told you that I thought my uncle would do something for her I told you so because I did think so and as your friend I should have told you what I thought in any matter that concerned your interest And now you have changed your opinion I have changed my opinion but very probably without sufficient ground That s hard upon me It may be hard to bear disappointment but you cannot say that anybody has ill used you And you don t think he will give her anything Nothing that will be of much moment to you And I m not to say that that s hard I think it confounded hard Of course I must put off my marriage Why do you not speak to my uncle I shall do so To tell the truth I think it would have come better from him but that is a matter of opinion I shall tell him very plainly what I think about it and if he is angry why I suppose I must leave his house that will be all Look here Crosbie do not begin your conversation with the purpose of angering him He is not a bad hearted man but is very obstinate I can be quite as obstinate as he is And then without further parley they went in among the turnips and each swore against his luck as he missed his birds There are certain phases of mind in which a man can neither ride nor shoot nor play a stroke at billiards nor remember a card at whist and to such a phase of mind had come both Crosbie and Dale after their conversation over the gate They were not above fifteen minutes late at the trysting place but nevertheless punctual though they had been the girls were there before them Of course the first inquiries were made about the game and of course the gentlemen declared that the birds were scarcer than they had ever been before that the dogs were wilder and their luck more excruciatingly bad to all which apologies very little attention was paid Lily and Bell had not come there to inquire after partridges and would have forgiven the sportsmen even though no single bird had been killed But they could not forgive the want of good spirits which was apparent I declare I don t know what s the matter with you Lily said to her lover We have been over fifteen miles of ground and I never knew anything so lackadaisical as you gentlemen from London Been over fifteen miles of ground Why uncle Christopher would think nothing of that Uncle Christopher is made of sterner stuff than we are said Crosbie They used to be born so sixty or seventy years ago And then they walked on through Gruddock s fields and the home paddocks back to the Great House where they found the squire standing in the front of the porch The walk had not been so pleasant as they had all intended that it should be when they made their arrangements for it Crosbie had endeavoured to recover his happy state of mind but had been unsuccessful and Lily fancying that her lover was not all that he should be had become reserved and silent Bernard and Bell had not shared this discomfiture but then Bernard and Bell were as a rule much more given to silence than the other two Uncle said Lily these men have shot nothing and you cannot conceive how unhappy they are in consequence It s all the fault of the naughty partridges ILLUSTRATION It s all the fault of the naughty partridges There are plenty of partridges if they knew how to get them said the squire The dogs are uncommonly wild said Crosbie They are not wild with me said the squire nor yet with Dingles Dingles was the squire s gamekeeper The fact is you young men nowadays expect to have dogs trained to do all the work for you It s too much labour for you to walk up to your game You ll be late for dinner girls if you don t look sharp We re not coming up this evening sir said Bell
5712_48842_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 And why not 
none	none	We re going to stay with mamma And why will not your mother come with you I ll be whipped if I can understand it One would have thought that under the present circumstances she would have been glad to see you all as much together as possible We re together quite enough said Lily And as for mamma I suppose she thinks And then she stopped herself catching the glance of Bell s imploring eye She was going to make some indignant excuse for her mother some excuse which would be calculated to make her uncle angry It was her practice to say such sharp words to him and consequently he did not regard her as warmly as her more silent and more prudent sister At the present moment he turned quickly round and went into the house and then with a very few words of farewell the two young men followed him The girls went back over the little bridge by themselves feeling that the afternoon had not gone off altogether well You shouldn t provoke him Lily said Bell And he shouldn t say those things about mamma It seems to me that you don t mind what he says Oh Lily No more you do He makes me so angry that I cannot hold my tongue He thinks that because all the place is his he is to say just what he likes Why should mamma go up there to please his humours You may be sure that mamma will do what she thinks best She is stronger minded than uncle Christopher and does not want any one to help her But Lily you shouldn t speak as though I were careless about mamma You didn t mean that I know Of course I didn t Then the two girls joined their mother in their own little domain but we will return to the men at the Great House Crosbie when he went up to dress for dinner fell into one of those melancholy fits of which I have spoken Was he absolutely about to destroy all the good that he had done for himself throughout the past years of his hitherto successful life or rather as he at last put the question to himself more strongly was it not the case that he had already destroyed all that success His marriage with Lily whether it was to be for good or bad was now a settled thing and was not regarded as a matter admitting of any doubt To do the man justice I must declare that in all these moments of misery he still did the best he could to think of Lily herself as of a great treasure which he had won as of a treasure which should and perhaps would compensate him for his misery But there was the misery very plain He must give up his clubs and his fashion and all that he had hitherto gained and be content to live a plain humdrum domestic life with eight hundred a year and a small house full of babies It was not the kind of Elysium for which he had tutored himself Lily was very nice very nice indeed She was as he said to himself by odds the nicest girl that he had ever seen Whatever might now turn up her happiness should be his first care But as for his own he began to fear that the compensation would hardly be perfect It is my own doing he said to himself intending to be rather noble in the purport of his soliloquy I have trained myself for other things very foolishly Of course I must suffer suffer damnably But she shall never know it Dear sweet innocent pretty little thing And then he went on about the squire as to whom he felt himself entitled to be indignant by his own disinterested and manly line of conduct towards the niece But I will let him know what I think about it he said It s all very well for Dale to say that I have been treated fairly It isn t fair for a man to put forward his niece under false pretences Of course I thought that he intended to provide for her And then having made up his mind in a very manly way that he would not desert Lily altogether after having promised to marry her he endeavoured to find consolation in the reflection that he might at any rate allow himself two years more run as a bachelor in London Girls who have to get themselves married without fortunes always know that they will have to wait Indeed Lily had already told him that as far as she was concerned she was in no hurry He need not therefore at once withdraw his name from Sebright s Thus he endeavoured to console himself still however resolving that he would have a little serious conversation with the squire that very evening as to Lily s fortune And what was the state of Lily s mind at the same moment while she also was performing some slight toilet changes preparatory to their simple dinner at the Small House I didn t behave well to him she said to herself I never do I forget how much he is giving up for me and then when anything annoys him I make it worse instead of comforting him And upon that she made accusation against herself that she did not love him half enough that she did not let him see how thoroughly and perfectly she loved him She had an idea of her own that as a girl should never show any preference for a man till circumstances should have fully entitled him to such manifestation so also should she make no drawback on her love but pour it forth for his benefit with all her strength when such circumstances had come to exist But she was ever feeling that she was not acting up to her theory now that the time for such practice had come She would unwittingly assume little reserves and make small pretences of indifference in spite of her own judgment She had done so on this afternoon and had left him without giving him her hand to press without looking up into his face with an assurance of love and therefore she was angry with herself I know I shall teach him to hate me she said out loud to Bell That would be very sad said Bell but I don t see it If you were engaged to a man you would be much better to him You would not say so much but what you did say would be all affection I am always making horrid little speeches for which I should like to cut out my tongue afterwards Whatever sort of speeches they are I think that he likes them Does he I m not all so sure of that Bell Of course I don t expect that he is to scold me not yet that is But I know by his eye when he is pleased and when he is displeased And then they went down to their dinner Up at the Great House the three gentlemen met together in apparent good humour Bernard Dale was a man of an equal temperament who rarely allowed any feeling or even any annoyance to interfere with his usual manner a man who could always come to table with a smile and meet either his friend or his enemy with a properly civil greeting Not that he was especially a false man There was nothing of deceit in his placidity of demeanour It arose from true equanimity but it was the equanimity of a cold disposition rather than of one well ordered by discipline The squire was aware that he had been unreasonably petulant before dinner and having taken himself to task in his own way now entered the dining room with the courteous greeting of a host I find that your bag was not so bad after all he said and I hope that your appetite is at least as good as your bag Crosbie smiled and made himself pleasant and said a few flattering words A man who intends to take some very decided step in an hour or two generally contrives to bear himself in the meantime as though the trifles of the world were quite sufficient for him So he praised the squire s game said a good natured word as to Dingles and bantered himself as to his own want of skill Then all went merry not quite as a marriage bell but still merry enough for a party of three gentlemen But Crosbie s resolution was fixed and as soon therefore as the old butler was permanently gone and the wine steadily in transit upon the table he began his task not without some apparent abruptness Having fully considered the matter he had determined that he would not wait for Bernard Dale s absence He thought it possible that he might be able to fight his battle better in Bernard s presence than he could do behind his back Squire he began They all called him squire when they were on good terms together and Crosbie thought it well to begin as though there was nothing amiss between them Squire of course I am thinking a good deal at the present moment as to my intended marriage That s natural enough said the squire Yes by George sir a man doesn t make a change like that without finding that he has got something to think of I suppose not said the squire I never was in the way of getting married myself but I can easily understand that I ve been the luckiest fellow in the world in finding such a girl as your niece Whereupon the squire bowed intending to make a little courteous declaration that the luck in the matter was on the side of the Dales I know that continued Crosbie She is exactly everything that a girl ought to be She is a good girl said Bernard Yes I think she is said the squire But it seems to me said Crosbie finding that it was necessary to dash at once headlong into the water that something ought to be said as to my means of supporting her properly Then he paused for a moment expecting that the squire would speak But the squire sat perfectly still looking intently at the empty fireplace and saying nothing Of supporting her continued Crosbie with all those comforts to which she has been accustomed She has never been used to expense said the squire Her mother as you doubtless know is not a rich woman But living here Lily has had great advantages a horse to ride and all that sort of thing I don t suppose she expects a horse in the park said the squire with a very perceptible touch of sarcasm in his voice
5618_48830_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope not 
none	none	said Crosbie I believe she has had the use of one of the ponies here sometimes but I hope that has not made her extravagant in her ideas I did not think that there was anything of that nonsense about either of them Nor is there as far as I know Nothing of the sort said Bernard But the long and the short of it is this sir and Crosbie as he spoke endeavoured to maintain his ordinary voice and usual coolness but his heightened colour betrayed that he was nervous Am I to expect any accession of income with my wife I have not spoken to my sister in law on the subject said the squire but I should fear that she cannot do much As a matter of course I would not take a shilling from her said Crosbie Then that settles it said the squire Crosbie paused a moment during which his colour became very red He unconsciously took up an apricot and eat it and then he spoke out Of course I was not alluding to missus Dale s income I would not on any account disturb her arrangements But I wished to learn sir whether you intend to do anything for your niece In the way of giving her a fortune Nothing at all I intend to do nothing at all Then I suppose we understand each other at last said Crosbie I should have thought that we might have understood each other at first said the squire Did I ever make you any promise or give you any hint that I intended to provide for my niece Have I ever held out to you any such hope I don t know what you mean by that word at last unless it be to give offence I meant the truth sir I meant this that seeing the manner in which your nieces lived with you I thought it probable that you would treat them both as though they were your daughters Now I find out my mistake that is all You have been mistaken and without a shadow of excuse for your mistake Others have been mistaken with me said Crosbie forgetting on the spur of the moment that he had no right to drag the opinion of any other person into the question What others said the squire with anger and his mind immediately betook itself to his sister in law I do not want to make any mischief said Crosbie If anybody connected with my family has presumed to tell you that I intended to do more for my niece Lilian than I have already done such person has not only been false but ungrateful I have given to no one any authority to make any promise on behalf of my niece No such promise has been made It was only a suggestion said Crosbie He was not in the least aware to whom the squire was alluding in his anger but he perceived that his host was angry and having already reflected that he should not have alluded to the words which Bernard Dale had spoken in his friendship he resolved to name no one Bernard as he sat by listening knew exactly how the matter stood but as he thought there could be no reason why he should subject himself to his uncle s ill will seeing that he had committed no sin No such suggestion should have been made said the squire No one has had a right to make such a suggestion No one has been placed by me in a position to make such a suggestion to you without manifest impropriety I will ask no further questions about it but it is quite as well that you should understand at once that I do not consider it to be my duty to give my niece Lilian a fortune on her marriage I trust that your offer to her was not made under any such delusion No sir it was not said Crosbie Then I suppose that no great harm has been done I am sorry if false hopes have been given to you but I am sure you will acknowledge that they were not given to you by me I think you have misunderstood me sir My hopes were never very high but I thought it right to ascertain your intentions Now you know them I trust for the girl s sake that it will make no difference to her I can hardly believe that she has been to blame in the matter Crosbie hastened at once to exculpate Lily and then with more awkward blunders than a man should have made who was so well acquainted with fashionable life as the Apollo of the Beaufort he proceeded to explain that as Lily was to have nothing his own pecuniary arrangements would necessitate some little delay in their marriage As far as I myself am concerned said the squire I do not like long engagements But I am quite aware that in this matter I have no right to interfere unless indeed and then he stopped himself I suppose it will be well to fix some day eh Crosbie said Bernard I will discuss that matter with missus Dale said Crosbie If you and she understand each other said the squire that will be sufficient Shall we go into the drawing room now or out upon the lawn That evening as Crosbie went to bed he felt that he had not gained the victory in his encounter with the squire CHAPTER VIII IT CANNOT BE On the following morning at breakfast each of the three gentlemen at the Great House received a little note on pink paper nominally from missus Dale asking them to drink tea at the Small House on that day week At the bottom of the note which Lily had written for mister Crosbie was added Dancing on the lawn if we can get anybody to stand up Of course you must come whether you like it or not And Bernard also Do your possible to talk my uncle into coming And this note did something towards re creating good humour among them at the breakfast table It was shown to the squire and at last he was brought to say that he would perhaps go to missus Dale s little evening party It may be well to explain that this promised entertainment had been originated with no special view to the pleasure of mister Crosbie but altogether on behalf of poor Johnny Eames What was to be done in that matter This question had been fully discussed between missus Dale and Bell and they had come to the conclusion that it would be best to ask Johnny over to a little friendly gathering in which he might be able to meet Lily with some strangers around them In this way his embarrassment might be overcome It would never do as missus Dale said that he should be suffered to stay away unnoticed by them When the ice is once broken he won t mind it said Bell And therefore early in the day a messenger was sent over to Guestwick who returned with a note from missus Eames saying that she would come on the evening in question with her son and daughter They would keep the fly and get back to Guestwick the same evening This was added as an offer had been made of beds for missus Eames and Mary Before the evening of the party another memorable occurrence had taken place at Allington which must be described in order that the feelings of the different people on that evening may be understood The squire had given his nephew to understand that he wished to have that matter settled as to his niece Bell and as Bernard s views were altogether in accordance with the squire s he resolved to comply with his uncle s wishes The project with him was not a new thing He did love his cousin quite sufficiently for purposes of matrimony and was minded that it would be a good thing for him to marry He could not marry without money but this marriage would give him an income without the trouble of intricate settlements or the interference of lawyers hostile to his own interests It was possible that he might do better but then it was possible also that he might do much worse and in addition to this he was fond of his cousin He discussed the matter within himself very calmly made some excellent resolutions as to the kind of life which it would behove him to live as a married man settled on the street in London in which he would have his house and behaved very prettily to Bell for four or five days running That he did not make love to her in the ordinary sense of the word must I suppose be taken for granted seeing that Bell herself did not recognize the fact She had always liked her cousin and thought that in these days he was making himself particularly agreeable On the evening before the party the girls were at the Great House having come up nominally with the intention of discussing the expediency of dancing on the lawn Lily had made up her mind that it was to be so but Bell had objected that it would be cold and damp and that the drawing room would be nicer for dancing You see we ve only got four young gentlemen and one ungrown said Lily and they will look so stupid standing up all properly in a room as though we had a regular party Thank you for the compliment said Crosbie taking off his straw hat So you will and we girls will look more stupid still But out on the lawn it won t look stupid at all Two or three might stand up on the lawn and it would be jolly enough I don t quite see it said Bernard Yes I think I see it said Crosbie The unadaptability of the lawn for the purpose of a ball Nobody is thinking of a ball said Lily with mock petulance I m defending you and yet you won t let me speak The unadaptability of the lawn for the purposes of a ball will conceal the insufficiency of four men and a boy as a supply of male dancers But Lily who is the ungrown gentleman Is it your old friend Johnny Eames Lily s voice became sobered as she answered him Oh no I did not mean mister Eames He is coming but I did not mean him Dick Boyce mister Boyce s son is only sixteen He is the ungrown gentleman And who is the fourth adult doctor Crofts from Guestwick I do hope you will like him Adolphus We think he is the very perfection of a man Then of course I shall hate him and be very jealous too And then that pair went off together fighting their own little battle on that head as turtle doves will sometimes do They went off and Bernard was left with Bell standing together over the ha ha fence which divides the garden at the back of the house from the field Bell he said they seem very happy don t they And they ought to be happy now oughtn t they Dear Lily I hope he will be good to her Do you know Bernard though he is your friend I am very very anxious about it It is such a vast trust to put in a man when we do not quite know him Yes it is but they ll do very well together Lily will be happy enough And he I suppose he ll be happy too He ll feel himself a little straightened as to income at first but that will all come round If he is not she will be wretched They will do very well Lily must be prepared to make the money go as far as she can that s all Lily won t feel the want of money It is not that But if he lets her know that she has made him a poor man then she will be unhappy Is he extravagant Bernard But Bernard was anxious to discuss another subject and therefore would not speak such words of wisdom as to Lily s engagement as might have been expected from him had he been in a different frame of mind No I should say not said he But Bell I do not know that we could have acted otherwise than we have done and yet I fear that we have been rash If he makes her unhappy Bernard I shall never forgive you But as she said this she put her hand lovingly upon his arm as a cousin might do and spoke in a tone which divested her threat of its acerbity You must not quarrel with me Bell whatever may happen I cannot afford to quarrel with you Of course I was not in earnest as to that You and I must never quarrel Bell at least I hope not I could bear to quarrel with any one rather than with you And then as he spoke there was something in his voice which gave the girl some slight indistinct warning of what might be his intention Not that she said to herself at once that he was going to make her an offer of his hand now on the spot but she felt that he intended something beyond the tenderness of ordinary cousinly affection I hope we shall never quarrel she said But as she spoke her mind was settling itself forming its resolution and coming to a conclusion as to the sort of love which Bernard might perhaps expect And it formed another conclusion as to the sort of love which might be given in return Bell he said you and I have always been dear friends Yes always Why should we not be something more than friends To give Captain Dale his due I must declare that his voice was perfectly natural as he asked this question and that he showed no signs of nervousness either in his face or limbs He had made up his mind to do it on that occasion and he did it without any signs of outward disturbance He asked his question and then he waited for his answer In this he was rather hard upon his cousin for though the question had certainly been asked in language that could not be mistaken still the matter had not been put forward with all that fulness which a young lady under such circumstances has a right to expect They had sat down on the turf close to the ha ha and they were so near that Bernard was able to put out his hand with the view of taking that of his cousin within his own But she contrived to keep her hands locked together so that he merely held her gently by the wrist I don t quite understand Bernard she said after a minute s pause Shall we be more than cousins Shall we be man and wife Now at least she could not say that she did not understand If the question was ever asked plainly Bernard Dale had asked it plainly Shall we be man and wife Few men I fancy dare to put it all at once in so abrupt a way and yet I do not know that the English language affords any better terms for the question Oh Bernard you have surprised me I hope I have not pained you Bell I have been long thinking of this but I am well aware that my own manner even to you has not been that of a lover It is not in me to smile and say soft things as Crosbie can But I do not love you the less on that account I have looked about for a wife and I have thought that if I could gain you I should be very fortunate He did not then say anything about his uncle and the eight hundred a year but he fully intended to do so as soon as an opportunity should serve He was quite of opinion that eight hundred a year and the good will of a rich uncle were strong grounds for matrimony were grounds even for love and he did not doubt but his cousin would see the matter in the same light You are very good to me more than good Of course I know that But oh Bernard I did not expect this a bit But you will answer me Bell Or if you would like time to think or to speak to my aunt perhaps you will answer me to morrow I think I ought to answer you now Not if it be a refusal Bell Think well of it before you do that I should have told you that our uncle wishes this match and that he will remove any difficulty there might be about money I do not care for money But as you were saying about Lily one has to be prudent Now in our marriage everything of that kind would be well arranged My uncle has promised me that he would at once allow us Stop Bernard You must not be led to suppose that any offer made by my uncle would help to purchase Indeed there can be no need for us to talk about money I wished to let you know the facts of the case exactly as they are And as to our uncle I cannot but think that you would be glad in such a matter to have him on your side Yes I should be glad to have him on my side that is if I were going But my uncle s wishes could not influence my decision The fact is Bernard Well dearest what is the fact I have always regarded you rather as a brother than as anything else But that regard may be changed No I think not Bernard I will go further and speak on at once It cannot be changed I know myself well enough to say that with certainty It cannot be changed You mean that you cannot love me Not as you would have me do I do love you very dearly very dearly indeed I would go to you in any trouble exactly as I would go to a brother And must that be all Bell Is not that all the sweetest love that can be felt But you must not think me ungrateful or proud I know well that you are are proposing to do for me much more than I deserve Any girl might be proud of such an offer But dear Bernard Bell before you give me a final answer sleep upon this and talk it over with your mother Of course you were unprepared and I cannot expect that you should promise me so much without a moment s consideration I was unprepared and therefore I have not answered you as I should have done But as it has gone so far I cannot let you leave me in uncertainty It is not necessary that I should keep you waiting In this matter I do know my own mind Dear Bernard indeed indeed it cannot be as you have proposed She spoke in a low voice and in a tone that had in it something of almost imploring humility but nevertheless it conveyed to her cousin an assurance that she was in earnest an assurance also that that earnest would not readily be changed Was she not a Dale And when did a Dale change his mind For a while he sat silent by her and she too having declared her intention refrained from further words For some minutes they thus remained looking down into the ha ha She still kept her old position holding her hands clasped together over her knees but he was now lying on his side supporting his head upon his arm with his face indeed turned towards her but with his eyes fixed upon the grass During this time however he was not idle His cousin s answer though it had grieved him had not come upon him as a blow stunning him for a moment and rendering him unfit for instant thought He was grieved more grieved than he had thought he would have been The thing that he had wanted moderately he now wanted the more in that it was denied to him But he was able to perceive the exact truth of his position and to calculate what might be his chances if he went on with his suit and what his advantage if he at once abandoned it I do not wish to press you unfairly Bell but may I ask if any other preference There is no other preference she answered And then again they were silent for a minute or two My uncle will be much grieved at this he said at last If that be all said Bell I do not think that we need either of us trouble ourselves He can have no right to dispose of our hearts I understand the taunt Bell Dear Bernard there was no taunt I intended none I need not speak of my own grief You cannot but know how deep it must be Why should I have submitted myself to this mortification had not my heart been concerned But that I will bear if I must bear it And then he paused looking up at her It will soon pass away she said I will accept it at any rate without complaint But as to my uncle s feelings it is open to me to speak and to you I should think to listen without indifference He has been kind to us both and loves us two above any other living beings It s not surprising that he should wish to see us married and it will not be surprising if your refusal should be a great blow to him I shall be sorry very sorry I also shall be sorry I am now speaking of him He has set his heart upon it and as he has but few wishes few desires so is he the more constant in those which he expresses When he knows this I fear that we shall find him very stern Then he will be unjust No he will not be unjust He is always a just man But he will be unhappy and will I fear make others unhappy Dear Bell may not this thing remain for a while unsettled You will not find that I take advantage of your goodness I will not intrude it on you again say for a fortnight or till Crosbie shall be gone No no no said Bell Why are you so eager in your noes There can be no danger in such delay I will not press you and you can let my uncle think that you have at least taken time for consideration There are things as to which one is bound to answer at once If I doubted myself I would let you persuade me But I do not doubt myself and I should be wrong to keep you in suspense Dear dearest Bernard it cannot be and as it cannot be you as my brother would bid me say so clearly It cannot be As she made this last assurance they heard the steps of Lily and her lover close to them and they both felt that it would be well that their intercourse should thus be brought to a close Neither had known how to get up and leave the place and yet each had felt that nothing further could then be said Did you ever see anything so sweet and affectionate and romantic said Lily standing over them and looking at them And all the while we have been so practical and worldly Do you know Bell that Adolphus seems to think we can t very well keep pigs in London It makes me so unhappy It does seem a pity said Crosbie for Lily seems to know all about pigs Of course I do I haven t lived in the country all my life for nothing Oh Bernard I should so like to see you rolled down into the bottom of the ha ha Just remain there and we ll do it between us Whereupon Bernard got up as did Bell also and they all went in to tea CHAPTER IX 
5720-48807-0000	train-other-500	missus DALE S LITTLE PARTY The next day was the day of the party
none	none	 Not a word more was said on that evening between Bell and her cousin at least not a word more of any peculiar note 
5720-48807-0001	train-other-500	and when Crosbie suggested to his friend on the following morning that they should both step down and see how the preparations were getting on at the Small House Bernard declined You forget my dear fellow that I m not in love as you are said he
5720-48807-0002	train-other-500	But I thought you were said Crosbie
none	none	 No not at all as you 
5720-48807-0003	train-other-500	are You are an accepted lover and will be allowed to do anything whip the creams and tune the piano if you know how
none	none	 I m only a half sort of lover 
5720-48807-0004	train-other-500	meditating a mariage de convenance to oblige an uncle and by no means required by the terms of my agreement to undergo a very rigid amount of drill Your position is just the reverse
5720-48807-0005	train-other-500	In saying all which Captain Dale was no doubt very false but if falseness can be forgiven to a man in any position it may be forgiven in that which he then filled
5720-48807-0006	train-other-500	So Crosbie went down to the Small House alone Dale wouldn t come said he speaking to the three ladies together I suppose he s keeping himself up for the dance on the lawn I hope he will be here in the evening said missus Dale
5720-48807-0007	train-other-500	But Bell said never a word She had determined that under the existing circumstances it would be only fair to her cousin that his offer and her answer to it
none	none	 should be kept secret She knew why Bernard did not come across from the Great House with his friend 
5720-48807-0008	train-other-500	but she said nothing of her knowledge Lily looked at her but looked without speaking
none	none	 and as for missus Dale she took no notice of the circumstance 
5720-48807-0009	train-other-500	Thus they passed the afternoon together without further mention of Bernard Dale and it may be said at any rate of Lily and Crosbie that his presence was not missed
none	none	 missus Eames with her son and daughter were the first to come 
5720-48807-0010	train-other-500	It is so nice of you to come early said Lily trying on the spur of the moment to say something which should sound pleasant and happy but in truth using that form of welcome which to my ears sounds always the most ungracious
5720-48807-0011	train-other-500	Ten minutes before the time named and of course you must have understood that I meant thirty minutes after it
5720-48807-0012	train-other-500	That is my interpretation of the words when I am thanked for coming early But missus Eames was a kind patient unexacting woman who took all civil words as meaning civility And indeed
none	none	 Lily had meant nothing else 
5720-48807-0013	train-other-500	Yes we did come early said missus Eames
none	none	 because Mary thought she would like to go up into the girls room and just settle her hair you know 
5720-48807-0014	train-other-500	So she shall said Lily who had taken Mary by the hand And we knew we shouldn t be in the way Johnny can go out into the garden if there s anything left to be done He shan t be banished unless he likes it said missus Dale
5720-48807-0015	train-other-500	If he finds us women too much for his unaided strength John Eames muttered something about being very well as he was and then got himself into an arm chair He had shaken hands with Lily trying as he did so
5720-48807-0016	train-other-500	to pronounce articulately a little speech which he had prepared for the occasion I have to congratulate you Lily and I hope with all my heart that you will be happy The words were simple enough and were not ill chosen but the poor young man
5720-48807-0017	train-other-500	never got them spoken The word congratulate did reach Lily s ears and she understood it all both the kindness of the intended speech and the reason why it could not be spoken Thank you John she said
none	none	 I hope I shall see so much of you in London It will be so nice to have an old Guestwick friend near me 
5720-48807-0018	train-other-500	She had her own voice and the pulses of her heart better under command than had he but she also felt that the occasion was trying to her The man had loved her honestly and truly still did love her paying her the
5720-48807-0019	train-other-500	great homage of bitter grief in that he had lost her
none	none	 Where is the girl who will not sympathize with such love and such grief if it be shown only because it cannot be concealed and be declared against the will of 
5720-48807-0020	train-other-500	him who declares it Then came in old missus Hearn whose cottage was not distant two minutes walk from the Small House She always called missus Dale my dear
5720-48807-0021	train-other-500	and petted the girls as though they had been children When told of Lily s marriage she had thrown up her hands with surprise for she had still left in some corner of her drawers remnants of sugar plums which she had bought for Lily
none	none	 A London man is he Well well I 
5720-48807-0022	train-other-500	wish he lived in the country Eight hundred a year my dear she had said to missus Dale That sounds nice down here because we are all so poor But I suppose eight hundred a year isn t very much up in London
5720-48807-0023	train-other-500	The squire s coming I suppose isn t he said missus Hearn as she seated herself on the sofa close to missus Dale Yes he ll be here by and by unless he changes his mind you know He doesn t stand on ceremony with me
5720-48807-0024	train-other-500	He change his mind When did you ever know Christopher Dale change his mind
none	none	 He is pretty constant missus Hearn 
5720-48807-0025	train-other-500	If he promised to give a man a penny he d give it But if he promised to take away a pound he d take it though it cost him years to get it He s going to turn me out of my cottage he says Nonsense missus Hearn Jolliffe came and told me
5720-48807-0026	train-other-500	Jolliffe I should explain was the bailiff that if I didn t like it as it was I might leave it and that the squire could get double the rent for it Now all I asked was that he should do a little painting in the kitchen and the wood is all as black as his hat
5720-48807-0027	train-other-500	I thought it was understood you were to paint inside
none	none	 How can I do it my dear with a hundred and forty pounds for everything I must live you know And he that has workmen about him every day of the year And was that a message to send to me 
5720-48807-0028	train-other-500	who have lived in the parish for fifty years Here he is And missus Hearn majestically raised herself from her seat as the squire entered the room With him
5720-48807-0029	train-other-500	entered mister and missus Boyce from the parsonage with Dick Boyce the ungrown gentleman and two girl Boyces who were fourteen and fifteen years of age
5720-48807-0030	train-other-500	missus Dale with the amount of good nature usual on such occasions asked reproachfully why Jane and Charles and Florence and Bessy did not come Boyce being a man who had his quiver full of them
5720-48807-0031	train-other-500	and missus Boyce giving the usual answer declared that she already felt that they had come as an avalanche
none	none	 But where are the the the young men asked Lily assuming a look of mock astonishment 
5720-48807-0032	train-other-500	They ll be across in two or three hours time said the squire They both dressed for dinner and as I thought made themselves very smart but for such a grand occasion as this
none	none	 they thought a second dressing necessary How do you do missus Hearn I hope you are quite well No rheumatism left eh This the squire said very loud into missus Hearn s ear missus Hearn was perhaps a little hard of hearing but it was very little and she hated to be thought deaf 
5720-48807-0033	train-other-500	She did not moreover like to be thought rheumatic This
none	none	 the squire knew and therefore his mode of address was not good natured You needn t make me jump so mister Dale I m pretty well now thank ye 
5720-48807-0034	train-other-500	I did have a twinge in the spring
none	none	 that cottage is so badly built for draughts I wonder you can live in it my sister said to me the last time she was over 
5720-48807-0035	train-other-500	I suppose I should be better off over with her
none	none	 at Hamersham only one doesn t like to move you know after living fifty years 
5720-48807-0036	train-other-500	in one parish You mustn t think of going away from us missus Boyce said speaking by no means loud but slowly and plainly hoping thereby to
5720-48807-0037	train-other-500	flatter the old woman But the old woman understood it all
none	none	 She s a sly creature is missus Boyce 
5720-48807-0038	train-other-500	missus Hearn said to missus Dale before the evening was out There are some old people whom it is very hard to flatter and with whom it is nevertheless almost impossible to live
5720-48807-0039	train-other-500	unless you do flatter them At last the two heroes came in across the lawn at the drawing room window and Lily as they entered
none	none	 dropped a low curtsey before them 
5720-48807-0040	train-other-500	gently swelling down upon the ground with her light muslin dress till she looked like some wondrous flower that had bloomed upon the carpet
5720-48807-0041	train-other-500	and putting her two hands with the backs of her fingers pressed together on the buckle of her girdle she said We are waiting upon your honours kind grace and feel how much we owe to you for favouring our poor abode
none	none	 And then she gently rose up again smiling oh so sweetly on the man she loved 
5720-48807-0042	train-other-500	and the puffings and swellings went out of her muslin I think there is nothing in the world so pretty
none	none	 as the conscious little tricks of love played off by a girl towards the man she loves when she has made up her mind boldly that all the world may know 
5720-48807-0043	train-other-500	that she has given herself away to him I am not sure that Crosbie liked it all as much as he should have done The bold assurance of her love when they two were alone together he did like
5720-48807-0044	train-other-500	What man does not like such assurances on such occasions But perhaps he would have been better pleased had Lily shown more reticence
none	none	 been more secret as it were as to her feelings when others were around them It was not that he accused her in his thoughts of any want of delicacy He read her character too well was if not quite aright in his reading of it at least too nearly so to admit of his making against her any such accusation as that It was the calf like feeling that was disagreeable to him He did not like to be presented even to the world of Allington as a victim caught for the sacrifice and bound with ribbon for the altar And then there lurked behind it all a feeling that it might be safer that the thing should not be so openly manifested before all the world Of course everybody knew that he was engaged to Lily Dale nor had he as he said to himself perhaps too frequently the slightest idea of breaking from that engagement But then the marriage might possibly be delayed He had not discussed that matter yet with Lily having indeed at the first moment of his gratified love created some little difficulty for himself by pressing for an early day I will refuse you nothing she had said to him but do not make it too 
5720-48807-0045	train-other-500	soon He saw therefore before him some little embarrassment and was inclined to wish that Lily would abstain from that manner which seemed to declare to all the world that she was about to be married immediately
5720-48807-0046	train-other-500	I must speak to her to morrow he said to himself as he accepted her salute with a mock gravity equal to her own Poor Lily How little she understood as yet what was passing through his mind Had she known his wish
none	none	 she would have wrapped up her love carefully in a napkin so that no one should have seen it no one but he when he might choose to have the treasure uncovered for his sight And it was all for his sake that she had been thus open in her ways She had seen girls who were half ashamed of their love 
5720-48807-0047	train-other-500	but she would never be ashamed of hers or of him She had given herself to him and now all the world might know it if all the world cared for such knowledge Why should she be ashamed of that which to her thinking was so great an honour to her
5720-48807-0048	train-other-500	She had heard of girls who would not speak of their love arguing to themselves cannily that there may be many a slip between the cup and the lip There could be no need of any such caution with her There could surely be no such slip
none	none	 Should there be such a fall 
5720-48807-0049	train-other-500	should any such fate either by falseness or misfortune come upon her no such caution could be of service to save her The cup would have been so shattered in its fall that no further piecing of its parts
5720-48807-0050	train-other-500	would be in any way possible So much as this she did not exactly say to herself but she
none	none	 felt it all and went bravely forward 
5720-48807-0051	train-other-500	bold in her love and careful to hide it from none who chanced to see it They had gone through the ceremony with the cake and teacups and had decided that at any rate the first dance or two
5720-48807-0052	train-other-500	should be held upon the lawn when the last of the guests arrived Oh Adolphus I am so glad he has come said Lily Do try to like him Of doctor Crofts who was the new comer
5720-48807-0053	train-other-500	she had sometimes spoken to her lover
none	none	 but she had never coupled her sister s name with that of the doctor even in speaking to him 
5720-48807-0054	train-other-500	Nevertheless Crosbie had in some way conceived the idea that this Crofts either had been or was or was to be in love with Bell
5720-48807-0055	train-other-500	and as he was prepared to advocate his friend Dale s claims in that quarter he was not particularly anxious to welcome the doctor as a thoroughly intimate
5720-48807-0056	train-other-500	friend of the family He knew nothing as yet of Dale s offer or of Bell s refusal but he was prepared for war if war should be necessary Of the squire at the present moment he was not very fond but
none	none	 if his destiny intended to give him a wife out of this family 
5720-48807-0057	train-other-500	he should prefer the owner of Allington and nephew of Lord De Guest as a brother in law to a village doctor as he took upon himself in his pride to call doctor Crofts
5720-48807-0058	train-other-500	It is very unfortunate said he but I never do like Paragons
none	none	 But you must like this Paragon Not that he is a Paragon at all 
5720-48807-0059	train-other-500	for he smokes and hunts and does all manner of wicked things And then she went forward to welcome her friend doctor Crofts was a slight spare man
5720-48807-0060	train-other-500	about five feet nine in height with very bright dark eyes a broad forehead with dark hair that almost curled but which did not come so forward over his brow as it should have done
5720-48807-0061	train-other-500	for purposes of beauty with a thin well cut nose and a mouth that would have been perfect had the lips been a little fuller The lower part of his face when seen alone
none	none	 had in it somewhat of sternness which however was redeemed by the brightness of his eyes And yet an artist would have declared that the lower features of his face 
5720-48807-0062	train-other-500	were by far the more handsome Lily went across to him and greeted him heartily declaring how glad she was to have him there
none	none	 And I must introduce you to mister Crosbie she said 
5720-48807-0063	train-other-500	as though she was determined to carry her point The two men shook hands with each other coldly without saying a word as young men are apt to do when they are brought together in that way Then they separated at once
5720-48807-0064	train-other-500	somewhat to the disappointment of Lily Crosbie stood off by himself both his eyes turned up towards the ceiling and looking as though he meant to give himself airs while Crofts got himself quickly up to the fireplace
none	none	 making civil little speeches 
5720-48807-0065	train-other-500	to missus Dale missus Boyce and missus Hearn And then at last he made his way round to Bell I am so glad he said to congratulate you on your sister s engagement Yes said Bell
5720-48807-0066	train-other-500	we knew that you would be glad to hear of her happiness Indeed I am glad and thoroughly hope that she may be happy You all like him do you not We like him very much And I am told that he is well off He is a very fortunate man
5720-48807-0067	train-other-500	very fortunate very fortunate Of course we think so said Bell Not however because he is rich No not because he is rich But because being worthy of such happiness
none	none	 his circumstances should enable him to marry and to enjoy it Yes exactly said Bell That is just it Then she sat down and in sitting down put an end to the conversation That is just it she had said 
5720-48807-0068	train-other-500	But as soon as the words were spoken she declared to herself that it was not so and that Crofts was wrong We love him she said to herself not because he is rich enough to marry without anxious thought but because he
5720-48807-0069	train-other-500	dares to marry although he is not rich And then she told herself that she was angry with the doctor After that doctor Crofts got off towards the door and stood there by himself leaning against the wall
5720-48807-0070	train-other-500	with the thumbs of both his hands stuck into the armholes of his waistcoat People said that he was a shy man I suppose he was shy and yet
none	none	 he was a man that was by no means afraid of doing anything that he had to do He could speak before a multitude without being abashed 
5720-48807-0071	train-other-500	whether it was a multitude of men or of women He could be very fixed too in his own opinion and eager if not violent in the prosecution of his purpose
5720-48807-0072	train-other-500	But he could not stand and say little words when he had in truth nothing to say He could not keep his ground when he felt that he was not using the ground upon which he stood
5720-48807-0073	train-other-500	He had not learned the art of assuming himself to be of importance in whatever place he might find himself It was this art which
none	none	 Crosbie had learned and by this art that he had flourished 
5720-48807-0074	train-other-500	So Crofts retired and leaned against the wall near the door and Crosbie came forward and shone like an Apollo among all the guests
none	none	 How 
5720-48807-0075	train-other-500	is it that he does it said John
none	none	 Eames to himself envying 
5720-48807-0076	train-other-500	the perfect happiness of the London man of fashion
none	none	 At last Lily got the dancers out upon the lawn 
5720-48807-0077	train-other-500	and then they managed to go through one quadrille But it was found that it did not answer The music of the single fiddle which Crosbie had hired from Guestwick was not
none	none	 sufficient for the purpose and then the grass though it was perfect for purposes of croquet 
5720-48807-0078	train-other-500	was not pleasant to the feet for dancing This is very nice said Bernard to his cousin I don t know anything that could be nicer but perhaps I know what you mean said Lily But I shall stay here
5720-48807-0079	train-other-500	There s no touch of romance about any of you Look at the moon there at the back of the steeple
none	none	 I don t mean to go in all night 
5720-48807-0080	train-other-500	Then she walked off by one of the paths and her lover went after her Don t you like the moon she said as she took his arm to which she was now so accustomed that she hardly thought of it as she took it
5720-48807-0081	train-other-500	Like the moon well I fancy I like the sun better I don t quite believe in moonlight I think it does best to talk about when one wants to be sentimental Ah that is just what I fear
5720-48807-0082	train-other-500	That is what I say to Bell when I tell her that her romance will fade as the roses do
none	none	 And then I shall have to learn that prose is more serviceable than poetry and that the mind is better than the heart and and that money is better than love It s all coming I know 
5720-48807-0083	train-other-500	and yet I do like the moonlight And the poetry and the love Yes
none	none	 The poetry much 
5720-48807-0084	train-other-500	and the love more To be loved by you
none	none	 is sweeter even than any of my dreams is better than all the poetry I have read Dearest Lily 
5720-48807-0085	train-other-500	and his unchecked arm stole round her waist It is the meaning of the moonlight
none	none	 and the essence of the poetry 
5720-48807-0086	train-other-500	continued the impassioned girl
none	none	 I did not know then why I liked such things but now I know 
5720-48807-0087	train-other-500	It was because I longed to be loved And to love Oh yes
none	none	 I would be nothing without that 
5720-48807-0088	train-other-500	But that you know is your delight
none	none	 or should be 
5720-48807-0089	train-other-500	The other is mine And yet it is a delight to love you to know that I may love you You mean that this is the realization of your romance Yes
none	none	 but it must not be the end of it Adolphus You must like the soft twilight and the long evenings when we shall be alone and you must read to me the books I love and you must not teach me to think that the world is hard and dry and cruel not yet I tell Bell so very often but you must not say so to me It shall not be dry and cruel if I can prevent it You understand what I mean dearest 
5720-48807-0090	train-other-500	I will not think it dry and cruel even though sorrow should come upon us if you I think you know what I mean If I am good to you I am not afraid of that I am not the least afraid of that
none	none	 You do not think that I could ever distrust you But you must not be ashamed to look at the moonlight and to read poetry and to To talk nonsense you mean 
5720-48807-0091	train-other-500	But as he said it he pressed her closer to his side and his tone was pleasant to her
none	none	 I suppose I m talking nonsense now she said pouting 
5720-48807-0092	train-other-500	You liked me better when I was talking about the pigs didn t you No I like you best now And why didn t you like me then Did I say anything to offend you I like you best now because
5720-48807-0093	train-other-500	They were standing in the narrow pathway of the gate leading from the bridge into the gardens of the Great House and the shadow of the thick spreading laurels
none	none	 was around them 
5720-48807-0094	train-other-500	But the moonlight still pierced brightly through the little avenue
none	none	 and she as she looked up to him could see the form of his face and the loving softness of his eye Because said he and then he stooped over her and pressed her closely while she put up her lips to his standing on tip toe that she might reach to his face Oh my love she said My love 
5720-48807-0095	train-other-500	my love As Crosbie walked back to the Great House that night he made a firm resolution that no consideration of worldly welfare should ever induce him
none	none	 to break his engagement with Lily Dale He went somewhat further also and determined that he would not put off the marriage for more than six or eight months or at the most ten if he could possibly 
5720-48807-0096	train-other-500	get his affairs arranged in that time To be sure he must give up
none	none	 everything all the aspirations and ambition of his life but then as he declared to himself somewhat mournfully he was prepared to do that Such were his resolutions and as he thought of them in bed he came to the conclusion that few men were less selfish than he was But what will they say to us for staying away said Lily recovering herself And I ought to be making the people dance you know Come along and do make yourself nice Do waltz with Mary Eames pray do If you don t I won t speak to you all night Acting under which threat Crosbie did on his return solicit the honour of that young lady s hand thereby 
5720-48807-0097	train-other-500	elating her into a seventh heaven of happiness What could the world afford
none	none	 better than a waltz with such a partner as Adolphus Crosbie 
5720-48807-0098	train-other-500	And poor Mary Eames could waltz well though she could not talk much as she danced
none	none	 and would pant a good deal when she stopped She put too much of her energy into the motion 
5720-48807-0099	train-other-500	and was too anxious to do the mechanical part of the work in a manner that should be satisfactory to her partner Oh thank you it s very nice I shall be able to go on again directly
5720-48807-0100	train-other-500	Her conversation with Crosbie did not get much beyond that and yet she felt that she had never done better than on this occasion
none	none	 Though there were at most not above five couples of dancers 
5720-48807-0101	train-other-500	and though they who did not dance such as the squire and mister Boyce and a curate from a neighbouring parish had in fact nothing to amuse them the affair was kept on very merrily
5720-48807-0102	train-other-500	for a considerable number of hours Exactly at twelve o clock there was a little supper
5720-48807-0103	train-other-500	which no doubt served to relieve missus Hearn s ennui and at which missus Boyce also seemed to enjoy herself As to the missus Boyces on such occasions I profess that I feel no pity
5720-48807-0104	train-other-500	They are generally happy in their children s happiness or if not they ought to be At any rate they are simply performing a manifest duty which duty in their time was performed on their behalf
5720-48807-0105	train-other-500	But on what account do the missus Hearns betake themselves to such gatherings Why did that ancient lady sit there hour after hour yawning longing for her bed looking every ten minutes at her watch
5720-48807-0106	train-other-500	while her old bones were stiff and sore and her old ears pained with the noise It could hardly have been simply for the sake of the supper After the supper however her maid took her across to her cottage
5720-48807-0107	train-other-500	and missus Boyce also then stole away home and the squire went off with some little parade suggesting to the young men that they should make no noise in the house as they returned
5720-48807-0108	train-other-500	But the poor curate remained talking a dull word every now and then to missus Dale and looking on with tantalized eyes at the joys which the world had prepared for others than him
none	none	 I must say that I think that public opinion and the bishops together are too hard upon curates in this particular 
5720-48807-0109	train-other-500	In the latter part of the night s delight when time and practice had made them all happy together John Eames stood up for the first time to dance with Lily She had done all she could short of asking him
5720-48807-0110	train-other-500	to induce him to do her this favour for she felt that it would be a favour How great had been the desire on his part to ask her and at the same time how great the repugnance
5720-48807-0111	train-other-500	Lily perhaps did not quite understand And yet she understood much of it
none	none	 She knew that he was not angry with her She knew that he was suffering from the injured pride of futile love almost as much as from the futile love itself She wished to put him at his ease in this but she did not quite give him credit for the full sincerity and the upright 
5720-48807-0112	train-other-500	uncontrolled heartiness of his feelings At length he did come up to her and though in truth she was engaged she at once accepted his offer Then she tripped across the room Adolphus she said
5720-48807-0113	train-other-500	I can t dance with you though I said I would John Eames has asked me and I haven t stood up with him before You understand and you ll be a good boy won t you
5720-48807-0114	train-other-500	Crosbie not being in the least jealous was a good boy and sat himself down to rest hidden behind a door For the first few minutes the conversation between Eames and Lily was of a very matter of fact kind
5720-48807-0115	train-other-500	She repeated her wish that she might see him in London and he said that of course he should come and call Then there was silence for a little while and they went through their figure dancing I don t at all know yet when we are to be married said Lily
5720-48807-0116	train-other-500	as soon as they were again standing together No I dare say not said Eames But not this year I suppose Indeed I should say of course not In the spring perhaps suggested Eames He had an unconscious desire
5720-48807-0117	train-other-500	that it might be postponed to some Greek kalends and yet he did not wish to injure Lily The reason I mention it is this that we should be so very glad if you could be here
5720-48807-0118	train-other-500	We all love you so much and I should so like to have you here on that day Why is it that girls so constantly do this so frequently ask men who have loved them to be present at their marriages
5720-48807-0119	train-other-500	with other men There is no triumph in it It is done in sheer kindness and affection They intend to offer something which shall soften
none	none	 and not aggravate the sorrow that they have caused 
5720-48807-0120	train-other-500	You can t marry me yourself the lady seems to say But the next greatest blessing which I can offer you shall be yours you shall see me married to somebody else I fully appreciate the intention but in honest truth
5720-48807-0121	train-other-500	I doubt the eligibility of the proffered entertainment On the present occasion John Eames seemed to be of this opinion for he did not at once accept the invitation Will you not oblige me so far as that
none	none	 said she softly I would do anything to oblige you said he gruffly 
5720-48807-0122	train-other-500	almost anything But not that No not that I could not do that Then he went off upon his figure and when they were next both standing together
5720-48807-0123	train-other-500	they remained silent till their turn for dancing had again come Why was it that after that night
none	none	 Lily thought more of John Eames than ever she had thought before 
5720-48807-0124	train-other-500	felt for him I mean a higher respect as for a man who had a will of his own And in that quadrille Crofts and Bell had been dancing together
5720-48807-0125	train-other-500	and they also had been talking of Lily s marriage A man may undergo what he likes for himself he had said but he has no right to make a woman undergo poverty Perhaps not said Bell
5720-48807-0126	train-other-500	That which is no suffering for a man which no man should think of for himself will make a hell on earth for a woman I suppose it would said Bell
5720-48807-0127	train-other-500	answering him without a sign of feeling in her face or voice But she took in every word that he spoke and disputed their truth inwardly with all the strength of her heart and mind and with the very vehemence of her soul
5720-48807-0128	train-other-500	As if a woman cannot bear more than a man she said to herself as she walked the length of the room alone
none	none	 when she had got herself free from the doctor s arm CHAPTER X missus LUPEX AND AMELIA ROPER ILLUSTRATION untitled I should simply mislead a confiding reader if I were to tell him that missus Lupex was an amiable woman Perhaps the fact that she was not amiable is the one great fault that should be laid to her charge but that fault had spread itself so widely and had cropped forth in so many different places of her life like a strong rank plant that will show itself all over a garden that it may almost be said that it made her odious in every branch of life and detestable alike to those who knew her little and to those who knew her much If a searcher could have got at the inside spirit of the woman that searcher would have found that she wished to go right that she did make or at any rate promise to herself that she would make certain struggles to attain decency and propriety But it was so natural to her to torment those whose misfortune brought them near to her and especially that wretched man who in an evil day had taken her to his bosom as his wife that decency fled from her and propriety would not live in her quarters missus Lupex was as I have already described her a woman not without some feminine attraction in the eyes of those who like morning negligence and evening finery and do not object to a long nose somewhat on one side She was clever in her way and could say smart things She could flatter also though her very flattery had always in it something that was disagreeable And she must have had some power of will as otherwise her husband would have escaped from her before the days of which I am writing Otherwise also she could hardly have obtained her footing and kept it in missus Roper s drawing room For though the hundred pounds a year either paid or promised to be paid was matter with missus Roper of vast consideration nevertheless the first three months of missus Lupex s sojourn in Burton Crescent were not over before the landlady of that house was most anxiously desirous of getting herself quit of her married boarders I shall perhaps best describe a little incident that had occurred in Burton Crescent during the absence of our friend Eames and the manner in which things were going on in that locality by giving at length two letters which Johnny received by post at Guestwick on the morning after missus Dale s party One was from his friend Cradell and the other from the devoted Amelia In this instance I will give that from the gentleman first presuming that I shall best consult my reader s wishes by keeping the greater delicacy till the last Income tax Office September one hundred eighty six MY DEAR JOHNNY We have had a terrible affair in the Crescent and I really hardly know how to tell you and yet I must do it for I want your advice You know the sort of standing that I was on with missus Lupex and perhaps you remember what we were saying on the platform at the station I have no doubt been fond of her society as I might be of that of any other friend I knew of course that she was a fine woman and if her husband chose to be jealous I couldn t help that But I never intended anything wrong and if it was necessary couldn t I call you as a witness to prove it I never spoke a word to her out of missus Roper s drawing room and Miss Spruce or missus Roper or somebody has always been there You know he drinks horribly sometimes but I do not think he ever gets downright drunk Well he came home last night about nine o clock after one of these bouts From what Jemima says Jemima was missus Roper s parlour maid I believe he had been at it down at the theatre for three days We hadn t seen him since Tuesday He went straight into the parlour and sent up Jemima to me to say that he wanted to see me missus Lupex was in the room and heard the girl summon me and jumping up she declared that if there was going to be blood shed she would leave the house There was nobody else in the room but Miss Spruce and she didn t say a word but took her candle and went upstairs You must own it looked very uncomfortable What was I to do with a drunken man down in the parlour However she seemed to think I ought to go If he comes up here said she I shall be the victim You little know of what that man is capable when his wrath has been inflamed by wine Now I think you are aware that I am not likely to be very much afraid of any man but why was I to be got into a row in such a way as this I hadn t done anything And then if there was to be a quarrel and anything was to come of it as she seemed to expect like bloodshed I mean or a fight or if he were to knock me on the head with the poker where should I be at my office A man in a public office as you and I are can t quarrel like anybody else It was this that I felt so much at the moment Go down to him said she unless you wish to see me murdered at your feet Fisher says that if what I say is true they must have arranged it all between them I don t think that for I do believe that she really is fond of me And then everybody knows that they never do agree about anything But she certainly did implore me to go down to him Well I went down and as I got to the bottom of the stairs where I found Jemima I heard him walking up and down the parlour Take care of yourself mister Cradell said the girl and I could see by her face that she was in a terrible fright At that moment I happened to see my hat on the hall table and it occurred to me that I ought to put myself into the hands of a friend Of course I was not afraid of that man in the dining room but should I have been justified in engaging in a struggle perhaps for dear life in missus Roper s house I was bound to think of her interests So I took up my hat and deliberately walked out of the front door Tell him said I to Jemima that I m not at home And so I went away direct to Fisher s meaning to send him back to Lupex as my friend but Fisher was at his chess club As I thought there was no time to be lost on such an occasion as this I went down to the club and called him out You know what a cool fellow Fisher is I don t suppose anything would ever excite him When I told him the story he said that he would sleep upon it and I had to walk up and down before the club while he finished his game Fisher seemed to think that I might go back to Burton Crescent but of course I knew that that would be out of the question So it ended in my going home and sleeping on his sofa and sending for some of my things in the morning I wanted him to get up and see Lupex before going to the office this morning But he said it would be better to put it off and so he will call upon him at the theatre immediately after office hours I want you to write to me at once saying what you know about the matter I ask you as I don t want to lug in any of the other people at Roper s It is very uncomfortable as I can t exactly leave her at once because of last quarter s money otherwise I should cut and run for the house is not the sort of place either for you or me You may take my word for that Master Johnny And I could tell you something too about A R only I don t want to make mischief But do you write immediately And now I think of it you had better write to Fisher so that he can show your letter to Lupex just saying that to the best of your belief there had never been anything between her and me but mere friendship and that of course you as my friend must have known everything Whether I shall go back to Roper s to night will depend on what Fisher says after the interview Good by old fellow I hope you are enjoying yourself and that L D is quite well Your sincere friend JOSEPH CRADELL John Eames read this letter over twice before he opened that from Amelia He had never yet received a letter from Miss Roper and felt very little of that ardour for its perusal which young men generally experience on the receipt of a first letter from a young lady The memory of Amelia was at the present moment distasteful to him and he would have thrown the letter unopened into the fire had he not felt it might be dangerous to do so As regarded his friend Cradell he could not but feel ashamed of him ashamed of him not for running away from mister Lupex but for excusing his escape on false pretences And then at last he opened the letter from Amelia Dearest John it began and as he read the words he crumpled the paper up between his fingers It was written in a fair female hand with sharp points instead of curves to the letters but still very legible and looking as though there were a decided purport in every word of it DEAREST JOHN It feels so strange to me to write to you in such language as this And yet you are dearest and have I not a right to call you so And are you not my own and am not I yours Again he crunched the paper up in his hand and as he did so he muttered words which I need not repeat at length But still he went on with his letter I know that we understand each other perfectly and when that is the case heart should be allowed to speak openly to heart Those are my feelings and I believe that you will find them reciprocal in your own bosom Is it not sweet to be loved I find it so And dearest John let me assure you with open candour that there is no room for jealousy in this breast with regard to you I have too much confidence for that I can assure you both in your honour and in my own I would say charms only you would call me vain You must not suppose that I meant what I said about L D Of course you will be glad to see the friends of your childhood and it would be far from your Amelia s heart to begrudge you such delightful pleasure Your friends will I hope some day be my friends Another crunch And if there be any one among them any real L D whom you have specially liked I will receive her to my heart specially also This assurance on the part of his Amelia was too much for him and he threw the letter from him thinking whence he might get relief whether from suicide or from the colonies but presently he took it up again and drained the bitter cup to the bottom And if I seemed petulant to you before you went away you must forgive your own Amelia I had nothing before me but misery for the month of your absence There is no one here congenial to my feelings of course not And you would not wish me to be happy in your absence would you I can assure you let your wishes be what they may I never can be happy again unless you are with me Write to me one little line and tell me that you are grateful to me for my devotion And now I must tell you that we have had a sad affair in the house and I do not think that your friend mister Cradell has behaved at all well You remember how he has been always going on with missus Lupex Mother was quite unhappy about it though she didn t like to say anything Of course when a lady s name is concerned it is particular But Lupex has become dreadful jealous during the last week and we all knew that something was coming She is an artful woman but I don t think she meant anything bad only to drive her husband to desperation He came here yesterday in one of his tantrums and wanted to see Cradell but he got frightened and took his hat and went off Now that wasn t quite right If he was innocent why didn t he stand his ground and explain the mistake As mother says it gives the house such a name Lupex swore last night that he d be off to the Income tax Office this morning and have Cradell out before all the commissioners and clerks and everybody If he does that it will get into the papers and all London will be full of it She would like it I know for all she cares for is to be talked about but only think what it will be for mother s house I wish you were here for your high prudence and courage would set everything right at once at least I think so I shall count the minutes till I get an answer to this and shall envy the postman who will have your letter before it will reach me Do write at once If I do not hear by Monday morning I shall think that something is the matter Even though you are among your dear old friends surely you can find a moment to write to your own Amelia Mother is very unhappy about this affair of the Lupexes She says that if you were here to advise her she should not mind it so much It is very hard upon her for she does strive to make the house respectable and comfortable for everybody I would send my duty and love to your dear mamma if I only knew her as I hope I shall do one day and to your sister and to L D also if you like to tell her how we are situated together So now no more from your Always affectionate sweetheart AMELIA ROPER Poor Eames did not feel the least gratified by any part of this fond letter but the last paragraph of it was the worst Was it to be endured by him that this woman should send her love to his mother and to his sister and even to Lily Dale He felt that there was a pollution in the very mention of Lily s name by such an one as Amelia Roper And yet Amelia Roper was as she had assured him his own Much as he disliked her at the present moment he did believe that he was her own He did feel that she had obtained a certain property in him and that his destiny in life would tie him to her He had said very few words of love to her at any time very few at least that were themselves of any moment but among those few there had undoubtedly been one or two in which he had told her that he loved her And he had written to her that fatal note Upon the whole would it not be as well for him to go out to the great reservoir behind Guestwick by which the Hamersham Canal was fed with its waters and put an end to his miserable existence On that same day he did write a letter to Fisher and he wrote also to Cradell As to those letters he felt no difficulty To Fisher he declared his belief that Cradell was innocent as he was himself as regarded missus Lupex I don t think he is the sort of man to make up to a married woman he said somewhat to Cradell s displeasure when the letter reached the Income tax Office for that gentleman was not averse to the reputation for success in love which the little adventure was as he thought calculated to give him among his brother clerks At the first bursting of the shell when that desperately jealous man was raging in the parlour incensed by the fumes both of wine and love Cradell had felt that the affair was disagreeably painful But on the morning of the third day for he had passed two nights on his friend Fisher s sofa he had begun to be somewhat proud of it and did not dislike to hear missus Lupex s name in the mouths of the other clerks When therefore Fisher read to him the letter from Guestwick he hardly was pleased with his friend s tone Ha ha ha said he laughing That s just what I wanted him to say Make up to a married woman indeed No I m the last man in London to do that sort of thing Upon my word Caudle I think you are said Fisher the very last man And then poor Cradell was not happy On that afternoon he boldly went to Burton Crescent and ate his dinner there Neither mister nor missus Lupex were to be seen nor were their names mentioned to him by missus Roper In the course of the evening he did pluck up courage to ask Miss Spruce where they were but that ancient lady merely shook her head solemnly and declared that she knew nothing about such goings on no not she But what was John Eames to do as to that letter from Amelia Roper He felt that any answer to it would be very dangerous and yet that he could not safely leave it unanswered He walked off by himself across Guestwick Common and through the woods of Guestwick Manor up by the big avenue of elms in Lord De Guest s park trying to resolve how he might rescue himself from this scrape Here over the same ground he had wandered scores of times in his earlier years when he knew nothing beyond the innocency of his country home thinking of Lily Dale and swearing to himself that she should be his wife Here he had strung together his rhymes and fed his ambition with high hopes building gorgeous castles in the air in all of which Lilian reigned as a queen and though in those days he had known himself to be awkward poor uncared for by any in the world except his mother and his sister yet he had been happy in his hopes happy in his hopes even though he had never taught himself really to believe that they would be realized But now there was nothing in his hopes or thoughts to make him happy Everything was black and wretched and ruinous What would it matter after all even if he should marry Amelia Roper seeing that Lily was to be given to another But then the idea of Amelia as he had seen her that night through the chink in the door came upon his memory and he confessed to himself that life with such a wife as that would be a living death At one moment he thought that he would tell his mother everything and leave her to write an answer to Amelia s letter Should the worst come to the worst the Ropers could not absolutely destroy him That they could bring an action against him and have him locked up for a term of years and dismissed from his office and exposed in all the newspapers he seemed to know That might all however be endured if only the gauntlet could be thrown down for him by some one else The one thing which he felt that he could not do was to write to a girl whom he had professed to love and tell her that he did not love her He knew that he could not himself form such words upon the paper nor as he was well aware could he himself find the courage to tell her to her face that he had changed his mind He knew that he must become the victim of his Amelia unless he could find some friendly knight to do battle in his favour and then again he thought of his mother But when he returned home he was as far as ever from any resolve to tell her how he was situated I may say that his walk had done him no good and that he had not made up his mind to anything He had been building those pernicious castles in the air during more than half the time not castles in the building of which he could make himself happy as he had done in the old days but black castles with cruel dungeons into which hardly a ray of light could find its way In all these edifices his imagination pictured to him Lily as the wife of mister Crosbie He accepted that as a fact and then went to work in his misery making her as wretched as himself through the misconduct and harshness of her husband He tried to think and to resolve what he would do but there is no task so hard as that of thinking when the mind has an objection to the matter brought before it The mind under such circumstances is like a horse that is brought to the water but refuses to drink So Johnny returned to his home still doubting whether or no he would answer Amelia s letter And if he did not answer it how would he conduct himself on his return to Burton Crescent I need hardly say that Miss Roper in writing her letter had been aware of all this and that Johnny s position had been carefully prepared for him by his affectionate sweetheart CHAPTER XI SOCIAL LIFE mister and missus Lupex had eaten a sweetbread together in much connubial bliss on that day which had seen Cradell returning to missus Roper s hospitable board They had together eaten a sweetbread with some other delicacies of the season in the neighbourhood of the theatre and had washed down all unkindness with bitter beer and brandy and water But of this reconciliation Cradell had not heard and when he saw them come together into the drawing room a few minutes after the question he had addressed to Miss Spruce he was certainly surprised Lupex was not an ill natured man nor one naturally savage by disposition He was a man fond of sweetbread and little dinners and one to whom hot brandy and water was too dear Had the wife of his bosom been a good helpmate to him he might have gone through the world if not respectably at any rate without open disgrace But she was a woman who left a man no solace except that to be found in brandy and water For eight years they had been man and wife and sometimes I grieve to say it he had been driven almost to hope that she would commit a married woman s last sin and leave him In his misery any mode of escape would have been welcome to him Had his energy been sufficient he would have taken his scene painting capabilities off to Australia or to the farthest shifting of scenes known on the world s stage But he was an easy listless self indulgent man and at any moment let his misery be as keen as might be a little dinner a few soft words and a glass of brandy and water would bring him round The second glass would make him the fondest husband living but the third would restore to him the memory of all his wrongs and give him courage against his wife or all the world even to the detriment of the furniture around him should a stray poker chance to meet his hand All these peculiarities of his character were not however known to Cradell and when our friend saw him enter the drawing room with his wife on his arm he was astonished mister Cradell your hand said Lupex who had advanced as far as the second glass of brandy and water but had not been allowed to go beyond it There has been a misunderstanding between us let it be forgotten ILLUSTRATION mister Cradell your hand said Lupex mister Cradell if I know him said the lady is too much the gentleman to bear any anger when a gentleman has offered him his hand Oh I m sure said Cradell I m quite indeed I m delighted to find there s nothing wrong after all And then he shook hands with both of them whereupon Miss Spruce got up curtseyed low and also shook hands with the husband and wife You re not a married man mister Cradell said Lupex and therefore you cannot understand the workings of a husband s heart There have been moments when my regard for that woman has been too much for me Now Lupex don t said she playfully tapping him with an old parasol which she still held And I do not hesitate to say that my regard for her was too much for me on that night when I sent for you to the dining room I m glad it s all put right now said Cradell Very glad indeed said Miss Spruce And therefore we need not say any more about it said missus Lupex One word said Lupex waving his hand mister Cradell I greatly rejoice that you did not obey my summons on that night Had you done so I confess it now had you done so blood would have been the consequence I was mistaken I acknowledge my mistake but blood would have been the consequence Dear dear dear said Miss Spruce Miss Spruce continued Lupex there are moments when the heart becomes too strong for a man I dare say said Miss Spruce Now Lupex that will do said his wife Yes that will do But I think it right to tell mister Cradell that I am glad he did not come to me Your friend mister Cradell did me the honour of calling on me at the theatre yesterday at half past four but I was in the slings then and could not very well come down to him I shall be happy to see you both any day at five and to bury all unkindness with a chop and glass at the Pot and Poker in Bow street I m sure you re very kind said Cradell And missus Lupex will join us There s a delightful little snuggery upstairs at the Pot and Poker and if Miss Spruce will condescend to Oh I m an old woman sir No no no said Lupex I deny that Come Cradell what do you say just a snug little dinner for four you know It was no doubt pleasant to see mister Lupex in his present mood much pleasanter than in that other mood of which blood would have been the consequence but pleasant as he now was it was nevertheless apparent that he was not quite sober Cradell therefore did not settle the day for the little dinner but merely remarked that he should be very happy at some future day And now Lupex suppose you get off to bed said his wife You ve had a very trying day you know And you ducky I shall come presently Now don t be making a fool of yourself but get yourself off Come and she stood close up against the open door waiting for him to pass I rather think I shall remain where I am and have a glass of something hot said he Lupex do you want to aggravate me again said the lady and she looked at him with a glance of her eye which he thoroughly understood He was not in a humour for fighting nor was he at present desirous of blood so he resolved to go But as he went he prepared himself for new battles I shall do something desperate I am sure I know I shall he said as he pulled off his boots Oh mister Cradell said missus Lupex as soon as she had closed the door behind her retreating husband how am I ever to look you in the face again after the events of these last memorable days And then she seated herself on the sofa and hid her face in a cambric handkerchief As for that said Cradell what does it signify among friends like us you know But that it should be known at your office as of course it is because of the gentleman that went down to him at the theatre I don t think I shall ever survive it You see I was obliged to send somebody missus Lupex I m not finding fault mister Cradell I know very well that in my melancholy position I have no right to find fault and I don t pretend to understand gentlemen s feelings towards each other But to have had my name mentioned up with yours in that way is Oh mister Cradell I don t know how I m ever to look you in the face again And again she buried hers in her pocket handkerchief Handsome is as handsome does said Miss Spruce and there was that in her tone of voice which seemed to convey much hidden meaning Exactly so Miss Spruce said missus Lupex and that s my only comfort at the present moment mister Cradell is a gentleman who would scorn to take advantage I m quite sure of that And then she did contrive to look at him over the edge of the hand which held the handkerchief That I wouldn t I m sure said Cradell That is to say And then he paused He did not wish to get into a scrape about missus Lupex He was by no means anxious to encounter her husband in one of his fits of jealousy But he did like the idea of being talked of as the admirer of a married woman and he did like the brightness of the lady s eyes When the unfortunate moth in his semi blindness whisks himself and his wings within the flame of the candle and finds himself mutilated and tortured he even then will not take the lesson but returns again and again till he is destroyed Such a moth was poor Cradell There was no warmth to be got by him from that flame There was no beauty in the light not even the false brilliance of unhallowed love Injury might come to him a pernicious clipping of the wings which might destroy all power of future flight injury and not improbably destruction if he should persevere But one may say that no single hour of happiness could accrue to him from his intimacy with missus Lupex He felt for her no love He was afraid of her and in many respects disliked her But to him in his moth like weakness ignorance and blindness it seemed to be a great thing that he should be allowed to fly near the candle Oh my friends if you will but think of it how many of you have been moths and are now going about ungracefully with wings more or less burnt off and with bodies sadly scorched But before mister Cradell could make up his mind whether or no he would take advantage of the present opportunity for another dip into the flame of the candle in regard to which proceeding however he could not but feel that the presence of Miss Spruce was objectionable the door of the room was opened and Amelia Roper joined the party Oh indeed missus Lupex she said And mister Cradell And Miss Spruce my dear said missus Lupex pointing to the ancient lady I m only an old woman said Miss Spruce Oh
5712_48842_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 yes I see 
none	none	Miss Spruce said Amelia I was not hinting at anything I can assure you I should think not my dear said missus Lupex Only I didn t know that you two were quite That is when last I heard about it I fancied But if the quarrel s made up there s nobody more rejoiced than I am The quarrel is made up said Cradell If mister Lupex is satisfied I m sure I am said Amelia mister Lupex is satisfied said missus Lupex and let me tell you my dear seeing that you are expecting to get married yourself missus Lupex I m not expecting to get married not particularly by any means Oh I thought you were And let me tell you that when you ve got a husband of your own you won t find it so easy to keep everything straight That s the worst of these lodgings if there is any little thing everybody knows it Don t they Miss Spruce Lodgings is so much more comfortable than housekeeping said Miss Spruce who lived rather in fear of her relatives the Ropers Everybody knows it does he said Amelia Why if a gentleman will come home at night tipsy and threaten to murder another gentleman in the same house and if a lady And then Amelia paused for she knew that the line of battle ship which she was preparing to encounter had within her much power of fighting Well miss said missus Lupex getting on her feet and what of the lady Now we may say that the battle had begun and that the two ships were pledged by the general laws of courage and naval warfare to maintain the contest till one of them should be absolutely disabled if not blown up or sunk And at this moment it might be difficult for a bystander to say with which of the combatants rested the better chance of permanent success missus Lupex had doubtless on her side more matured power a habit of fighting which had given her infinite skill a courage which deadened her to the feeling of all wounds while the heat of the battle should last and a recklessness which made her almost indifferent whether she sank or swam But then Amelia carried the greater guns and was able to pour in heavier metal than her enemy could use and she too swam in her own waters Should they absolutely come to grappling and boarding Amelia would no doubt have the best of it but missus Lupex would probably be too crafty to permit such a proceeding as that She was however ready for the occasion and greedy for the fight And what of the lady said she in a tone of voice that admitted of no pacific rejoinder A lady if she is a lady said Amelia will know how to behave herself And you re going to teach me are you Miss Roper I m sure I m ever so much obliged to you It s Manchester manners I suppose that you prefer I prefer honest manners missus Lupex and decent manners and manners that won t shock a whole house full of people and I don t care whether they come from Manchester or London Milliner s manners I suppose I don t care whether they are milliner s manners or theatrical missus Lupex as long as they re not downright bad manners as yours are missus Lupex And now you ve got it What are you going on for in this way with that young man till you ll drive your husband into a madhouse with drink and jealousy Miss Roper Miss Roper said Cradell now really Don t mind her mister Cradell said missus Lupex she s not worthy for you to speak to And as to that poor fellow Eames if you ve any friendship for him you ll let him know what she is My dear how s mister Juniper of Grogram s house at Salford I know all about you and so shall John Eames too poor unfortunate fool of a fellow Telling me of drink and jealousy indeed Yes telling you And now you ve mentioned mister Juniper s name mister Eames and mister Cradell too may know the whole of it There s been nothing about mister Juniper that I m ashamed of It would be difficult to make you ashamed of anything I believe But let me tell you this missus Lupex you re not going to destroy the respectability of this house by your goings on It was a bad day for me when I let Lupex bring me into it Then pay your bill and walk out of it said Amelia waving her hand towards the door I ll undertake to say there shan t be any notice required Only you pay mother what you owe and you re free to go at once I shall go just when I please and not one hour before Who are you you gipsy to speak to me in this way And as for going go you shall if we have to call in the police to make you Amelia as at this period of the fight she stood fronting her foe with her arms akimbo certainly seemed to have the best of the battle But the bitterness of missus Lupex s tongue had hardly yet produced its greatest results I am inclined to think that the married lady would have silenced her who was single had the fight been allowed to rage always presuming that no resort to grappling irons took place But at this moment missus Roper entered the room accompanied by her son and both the combatants for a moment retreated Amelia what s all this said missus Roper trying to assume a look of agonized amazement Ask missus Lupex said Amelia And missus Lupex will answer said that lady Your daughter has come in here and attacked me in such language before mister Cradell too Why doesn t she pay what she owes and leave the house said Amelia Hold your tongue said her brother What she owes is no affair of yours But it s an affair of mine when I m insulted by such a creature as that Creature said missus Lupex I d like to know which is most like a creature But I ll tell you what it is Amelia Roper Here however her eloquence was stopped for Amelia had disappeared through the door having been pushed out of the room by her brother Whereupon missus Lupex having found a sofa convenient for the service betook herself to hysterics There for the moment we will leave her hoping that poor missus Roper was not kept late out of her bed What a deuce of a mess Eames will make of it if he marries that girl Such was Cradell s reflection as he betook himself to his own room But of his own part in the night s transactions he was rather proud than otherwise feeling that the married lady s regard for him had been the cause of the battle which had raged So likewise did Paris derive much gratification from the ten years siege of Troy CHAPTER XII LILIAN DALE BECOMES A BUTTERFLY And now we will go back to Allington The same morning that brought to John Eames the two letters which were given in the last chapter but one brought to the Great House among others the following epistle for Adolphus Crosbie It was from a countess and was written on pink paper beautifully creamlaid and scented ornamented with a coronet and certain singularly entwined initials Altogether the letter was very fashionable and attractive and Adolphus Crosbie was by no means sorry to receive it Courcy Castle September one hundred eighty six MY DEAR mister CROSBIE We have heard of you from the Gazebees who have come down to us and who tell us that you are rusticating at a charming little village in which among other attractions there are wood nymphs and water nymphs to whom much of your time is devoted As this is just the thing for your taste I would not for worlds disturb you but if you should ever tear yourself away from the groves and fountains of Allington we shall be delighted to welcome you here though you will find us very unromantic after your late Elysium Lady Dumbello is coming to us who I know is a favourite of yours Or is it the other way and are you a favourite of hers I did ask Lady Hartletop but she cannot get away from the poor marquis who is you know so very infirm The duke isn t at Gatherum at present but of course I don t mean that that has anything to do with dear Lady Hartletop s not coming to us I believe we shall have the house full and shall not want for nymphs either though I fear they will not be of the wood and water kind Margaretta and Alexandrina particularly want you to come as they say you are so clever at making a houseful of people go off well If you can give us a week before you go back to manage the affairs of the nation pray do Yours very sincerely ROSINA DE COURCY The Countess De Courcy was a very old friend of mister Crosbie s that is to say as old friends go in the world in which he had been living He had known her for the last six or seven years and had been in the habit of going to all her London balls and dancing with her daughters everywhere in a most good natured and affable way He had been intimate from old family relations with mister Mortimer Gazebee who though only an attorney of the more distinguished kind had married the countess s eldest daughter and now sat in Parliament for the city of Barchester near to which Courcy Castle was situated And to tell the truth honestly at once mister Crosbie had been on terms of great friendship with Lady De Courcy s daughters the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina perhaps especially so with the latter though I would not have my readers suppose by my saying so that anything more tender than friendship had ever existed between them Crosbie said nothing about the letter on that morning but during the day or perhaps as he thought over the matter in bed he made up his mind that he would accept Lady De Courcy s invitation It was not only that he would be glad to see the Gazebees or glad to stay in the same house with that great master in the high art of fashionable life Lady Dumbello or glad to renew his friendship with the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina Had he felt that the circumstances of his engagement with Lily made it expedient for him to stay with her till the end of his holidays he could have thrown over the De Courcys without a struggle But he told himself that it would be well for him now to tear himself away from Lily or perhaps he said that it would be well for Lily that he should be torn away He must not teach her to think that they were to live only in the sunlight of each other s eyes during those months or perhaps years which must elapse before their engagement could be carried out Nor must he allow her to suppose that either he or she were to depend solely upon the other for the amusements and employments of life In this way he argued the matter very sensibly within his own mind and resolved without much difficulty that he would go to Courcy Castle and bask for a week in the sunlight of the fashion which would be collected there The quiet humdrum of his own fireside would come upon him soon enough I think I shall leave you on Wednesday sir Crosbie said to the squire at breakfast on Sunday morning Leave us on Wednesday said the squire who had an old fashioned idea that people who were engaged to marry each other should remain together as long as circumstances could be made to admit of their doing so Nothing wrong is there O dear no But everything must come to an end some day and as I must make one or two short visits before I get back to town I might as well go on Wednesday Indeed I have made it as late as I possibly could Where do you go from here asked Bernard Well as it happens only into the next county to Courcy Castle And then there was nothing more said about the matter at that breakfast table It had become their habit to meet together on the Sunday mornings before church on the lawn belonging to the Small House and on this day the three gentlemen walked down together and found Lily and Bell already waiting for them They generally had some few minutes to spare on those occasions before missus Dale summoned them to pass through the house to church and such was the case at present The squire at these times would stand in the middle of the grass plot surveying his grounds and taking stock of the shrubs and flowers and fruit trees round him for he never forgot that it was all his own and would thus use this opportunity as he seldom came down to see the spot on other days missus Dale as she would see him from her own window while she was tying on her bonnet would feel that she knew what was passing through his mind and would regret that circumstances had forced her to be beholden to him for such assistance But in truth she did not know all that he thought at such times It is mine he would say to himself as he looked around on the pleasant place But it is well for me that they should enjoy it She is my brother s widow and she is welcome very welcome I think that if those two persons had known more than they did of each other s hearts and minds they might have loved each other better And then Crosbie told Lily of his intention On Wednesday she said turning almost pale with emotion as she heard this news He had told her abruptly not thinking probably that such tidings would affect her so strongly Well
5867_48852_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 yes I have 
none	none	written to Lady De Courcy and said Wednesday It wouldn t do for me exactly to drop everybody and perhaps Oh no And Adolphus you don t suppose I begrudge your going Only it does seem so sudden does it not You see I ve been here over six weeks Yes you ve been very good When I think of it what a six weeks it has been I wonder whether the difference seems to you as great as it does to me I ve left off being a grub and begun to be a butterfly But you mustn t be a butterfly when you re married Lily No not in that sense But I meant that my real position in the world that for which I would fain hope that I was created opened to me only when I knew you and knew that you loved me But mamma is calling us and we must go through to church Going on Wednesday There are only three days more then Yes just three days he said as he took her on his arm and passed through the house on to the road And when are we to see you again she asked as they reached the churchyard Ah who is to say that yet We must ask the Chairman of Committees when he will let me go again Then there was nothing more said and they all followed the squire through the little porch and up to the big family pew in which they all sat Here the squire took his place in one special corner which he had occupied ever since his father s death and from which he read the responses loudly and plainly so loudly and plainly that the parish clerk could by no means equal him though with emulous voice he still made the attempt T squire d like to be squire and parson and clerk and everything so a would the poor clerk would say when complaining of the ill usage which he suffered If Lily s prayers were interrupted by her new sorrow I think that her fault in that respect would be forgiven Of course she had known that Crosbie was not going to remain at Allington much longer She knew quite as well as he did the exact day on which his leave of absence came to its end and the hour at which it behoved him to walk into his room at the General Committee Office She had taught herself to think that he would remain with them up to the end of his vacation and now she felt as a schoolboy would feel who was told suddenly a day or two before the time that the last week of his holidays was to be taken from him The grievance would have been slight had she known it from the first but what schoolboy could stand such a shock when the loss amounted to two thirds of his remaining wealth Lily did not blame her lover She did not even think that he ought to stay She would not allow herself to suppose that he could propose anything that was unkind But she felt her loss and more than once as she knelt at her prayers she wiped a hidden tear from her eyes Crosbie also was thinking of his departure more than he should have done during mister Boyce s sermon It s easy listening to him missus Hearn used to say of her husband s successor It don t give one much trouble following him into his arguments mister Crosbie perhaps found the difficulty greater than did missus Hearn and would have devoted his mind more perfectly to the discourse had the argument been deeper It is very hard that necessity of listening to a man who says nothing On this occasion Crosbie ignored the necessity altogether and gave up his mind to the consideration of what it might be expedient that he should say to Lily before he went He remembered well those few words which he had spoken in the first ardour of his love pleading that an early day might be fixed for their marriage And he remembered also how prettily Lily had yielded to him Only do not let it be too soon she had said Now he must unsay what he had then said He must plead against his own pleadings and explain to her that he desired to postpone the marriage rather than to hasten it a task which I presume must always be an unpleasant one for any man engaged to be married I might as well do it at once he said to himself as he bobbed his head forward into his hands by way of returning thanks for the termination of mister Boyce s sermon As he had only three days left it was certainly as well that he should do this at once Seeing that Lily had no fortune she could not in justice complain of a prolonged engagement That was the argument which he used in his own mind But he as often told himself that she would have very great ground of complaint if she were left for a day unnecessarily in doubt as to this matter Why had he rashly spoken those hasty words to her in his love betraying himself into all manner of scrapes as a schoolboy might do or such a one as Johnny Eames What an ass he had been not to have remembered himself and to have been collected not to have bethought himself on the occasion of all that might be due to Adolphus Crosbie And then the idea came upon him whether he had not altogether made himself an ass in this matter And as he gave his arm to Lily outside the church door he shrugged his shoulders while making that reflection It is too late now he said to himself and then turned round and made some sweet little loving speech to her Adolphus Crosbie was a clever man and he meant also to be a true man if only the temptations to falsehood might not be too great for him Lily he said to her will you walk in the fields after lunch Walk in the fields with him Of course she would There were only three days left and would she not give up to him every moment of her time if he would accept of all her moments And then they lunched at the Small House missus Dale having promised to join the dinner party at the squire s table The squire did not eat any lunch excusing himself on the plea that lunch in itself was a bad thing He can eat lunch at his own house missus Dale afterwards said to Bell And I ve often seen him take a glass of sherry While thinking of this missus Dale made her own dinner If her brother in law would not eat at her board neither would she eat at his And then in a few minutes Lily had on her hat in place of that decorous church going bonnet which Crosbie was wont to abuse with a lover s privilege feeling well assured that he might say what he liked of the bonnet as long as he would praise the hat Only three days she said as she walked down with him across the lawn at a quick pace But she said it in a voice which made no complaint which seemed to say simply this that as the good time was to be so short they must make the most of it And what compliment could be paid to a man so sweet as that What flattery could be more gratifying All my earthly heaven is with you and now for the delight of these immediately present months or so there are left to me but three days of this heaven Come then I will make the most of what happiness is given to me Crosbie felt it all as she felt it and recognized the extent of the debt he owed her I ll come down to them for a day at Christmas though it be only for a day he said to himself Then he reflected that as such was his intention it might be well for him to open his present conversation with a promise to that effect Yes Lily there are only three days left now But I wonder whether I suppose you ll all be at home at Christmas At home at Christmas of course we shall be at home You don t mean to say you ll come to us Well I think I will if you ll have me Oh that will make such a difference Let me see That will only be three months And to have you here on Christmas Day I would sooner have you then than on any other day in the year It will only be for one day Lily I shall come to dinner on Christmas Eve and must go away the day after But you will come direct to our house If you can spare me a room Of course we can So we could now Only when you came you know Then she looked up into his face and smiled When I came I was the squire s friend and your cousin s rather than yours But that s all changed now Yes you re my friend now mine specially I m to be now and always your own special dearest friend eh Adolphus And then she exacted from him the repetition of the promise which he had so often given her By this time they had passed through the grounds of the Great House and were in the fields Lily said he speaking rather suddenly and making her feel by his manner that something of importance was to be said I want to say a few words to you about business And he gave a little laugh as he spoke the last word making her fully understand that he was not quite at his ease Of course I ll listen And Adolphus pray don t be afraid about me What I mean is don t think that I can t bear cares and troubles I can bear anything as long as you love me I say that because I m afraid I seemed to complain about your going I didn t mean to I never thought you complained dearest Nothing can be better than you are at all times and in every way A man would be very hard to please if you didn t please him If I can only please you You do please me in everything Dear Lily I think I found an angel when I found you But now about this business Perhaps I d better tell you everything Oh yes tell me everything But then you mustn t misunderstand me And if I talk about money you mustn t suppose that it has anything to do with my love for you I wish for your sake that I wasn t such a little pauper What I mean to say is this that if I seem to be anxious about money you must not suppose that that anxiety bears any reference whatever to my affection for you I should love you just the same and look forward just as much to my happiness in marrying you whether you were rich or poor You understand that She did not quite understand him but she merely pressed his arm so as to encourage him to go on She presumed that he intended to tell her something as to their future mode of life something which he supposed it might not be pleasant for her to hear and she was determined to show him that she would receive it pleasantly You know said he how anxious I have been that our marriage should not be delayed To me of course it must be everything now to call you my own as soon as possible In answer to which little declaration of love she merely pressed his arm again the subject being one on which she had not herself much to say Of course I must be very anxious but I find it not so easy as I expected You know what I said Adolphus I said that I thought we had better wait I m sure mamma thinks so And if we can only see you now and then That will be a matter of course But as I was saying Let me see Yes all that waiting will be intolerable to me It is such a bore for a man when he has made up his mind on such a matter as marriage not to make the change at once especially when he is going to take to himself such a little angel as you are and as he spoke these loving words his arm was again put round her waist but and then he stopped He wanted to make her understand that this change of intention on his part was caused by the unexpected misconduct of her uncle He desired that she should know exactly how the matter stood that he had been led to suppose that her uncle would give her some small fortune that he had been disappointed and had a right to feel the disappointment keenly and that in consequence of this blow to his expectations he must put off his marriage But he wished her also to understand at the same time that this did not in the least mar his love for her that he did not join her at all in her uncle s fault All this he was anxious to convey to her but he did not know how to get it said in a manner that would not be offensive to her personally and that should not appear to accuse himself of sordid motives He had begun by declaring that he would tell her all but sometimes it is not easy that task of telling a person everything There are things which will not get themselves told You mean dearest said she that you cannot afford to marry at once Yes that is it I had expected that I should be able but Did any man in love ever yet find himself able to tell the lady whom he loved that he was very much disappointed on discovering that she had got no money If so his courage I should say was greater than his love Crosbie found himself unable to do it and thought himself cruelly used because of the difficulty The delay to which he intended to subject her was occasioned as he felt by the squire and not by himself He was ready to do his part if only the squire had been willing to do the part which properly belonged to him The squire would not and therefore neither could he not as yet Justice demanded that all this should be understood but when he came to the telling of it he found that the story would not form itself properly He must let the thing go and bear the injustice consoling himself as best he might by the reflection that he at least was behaving well in the matter It won t make me unhappy Adolphus Will it not said he As regards myself I own that I cannot bear the delay with so much indifference Nay my love but you should not misunderstand me she said stopping and facing him on the path in which they were walking I suppose I ought to protest according to the common rules that I would rather wait Young ladies are expected to say so If you were pressing me to marry at once I should say so no doubt But now as it is I will be more honest I have only one wish in the world and that is to be your wife to be able to share everything with you The sooner we can be together the better it will be at any rate for me There will that satisfy you My own own Lily Yes your own Lily You shall have no cause to doubt me dearest But I do not expect that I am to have everything exactly as I want it I say again that I shall not be unhappy in waiting How can I be unhappy while I feel certain of your love I was disappointed just now when you said that you were going so soon and I am afraid I showed it But those little things are more unendurable than the big things Yes that s very true But there are three more days and I mean to enjoy them so much And then you will write to me and you will come at Christmas And next year when you have your holiday you will come down to us again will you not You may be quite sure of that And so the time will go by till it suits you to come and take me I shall not be unhappy I at any rate shall be impatient Ah men always are impatient It is one of their privileges I suppose And I don t think that a man ever has the same positive and complete satisfaction in knowing that he is loved which a girl feels You are my bird that I have shot with my own gun and the assurance of my success is sufficient for my happiness You have bowled me over and know that I can t get up again I don t know about can t I would let you up quick enough if you wished it How he made his loving assurance that he did not wish it never would or could wish it the reader will readily understand And then he considered that he might as well leave all those money questions as they now stood His real object had been to convince her that their joint circumstances did not admit of an immediate marriage and as to that she completely understood him Perhaps during the next three days some opportunity might arise for explaining the whole matter to missus Dale At any rate he had declared his own purpose honestly and no one could complain of him On the following day they all rode over to Guestwick together the all consisting of the two girls with Bernard and Crosbie Their object was to pay two visits one to their very noble and highly exalted ally the Lady Julia De Guest and the other to their much humbler and better known friend missus Eames As Guestwick Manor lay on their road into the town they performed the grander ceremony the first The present Earl De Guest brother of that Lady Fanny who ran away with Major Dale was an unmarried nobleman who devoted himself chiefly to the breeding of cattle And as he bred very good cattle taking infinite satisfaction in the employment devoting all his energies thereto and abstaining from all prominently evil courses it should be acknowledged that he was not a bad member of society He was a thorough going old Tory whose proxy was always in the hand of the leader of his party and who seldom himself went near the metropolis unless called thither by some occasion of cattle showing He was a short stumpy man with red cheeks and a round face who was usually to be seen till dinner time dressed in a very old shooting coat with breeches gaiters and very thick shoes He lived generally out of doors and was almost as great in the preserving of game as in the breeding of oxen He knew every acre of his own estate and every tree upon it as thoroughly as a lady knows the ornaments in her drawing room There was no gap in a fence of which he did not remember the exact bearings no path hither or thither as to which he could not tell the why and the wherefore He had been in his earlier years a poor man as regarded his income very poor seeing that he was an earl But he was not at present by any means an impoverished man having been taught a lesson by the miseries of his father and grandfather and having learned to live within his means Now as he was going down the vale of years men said that he was becoming rich and that he had ready money to spend a position in which no Lord De Guest had found himself for many generations back His father and grandfather had been known as spendthrifts and now men said that this earl was a miser There was not much of nobility in his appearance but they greatly mistook Lord De Guest who conceived that on that account his pride of place was not dear to his soul His peerage dated back to the time of King John and there were but three lords in England whose patents had been conferred before his own He knew what privileges were due to him on behalf of his blood and was not disposed to abate one jot of them He was not loud in demanding them As he went through the world he sent no trumpeters to the right or left proclaiming that the Earl De Guest was coming When he spread his board for his friends which he did but on rare occasions he entertained them simply with a mild tedious old fashioned courtesy We may say that if properly treated the earl never walked over anybody But he could if ill treated be grandly indignant and if attacked could hold his own against all the world He knew himself to be every inch an earl pottering about after his oxen with his muddy gaiters and red cheeks as much as though he were glittering with stars in courtly royal ceremonies among his peers at Westminster ay more an earl than any of those who use their nobility for pageant purposes Woe be to him who should mistake that old coat for a badge of rural degradation Now and again some unlucky wight did make such a mistake and had to do his penance very uncomfortably With the earl lived a maiden sister the Lady Julia Bernard Dale s father had in early life run away with one sister but no suitor had been fortunate enough to induce the Lady Julia to run with him Therefore she still lived in maiden blessedness as mistress of Guestwick Manor and as such had no mean opinion of the high position which destiny had called upon her to fill She was a tedious dull virtuous old woman who gave herself infinite credit for having remained all her days in the home of her youth probably forgetting in her present advanced years that her temptations to leave it had not been strong or numerous She generally spoke of her sister Fanny with some little contempt as though that poor lady had degraded herself in marrying a younger brother She was as proud of her own position as was the earl her brother but her pride was maintained with more of outward show and less of inward nobility It was hardly enough for her that the world should know that she was a De Guest and therefore she had assumed little pompous ways and certain airs of condescension which did not make her popular with her neighbours The intercourse between Guestwick Manor and Allington was not very frequent or very cordial Soon after the running away of the Lady Fanny the two families had agreed to acknowledge their connection with each other and to let it be known by the world that they were on friendly terms Either that course was necessary to them or the other course of letting it be known that they were enemies Friendship was the less troublesome and therefore the two families called on each other from time to time and gave each other dinners about once a year The earl regarded the squire as a man who had deserted his politics and had thereby forfeited the respect due to him as an hereditary land magnate and the squire was wont to be little the earl as one who understood nothing of the outer world At Guestwick Manor Bernard was to some extent a favourite He was actually a relative having in his veins blood of the De Guests and was not the less a favourite because he was the heir to Allington and because the blood of the Dales was older even than that of the noble family to which he was allied When Bernard should come to be the squire then indeed there might be cordial relations between Guestwick Manor and Allington unless indeed the earl s heir and the squire s heir should have some fresh cause of ill will between themselves They found Lady Julia sitting in her drawing room alone and introduced to her mister Crosbie in due form The fact of Lily s engagement was of course known at the manor and it was quite understood that her intended husband was now brought over that he might be looked at and approved Lady Julia made a very elaborate curtsey and expressed a hope that her young friend might be made happy in that sphere of life to which it had pleased God to call her I hope I shall Lady Julia said Lily with a little laugh at any rate I mean to try We all try my dear but many of us fail to try with sufficient energy of purpose It is only by doing our duty that we can hope to be happy whether in single life or in married Miss Dale means to be a dragon of perfection in the performance of hers said Crosbie A dragon said Lady Julia No I hope Miss Lily Dale will never become a dragon And then she turned to her nephew It may be as well to say at once that she never forgave mister Crosbie the freedom of the expression which he had used He had been in the drawing room of Guestwick Manor for two minutes only and it did not become him to talk about dragons Bernard she said I heard from your mother yesterday I am afraid she does not seem to be very strong And then there was a little conversation not very interesting in its nature between the aunt and the nephew as to the general health of Lady Fanny I didn t know my aunt was so unwell said Bell She isn t ill said Bernard She never is ill but then she is never well Your aunt said Lady Julia seeming to put a touch of sarcasm into the tone of her voice as she repeated the word your aunt has never enjoyed good health since she left this house but that is a long time ago A very long time said Crosbie who was not accustomed to be left in his chair silent You Dale at any rate can hardly remember it But I can remember it said Lady Julia gathering herself up I can remember when my sister Fanny was recognized as the beauty of the country It is a dangerous gift that of beauty Very dangerous said Crosbie Then Lily laughed again and Lady Julia became more angry than ever What odious man was this whom her neighbours were going to take into their very bosom But she had heard of mister Crosbie before and mister Crosbie also had heard of her By the by Lady Julia said he I think I know some very dear friends of yours Very dear friends is a very strong word I have not many very dear friends I mean the Gazebees I have heard Mortimer Gazebee and Lady Amelia speak of you Whereupon Lady Julia confessed that she did know the Gazebees mister Gazebee she said was a man who in early life had wanted many advantages but still he was a very estimable person He was now in Parliament and she understood that he was making himself useful She had not quite approved of Lady Amelia s marriage at the time and so she had told her very old friend Lady De Courcy but And then Lady Julia said many words in praise of mister Gazebee which seemed to amount to this that he was an excellent sort of man with a full conviction of the too great honour done to him by the earl s daughter who had married him and a complete consciousness that even that marriage had not put him on a par with his wife s relations or even with his wife And then it came out that Lady Julia in the course of the next week was going to meet the Gazebees at Courcy Castle I am delighted to think that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you there said Crosbie Indeed said Lady Julia I am going to Courcy on Wednesday That I fear will be too early to allow of my being of any service to your ladyship Lady Julia drew herself up and declined the escort which mister Crosbie had seemed to offer It grieved her to find that Lily Dale s future husband was an intimate friend of her friend s and it especially grieved her to find that he was now going to that friend s house It was a grief to her and she showed that it was It also grieved Crosbie to find that Lady Julia was to be a fellow guest with himself at Courcy Castle but he did not show it He expressed nothing but smiles and civil self congratulation on the matter pretending that he would have much delight in again meeting Lady Julia but in truth he would have given much could he have invented any manoeuvre by which her ladyship might have been kept at home What a horrid old woman she is said Lily as they rode back down the avenue I beg your pardon Bernard for of course she is your aunt Yes she is my aunt and though I am not very fond of her I deny that she is a horrid old woman She never murdered anybody or robbed anybody or stole away any other woman s lover I should think not said Lily She says her prayers earnestly I have no doubt continued Bernard and gives away money to the poor and would sacrifice to morrow any desire of her own to her brother s wish I acknowledge that she is ugly and pompous and that being a woman she ought not to have such a long black beard on her upper lip I don t care a bit about her beard said Lily But why did she tell me to do my duty I didn t go there to have a sermon preached to me And why did she talk about beauty being dangerous said Bell Of course we all knew what she meant I didn t know at all what she meant said Lily and I don t know now I think she s a charming woman and I shall be especially civil to her at Lady De Courcy s said Crosbie And in this way saying hard things of the poor old spinster whom they had left they made their way into Guestwick and again dismounted at missus Eames s door CHAPTER XIII A VISIT TO GUESTWICK ILLUSTRATION untitled As the party from Allington rode up the narrow High street of Guestwick and across the market square towards the small respectable but very dull row of new houses in which missus Eames lived the people of Guestwick were all aware that Miss Lily Dale was escorted by her future husband The opinion that she had been a very fortunate girl was certainly general among the Guestwickians though it was not always expressed in open or generous terms It was a great match for her some said but shook their heads at the same time hinting that mister Crosbie s life in London was not all that it should be and suggesting that she might have been more safe had she been content to bestow herself upon some country neighbour of less dangerous pretensions Others declared that it was no such great match after all They knew his income to a penny and believed that the young people would find it very difficult to keep a house in London unless the old squire intended to assist them But nevertheless Lily was envied as she rode through the town with her handsome lover by her side And she was very happy I will not deny that she had some feeling of triumphant satisfaction in the knowledge that she was envied Such a feeling on her part was natural and is natural to all men and women who are conscious that they have done well in the adjustment of their own affairs As she herself had said he was her bird the spoil of her own gun the product of such capacity as she had in her on which she was to live and if possible to thrive during the remainder of her life Lily fully recognized the importance of the thing she was doing and in soberest guise had thought much of this matter of marriage But the more she thought of it the more satisfied she was that she was doing well And yet she knew that there was a risk He who was now everything to her might die nay it was possible that he might be other than she thought him to be that he might neglect her desert her or misuse her But she had resolved to trust in everything and having so trusted she would not provide for herself any possibility of retreat Her ship should go out into the middle ocean beyond all ken of the secure port from which it had sailed her army should fight its battle with no hope of other safety than that which victory gives All the world might know that she loved him if all the world chose to inquire about the matter She triumphed in her lover and did not deny even to herself that she was triumphant missus Eames was delighted to see them It was so good in mister Crosbie to come over and call upon such a poor forlorn woman as her and so good in Captain Dale so good also in the dear girls who at the present moment had so much to make them happy at home at Allington Little things accounted as bare civilities by others were esteemed as great favours by missus Eames And dear missus Dale I hope she was not fatigued when we kept her up the other night so unconscionably late Bell and Lily both assured her that their mother was none the worse for what she had gone through and then missus Eames got up and left the room with the declared purpose of looking for John and Mary but bent in truth on the production of some cake and sweet wine which she kept under lock and key in the little parlour Don t let s stay here very long whispered Crosbie No not very long said Lily But when you come to see my friends you mustn t be in a hurry mister Crosbie He had his turn with Lady Julia said Bell and we must have ours now At any rate missus Eames won t tell us to do our duty and to beware of being too beautiful said Lily Mary and John came into the room before their mother returned then came missus Eames and a few minutes afterwards the cake and wine arrived It certainly was rather dull as none of the party seemed to be at their ease The grandeur of mister Crosbie was too great for missus Eames and her daughter and John was almost silenced by the misery of his position He had not yet answered Miss Roper s letter nor had he even made up his mind whether he would answer it or no And then the sight of Lily s happiness did not fill him with all that friendly joy which he should perhaps have felt as the friend of her childhood To tell the truth he hated Crosbie and so he had told himself and had so told his sister also very frequently since the day of the party I tell you what it is Molly he had said if there was any way of doing it I d fight that man What and make Lily wretched She ll never be happy with him I m sure she won t I don t want to do her any harm but yet I d like to fight that man if I only knew how to manage it And then he bethought himself that if they could both be slaughtered in such an encounter it would be the only fitting termination to the present state of things In that way too there would be an escape from Amelia and at the present moment he saw none other When he entered the room he shook hands with all the party from Allington but as he told his sister afterwards his flesh crept when he touched Crosbie Crosbie as he contemplated the Eames family sitting stiff and ill at ease in their own drawing room chairs made up his mind that it would be well that his wife should see as little of John Eames as might be when she came to London not that he was in any way jealous of her lover He had learned everything from Lily all at least that Lily knew and regarded the matter rather as a good joke Don t see him too often he had said to her for fear he should make an ass of himself Lily had told him everything all that she could tell but yet he did not in the least comprehend that Lily had in truth a warm affection for the young man whom he despised Thank you no said Crosbie I never do take wine in the middle of the day But a bit of cake And missus Eames by her look implored him to do her so much honour She implored Captain Dale also but they were both inexorable I do not know that the two girls were at all more inclined to eat and drink than the two men but they understood that missus Eames would be broken hearted if no one partook of her delicacies The little sacrifices of society are all made by women as are also the great sacrifices of life A man who is good for anything is always ready for his duty and so is a good woman always ready for a sacrifice We really must go now said Bell because of the horses And under this excuse they got away You will come over before you go back to London John said Lily as he came out with the intention of helping her mount from which purpose however he was forced to recede by the iron will of mister Crosbie Yes I ll come over again before I go Good by Good by John said Bell Good by Eames said Captain Dale Crosbie as he seated himself in the saddle made the very slightest sign of recognition to which his rival would not condescend to pay any attention I ll manage to have a fight with him in some way said Eames to himself as he walked back through the passage of his mother s house And Crosbie as he settled his feet in the stirrups felt that he disliked the young man more and more It would be monstrous to suppose that there could be aught of jealousy in the feeling and yet he did dislike him very strongly and felt almost angry with Lily for asking him to come again to Allington I must put an end to all that he said to himself as he rode silently out of town You must not snub my friends sir said Lily smiling as she spoke but yet with something of earnestness in her voice They were out of the town by this time and Crosbie had hardly uttered a word since they had left missus Eames s door They were now on the high road and Bell and Bernard Dale were somewhat in advance of them I never snub anybody said Crosbie petulantly that is unless they have absolutely deserved snubbing And have I deserved it Because I seem to have got it said Lily Nonsense Lily I never snubbed you yet and I don t think it likely that I shall begin But you ought not to accuse me of not being civil to your friends In the first place I am as civil to them as my nature will allow me to be And in the second place Well in the second place I am not quite sure that you are very wise to encourage that young man s friendship just at present That means I suppose that I am very wrong to do so No dearest it does not mean that If I meant so I would tell you so honestly I mean just what I say There can I suppose be no doubt that he has filled himself with some kind of romantic attachment for you a foolish kind of love which I don t suppose he ever expected to gratify but the idea of which lends a sort of grace to his life When he meets some young woman fit to be his wife he will forget all about it but till then he will go about fancying himself a despairing lover And then such a young man as John Eames is very apt to talk of his fancies I don t believe for a moment that he would mention my name to any one But Lily perhaps I may know more of young men than you do Yes of course you do And I can assure you that they are generally too well inclined to make free with the names of girls whom they think that they like You must not be surprised if I am unwilling that any man should make free with your name After this Lily was silent for a minute or two She felt that an injustice was being done to her and she was not inclined to put up with it but she could not quite see where the injustice lay A great deal was owing from her to Crosbie In very much she was bound to yield to him and she was anxious to do on his behalf even more than her duty But yet she had a strong conviction that it would not be well that she should give way to him in everything She wished to think as he thought as far as possible but she could not say that she agreed with him when she knew that she differed from him John Eames was an old friend whom she could not abandon and so much at the present time she felt herself obliged to say But Adolphus Well dearest You would not wish me to be unkind to so very old a friend as John Eames I have known him all my life and we have all of us had a very great regard for the whole family His father was my uncle s most particular friend I think Lily you must understand what I mean I don t want you to quarrel with any of them or to be what you call unkind But you need not give special and pressing invitations to this young man to come and see you before he goes back to London and then to come and see you directly you get to London You tell me that he has some kind of romantic idea of being in love with you of being in despair because you are not in love with him It s all great nonsense no doubt but it seems to me that under such circumstances you d better just leave him alone Again Lily was silent These were her three last days in which it was her intention to be especially happy but above all things to make him especially happy On no account would she say to him sharp words or encourage in her own heart a feeling of animosity against him and yet she believed him to be wrong and so believing could hardly bring herself to bear the injury Such was her nature as a Dale And let it be remembered that very many who can devote themselves for great sacrifices cannot bring themselves to the endurance of little injuries Lily could have given up any gratification for her lover but she could not allow herself to have been in the wrong believing herself to have been in the right I have asked him now and he must come she said But do not press him to come any more Certainly not after what you have said Adolphus If he comes over to Allington he will see me in mamma s house to which he has always been made welcome by her Of course I understand perfectly You understand what Lily But she had stopped herself fearing that she might say that which would be offensive to him if she continued What is it you understand Lily Do not press me to go on Adolphus As far as I can I will do all that you want me to do You meant to say that when you find yourself an inmate of my house as a matter of course you could not ask your own friends to come and see you Was that gracious Whatever I may have meant to say I did not say that Nor in truth did I mean it Pray don t go on about it now These are to be our last days you know and we shouldn t waste them by talking of things that are unpleasant After all poor Johnny Eames is nothing to me nothing nothing How can any one be anything to me when I think of you But even this did not bring Crosbie back at once into a pleasant humour Had Lily yielded to him and confessed that he was right he would have made himself at once as pleasant as the sun in May But this she had not done She had simply abstained from her argument because she did not choose to be vexed and had declared her continued purpose of seeing Eames on his promised visit Crosbie would have had her acknowledge herself wrong and would have delighted in the privilege of forgiving her But Lily Dale was one who did not greatly relish forgiveness or any necessity of being forgiven So they rode on if not in silence without much joy in their conversation It was now late on the Monday afternoon and Crosbie was to go early on the Wednesday morning What if these three last days should come to be marred with such terrible drawbacks as these Bernard Dale had not spoken a word to his cousin of his suit since they had been interrupted by Crosbie and Lily as they were lying on the bank by the ha ha He had danced with her again and again at missus Dale s party and had seemed to revert to his old modes of conversation without difficulty Bell therefore had believed the matter to be over and was thankful to her cousin declaring within her own bosom that the whole matter should be treated by her as though it had never happened To no one not even to her mother would she tell it To such reticence she bound herself for his sake feeling that he would be best pleased that it should be so But now as they rode on together far in advance of the other couple he again returned to the subject Bell said he am I to have any hope Any hope as to what Bernard I hardly know whether a man is bound to take a single answer on such a subject But this I know that if a man s heart is concerned he is not very willing to do so When that answer has been given honestly and truly Oh no doubt I don t at all suppose that you were dishonest or false when you refused to allow me to speak to you But Bernard I did not refuse to allow you to speak to me Something very like it But however I have no doubt you were true enough But Bell why should it be so If you were in love with any one else I could understand it I am not in love with any one else Exactly And there are so many reasons why you and I should join our fortunes together It cannot be a question of fortune Bernard Do listen to me Do let me speak at any rate I presume I may at least suppose that you do not dislike me Oh no And though you might not be willing to accept any man s hand merely on a question of fortune surely the fact that our marriage would be in every way suitable as regards money should not set you against it Of my own love for you I will not speak further as I do not doubt that you believe what I say but should you not question your own feelings very closely before you determine to oppose the wishes of all those who are nearest to you Do you mean mamma Bernard Not her especially though I cannot but think she would like a marriage that would keep all the family together and would give you an equal claim to the property to that which I have That would not have a feather s weight with mamma Have you asked her No I have mentioned the matter to no one Then you cannot know And as to my uncle I have the means of knowing that it is the great desire of his life I must say that I think some consideration for him should induce you to pause before you give a final answer even though no consideration for me should have any weight with you I would do more for you than for him much more Then do this for me Allow me to think that I have not yet had an answer to my proposal give me to this day month to Christmas till any time that you like to name so that I may think that it is not yet settled and may tell uncle Christopher that such is the case Bernard it would be useless It would at any rate show him that you are willing to think of it But I am not willing to think of it not in that way I do know my own mind thoroughly and I should be very wrong if I were to deceive you And you wish me to give that as your only answer to my uncle To tell the truth Bernard I do not much care what you may say to my uncle in this matter He can have no right to interfere in the disposal of my hand and therefore I need not regard his wishes on the subject I will explain to you in one word what my feelings are about it I would accept no man in opposition to mamma s wishes but not even for her could I accept any man in opposition to my own But as concerns my uncle I do not feel myself called on to consult him in any way on such a matter And yet he is the head of our family I don t care anything about the family not in that way And he has been very generous to you all That I deny He has not been generous to mamma He is very hard and ungenerous to mamma He lets her have that house because he is anxious that the Dales should seem to be respectable before the world and she lives in it because she thinks it better for us that she should do so If I had my way she should leave it to morrow or at any rate as soon as Lily is married I would much sooner go into Guestwick and live as the Eames do I think you are ungrateful Bell No I am not ungrateful And as to consulting Bernard I should be much more inclined to consult you than him about my marriage If you would let me look on you altogether as a brother I should think little of promising to marry no one whom you did not approve But such an agreement between them would by no means have suited Bernard s views He had thought some four or five weeks back that he was not personally very anxious for this match He had declared to himself that he liked his cousin well enough that it would be a good thing for him to settle himself that his uncle was reasonable in his wishes and sufficiently liberal in his offers and that therefore he would marry It had hardly occurred to him as probable that his cousin would reject so eligible an offer and had certainly never occurred to him that he would have to suffer anything from such rejection He had entertained none of that feeling of which lovers speak when they declare that they are staking their all upon the hazard of a die It had not seemed to him that he was staking anything as he gently told his tale of languid love lying on the turf by the ha ha He had not regarded the possibility of disappointment of sorrow and of a deeply vexed mind He would have felt but little triumph if accepted and had not thought that he could be humiliated by any rejection In this frame of mind he had gone to his work but now he found to his own surprise that this girl s answer had made him absolutely unhappy Having expressed a wish for this thing the very expression of the wish made him long to possess it He found as he rode along silently by her side that he was capable of more earnestness of desire than he had known himself to possess He was at this moment unhappy disappointed anxious distrustful of the future and more intent on one special toy than he had ever been before even as a boy He was vexed and felt himself to be sore at heart He looked round at her as she sat silent quiet and somewhat sad upon her pony and declared to himself that she was very beautiful that she was a thing to be gained if still there might be the possibility of gaining her He felt that he really loved her and yet he was almost angry with himself for so feeling Why had he subjected himself to this numbing weakness His love had never given him any pleasure Indeed he had never hitherto acknowledged it but now he was driven to do so on finding it to be the source of trouble and pain I think it is open to us to doubt whether even yet Bernard Dale was in love with his cousin whether he was not rather in love with his own desire But against himself he found a verdict that he was in love and was angry with himself and with all the world Ah Bell he said coming close up to her I wish you could understand how I love you And as he spoke his cousin unconsciously recognized more of affection in his tone and less of that spirit of bargaining which had seemed to pervade all his former pleas than she had ever found before And do I not love you Have I not offered to be to you in all respects as a sister That is nothing Such an offer to me now is simply laughing at me Bell I tell you what I will not give you up The fact is you do not know me yet not know me as you must know any man before you choose him for your husband You and Lily are not alike in this You are cautious doubtful of yourself and perhaps also somewhat doubtful of others My heart is set upon this and I shall still try to succeed Ah Bernard do not say that Believe me when I tell you that it can never be No I will not believe you I will not allow myself to be made utterly wretched I tell you fairly that I will not believe you I may surely hope if I choose to hope No Bell I will never give you up unless indeed I should see you become another man s wife As he said this they all turned in through the squire s gate and rode up to the yard in which it was their habit to dismount from their horses CHAPTER XIV JOHN EAMES TAKES A WALK John Eames watched the party of cavaliers as they rode away from his mother s door and then started upon a solitary walk as soon as the noise of the horses hoofs had passed away out of the street He was by no means happy in his mind as he did so Indeed he was overwhelmed with care and trouble and as he went along very gloomy thoughts passed through his mind Had he not better go to Australia or Vancouver s Island or I will not name the places which the poor fellow suggested to himself as possible terminations of the long journeys which he might not improbably be called upon to take That very day just before the Dales had come in he had received a second letter from his darling Amelia written very closely upon the heels of the first Why had he not answered her Was he ill Was he untrue No she would not believe that and therefore fell back upon the probability of his illness If it was so she would rush down to see him Nothing on earth should keep her from the bedside of her betrothed If she did not get an answer from her beloved John by return of post she would be down with him at Guestwick by the express train Here was a position for such a young man as John Eames And of Amelia Roper we may say that she was a young woman who would not give up her game as long as the least chance remained of her winning it I must go somewhere John said to himself as he put on his slouched hat and wandered forth through the back streets of Guestwick What would his mother say when she heard of Amelia Roper What would she say when she saw her He walked away towards the Manor so that he might roam about the Guestwick woods in solitude There was a path with a stile leading off from the high road about half a mile beyond the lodges through which the Dales had ridden up to the house and by this path John Eames turned in and went away till he had left the Manor house behind him and was in the centre of the Guestwick woods He knew the whole ground well having roamed there ever since he was first allowed to go forth upon his walks alone He had thought of Lily Dale by the hour together as he had lost himself among the oak trees but in those former days he had thought of her with some pleasure Now he could only think of her as of one gone from him for ever and then he had also to think of her whom he had taken to himself in Lily s place Young men very young men men so young that it may be almost a question whether or no they have as yet reached their manhood are more inclined to be earnest and thoughtful when alone than they ever are when with others even though those others be their elders I fancy that as we grow old ourselves we are apt to forget that it was so with us and forgetting it we do not believe that it is so with our children We constantly talk of the thoughtlessness of youth I do not know whether we might not more appropriately speak of its thoughtfulness It is however no doubt true that thought will not at once produce wisdom It may almost be a question whether such wisdom as many of us have in our mature years has not come from the dying out of the power of temptation rather than as the results of thought and resolution Men full fledged and at their work are for the most part too busy for much thought but lads on whom the work of the world has not yet fallen with all its pressure they have time for thinking And thus John Eames was thoughtful They who knew him best accounted him to be a gay good hearted somewhat reckless young man open to temptation but also open to good impressions as to whom no great success could be predicated but of whom his friends might fairly hope that he might so live as to bring upon them no disgrace and not much trouble But above all things they would have called him thoughtless In so calling him they judged him wrong He was ever thinking thinking much of the world as it appeared to him and of himself as he appeared to the world and thinking also of things beyond the world What was to be his fate here and hereafter Lily Dale was gone from him and Amelia Roper was hanging round his neck like a millstone What under such circumstances was to be his fate here and hereafter We may say that the difficulties in his way were not as yet very great As to Lily indeed he had no room for hope but then his love for Lily had perhaps been a sentiment rather than a passion Most young men have to go through that disappointment and are enabled to bear it without much injury to their prospects or happiness And in after life the remembrance of such love is a blessing rather than a curse enabling the possessor of it to feel that in those early days there was something within him of which he had no cause to be ashamed I do not pity John Eames much in regard to Lily Dale And then as to Amelia Roper had he achieved but a tithe of that lady s experience in the world or possessed a quarter of her audacity surely such a difficulty as that need not have stood much in his way What could Amelia do to him if he fairly told her that he was not minded to marry her In very truth he had never promised to do so He was in no way bound to her not even by honour Honour indeed with such as her But men are cowards before women until they become tyrants and are easy dupes till of a sudden they recognize the fact that it is pleasanter to be the victimizer than the victim and as easy There are men indeed who never learn the latter lesson But though the cause for fear was so slight poor John Eames was thoroughly afraid Little things which in connection with so deep a sorrow as his it is almost ridiculous to mention added to his embarrassments and made an escape from them seem to him to be impossible He could not return to London without going to Burton Crescent because his clothes were there and because he owed to missus Roper some small sum of money which on his return to London he would not have immediately in his pocket He must therefore meet Amelia and he knew that he had not the courage to tell a girl face to face that he did not love her after he had been once induced to say that he did do so His boldest conception did not go beyond the writing of a letter in which he would renounce her and removing himself altogether from that quarter of the town in which Burton Crescent was situated But then about his clothes and that debt of his And what if Amelia should in the meantime come down to Guestwick and claim him Could he in his mother s presence declare that she had no right to make such claim The difficulties in truth were not very great but they were too heavy for that poor young clerk from the Income tax Office You will declare that he must have been a fool and a coward Yet he could read and understand Shakspeare He knew much by far too much of Byron s poetry by heart He was a deep critic often writing down his criticisms in a lengthy journal which he kept He could write quickly and with understanding and I may declare that men at his office had already ascertained that he was no fool He knew his business and could do it as many men failed to do who were much less foolish before the world And as to that matter of cowardice he would have thought it the greatest blessing in the world to be shut up in a room with Crosbie having permission to fight with him till one of them should have been brought by stress of battle to give up his claim to Lily Dale Eames was no coward He feared no man on earth But he was terribly afraid of Amelia Roper He wandered about through the old Manor woods very ill at ease The post from Guestwick went out at seven and he must at once make up his mind whether or no he would write to Amelia on that day He must also make up his mind as to what he would say to her He felt that he should at least answer her letter let his answer be what it might Should he promise to marry her say in ten or twelve years time Should he tell her that he was a blighted being unfit for love and with humility entreat of her that he might be excused Or should he write to her mother telling her that Burton Crescent would not suit him any longer promising her to send the balance on receipt of his next payment and asking her to send his clothes in a bundle to the Income tax Office Or should he go home to his own mother and boldly tell it all to her He at last resolved that he must write the letter and as he composed it in his mind he sat himself down beneath an old tree which stood on a spot at which many of the forest tracks met and crossed each other The letter as he framed it here was not a bad letter if only he could have got it written and posted Every word of it he chose with precision and in his mind he emphasized every expression which told his mind clearly and justified his purpose He acknowledged himself to have been wrong in misleading his correspondent and allowing her to imagine that she possessed his heart He had not a heart at her disposal He had been weak not to write to her before having been deterred from doing so by the fear of giving her pain but now he felt that he was bound in honour to tell her the truth Having so told her he would not return to Burton Crescent if it would pain her to see him there He would always have a deep regard for her Oh Johnny and would hope anxiously that her welfare in life might be complete That was the letter as he wrote it on the tablets of his mind under the tree but the getting it put on to paper was a task as he knew of greater difficulty Then as he repeated it to himself he fell asleep Young man said a voice in his ears as he slept At first the voice spoke as a voice from his dream without waking him but when it was repeated he sat up and saw that a stout gentleman was standing over him For a moment he did not know where he was or how he had come there nor could he recollect as he saw the trees about him how long he had been in the wood But he knew the stout gentleman well enough though he had not seen him for more than two years Young man said the voice if you want to catch rheumatism that s the way to do it Why it s young Eames isn t it ILLUSTRATION Why it s young Eames Yes my lord said Johnny raising himself up so that he was now sitting instead of lying as he looked up into the earl s rosy face I knew your father and a very good man he was only he shouldn t have taken to farming People think they can farm without learning the trade but that s a very great mistake I can farm because I ve learned it Don t you think you d better get up Whereupon Johnny raised himself to his feet Not but what you re very welcome to lie there if you like it Only in October you know I m afraid I m trespassing my lord said Eames I came in off the path and You re welcome you re very welcome If you ll come up to the house I ll give you some luncheon This hospitable offer however Johnny declined alleging that it was late and that he was going home to dinner Come along said the earl You can t go any shorter way than by the house Dear dear how well I remember your father He was a much cleverer man than I am very much but he didn t know how to send a beast to market any better than a child By the by they have put you into a public office haven t they Yes my lord And a very good thing too a very good thing indeed But why were you asleep in the wood It isn t warm you know I call it rather cold And the earl stopped and looked at him scrutinizing him as though resolved to inquire into so deep a mystery I was taking a walk and thinking of something I sat down Leave of absence I suppose Yes my lord Have you got into trouble You look as though you were in trouble Your poor father used to be in trouble I haven t taken to farming said Johnny with an attempt at a smile Ha ha ha quite right No don t take to farming Unless you learn it you know you might just as well take to shoemaking just the same You haven t got into trouble then eh No my lord not particularly Not particularly I know very well that young men do get into trouble when they get up to London If you want any any advice or that sort of thing you may come to me for I knew your father well Do you like shooting I never did shoot anything Well perhaps better not To tell the truth I m not very fond of young men who take to shooting without having anything to shoot at By the by now I think of it I ll send your mother some game It may however here be fair to mention that game very often came from Guestwick Manor to missus Eames And look here cold pheasant for breakfast is the best thing I know of Pheasants at dinner are rubbish mere rubbish Here we are at the house Will you come in and have a glass of wine But this John Eames declined pleasing the earl better by doing so than he would have done by accepting it Not that the lord was inhospitable or insincere in his offer but he preferred that such a one as John Eames should receive his proffered familiarity without too much immediate assurance He felt that Eames was a little in awe of his companion s rank and he liked him the better for it He liked him the better for it and was a man apt to remember his likings If you won t come in good by and he gave Johnny his hand Good evening my lord said Johnny And remember this it is the deuce of a thing to have rheumatism in your loins I wouldn t go to sleep under a tree if I were you not in October But you re always welcome to go anywhere about the place Thank you my lord And if you should take to shooting but I dare say you won t and if you come to trouble and want advice or that sort of thing write to me I knew your father well And so they parted Eames returning on his road towards Guestwick For some reason which he could not define he felt better after his interview with the earl There had been something about the fat good natured sensible old man which had cheered him in spite of his sorrow Pheasants for dinner are rubbish mere rubbish he said to himself over and over again as he went along the road and they were the first words which he spoke to his mother after entering the house I wish we had some of that sort of rubbish said she So you will to morrow and then he described to her his interview The earl was at any rate quite right about lying upon the ground I wonder you can be so foolish And he is right about your poor father too But you have got to change your boots and we shall be ready for dinner almost immediately But Johnny Eames before he sat down to dinner did write his letter to Amelia and did go out to post it with his own hands much to his mother s annoyance But the letter would not get itself written in that strong and appropriate language which had come to him as he was roaming through the woods It was a bald letter and somewhat cowardly withal DEAR AMELIA the letter ran I have received both of yours and did not answer the first because I felt that there was a difficulty in expressing what I wish to say and now it will be better that you should allow the subject to stand over till I am back in town I shall be there in ten days from this I have been quite well and am so but of course am much obliged by your inquiries I know you will think this very cold but when I tell you everything you will agree with me that it is best If I were to marry I know that we should be unhappy because we should have nothing to live on If I have ever said anything to deceive you I beg your pardon with all my heart but perhaps it will be better to let the subject remain till we shall meet again in London Believe me to be Your most sincere friend And I may say admirer Oh John Eames JOHN EAMES CHAPTER XV THE LAST DAY Last days are wretched days and so are last moments wretched moments It is not the fact that the parting is coming which makes these days and moments so wretched but the feeling that something special is expected from them which something they always fail to produce Spasmodic periods of pleasure of affection or even of study seldom fail of disappointment when premeditated When last days are coming they should be allowed to come and to glide away without special notice or mention And as for last moments there should be none such Let them ever be ended even before their presence has been acknowledged But Lily Dale had not yet been taught these lessons by her world s experience and she expected that this sweetest cup of which she had ever drank should go on being sweet sweeter and still sweeter as long as she could press it to her lips How the dregs had come to mix themselves with the last drops we have already seen and on that same day on the Monday evening the bitter task still remained for Crosbie as they walked about through the gardens in the evening found other subjects on which he thought it necessary to give her sundry hints intended for her edification which came to her with much of the savour of a lecture A girl when she is thoroughly in love as surely was the case with Lily likes to receive hints as to her future life from the man to whom she is devoted but she would I think prefer that such hints should be short and that the lesson should be implied rather than declared that they should in fact be hints and not lectures Crosbie who was a man of tact who understood the world and had been dealing with women for many years no doubt understood all this as well as we do But he had come to entertain a notion that he was an injured man that he was giving very much more than was to be given to him and that therefore he was entitled to take liberties which might not fairly be within the reach of another lover My reader will say that in all this he was ungenerous Well he was ungenerous I do not know that I have ever said that much generosity was to be expected from him He had some principles of right and wrong under the guidance of which it may perhaps be hoped that he will not go utterly astray but his past life had not been of a nature to make him unselfish He was ungenerous and Lily felt it though she would not acknowledge it even to herself She had been very open with him acknowledging the depth of her love for him telling him that he was now all in all to her that life without his love would be impossible to her and in a certain way he took advantage of these strong avowals treating her as though she were a creature utterly in his power as indeed she was On that evening he said no more of Johnny Eames but said much of the difficulty of a man establishing himself with a wife in London who had nothing but his own moderate income on which to rely He did not in so many words tell her that if her friends could make up for her two or three thousand pounds that being much less than he had expected when he first made his offer this terrible difficulty would be removed but he said enough to make her understand that the world would call him very imprudent in taking a girl who had nothing And as he spoke of these things Lily remaining for the most part silent as he did so it occurred to him that he might talk to her freely of his past life more freely than he would have done had he feared that he might lose her by any such disclosures He had no fear of losing her Alas might it not be possible that he had some such hope He told her that his past life had been expensive that though he was not in debt he had lived up to every shilling that he had and that he had contracted habits of expenditure which it would be almost impossible for him to lay aside at a day s notice Then he spoke of entanglements meaning as he did so to explain more fully what were their nature but not daring to do so when he found that Lily was altogether in the dark as to what he meant No he was not a generous man a very ungenerous man And yet during all this time he thought that he was guided by principle It will be best that I should be honest with her he said to himself And then he told himself scores of times that when making his offer he had expected and had a right to expect that she would not be penniless Under those circumstances he had done the best he could for her offering her his heart honestly with a quick readiness to make her his own at the earliest day that she might think possible Had he been more cautious he need not have fallen into this cruel mistake but she at any rate could not quarrel with him for his imprudence And still he was determined to stand by his engagement and willing to marry her although as he the more thought of it he felt the more strongly that he would thereby ruin his prospects and thrust beyond his own reach all those good things which he had hoped to win As he continued to talk to her he gave himself special credit for his generosity and felt that he was only doing his duty by her in pointing out to her all the difficulties which lay in the way of their marriage At first Lily said some words intended to convey an assurance that she would be the most economical wife that man ever had but she soon ceased from such promises as these Her perceptions were keen and she discovered that the difficulties of which he was afraid were those which he must overcome before his marriage not any which might be expected to overwhelm him after it A cheap and nasty menage would be my aversion he said to her It is that which I want to avoid chiefly for your sake Then she promised him that she would wait patiently for his time even though it should be for seven years she said looking up into his face and trying to find there some sign of approbation That s nonsense he said People are not patriarchs now a days I suppose we shall have to wait two years And that s a deuce of a bore a terrible bore And there was that in the tone of his voice which grated on her feelings and made her wretched for the moment As he parted with her for the night on her own side of the little bridge which led from one garden to the other he put his arm round her to embrace her and kiss her as he had often done at that spot It had become a habit with them to say their evening farewells there and the secluded little nook amongst the shrubs was inexpressibly dear to Lily But on the present occasion she made an effort to avoid his caress She turned from him very slightly but it was enough and he felt it Are you angry with me he said Oh no Adolphus how can I be angry with you And then she turned to him and gave him her face to kiss almost before he had again asked for it He shall not at any rate think that I am unkind to him and it will not matter now she said to herself as she walked slowly across the lawn in the dark up to her mother s drawing room window Well dearest said missus Dale who was there alone did the beards wag merry in the Great Hall this evening That was a joke with them for neither Crosbie nor Bernard Dale used a razor at his toilet Not specially merry And I think it was my fault for I have a headache Mamma I believe I will go at once to bed My darling is there anything wrong Nothing mamma But we had such a long ride and then Adolphus is going and of course we have so much to say To morrow will be the last day for I shall only just see him on Wednesday morning and as I want to be well if possible I ll go to bed And so she took her candle and went When Bell came up Lily was still awake but she begged her sister not to disturb her Don t talk to me Bell she said I m trying to make myself quiet and I half feel that I should get childish if I went on talking I have almost more to think of than I know how to manage And she strove not altogether unsuccessfully to speak with a cheery tone as though the cares which weighed upon her were not unpleasant in their nature Then her sister kissed her and left her to her thoughts And she had great matter for thinking so great that many hours sounded in her ears from the clock on the stairs before she brought her thoughts to a shape that satisfied herself She did so bring them at last and then she slept She did so bring them toiling over her work with tears that made her pillow wet with heart burning and almost with heart breaking with much doubting and many anxious eager inquiries within her own bosom as to that which she ought to do and that which she could endure to do But at last her resolve was taken and then she slept It had been agreed between them that Crosbie should come down to the Small House on the next day after breakfast and remain there till the time came for riding But Lily determined to alter this arrangement and accordingly put on her hat immediately after breakfast and posted herself at the bridge so as to intercept her lover as he came He soon appeared with his friend Dale and she at once told him her purpose I want to have a talk with you Adolphus before you go in to mamma so come with me into the field All right said he And Bernard can finish his cigar on the lawn Mamma and Bell will join him there All right said Bernard So they separated and Crosbie went away with Lily into the field where they had first learned to know each other in those haymaking days She did not say much till they were well away from the house but answered what words he chose to speak not knowing very well of what he spoke But when she considered that they had reached the proper spot she began very abruptly Adolphus she said I have something to say to you something to which you must listen very carefully Then he looked at her and at once knew that she was in earnest This is the last day on which I could say it she continued and I am very glad that I have not let the last day go by without saying it I should not have known how to put it in a letter What is it Lily And I do not know that I can say it properly but I hope that you will not be hard upon me Adolphus if you wish that all this between us should be over I will consent Lily I mean what I say If you wish it I will consent and when I have said so proposing it myself you may be quite sure that I shall never blame you if you take me at my word Are you tired of me Lily No I shall never be tired of you never weary with loving you I did not wish to say so now but I will answer your question boldly Tired of you I fancy that a girl can never grow tired of her lover But I would sooner die in the struggle than be the cause of your ruin It would be better in every way better I have said nothing of being ruined But listen to me I should not die if you left me not be utterly broken hearted Nothing on earth can I ever love as I have loved you But I have a God and a Saviour that will be enough for me I can turn to them with content if it be well that you should leave me I have gone to them and But at this moment she could utter no more words She had broken down in her effort losing her voice through the strength of her emotion As she did not choose that he should see her overcome she turned from him and walked away across the grass Of course he followed her but he was not so quick after her but that time had been given to her to recover herself It is true she said I have the strength of which I tell you Though I have given myself to you as your wife I can bear to be divorced from you now now And my love though it may sound heartless I would sooner be so divorced from you than cling to you as a log that must drag you down under the water and drown you in trouble and care I would indeed I would If you go of course that kind of thing is over for me But the world has more than that much more and I would make myself happy yes my love I would be happy You need not fear that But Lily why is all this said to me here to day Because it is my duty to say it I understand all your position now though it is only now It never flashed on me till yesterday When you proposed to me you thought that I that I had some fortune Never mind that now Lily But you did I see it all now I ought perhaps to have told you that it was not so There has been the mistake and we are both sufferers But we need not make the suffering deeper than needs be My love you are free from this moment And even my heart shall not blame you for accepting your freedom And are you afraid of poverty he asked her I am afraid of poverty for you You and I have lived differently Luxuries of which I know nothing have been your daily comforts I tell you I can bear to part with you but I cannot bear to become the source of your unhappiness

none	none	bear it and none shall dare in my hearing to speak against you I have brought you here to say the word nay more than that to advise you to say it He stood silent for a moment during which he held her by the hand She was looking into his face but he was looking away into the clouds striving to appear as though he was the master of the occasion But during those moments his mind was wracked with doubt What if he should take her at her word Some few would say bitter things against him but such bitter things had been said against many another man without harming him Would it not be well for both if he should take her at her word She would recover and love again as other girls had done and as for him he would thus escape from the ruin at which he had been gazing for the last week past For it was ruin utter ruin He did love her so he declared to himself But was he a man who ought to throw the world away for love Such men there were but was he one of them Could he be happy in that small house somewhere near the New Road with five children and horrid misgivings as to the baker s bill Of all men living was not he the last that should have allowed himself to fall into such a trap All this passed through his mind as he turned his face up to the clouds with a look that was intended to be grand and noble Speak to me Adolphus and say that it shall be so Then his heart misgave him and he lacked the courage to extricate himself from his trouble or as he afterwards said to himself he had not the heart to do it If I understand you rightly Lily all this comes from no want of love on your own part Want of love on my part But you should not ask me that Until you tell me that there is such a want I will agree to no parting Then he took her hand and put it within his arm No Lily whatever may be our cares and troubles we are bound together indissolubly Are we said she and as she spoke her voice trembled and her hand shook Much too firmly for any such divorce as that No Lily I claim the right to tell you all my troubles but I shall not let you go But Adolphus and the hand on his arm was beginning to cling to it again Adolphus said he has got nothing more to say on that subject He exercises the right which he believes to be his own and chooses to retain the prize which he has won She was now clinging to him in very truth Oh my love she said I do not know how to say it again It is of you that I am thinking of you of you I know you are but you have misunderstood me a little that s all Have I Then listen to me again once more my heart s own darling my love my husband my lord If I cannot be to you at once like Ruth and never cease from coming after you my thoughts to you shall be like those of Ruth if aught but death part thee and me may God do so to me and more also Then she fell upon his breast and wept He still hardly understood the depth of her character He was not himself deep enough to comprehend it all But yet he was awed by her great love and exalted to a certain solemnity of feeling which for the time made him rejoice in his late decision For a few hours he was minded to throw the world behind him and wear this woman as such a woman should be worn as a comforter to him in all things and a strong shield against great troubles Lily he said my own Lily Yes your own to take when you please and leave untaken while you please and as much your own in one way as in the other Then she looked up again and essayed to laugh as she did so You will think I am frantic but I am so happy I don t care about your going now indeed I don t There you may go now this minute if you like it And she withdrew her hand from him I feel so differently from what I have done for the last few days I am so glad you have spoken to me as you did Of course I ought to bear all those things with you But I cannot be unhappy about it now I wonder if I went to work and made a lot of things whether that would help A set of shirts for me for instance I could do that at any rate It may come to that yet some of these days I pray God that it may Then again she was serious and the tears came once more into her eyes I pray God that it may To be of use to you to work for you to do something for you that may have in it some sober earnest purport of usefulness that is what I want above all things I want to be with you at once that I may be of service to you Would that you and I were alone together that I might do everything for you I sometimes think that a very poor man s wife is the happiest because she does do everything You shall do everything very soon said he and then they sauntered along pleasantly through the morning hours and when they again appeared at missus Dale s table missus Dale and Bell were astonished at Lily s brightness All her old ways had seemed to return to her and she made her little saucy speeches to mister Crosbie as she had used to do when he was first becoming fascinated by her sweetness You know that you ll be such a swell when you get to that countess s house that you ll forget all about Allington Of course I shall said he And the paper you write upon will be all over coronets that is if ever you do write Perhaps you will to Bernard some day just to show that you are staying at a castle You certainly don t deserve that he should write to you said missus Dale I don t expect it for a moment not till he gets back to London and finds that he has nothing else to do at his office But I should so like to see how you and Lady Julia get on together It was quite clear that she regarded you as an ogre didn t she Bell So many people are ogres to Lady Julia said Bell I believe Lady Julia to be a very good woman said missus Dale and I won t have her abused Particularly before poor Bernard who is her pet nephew said Lily I dare say Adolphus will become a pet too when she has been a week with him at Courcy Castle Do try and cut Bernard out From all which missus Dale learned that some care which had sat heavy on Lily s heart was now lightened if not altogether removed She had asked no questions of her daughter but she had perceived during the past few days that Lily was in trouble and she knew that such trouble had arisen from her engagement She had asked no questions but of course she had been told what was mister Crosbie s income and had been made to understand that it was not to be considered as amply sufficient for all the wants of matrimony There was little difficulty in guessing what was the source of Lily s care and as little in now perceiving that something had been said between them by which that care had been relieved After that they all rode and the afternoon went by pleasantly It was the last day indeed but Lily had determined that she would not be sad She had told him that he might go now and that she would not be discontented at his going She knew that the morrow would be very blank to her but she struggled to live up to the spirit of her promise and she succeeded They all dined at the Great House even missus Dale doing so upon this occasion When they had come in from the garden in the evening Crosbie talked more to missus Dale than he did even to Lily while Lily sat a little distant listening with all her ears sometimes saying a low toned word and happy beyond expression in the feeling that her mother and her lover should understand each other And it must be understood that Crosbie at this time was fully determined to conquer the difficulties of which he had thought so much and to fix the earliest day which might be possible for his marriage The solemnity of that meeting in the field still hung about him and gave to his present feelings a manliness and a truth of purpose which were too generally wanting to them If only those feelings would last But now he talked to missus Dale about her daughter and about their future prospects in a tone which he could not have used had not his mind for the time been true to her He had never spoken so freely to Lily s mother and at no time had missus Dale felt for him so much of a mother s love He apologized for the necessity of some delay arguing that he could not endure to see his young wife without the comfort of a home of her own and that he was now as he always had been afraid of incurring debt missus Dale disliked waiting engagements as do all mothers but she could not answer unkindly to such pleading as this Lily is so very young she said that she may well wait for a year or so For seven years said Lily jumping up and whispering into her mother s ear I shall hardly be six and twenty then which is not at all too old And so the evening passed away very pleasantly God bless you Adolphus missus Dale said to him as she parted with him at her own door It was the first time that she had called him by his Christian name I hope you understand how much we are trusting to you I do I do said he as he pressed her hand Then as he walked back alone he swore to himself binding himself to the oath with all his heart that he would be true to those women both to the daughter and to the mother for the solemnity of the morning was still upon him He was to start the next morning before eight Bernard having undertaken to drive him over to the railway at Guestwick The breakfast was on the table shortly after seven and just as the two men had come down Lily entered the room with her hat and shawl I said I would be in to pour out your tea said she and then she sat herself down over against the teapot It was a silent meal for people do not know what to say in those last minutes And Bernard too was there proving how true is the adage which says that two are company but that three are not I think that Lily was wrong to come up on that last morning but she would not hear of letting him start without seeing him when her lover had begged her not to put herself to so much trouble Trouble Would she not have sat up all night to see even the last of the top of his hat Then Bernard muttering something about the horse went away I have only one minute to speak to you said she jumping up and I have been thinking all night of what I had to say It is so easy to think and so hard to speak My darling I understand it all But you must understand this that I will never distrust you I will never ask you to give me up again or say that I could be happy without you I could not live without you that is without the knowledge that you are mine But I will never be impatient never Pray pray believe me Nothing shall make me distrust you Dearest Lily I will endeavour to give you no cause I know you will not but I specially wanted to tell you that And you will write very soon Directly I get there And as often as you can But I won t bother you only your letters will make me so happy I shall be so proud when they come to me I shall be afraid of writing too much to you for fear I should tire you You will never do that Shall I not But you must write first you know If you could only understand how I shall live upon your letters And now good by There are the wheels God bless you my own my own And she gave herself up into his arms as she had given herself up into his heart She stood at the door as the two men got into the gig and as it passed down through the gate she hurried out upon the terrace from whence she could see it for a few yards down the lane Then she ran from the terrace to the gate and hurrying through the gate made her way into the churchyard from the farther corner of which she could see the heads of the two men till they had made the turn into the main road beyond the parsonage There she remained till the very sound of the wheels no longer reached her ears stretching her eyes in the direction they had taken Then she turned round slowly and made her way out at the churchyard gate which opened on to the road close to the front door of the Small House I should like to punch his head said Hopkins the gardener to himself as he saw the gig driven away and saw Lily trip after it that she might see the last of him whom it carried And I wouldn t think nothing of doing it no more I wouldn t Hopkins added in his soliloquy It was generally thought about the place that Miss Lily was Hopkins s favourite though he showed it chiefly by snubbing her more frequently than he snubbed her sister Lily had evidently intended to return home through the front door but she changed her purpose before she reached the house and made her way slowly back through the churchyard and by the gate of the Great House and by the garden at the back of it till she crossed the little bridge But on the bridge she rested awhile leaning against the railing as she had often leant with him and thinking of all that had passed since that July day on which she had first met him On no spot had he so often told her of his love as on this and nowhere had she so eagerly sworn to him that she would be his own dutiful loving wife And by God s help so I will she said to herself as she walked firmly up to the house He has gone mamma she said as she entered the breakfast room And now we ll go back to our work a day ways it has been all Sunday for me for the last six weeks CHAPTER XVI mister CROSBIE MEETS AN OLD CLERGYMAN ON HIS WAY TO COURCY CASTLE ILLUSTRATION untitled For the first mile or two of their journey Crosbie and Bernard Dale sat for the most part silent in their gig Lily as she ran down to the churchyard corner and stood there looking after them with her loving eyes had not been seen by them But the spirit of her devotion was still strong upon them both and they felt that it would not be well to strike at once into any ordinary topic of conversation And moreover we may presume that Crosbie did feel much at thus parting from such a girl as Lily Dale with whom he had lived in close intercourse for the last six weeks and whom he loved with all his heart with all the heart that he had for such purposes In those doubts as to his marriage which had troubled him he had never expressed to himself any disapproval of Lily He had not taught himself to think that she was other than he would have her be that he might thus give himself an excuse for parting from her Not as yet at any rate had he had recourse to that practice so common with men who wish to free themselves from the bonds with which they have permitted themselves to be bound Lily had been too sweet to his eyes to his touch to all his senses for that He had enjoyed too keenly the pleasure of being with her and of hearing her tell him that she loved him to allow of his being personally tired of her He had not been so spoilt by his club life but that he had taken exquisite pleasure in all her nice country ways and soft kind hearted womanly humour He was by no means tired of Lily Better than any of his London pleasures was this pleasure of making love in the green fields to Lily Dale It was the consequences of it that affrighted him Babies with their belongings would come and dull evenings over a dull fire or else the pining grief of a disappointed woman He would be driven to be careful as to his clothes because the ordering of a new coat would entail a serious expenditure He could go no more among countesses and their daughters because it would be out of the question that his wife should visit at their houses All the victories that he had ever won must be given up He was thinking of this even while the gig was going round the corner near the parsonage house and while Lily s eyes were still blessed with some view of his departing back but he was thinking also that moment that there might be other victory in store for him that it might be possible for him to learn to like that fireside even though babies should be there and a woman opposite to him intent on baby cares He was struggling as best he knew how for the solemnity which Lily had imparted to him had not yet vanished from his spirit I hope that upon the whole you feel contented with your visit said Bernard to him at last Contented Of course I do That is easily said and civility to me perhaps demands as much But I know that you have to some extent been disappointed Well yes I have been disappointed as regards money It is of no use denying it I should not mention it now only that I want to know that you exonerate me I have never blamed you neither you nor anybody else unless indeed it has been myself You mean that you regret what you ve done No I don t mean that I am too devotedly attached to that dear girl whom we have just left to feel any regret that I have engaged myself to her But I do think that had I managed better with your uncle things might have been different I doubt it Indeed I know that it is not so and can assure you that you need not make yourself unhappy on that score I had thought as you well know that he would have done something for Lily something though not as much as he always intended to do for Bell But you may be sure of this that he had made up his mind as to what he would do Nothing that you or I could have said would have changed him Well we won t say anything more about it said Crosbie Then they went on again in silence and arrived at Guestwick in ample time for the train Let me know as soon as you get to town said Crosbie Oh of course I ll write to you before that And so they parted As Dale turned and went Crosbie felt that he liked him less than he had done before and Bernard also as he was driving him came to the conclusion that Crosbie would not be so good a fellow as a brother in law as he had been as a chance friend He ll give us trouble in some way and I m sorry that I brought him down That was Dale s inward conviction in the matter Crosbie s way from Guestwick lay by railway to Barchester the cathedral city lying in the next county from whence he purposed to have himself conveyed over to Courcy There had in truth been no cause for his very early departure as he was aware that all arrivals at country houses should take place at some hour not much previous to dinner He had been determined to be so soon upon the road by a feeling that it would be well for him to get over those last hours Thus he found himself in Barchester at eleven o clock with nothing on his hands to do and having nothing else to do he went to church There was a full service at the cathedral and as the verger marshalled him up to one of the empty stalls a little spare old man was beginning to chant the Litany I did not mean to fall in for all this said Crosbie to himself as he settled himself with his arms on the cushion But the peculiar charm of that old man s voice soon attracted him a voice that though tremulous was yet strong and he ceased to regret the saint whose honour and glory had occasioned the length of that day s special service And who is the old gentleman who chanted the Litany he asked the verger afterwards as he allowed himself to be shown round the monuments of the cathedral That s our precentor sir mister Harding You must have heard of mister Harding But Crosbie with a full apology confessed his ignorance Well sir he s pretty well known too tho he is so shy like He s father in law to our dean sir and father in law to Archdeacon Grantly also His daughters have all gone into the profession then Why yes but Miss Eleanor for I remember her before she was married at all when they lived at the hospital At the hospital Hiram s hospital sir He was warden you know You should go and see the hospital sir if you never was there before Well Miss Eleanor that was his youngest she married mister Bold as her first But now she s the dean s lady Oh the dean s lady is she Yes indeed And what do you think sir mister Harding might have been dean himself if he d liked They did offer it to him And he refused it Indeed he did sir Nolo decanari I never heard of that before What made him so modest Just that sir because he is modest He s past his seventy now ever so much but he s just as modest as a young girl A deal more modest than some of them To see him and his granddaughter together And who is his granddaughter Why Lady Dumbello as will be the Marchioness of Hartletop I know Lady Dumbello said Crosbie not meaning however to boast to the verger of his noble acquaintance Oh do you sir said the man unconsciously touching his hat at this sign of greatness in the stranger though in truth he had no love for her ladyship Perhaps you re going to be one of the party at Courcy Castle Well I believe I am You ll find her ladyship there before you She lunched with her aunt at the deanery as she went through yesterday finding it too much trouble to go out to her father s at Plumstead Her father is the archdeacon you know They do say but her ladyship is your friend No friend at all only a very slight acquaintance She s quite as much above my line as she is above her father s Well she is above them all They say she would hardly as much as speak to the old gentleman What her father No mister Harding he that chanted the Litany just now There he is sir coming out of the deanery They were now standing at the door leading out from one of the transepts and mister Harding passed them as they were speaking together He was a little withered shambling old man with bent shoulders dressed in knee breeches and long black gaiters which hung rather loosely about his poor old legs rubbing his hands one over the other as he went And yet he walked quickly not tottering as he walked but with an uncertain doubtful step The verger as mister Harding passed put his hand to his head and Crosbie also raised his hat Whereupon mister Harding raised his and bowed and turned round as though he were about to speak Crosbie felt that he had never seen a face on which traits of human kindness were more plainly written But the old man did not speak He turned his body half round and then shambled back as though ashamed of his intention and passed on He is of that sort that they make the angels of said the verger But they can t make many if they want them all as good as he is I m much obliged to you sir And he pocketed the half crown which Crosbie gave him ILLUSTRATION He is of that sort that they make the angels of said the verger So that s Lady Dumbello s grandfather said Crosbie to himself as he walked slowly round the close towards the hospital by the path which the verger had shown him He had no great love for Lady Dumbello who had dared to snub him even him They may make an angel of the old gentleman he continued to say but they ll never succeed in that way with the granddaughter He sauntered slowly on over a little bridge and at the gate of the hospital he again came upon mister Harding I was going to venture in said he to look at the place But perhaps I shall be intruding No no by no means said mister Harding Pray come in I cannot say that I am just at home here I do not live here not now But I know the ways of the place well and can make you welcome That s the warden s house Perhaps we won t go in so early in the day as the lady has a very large family An excellent lady and a dear friend of mine as is her husband And he is warden you say Yes warden of the hospital You see the house sir Very pretty isn t it Very pretty To my idea it s the prettiest built house I ever saw I won t go quite so far as that said Crosbie But you would if you d lived there twelve years as I did I lived in that house twelve years and I don t think there s so sweet a spot on the earth s surface Did you ever see such turf as that Very nice indeed said Crosbie who began to make a comparison with missus Dale s turf at the Small House and to determine that the Allington turf was better than that of the hospital I had that turf laid down myself There were borders there when I first came with hollyhocks and those sort of things The turf was an improvement There s no doubt of that I should say The turf was an improvement certainly And I planted those shrubs too There isn t such a Portugal laurel as that in the county Were you warden here sir And Crosbie as he asked the question remembered that in his very young days he had heard of some newspaper quarrel which had taken place about Hiram s hospital at Barchester Yes sir I was warden here for twelve years Dear dear dear If they had put any gentleman here that was not on friendly terms with me it would have made me very unhappy very But as it is I go in and out just as I like almost as much as I did before they But they didn t turn me out There were reasons which made it best that I should resign And you live at the deanery now mister Harding Yes I live at the deanery now But I am not dean you know My son in law doctor Arabin is the dean I have another daughter married in the neighbourhood and can truly say that my lines have fallen to me in pleasant places Then he took Crosbie in among the old men into all of whose rooms he went It was an almshouse for aged men of the city and before Crosbie had left him mister Harding had explained all the circumstances of the hospital and of the way in which he had left it I didn t like going you know I thought it would break my heart But I could not stay when they said such things as that I couldn t stay And what is more I should have been wrong to stay I see it all now But when I went out under that arch mister Crosbie leaning on my daughter s arm I thought that my heart would have broken And the tears even now ran down the old man s cheeks as he spoke It was a long story and it need not be repeated here And there was no reason why it should have been told to mister Crosbie other than this that mister Harding was a fond garrulous old man who loved to indulge his mind in reminiscences of the past But this was remarked by Crosbie that in telling his story no word was said by mister Harding injurious to any one And yet he had been injured injured very deeply It was all for the best he said at last especially as the happiness has not been denied to me of making myself at home at the old place I would take you into the house which is very comfortable very only it is not always convenient early in the day where there s a large family In hearing which Crosbie was again made to think of his own future home and limited income He had told the old clergyman who he was and that he was on his way to Courcy Where as I understand I shall meet a granddaughter of yours Yes yes she is my grandchild She and I have got into different walks of life now so that I don t see much of her They tell me that she does her duty well in that sphere of life to which it has pleased God to call her That depends thought Crosbie on what the duties of a viscountess may be supposed to be But he wished his new friend good by without saying anything further as to Lady Dumbello and at about six o clock in the evening had himself driven up under the portico of Courcy Castle CHAPTER XVII COURCY CASTLE Courcy Castle was very full In the first place there was a great gathering there of all the Courcy family The earl was there and the countess of course At this period of the year Lady De Courcy was always at home but the presence of the earl himself had heretofore been by no means so certain He was a man who had been much given to royal visitings and attendances to parties in the Highlands to no doubt necessary prolongations of the London season to sojournings at certain German watering places convenient probably in order that he might study the ways and ceremonies of German Courts and to various other absences from home occasioned by a close pursuit of his own special aims in life for the Earl De Courcy had been a great courtier But of late gout lumbago and perhaps also some diminution in his powers of making himself generally agreeable had reconciled him to domestic duties and the earl spent much of his time at home The countess in former days had been heard to complain of her lord s frequent absence But it is hard to please some women and now she would not always be satisfied with his presence And all the sons and daughters were there excepting Lord Porlock the eldest who never met his father The earl and Lord Porlock were not on terms and indeed hated each other as only such fathers and such sons can hate The Honourable George De Courcy was there with his bride he having lately performed a manifest duty in having married a young woman with money Very young she was not having reached some years of her life in advance of thirty but then neither was the Honourable George very young and in this respect the two were not ill sorted The lady s money had not been very much perhaps thirty thousand pounds or so But then the Honourable George s money had been absolutely none Now he had an income on which he could live and therefore his father and mother had forgiven him all his sins and taken him again to their bosom And the marriage was matter of great moment for the elder scion of the house had not yet taken to himself a wife and the De Courcy family might have to look to this union for an heir The lady herself was not beautiful or clever or of imposing manners nor was she of high birth But neither was she ugly nor unbearably stupid Her manners were at any rate innocent and as to her birth seeing that from the first she was not supposed to have had any no disappointment was felt Her father had been a coal merchant She was always called missus George and the effort made respecting her by everybody in and about the family was to treat her as though she were a figure of a woman a large well dressed resemblance of a being whom it was necessary for certain purposes that the De Courcys should carry in their train Of the Honourable George we may further observe that having been a spendthrift all his life he had now become strictly parsimonious Having reached the discreet age of forty he had at last learned that beggary was objectionable and he therefore devoted every energy of his mind to saving shillings and pence wherever pence and shillings might be saved When first this turn came upon him both his father and mother were delighted to observe it but although it had hardly yet lasted over twelve months some evil results were beginning to appear Though possessed of an income he would take no steps towards possessing himself of a house He hung by the paternal mansion either in town or country drank the paternal wines rode the paternal horses and had even contrived to obtain his wife s dresses from the maternal milliner In the completion of which little last success however some slight family dissent had showed itself The Honourable John the third son was also at Courcy He had as yet taken to himself no wife and as he had not hitherto made himself conspicuously useful in any special walk of life his family were beginning to regard him as a burden Having no income of his own to save he had not copied his brother s virtue of parsimony and to tell the truth plainly had made himself so generally troublesome to his father that he had been on more than one occasion threatened with expulsion from the family roof But it is not easy to expel a son Human fledglings cannot be driven out of the nest like young birds An Honourable John turned adrift into absolute poverty will make himself heard of in the world if in no other way by his ugliness as he starves A thorough going ne er do well in the upper classes has eminent advantages on his side in the battle which he fights against respectability He can t be sent to Australia against his will He can t be sent to the poor house without the knowledge of all the world He can t be kept out of tradesmen s shops nor without terrible scandal can he be kept away from the paternal properties The earl had threatened and snarled and shown his teeth he was an angry man and a man who could look very angry with eyes which could almost become red and a brow that wrinkled itself in perpendicular wrinkles sometimes very terrible to behold But he was an inconsistent man and the Honourable John had learned to measure his father and in an accurate balance I have mentioned the sons first because it is to be presumed that they were the elder seeing that their names were mentioned before those of their sisters in all the peerages But there were four daughters the Ladies Amelia Rosina Margaretta and Alexandrina They we may say were the flowers of the family having so lived that they had created none of those family feuds which had been so frequent between their father and their brothers They were discreet high bred women thinking perhaps a little too much of their own position in the world and somewhat apt to put a wrong value on those advantages which they possessed and on those which they did not possess The Lady Amelia was already married having made a substantial if not a brilliant match with mister Mortimer Gazebee a flourishing solicitor belonging to a firm which had for many years acted as agents to the De Courcy property Mortimer Gazebee was now member of Parliament for Barchester partly through the influence of his father in law That this should be so was a matter of great disgust to the Honourable George who thought that the seat should have belonged to him But as mister Gazebee had paid the very heavy expenses of the election out of his own pocket and as George De Courcy certainly could not have paid them the justice of his claim may be questionable Lady Amelia Gazebee was now the happy mother of many babies whom she was wont to carry with her on her visits to Courcy Castle and had become an excellent partner to her husband He would perhaps have liked it better if she had not spoken so frequently to him of her own high position as the daughter of an earl or so frequently to others of her low position as the wife of an attorney But on the whole they did very well together and mister Gazebee had gotten from his marriage quite as much as he expected when he made it The Lady Rosina was very religious and I do not know that she was conspicuous in any other way unless it might be that she somewhat resembled her father in her temper It was of the Lady Rosina that the servants were afraid especially with reference to that so called day of rest which under her dominion had become to many of them a day of restless torment It had not always been so with the Lady Rosina but her eyes had been opened by the wife of a great church dignitary in the neighbourhood and she had undergone regeneration How great may be the misery inflicted by an energetic unmarried healthy woman in that condition a woman with no husband or children or duties to distract her from her work I pray that my readers may never know The Lady Margaretta was her mother s favourite and she was like her mother in all things except that her mother had been a beauty The world called her proud disdainful and even insolent but the world was not aware that in all that she did she was acting in accordance with a principle which had called for much self abnegation She had considered it her duty to be a De Courcy and an earl s daughter at all times and consequently she had sacrificed to her idea of duty all popularity adulation and such admiration as would have been awarded to her as a well dressed tall fashionable and by no means stupid young woman To be at all times in something higher than they who were manifestly below her in rank that was the effort that she was ever making But she had been a good daughter assisting her mother as best she might in all family troubles and never repining at the cold colourless unlovely life which had been vouchsafed to her Alexandrina was the beauty of the family and was in truth the youngest But even she was not very young and was beginning to make her friends uneasy lest she too should let the precious season of hay harvest run by without due use of her summer s sun She had perhaps counted too much on her beauty which had been beauty according to law rather than beauty according to taste and had looked probably for too bounteous a harvest That her forehead and nose and cheeks and chin were well formed no man could deny Her hair was soft and plentiful Her teeth were good and her eyes were long and oval But the fault of her face was this that when you left her you could not remember it After a first acquaintance you could meet her again and not know her After many meetings you would fail to carry away with you any portrait of her features But such as she had been at twenty such was she now at thirty Years had not robbed her face of its regularity or ruffled the smoothness of her too even forehead Rumour had declared that on more than one or perhaps more than two occasions Lady Alexandrina had been already induced to plight her troth in return for proffered love but we all know that Rumour when she takes to such topics exaggerates the truth and sets down much in malice The lady was once engaged the engagement lasting for two years and the engagement had been broken off owing to some money difficulties between the gentlemen of the families Since that she had become somewhat querulous and was supposed to be uneasy on that subject of her haymaking Her glass and her maid assured her that her sun shone still as brightly as ever but her spirit was becoming weary with waiting and she dreaded lest she should become a terror to all as was her sister Rosina or an object of interest to none as was Margaretta It was from her especially that this message had been sent to our friend Crosbie for during the last spring in London she and Crosbie had known each other well Yes my gentle readers it is true as your heart suggests to you Under such circumstances mister Crosbie should not have gone to Courcy Castle Such was the family circle of the De Courcys Among their present guests I need not enumerate many First and foremost in all respects was Lady Dumbello of whose parentage and position a few words were said in the last chapter She was a lady still very young having as yet been little more than two years married But in those two years her triumphs had been many so many that in the great world her standing already equalled that of her celebrated mother in law the Marchioness of Hartletop who for twenty years had owned no greater potentate than herself in the realms of fashion But Lady Dumbello was every inch as great as she and men said and women also that the daughter in law would soon be the greater I ll be hanged if I can understand how she does it a certain noble peer had once said to Crosbie standing at the door of Sebright s during the latter days of the last season She never says anything to any one She won t speak ten words a whole night through I don t think she has an idea in her head said Crosbie Let me tell you that she must be a very clever woman continued the noble peer No fool could do as she does Remember she s only a parson s daughter and as for beauty I don t admire her for one said Crosbie I don t want to run away with her if you mean that said the peer but she is handsome no doubt I wonder whether Dumbello likes it Dumbello did like it It satisfied his ambition to be led about as the senior lacquey in his wife s train He believed himself to be a great man because the world fought for his wife s presence and considered himself to be distinguished even among the eldest sons of marquises by the greatness reflected from the parson s daughter whom he had married He had now been brought to Courcy Castle and felt himself proud of his situation because Lady Dumbello had made considerable difficulty in according this week to the Countess De Courcy And Lady Julia De Guest was already there the sister of the other old earl who lived in the next county She had only arrived on the day before but had been quick in spreading the news as to Crosbie s engagement Engaged to one of the Dales is he said the countess with a pretty little smile which showed plainly that the matter was one of no interest to herself Has she got any money Not a shilling I should think said the Lady Julia Pretty I suppose suggested the countess Why yes she is pretty and a nice girl I don t know whether her mother and uncle were very wise in encouraging mister Crosbie I don t hear that he has anything special to recommend him in the way of money I mean I dare say it will come to nothing said the countess who liked to hear of girls being engaged and then losing their promised husbands She did not know that she liked it but she did and already had pleasure in anticipating poor Lily s discomfiture But not the less was she angry with Crosbie feeling that he was making his way into her house under false pretences And Alexandrina also was angry when Lady Julia repeated the same tidings in her hearing I really don t think we care very much about it Lady Julia said she with a little toss of her head That s three times we ve been told of Miss Dale s good fortune The Dales are related to you I think said Margaretta Not at all said Lady Julia bristling up The lady whom mister Crosbie proposes to marry is in no way connected with us Her cousin who is the heir to the Allington property is my nephew by his mother And then the subject was dropped Crosbie on his arrival was shown up into his room told the hour of dinner and left to his devices He had been at the castle before and knew the ways of the house So he sat himself down to his table and began a letter to Lily But he had not proceeded far not having as yet indeed made up his mind as to the form in which he would commence it but was sitting idly with the pen in his hand thinking of Lily and thinking also how such houses as this in which he now found himself would be soon closed against him when there came a rap at his door and before he could answer the Honourable John entered the room Well old fellow said the Honourable John how are you Crosbie had been intimate with John De Courcy but never felt for him either friendship or liking Crosbie did not like such men as John De Courcy but nevertheless they called each other old fellow poked each other s ribs and were very intimate Heard you were here continued the Honourable John so I thought I would come up and look after you Going to be married ain t you Not that I know of said Crosbie Come we know better than that The women have been talking about it for the last three days I had her name quite pat yesterday but I ve forgot it now Hasn t got a tanner has she And the Honourable John had now seated himself upon the table You seem to know a great deal more about it than I do It is that old woman from Guestwick who told us then The women will be at you at once you ll find If there s nothing in it it s what I call a d shame Why should they always pull a fellow to pieces in that way They were going to marry me the other day Were they indeed though To Harriet Twistleton You know Harriet Twistleton An uncommon fine girl you know But I wasn t going to be caught like that I m very fond of Harriet in my way you know but they don t catch an old bird like me with chaff I condole with Miss Twistleton for what she has lost I don t know about condoling But upon my word that getting married is a very slow thing Have you seen George s wife Crosbie declared that he had not as yet had that pleasure She s here now you know I wouldn t have taken her not if she d had ten times thirty thousand pounds By Jove no But he likes it well enough Would you believe it now he cares for nothing on earth except money You never saw such a fellow But I ll tell you what his nose will be out of joint yet for Porlock is going to marry I heard it from Colepepper who almost lives with Porlock As soon as Porlock heard that she was in the family way he immediately made up his mind to cut him out That was a great sign of brotherly love said Crosbie I knew he d do it said John and so I told George before he got himself spliced But he would go on If he d remained as he was for four or five years longer there would have been no danger for Porlock you know is leading the deuce of a life I shouldn t wonder if he didn t reform now and take to singing psalms or something of that sort There s no knowing what a man may come to in this world By George no But I ll tell you what they ll find no change in me If I marry it will not be with the intention of giving up life I say old fellow have you got a cigar here What to smoke up here do you mean Yes why not we re ever so far from the women Not whilst I am occupier of this room Besides it s time to dress for dinner Is it So it is by George But I mean to have a smoke first I can tell you So it s all a lie about your being engaged eh As far as I know it is said Crosbie And then his friend left him What was he to do at once now this very day as to his engagement He had felt sure that the report of it would be carried to Courcy by Lady Julia De Guest but he had not settled down upon any resolution as to what he would do in consequence It had not occurred to him that he would immediately be charged with the offence and called upon to plead guilty or not guilty He had never for a moment meditated any plea of not guilty but he was aware of an aversion on his part to declare himself as engaged to Lilian Dale It seemed that by doing so he would cut himself off at once from all pleasure at such houses as Courcy Castle and as he argued to himself why should he not enjoy the little remnant of his bachelor life As to his denying his engagement to John De Courcy that was nothing Any one would understand that he would be justified in concealing a fact concerning himself from such a one as he The denial repeated from John s mouth would amount to nothing even among John s own sisters But now it was necessary that Crosbie should make up his mind as to what he would say when questioned by the ladies of the house If he were to deny the fact to them the denial would be very serious And indeed was it possible that he should make such denial with Lady Julia opposite to him Make such a denial And was it the fact that he could wish to do so that he should think of such falsehood and even meditate on the perpetration of such cowardice He had held that young girl to his heart on that very morning He had sworn to her and had also sworn to himself that she should have no reason for distrusting him He had acknowledged most solemnly to himself that whether for good or for ill he was bound to her and could it be that he was already calculating as to the practicability of disowning her In doing so must he not have told himself that he was a villain But in truth he made no such calculation His object was to banish the subject if it were possible to do so to think of some answer by which he might create a doubt It did not occur to him to tell the countess boldly that there was no truth whatever in the report and that Miss Dale was nothing to him But might he not skilfully laugh off the subject even in the presence of Lady Julia Men who were engaged did so usually and why should not he It was generally thought that solicitude for the lady s feelings should prevent a man from talking openly of his own engagement Then he remembered the easy freedom with which his position had been discussed throughout the whole neighbourhood of Allington and felt for the first time that the Dale family had been almost indelicate in their want of reticence I suppose it was done to tie me the faster he said to himself as he pulled out the ends of his cravat What a fool I was to come here or indeed to go anywhere after settling myself as I have done And then he went down into the drawing room It was almost a relief to him when he found that he was not charged with his sin at once He himself had been so full of the subject that he had expected to be attacked at the moment of his entrance He was however greeted without any allusion to the matter The countess in her own quiet way shook hands with him as though she had seen him only the day before The earl who was seated in his arm chair asked some one out loud who the stranger was and then with two fingers put forth muttered some apology for a welcome But Crosbie was quite up to that kind of thing How do my lord he said turning his face away to some one else as he spoke and then he took no further notice of the master of the house Not know him indeed Crippled though he was by his matrimonial bond Crosbie felt that at any rate as yet he was the earl s equal in social importance After that he found himself in the back part of the drawing room away from the elder people standing with Lady Alexandrina with Miss Gresham a cousin of the De Courcys and sundry other of the younger portion of the assembled community So you have Lady Dumbello here said Crosbie Oh yes the dear creature said Lady Margaretta It was so good of her to come you know She positively refused the Duchess of saint Bungay said Alexandrina I hope you perceive how good we ve been to you in getting you to meet her People have actually asked to come I am grateful but in truth my gratitude has more to do with Courcy Castle and its habitual inmates than with Lady Dumbello Is he here Oh yes he s in the room somewhere There he is standing up by Lady Clandidlem He always stands in that way before dinner In the evening he sits down much after the same fashion Crosbie had seen him on first entering the room and had seen every individual in it He knew better than to omit the duty of that scrutinizing glance but it sounded well in his line not to have observed Lord Dumbello And her ladyship is not down said he She is generally last said Lady Margaretta And yet she has always three women to dress her said Alexandrina But when finished what a success it is said Crosbie Indeed it is said Margaretta with energy Then the door was opened and Lady Dumbello entered the room There was immediately a commotion among them all Even the gouty old lord shuffled up out of his chair and tried with a grin to look sweet and pleasant The countess came forward looking very sweet and pleasant making little complimentary speeches to which the viscountess answered simply by a gracious smile Lady Clandidlem though she was very fat and heavy left the viscount and got up to join the group Baron Potsneuf a diplomatic German of great celebrity crossed his hands upon his breast and made a low bow The Honourable George who had stood silent for the last quarter of an hour suggested to her ladyship that she must have found the air rather cold and the Ladies Margaretta and Alexandrina fluttered up with little complimentary speeches to their dear Lady Dumbello hoping this and beseeching that as though the Woman in White before them had been the dearest friend of their infancy She was a woman in white being dressed in white silk with white lace over it and with no other jewels upon her person than diamonds Very beautifully she was dressed doing infinite credit no doubt to those three artists who had between them succeeded in turning her out of hand And her face also was beautiful with a certain cold inexpressive beauty She walked up the room very slowly smiling here and smiling there but still with very faint smiles and took the place which her hostess indicated to her One word she said to the countess and two to the earl Beyond that she did not open her lips All the homage paid to her she received as though it were clearly her due She was not in the least embarrassed nor did she show herself to be in the slightest degree ashamed of her own silence She did not look like a fool nor was she even taken for a fool but she contributed nothing to society but her cold hard beauty her gait and her dress We may say that she contributed enough for society acknowledged itself to be deeply indebted to her The only person in the room who did not move at Lady Dumbello s entrance was her husband But he remained unmoved from no want of enthusiasm A spark of pleasure actually beamed in his eye as he saw the triumphant entrance of his wife He felt that he had made a match that was becoming to him as a great nobleman and that the world was acknowledging that he had done his duty And yet Lady Dumbello had been simply the daughter of a country parson of a clergyman who had reached no higher rank than that of an archdeacon How wonderfully well that woman has educated her the countess said that evening in her dressing room to Margaretta The woman alluded to was missus Grantly the wife of the parson and mother of Lady Dumbello The old earl was very cross because destiny and the table of precedence required him to take out Lady Clandidlem to dinner He almost insulted her as she kindly endeavoured to assist him in his infirm step rather than to lean upon him Ugh he said it s a bad arrangement that makes two old people like you and me be sent out together to help each other Speak for yourself said her ladyship with a laugh I at any rate can get about without any assistance which indeed was true enough It s well for you growled the earl as he got himself into his seat And after that he endeavoured to solace his pain by a flirtation with Lady Dumbello on his left The earl s smiles and the earl s teeth when he whispered naughty little nothings to pretty young women were phenomena at which men might marvel Whatever those naughty nothings were on the present occasion Lady Dumbello took them all with placidity smiling graciously but speaking hardly more than monosyllables Lady Alexandrina fell to Crosbie s lot and he felt gratified that it was so It might be necessary for him as a married man to give up such acquaintances as the De Courcys but he should like if possible to maintain a friendship with Lady Alexandrina What a friend Lady Alexandrina would be for Lily if any such friendship were only possible What an advantage would such an alliance confer upon that dear little girl for after all though the dear little girl s attractions were very great he could not but admit to himself that she wanted a something a way of holding herself and of speaking which some people call style Lily might certainly learn a great deal from Lady Alexandrina and it was this conviction no doubt which made him so sedulous in pleasing that lady on the present occasion And she as it seemed was well inclined to be pleased She said no word to him during dinner about Lily and yet she spoke about the Dales and about Allington showing that she knew in what quarters he had been staying and then she alluded to their last parties in London those occasions on which as Crosbie now remembered the intercourse between them had almost been tender It was manifest to him that at any rate she did not wish to quarrel with him It was manifest also that she had some little hesitation in speaking to him about his engagement He did not for a moment doubt that she was aware of it And in this way matters went on between them till the ladies left the room So you re going to be married too said the Honourable George by whose side Crosbie found himself seated when the ladies were gone Crosbie was employing himself upon a walnut and did not find it necessary to make any answer It s the best thing a fellow can do continued George that is if he has been careful to look to the main chance if he hasn t been caught napping you know It doesn t do for a man to go hanging on by nothing till he finds himself an old man You ve feathered your own nest at any rate Yes I ve got something in the scramble and I mean to keep it Where will John be when the governor goes off the hooks Porlock wouldn t give him a bit of bread and cheese and a glass of beer to save his life that is to say not if he wanted it I m told your elder brother is going to be married You ve heard that from John He s spreading that about everywhere to take a rise out of me I don t believe a word of it Porlock never was a marrying man and what s more from all I hear I don t think he ll live long In this way Crosbie escaped from his own difficulty and when he rose from the dinner table had not as yet been driven to confess anything to his own discredit But the evening was not yet over When he returned to the drawing room he endeavoured to avoid any conversation with the countess herself believing that the attack would more probably come from her than from her daughter He therefore got into conversation first with one and then with another of the girls till at last he found himself again alone with Alexandrina mister Crosbie she said in a low voice as they were standing together over one of the distant tables with their backs to the rest of the company I want you to tell me something about Miss Lilian Dale About Miss Lilian Dale he said repeating her words Is she very pretty Yes she certainly is pretty And very nice and attractive and clever and all that is delightful Is she perfect She is very attractive said he but I don t think she s perfect And what are her faults That question is hardly fair is it Suppose any one were to ask me what were your faults do you think I should answer the question I am quite sure you would and make a very long list of them too But as to Miss Dale you ought to think her perfect If a gentleman were engaged to me I should expect him to swear before all the world that I was the very pink of perfection But supposing the gentleman were not engaged to you That would be a different thing I am not engaged to you said Crosbie Such happiness and such honour are I fear very far beyond my reach But nevertheless I am prepared to testify as to your perfection anywhere And what would Miss Dale say Allow me to assure you that such opinions as I may choose to express of my friends will be my own opinions and not depend on those of any one else And you think then that you are not bound to be enslaved as yet How many more months of such freedom are you to enjoy Crosbie remained silent for a minute before he answered and then he spoke in a serious voice Lady Alexandrina said he I would beg from you a great favour What is the favour mister Crosbie I am quite in earnest Will you be good enough kind enough enough my friend not to connect my name again with that of Miss Dale while I am here Has there been a quarrel No there has been no quarrel I cannot explain to you now why I make this request but to you I will explain it before I go Explain it to me I have regarded you as more than an acquaintance as a friend In days now past there were moments when I was almost rash enough to hope that I might have said even more than that I confess that I had no warrant for such hopes but I believe that I may still look on you as a friend Oh yes certainly said Alexandrina in a very low voice and with a certain amount of tenderness in her tone I have always regarded you as a friend And therefore I venture to make the request The subject is not one on which I can speak openly without regret at the present moment But to you at least I promise that I will explain it all before I leave Courcy He at any rate succeeded in mystifying Lady Alexandrina I don t believe he is engaged a bit she said to Lady Amelia Gazebee that night Nonsense my dear Lady Julia wouldn t speak of it in that certain way if she didn t know Of course he doesn t wish to have it talked about If ever he has been engaged to her he has broken it off again said Lady Alexandrina I dare say he will my dear if you give him encouragement said the married sister with great sisterly good nature CHAPTER XVIII LILY DALE S FIRST LOVE LETTER Crosbie was rather proud of himself when he went to bed He had succeeded in baffling the charge made against him without saying anything as to which his conscience need condemn him So at least he then told himself The impression left by what he had said would be that there had been some question of an engagement between him and Lilian Dale but that nothing at this moment was absolutely fixed But in the morning his conscience was not quite so clear What would Lily think and say if she knew it all Could he dare to tell her or to tell any one the real state of his mind As he lay in bed knowing that an hour remained to him before he need encounter the perils of his tub he felt that he hated Courcy Castle and its inmates Who was there among them all that was comparable to missus Dale and her daughters He detested both George and John He loathed the earl As to the countess herself he was perfectly indifferent regarding her as a woman whom it was well to know but as one only to be known as the mistress of Courcy Castle and a house in London As to the daughters he had ridiculed them all from time to time even Alexandrina whom he now professed to love Perhaps in some sort of way he had a weak fondness for her but it was a fondness that had never touched his heart He could measure the whole thing at its worth Courcy Castle with its privileges Lady Dumbello Lady Clandidlem and the whole of it He knew that he had been happier on that lawn at Allington and more contented with himself than ever he had been even under Lady Hartletop s splendid roof in Shropshire Lady Dumbello was satisfied with these things even in the inmost recesses of her soul but he was not a male Lady Dumbello He knew that there was something better and that that something was within his reach But nevertheless the air of Courcy was too much for him In arguing the matter with himself he regarded himself as one infected with a leprosy from which there could be no recovery and who should therefore make his whole life suitable to the circumstances of that leprosy It was of no use for him to tell himself that the Small House at Allington was better than Courcy Castle Satan knew that heaven was better than hell but he found himself to be fitter for the latter place Crosbie ridiculed Lady Dumbello even there among her friends with all the cutting words that his wit could find but nevertheless the privilege of staying in the same house with her was dear to him It was the line of life into which he had fallen and he confessed inwardly that the struggle to extricate himself would be too much for him All that had troubled him while he was yet at Allington but it overwhelmed him almost with dismay beneath the hangings of Courcy Castle Had he not better run from the place at once He had almost acknowledged to himself that he repented his engagement with Lilian Dale but he still was resolved that he would fulfil it He was bound in honour to marry that little girl and he looked sternly up at the drapery over his head as he assured himself that he was a man of honour Yes he would sacrifice himself As he had been induced to pledge his word he would not go back from it He was too much of a man for that But had he not been wrong to refuse the result of Lily s wisdom when she told him in the field that it would be better for them to part He did not tell himself that he had refused her offer merely because he had not the courage to accept it on the spur of the moment No He had been too good to the poor girl to take her at her word It was thus he argued on the matter within his own breast He had been too true to her and now the effect would be that they would both be unhappy for life He could not live in content with a family upon a small income He was well aware of that No one could be harder upon him in that matter than was he himself But it was too late now to remedy the ill effects of an early education It was thus that he debated the matter as he lay in bed contradicting one argument by another over and over again but still in all of them teaching himself to think that this engagement of his was a misfortune Poor Lily Her last words to him had conveyed an assurance that she would never distrust him And she also as she lay wakeful in her bed on this the first morning of his absence thought much of their mutual vows How true she would be to them How she would be his wife with all her heart and spirit It was not only that she would love him but in her love she would serve him to her utmost serve him as regarded this world and if possible as regarded the next Bell she said I wish you were going to be married too Thank ye dear said Bell Perhaps I shall some day Ah but I m not joking It seems such a serious thing And I can t expect you to talk to me about it now as you would if you were in the same position yourself Do you think I shall make him happy Yes I do certainly Happier than he would be with any one else that he might meet I dare not think that I think I could give him up to morrow if I could see any one that would suit him better What would Lily have said had she been made acquainted with all the fascinations of Lady Alexandrina De Courcy The countess was very civil to him saying nothing about his engagement but still talking to him a good deal about his sojourn at Allington Crosbie was a pleasant man for ladies in a large house Though a sportsman he was not so keen a sportsman as to be always out with the gamekeepers Though a politician he did not sacrifice his mornings to the perusal of blue books or the preparation of party tactics Though a reading man he did not devote himself to study Though a horseman he was not often to be found in the stables He could supply conversation when it was wanted and could take himself out of the way when his presence among the women was not needed Between breakfast and lunch on the day following his arrival he talked a good deal to the countess and made himself very agreeable She continued to ridicule him gently for his prolonged stay among so primitive and rural a tribe of people as the Dales and he bore her little sarcasm with the utmost good humour Six weeks at Allington without a move Why mister Crosbie you must have felt yourself to be growing there So I did like an ancient tree Indeed I was so rooted that I could hardly get away Was the house full of people all the time There was nobody there but Bernard Dale Lady Julia s nephew Quite a case of Damon and Pythias Fancy your going down to the shades of Allington to enjoy the uninterrupted pleasures of friendship for six weeks Friendship and the partridges There was nothing else then Indeed there was There was a widow with two very nice daughters living not exactly in the same house but on the same grounds Oh indeed That makes such a difference doesn t it You are not a man to bear much privation on the score of partridges nor a great deal I imagine for friendship But when you talk of pretty girls It makes a difference doesn t it A very great difference I think I have heard of that missus Dale before And so her girls are nice Very nice indeed Play croquet I suppose and eat syllabub on the lawn But really didn t you get very tired of it Oh dear no I was happy as the day was long Going about with a crook I suppose Not exactly a live crook but doing all that kind of thing I learned a great deal about pigs Under the guidance of Miss Dale Yes under the guidance of Miss Dale I m sure one is very much obliged to you for tearing yourself away from such charms and coming to such unromantic people as we are But I fancy men always do that sort of thing once or twice in their lives and then they talk of their souvenirs I suppose it won t go beyond a souvenir with you This was a direct question but still admitted of a fencing answer It has at any rate given me one said he which will last me my life The countess was quite contented That Lady Julia s statement was altogether true she had never for a moment doubted That Crosbie should become engaged to a young lady in the country whereas he had shown signs of being in love with her daughter in London was not at all wonderful Nor in her eyes did such practice amount to any great sin Men did so daily and girls were prepared for their so doing A man in her eyes was not to be regarded as safe from attack because he was engaged Let the young lady who took upon herself to own him have an eye to that When she looked back on the past careers of her own flock she had to reckon more than one such disappointment for her own daughters Others besides Alexandrina had been so treated Lady De Courcy had had her grand hopes respecting her girls and after them moderate hopes and again after them bitter disappointments Only one had been married and she was married to an attorney It was not to be supposed that she would have any very high toned feelings as to Lily s rights in this matter Such a man as Crosbie was certainly no great match for an earl s daughter Such a marriage indeed would one may say be but a poor triumph When the countess during the last season in town had observed how matters were going with Alexandrina she had cautioned her child taking her to task for her imprudence But the child had been at this work for fourteen years and was weary of it Her sisters had been at the work longer and had almost given it up in despair Alexandrina did not tell her parent that her heart was now beyond her control and that she had devoted herself to Crosbie for ever but she pouted saying that she knew very well what she was about scolding her mother in return and making Lady De Courcy perceive that the struggle was becoming very weary And then there were other considerations mister Crosbie had not much certainly in his own possession but he was a man out of whom something might be made by family influence and his own standing He was not a hopeless ponderous man whom no leaven could raise He was one of whose position in society the countess and her daughters need not be ashamed Lady De Courcy had given no expressed consent to the arrangement but it had come to be understood between her and her daughter that the scheme was to be entertained as admissible Then came these tidings of the little girl down at Allington She felt no anger against Crosbie To be angry on such a subject would be futile foolish and almost indecorous It was a part of the game which was as natural to her as fielding is to a cricketer One cannot have it all winnings at any game Whether Crosbie should eventually become her own son in law or not it came to her naturally as a part of her duty in life to bowl down the stumps of that young lady at Allington If Miss Dale knew the game well and could protect her own wicket let her do so She had no doubt as to Crosbie s engagement with Lilian Dale but she had as little as to his being ashamed of that engagement Had he really cared for Miss Dale he would not have left her to come to Courcy Castle Had he been really resolved to marry her he would not have warded all questions respecting his engagement with fictitious answers He had amused himself with Lily Dale and it was to be hoped that the young lady had not thought very seriously about it That was the most charitable light in which Lady De Courcy was disposed to regard the question It behoved Crosbie to write to Lily Dale before dinner He had promised to do so immediately on his arrival and he was aware that he would be regarded as being already one day beyond his promise Lily had told him that she would live upon his letters and it was absolutely necessary that he should furnish her with her first meal So he betook himself to his room in sufficient time before dinner and got out his pen ink and paper He got out his pen ink and paper and then he found that his difficulties were beginning I beg that it may be understood that Crosbie was not altogether a villain He could not sit down and write a letter as coming from his heart of which as he wrote it he knew the words to be false He was an ungenerous worldly inconstant man very prone to think well of himself and to give himself credit for virtues which he did not possess but he could not be false with premeditated cruelty to a woman he had sworn to love He could not write an affectionate warm hearted letter to Lily without bringing himself at any rate for the time to feel towards her in an affectionate warm hearted way Therefore he now sat himself to work while his pen yet remained dry in his hand to remodel his thoughts which had been turned against Lily and Allington by the craft of Lady De Courcy It takes some time before a man can do this He has to struggle with himself in a very uncomfortable way making efforts which are often unsuccessful It is sometimes easier to lift a couple of hundredweights than to raise a few thoughts in one s mind which at other moments will come galloping in without a whistle He had just written the date of his letter when a little tap came at his door and it was opened I say Crosbie said the Honourable John didn t you say something yesterday about a cigar before dinner Not a word said Crosbie in rather an angry tone Then it must have been me said John But bring your case with you and come down to the harness room if you won t smoke here I ve had a regular little snuggery fitted up there and we can go in and see the fellows making up the horses Crosbie wished the Honourable John at the mischief I have letters to write said he Besides I never smoke before dinner That s nonsense I ve smoked hundreds of cigars with you before dinner Are you going to turn curmudgeon too like George and the rest of them I don t know what s coming to the world I suppose the fact is that little girl at Allington won t let you smoke The little girl at Allington began Crosbie and then he reflected that it would not be well for him to say anything to his present companion about that little girl I ll tell you what it is said he I really have got letters to write which must go by this post There s my cigar case on the dressing table I hope it will be long before I m brought to such a state said John taking up the cigars in his hand Let me have the case back said Crosbie A present from the little girl I suppose said John All right old fellow you shall have it There would be a nice brother in law for a man said Crosbie to himself as the door closed behind the retreating scion of the De Courcy family And then again he took up his pen The letter must be written and therefore he threw himself upon the table resolved that the words should come and the paper be filled Courcy Castle October one hundred eighty six DEAREST LILY This is the first letter I ever wrote to you except those little notes when I sent you my compliments discreetly and it sounds so odd You will think that this does not come as soon as it should but the truth is that after all I only got in here just before dinner yesterday I stayed ever so long in Barchester and came across such a queer character For you must know I went to church and afterwards fraternized with the clergyman who did the service such a gentle old soul and singularly enough he is the grandfather of Lady Dumbello who is staying here I wonder what you d think of Lady Dumbello or how you d like to be shut up in the same house with her for a week But with reference to my staying at Barchester I must tell you the truth now though I was a gross impostor the day that I went away I wanted to avoid a parting on that last morning and therefore I started much sooner than I need have done I know you will be very angry with me but open confession is good for the soul You frustrated all my little plan by your early rising and as I saw you standing on the terrace looking after us as we went I acknowledged that you had been right and that I was wrong When the time came I was very glad to have you with me at the last moment My own dearest Lily you cannot think how different this place is from the two houses at Allington or how much I prefer the sort of life which belongs to the latter I know that I have been what the world calls worldly but you will have to cure me of that I have questioned myself very much since I left you and I do not think that I am quite beyond the reach of a cure At any rate I will put myself trustingly into the doctor s hands I know it is hard for a man to change his habits but I can with truth say this for myself that I was happy at Allington enjoying every hour of the day and that here I am ennuye by everybody and nearly by everything One of the girls of the house I do like but as to other people I can hardly find a companion among them let alone a friend However it would not have done for me to have broken away from all such alliances too suddenly When I get up to London and now I really am anxious to get there I can write to you more at my ease and more freely than I do here I know that I am hardly myself among these people or rather I am hardly myself as you know me and as I hope you always will know me But nevertheless I am not so overcome by the miasma but what I can tell you how truly I love you Even though my spirit should be here which it is not my heart would be on the Allington lawns That dear lawn and that dear bridge Give my kind love to Bell and your mother I feel already that I might almost say my mother And Lily my darling write to me at once I expect your letters to me to be longer and better and brighter than mine to you But I will endeavour to make mine nicer when I get back to town God bless you Yours with all my heart A C As he had waxed warm with his writing he had forced himself to be affectionate and as he flattered himself frank and candid Nevertheless he was partly conscious that he was preparing for himself a mode of escape in those allusions of his to his own worldliness if escape should ultimately be necessary I have tried he would then say I have struggled honestly with my best efforts for success but I am not good enough for such success I do not intend to say that he wrote with a premeditated intention of thus using his words but as he wrote them he could not keep himself from reflecting that they might be used in that way He read his letter over felt satisfied with it and resolved that he might now free his mind from that consideration for the next forty eight hours Whatever might be his sins he had done his duty by Lily And with this comfortable reflection he deposited his letter in the Courcy Castle letter box CHAPTER XIX THE SQUIRE MAKES A VISIT TO THE SMALL HOUSE ILLUSTRATION untitled missus Dale acknowledged to herself that she had not much ground for hoping that she should ever find in Crosbie s house much personal happiness for her future life She did not dislike mister Crosbie nor in any great degree mistrust him but she had seen enough of him to make her certain that Lily s future home in London could not be a home for her He was worldly or at least a man of the world He would be anxious to make the most of his income and his life would be one long struggle not perhaps for money but for those things which money only can give There are men to whom eight hundred a year is great wealth and houses to which it brings all the comforts that life requires But Crosbie was not such a man nor would his house be such a house missus Dale hoped that Lily would be happy with him and satisfied with his modes of life and she strove to believe that such would be the case but as regarded herself she was forced to confess that in such a marriage her child would be much divided from her That pleasant abode to which she had long looked forward that she might have a welcome there in coming years should be among fields and trees not in some narrow London street Lily must now become a city lady but Bell would still be left to her and it might still be hoped that Bell would find for herself some country home Since the day on which Lily had first told her mother of her engagement missus Dale had found herself talking much more fully and more frequently with Bell than with her younger daughter As long as Crosbie was at Allington this was natural enough He and Lily were of course together while Bell remained with her mother But the same state of things continued even after Crosbie was gone It was not that there was any coolness or want of affection between the mother and daughter but that Lily s heart was full of her lover and that missus Dale though she had given her cordial consent to the marriage felt that she had but few points of sympathy with her future son in law She had never said even to herself that she disliked him nay she had sometimes declared to herself that she was fond of him But in truth he was not a man after her own heart He was not one who could ever be to her as her own son and her own child But she and Bell would pass hours together talking of Lily s prospects It seems so strange to me said missus Dale that she of all girls should have been fancied by such a man as mister Crosbie or that she should have liked him I cannot imagine Lily living in London If he is good and affectionate to her she will be happy wherever he is said Bell I hope so I m sure I hope so But it seems as though she will be so far separated from us It is not the distance but the manner of life which makes the separation I hope you ll never be taken so far from me I don t think I shall allow myself to be taken up to London said Bell laughing But one can never tell If I do you must follow us mamma I do not want another mister Crosbie for you dear But perhaps I may want one for myself You need not tremble quite yet however Apollos do not come this road every day Poor Lily Do you remember when she first called him Apollo I do well I remember his coming here the day after Bernard brought him down and how you were playing on the lawn while I was in the other garden I little thought then what it would come to But mamma you don t regret it Not if it s to make her happy If she can be happy with him of course I shall not regret it not though he were to take her to the world s end away from us What else have I to look for but that she and you should both be happy Men in London are happy with their wives as well as men in the country Oh yes of all women I should be the first to acknowledge that And as to Adolphus himself I do not know why we should distrust him
5712_48842_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 No my dear 
none	none	there is no reason If I did distrust him I should not have given so ready an assent to the marriage But nevertheless The truth is you don t like him mamma Not so cordially as I hope I may like any man whom you may choose for your husband And Lily though she said nothing on the subject to missus Dale felt that her mother was in some degree estranged from her Crosbie s name was frequently mentioned between them but in the tone of missus Dale s voice and in her manner when she spoke of him there was lacking that enthusiasm and heartiness which real sympathy would have produced Lily did not analyse her own feelings or closely make inquiry as to those of her mother but she perceived that it was not all as she would have wished it to have been I know mamma does not love him she said to Bell on the evening of the day on which she received Crosbie s first letter Not as you do Lily but she does love him Not as I do To say that is nonsense Bell of course she does not love him as I do But the truth is she does not love him at all Do you think I cannot see it I m afraid that you see too much She never says a word against him but if she really liked him she would sometimes say a word in his favour I do not think she would ever mention his name unless you or I spoke of him before her If she did not approve of him why did she not say so sooner That s hardly fair upon mamma said Bell with some earnestness She does not disapprove of him and she never did You know mamma well enough to be sure that she would not interfere with us in such a matter without very strong reason As regards mister Crosbie she gave her consent without a moment s hesitation Yes she did How can you say then that she disapproves of him I didn t mean to find fault with mamma Perhaps it will come all right It will come all right But Bell though she made this very satisfactory promise was as well aware as either of the others that the family would be divided when Crosbie should have married Lily and taken her off to London On the following morning missus Dale and Bell were sitting together Lily was above in her own room either writing to her lover or reading his letter or thinking of him or working for him In some way she was employed on his behalf and with this object she was alone It was now the middle of October and the fire was lit in missus Dale s drawing room The window which opened upon the lawn was closed the heavy curtains had been put back in their places and it had been acknowledged as an unwelcome fact that the last of the summer was over This was always a sorrow to missus Dale but it is one of those sorrows which hardly admit of open expression Bell she said looking up suddenly there s your uncle at the window Let him in For now since the putting up of the curtains the window had been bolted as well as closed So Bell got up and opened a passage for the squire s entrance It was not often that he came down in this way and when he did do so it was generally for some purpose which had been expressed before What fires already said he I never have fires at the other house in the morning till the first of November I like to see a spark in the grate after dinner I like a fire when I m cold said missus Dale But this was a subject on which the squire and his sister in law had differed before and as mister Dale had some business in hand he did not now choose to waste his energy in supporting his own views on the question of fires Bell my dear said he I want to speak to your mother for a minute or two on a matter of business You wouldn t mind leaving us for a little while would you Whereupon Bell collected up her work and went upstairs to her sister Uncle Christopher is below with mamma said she talking about business I suppose it is something to do with your marriage But Bell was wrong The squire s visit had no reference to Lily s marriage missus Dale did not move or speak a word when Bell was gone though it was evident that the squire paused in order that she might ask some question of him Mary said he at last I ll tell you what it is that I have come to say to you Whereupon she put the piece of needlework which was in her hands down upon the work basket before her and settled herself to listen to him I wish to speak to you about Bell About Bell said missus Dale as though much surprised that he should have anything to say to her respecting her eldest daughter Yes about Bell Here s Lily going to be married and it will be well that Bell should be married too I don t see that at all said missus Dale I am by no means in a hurry to be rid of her No I dare say not But of course you only regard her welfare and I can truly say that I do the same There would be no necessity for hurry as to a marriage for her under ordinary circumstances but there may be circumstances to make such a thing desirable and I think that there are It was evident from the squire s tone and manner that he was very much in earnest but it was also evident that he found some difficulty in opening out the budget with which he had prepared himself He hesitated a little in his voice and seemed to be almost nervous missus Dale with some little spice of ill nature altogether abstained from assisting him She was jealous of interference from him about her girls and though she was of course bound to listen to him she did so with a prejudice against and almost with a resolve to oppose anything that he might say When he had finished his little speech about circumstances the squire paused again but missus Dale still sat silent with her eyes fixed upon his face I love your children very dearly said he though I believe you hardly give me credit for doing so I am sure you do said missus Dale and they are both well aware of it And I am very anxious that they should be comfortably established in life I have no children of my own and those of my two brothers are everything to me missus Dale had always considered it as a matter of course that Bernard should be the squire s heir and had never felt that her daughters had any claim on that score It was a well understood thing in the family that the senior male Dale should have all the Dale property and all the Dale money She fully recognized even the propriety of such an arrangement But it seemed to her that the squire was almost guilty of hypocrisy in naming his nephew and his two nieces together as though they were the joint heirs of his love Bernard was his adopted son and no one had begrudged to the uncle the right of making such adoption Bernard was everything to him and as being his heir was bound to obey him in many things But her daughters were no more to him than any nieces might be to any uncle He had nothing to do with their disposal in marriage and the mother s spirit was already up in arms and prepared to do battle for her own independence and for that of her children If Bernard would marry well said she I have no doubt it would be a comfort to you meaning to imply thereby that the squire had no right to trouble himself about any other marriage That s just it said the squire It would be a great comfort to me And if he and Bell could make up their minds together it would I should think be a great comfort to you also Bernard and Bell exclaimed missus Dale No idea of such a union had ever yet come upon her and now in her surprise she sat silent She had always liked Bernard Dale having felt for him more family affection than for any other of the Dale family beyond her own hearth He had been very intimate in her house having made himself almost as a brother to her girls But she had never thought of him as a husband for either of them Then Bell has not spoken to you about it said the squire Never a word And you had never thought about it Certainly not I have thought about it a great deal For some years I have always been thinking of it I have set my heart upon it and shall be very unhappy if it cannot be brought about They are both very dear to me dearer than anybody else If I could see them man and wife I should not much care then how soon I left the old place to them There was a purer touch of feeling in this than the squire had ever before shown in his sister in law s presence and more heartiness than she had given him the credit of possessing And she could not but acknowledge to herself that her own child was included in this unexpected warmth of love and that she was bound at any rate to entertain some gratitude for such kindness It is good of you to think of her said the mother very good I think a great deal about her said the squire But that does not much matter now The fact is that she has declined Bernard s offer Has Bernard offered to her So he tells me and she has refused him It may perhaps be natural that she should do so never having taught herself to look at him in the light of a lover I don t blame her at all I am not angry with her Angry with her No You can hardly be angry with her for not being in love with her cousin I say that I am not angry with her But I think she might undertake to consider the question You would like such a match would you not missus Dale did not at first make any answer but began to revolve the thing in her mind and to look at it in various points of view There was a great deal in such an arrangement which at the first sight recommended it to her very strongly All the local circumstances were in its favour As regarded herself it would promise to her all that she had ever desired It would give her a prospect of seeing very much of Lily for if Bell were settled at the old family house Crosbie would naturally be much with his friend She liked Bernard also and for a moment or two fancied as she turned it all over in her mind that even yet if such a marriage were to take place there might grow up something like true regard between her and the old squire How happy would be her old age in that Small House if Bell with her children were living so close to her Well said the squire who was looking very intently into her face I was thinking said missus Dale Do you say that she has already refused him I am afraid she has but then you know It must of course be left for her to judge If you mean that she cannot be made to marry her cousin of course we all know she can t I mean rather more than that What do you mean then That the matter must be left altogether to her own decision that no persuasion must be used by you or me If he can persuade her indeed Yes exactly He must persuade her I quite agree with you that he should have liberty to plead his own cause But look you here Mary she has always been a very good child to you Indeed she has And a word from you would go a long way with her as it ought If she knows that you would like her to marry her cousin it will make her think it her duty Ah but that is just what I cannot try to make her think Will you let me speak Mary You take me up and scold me before the words are half out of my mouth Of course I know that in these days a young lady is not to be compelled into marrying anybody not but that as far as I can see they did better than they do now when they had not quite so much of their own way I never would take upon myself to ask a child to marry any man But you may explain to her that it is her duty to give such a proposal much thought before it is absolutely refused A girl either is in love or she is not If she is she is ready to jump down a man s throat and that was the case with Lily She never thought of the man till he had proposed to her fully Well never mind now But if a girl is not in love she thinks she is bound to swear and declare that she never will be so I don t think Bell ever declared anything of the kind Yes she did She told Bernard that she didn t love him and couldn t love him and in fact that she wouldn t think anything more about it Now Mary that s what I call being headstrong and positive I don t want to drive her and I don t want you to drive her But here is an arrangement which for her will be a very good one you must admit that We all know that she is on excellent terms with Bernard It isn t as though they had been falling out and hating each other all their lives She told him that she was very fond of him and talked nonsense about being his sister and all that I don t see that it was nonsense at all Yes it was nonsense on such an occasion If a man asks a girl to marry him he doesn t want her to talk to him about being his sister I think it is nonsense If she would only consider about it properly she would soon learn to love him That lesson if it be learned at all must be learned without any tutor You won t do anything to help me then I will at any rate do nothing to mar you And to tell the truth I must think over the matter fully before I can decide what I had better say to Bell about it From her not speaking to me I think she ought to have told you No mister Dale Had she accepted him of course she would have told me Had she thought of doing so she might probably have consulted me But if she made up her mind that she must reject him She oughtn t to have made up her mind But if she did it seems natural to me that she should speak of it to no one She might probably think that Bernard would be as well pleased that it should not be known Psha known of course it will be known As you want time to consider of it I will say nothing more now If she were my daughter I should have no hesitation in telling her what I thought best for her welfare I have none though I may have some in making up my mind as to what is best for her welfare But mister Dale you may be sure of this I will speak to her very earnestly of your kindness and love for her And I wish you would believe that I feel your regard for her very strongly In answer to this he merely shook his head and hummed and hawed You would be glad to see them married as regards yourself he asked Certainly I would said missus Dale I have always liked Bernard and I believe my girl would be safe with him But then you see it s a question on which my own likings or dislikings should not have any bearing And so they parted the squire making his way back again through the drawing room window He was not above half pleased with his interview but then he was a man for whom half pleasure almost sufficed He rarely indulged any expectation that people would make themselves agreeable to him missus Dale since she had come to the Small House had never been a source of satisfaction to him but he did not on that account regret that he had brought her there He was a constant man urgent in carrying out his own plans but not sanguine in doing so and by no means apt to expect that all things would go smooth with him He had made up his mind that his nephew and his niece should be married and should he ultimately fail in this such failure would probably embitter his future life but it was not in the nature of the man to be angry in the meantime or to fume and scold because he met with opposition He had told missus Dale that he loved Bell dearly So he did though he seldom spoke to her with much show of special regard and never was soft and tender with her But on the other hand he did not now love her the less because she opposed his wishes He was a constant undemonstrative man given rather to brooding than to thinking harder in his words than in his thoughts with more of heart than others believed or than he himself knew but above all he was a man who having once desired a thing would desire it always missus Dale when she was left alone began to turn over the question in her mind in a much fuller manner than the squire s presence had as yet made possible for her Would not such a marriage as this be for them all the happiest domestic arrangement which circumstances could afford Her daughter would have no fortune but here would be prepared for her all the comforts which fortune can give She would be received into her uncle s house not as some penniless portionless bride whom Bernard might have married and brought home but as the wife whom of all others Bernard s friends had thought desirable for him And then as regarded missus Dale herself there would be nothing in such a marriage which would not be delightful to her It would give a realization to all her dreams of future happiness But as she said to herself over and over again all that must go for nothing It must be for Bell and for her only to answer Bernard s question In her mind there was something sacred in that idea of love She would regard her daughter almost as a castaway if she were to marry any man without absolutely loving him loving him as Lily loved her lover with all her heart and all her strength With such a conviction as this strong upon her she felt that she could not say much to Bell that would be of any service CHAPTER XX doctor CROFTS If there was anything in the world as to which Isabella Dale was quite certain it was this that she was not in love with doctor Crofts As to being in love with her cousin Bernard she had never had occasion to ask herself any question on that head She liked him very well but she had never thought of marrying him and now when he made his proposal she could not bring herself to think of it But as regards doctor Crofts she had thought of it and had made up her mind in the manner above described It may be said that she could not have been justified in discussing the matter even within her own bosom unless authorized to do so by doctor Crofts himself Let it then be considered that doctor Crofts had given her some such authority This may be done in more ways than one and Miss Dale could not have found herself asking herself questions about him unless there had been fitting occasion for her to do so The profession of a medical man in a small provincial town is not often one which gives to its owner in early life a large income Perhaps in no career has a man to work harder for what he earns or to do more work without earning anything It has sometimes seemed to me as though the young doctors and the old doctors had agreed to divide between them the different results of their profession the young doctors doing all the work and the old doctors taking all the money If this be so it may account for that appearance of premature gravity which is borne by so many of the medical profession Under such an arrangement a man may be excused for a desire to put away childish things very early in life doctor Crofts had now been practising in Guestwick nearly seven years having settled himself in that town when he was twenty three years old and being at this period about thirty During those seven years his skill and industry had been so fully admitted that he had succeeded in obtaining the medical care of all the paupers in the union for which work he was paid at the rate of one hundred pounds a year He was also assistant surgeon at a small hospital which was maintained in that town and held two or three other similar public positions all of which attested his respectability and general proficiency They moreover thoroughly saved him from any of the dangers of idleness but unfortunately they did not enable him to regard himself as a successful professional man Whereas old doctor Gruffen of whom but few people spoke well had made a fortune in Guestwick and even still drew from the ailments of the town a considerable and hardly yet decreasing income Now this was hard upon doctor Crofts unless there was existing some such well understood arrangement as that above named He had been known to the family of the Dales long previous to his settlement at Guestwick and had been very intimate with them from that time to the present day Of all the men young or old whom missus Dale counted among her intimate friends he was the one whom she most trusted and admired And he was a man to be trusted by those who knew him well He was not bright and always ready as was Crosbie nor had he all the practical worldly good sense of Bernard Dale In mental power I doubt whether he was superior to John Eames to John Eames such as he might become when the period of his hobbledehoyhood should have altogether passed away But Crofts compared with the other three as they all were at present was a man more to be trusted than any of them And there was moreover about him an occasional dash of humour without which missus Dale would hardly have regarded him with that thorough liking which she had for him But it was a quiet humour apt to show itself when he had but one friend with him rather than in general society Crosbie on the other hand would be much more bright among a dozen than he could with a single companion Bernard Dale was never bright and as for Johnny Eames but in this matter of brightness Johnny Eames had not yet shown to the world what his character might be It was now two years since Crofts had been called upon for medical advice on behalf of his friend missus Dale She had then been ill for a long period some two or three months and doctor Crofts had been frequent in his visits at Allington At that time he became very intimate with missus Dale s daughters and especially so with the eldest Young unmarried doctors ought perhaps to be excluded from houses in which there are young ladies I know at any rate that many sage matrons hold very strongly to that opinion thinking no doubt that doctors ought to get themselves married before they venture to begin working for a living missus Dale perhaps regarded her own girls as still merely children for Bell the elder was then hardly eighteen or perhaps she held imprudent and heterodox opinions on this subject or it may be that she selfishly preferred doctor Crofts with all the danger to her children to doctor Gruffen with all the danger to herself But the result was that the young doctor one day informed himself as he was riding back to Guestwick that much of his happiness in this world would depend on his being able to marry missus Dale s eldest daughter At that time his total income amounted to little more than two hundred a year and he had resolved within his own mind that doctor Gruffen was esteemed as much the better doctor by the general public opinion of Guestwick and that doctor Gruffen s sandy haired assistant would even have a better chance of success in the town than himself should it ever come to pass that the doctor was esteemed too old for personal practice Crofts had no fortune of his own and he was aware that Miss Dale had none Then under those circumstances what was he to do It is not necessary that we should inquire at any great length into those love passages of the doctor s life which took place three years before the commencement of this narrative He made no declaration to Bell but Bell young as she was understood well that he would fain have done so had not his courage failed him or rather had not his prudence prevented him To missus Dale he did speak not openly avowing his love even to her but hinting at it and then talking to her of his unsatisfied hopes and professional disappointments It is not that I complain of being poor as I am said he or at any rate not so poor that my poverty must be any source of discomfort to me but I could hardly marry with such an income as I have at present But it will increase will it not said missus Dale It may some day when I am becoming an old man he said But of what use will it be to me then missus Dale could not tell him that as far as her voice in the matter went he was welcome to woo her daughter and marry her poor as he was and doubly poor as they would both be together on such a pittance He had not even mentioned Bell s name and had he done so she could only have bade him wait and hope After that he said nothing further to her upon the subject To Bell he spoke no word of overt love but on an autumn day when missus Dale was already convalescent and the repetition of his professional visits had become unnecessary he got her to walk with him through the half hidden shrubbery paths and then told her things which he should never have told her if he really wished to bind her heart to his He repeated that story of his income and explained to her that his poverty was only grievous to him in that it prevented him from thinking of marriage I suppose it must said Bell I should think it wrong to ask any lady to share such an income as mine said he Whereupon Bell had suggested to him that some ladies had incomes of their own and that he might in that way get over the difficulty I should be afraid of myself in marrying a girl with money said he besides that is altogether out of the question now Of course Bell did not ask him why it was out of the question and for a time they went on walking in silence It is a hard thing to do he then said not looking at her but looking at the gravel on which he stood It is a hard thing to do but I will determine to think of it no further I believe a man may be as happy single as he may married almost Perhaps more so said Bell Then the doctor left her and Bell as I have said before made up her mind with great firmness that she was not in love with him I may certainly say that there was nothing in the world as to which she was so certain as she was of this And now in these days doctor Crofts did not come over to Allington very often Had any of the family in the Small House been ill he would have been there of course The squire himself employed the apothecary in the village or if higher aid was needed would send for doctor Gruffen On the occasion of missus Dale s party Crofts was there having been specially invited but missus Dale s special invitations to her friends were very few and the doctor was well aware that he must himself make occasion for going there if he desired to see the inmates of the house But he very rarely made such occasion perhaps feeling that he was more in his element at the workhouse and the hospital Just at this time however he made one very great and unexpected step towards success in his profession He was greatly surprised one morning by being summoned to the Manor House to attend upon Lord De Guest The family at the Manor had employed doctor Gruffen for the last thirty years and Crofts when he received the earl s message could hardly believe the words The earl ain t very bad said the servant but he would be glad to see you if possible a little before dinner You re sure he wants to see me said Crofts Oh yes I m sure enough of that sir It wasn t doctor Gruffen No sir it wasn t doctor Gruffen I believe his lordship s had about enough of doctor Gruffen The doctor took to chaffing his lordship one day Chaffed his lordship his hands and feet and that sort of thing suggested the doctor Hands and feet said the man Lord bless you sir he poked his fun at him just as though he was nobody I didn t hear but missus Connor says that my lord s back was up terribly high And so doctor Crofts got on his horse and rode up to Guestwick Manor The earl was alone Lady Julia having already gone to Courcy Castle How d ye do how d ye do said the earl I m not very ill but I want to get a little advice from you It s quite a trifle but I thought it well to see somebody Whereupon doctor Crofts of course declared that he was happy to wait upon his lordship I know all about you you know said the earl Your grandmother Stoddard was a very old friend of my aunt s You don t remember Lady Jemima No said Crofts I never had that honour An excellent old woman and knew your grandmother Stoddard well You see Gruffen has been attending us for I don t know how many years but upon my word and then the earl stopped himself It s an ill wind that blows nobody any good said Crofts with a slight laugh Perhaps it ll blow me some good for Gruffen never did me any The fact is this I m very well you know as strong as a horse You look pretty well No man could be better not of my age I m sixty you know You don t look as though you were ailing I m always out in the open air and that I take it is the best thing for a man There s nothing like plenty of exercise certainly And I m always taking exercise said the earl There isn t a man about the place works much harder than I do And let me tell you sir when you undertake to keep six or seven hundred acres of land in your own hand you must look after it unless you mean to lose money by it I ve always heard that your lordship is a good farmer Well yes wherever the grass may grow about my place it doesn t grow under my feet You won t often find me in bed at six o clock I can tell you After this doctor Crofts ventured to ask his lordship as to what special physical deficiency his own aid was invoked at the present time Ah I was just coming to that said the earl They tell me it s a very dangerous practice to go to sleep after dinner It s not very uncommon at any rate said the doctor I suppose not but Lady Julia is always at me about it And to tell the truth I think I sleep almost too sound when I get to my arm chair in the drawing room Sometimes my sister really can t wake me so at least she says And how s your appetite at dinner Oh I m quite right there I never eat any luncheon you know and enjoy my dinner thoroughly Then I drink three or four glasses of port wine And feel sleepy afterwards That s just it said the earl It is not perhaps necessary that we should inquire what was the exact nature of the doctor s advice but it was at any rate given in such a way that the earl said he would be glad to see him again And look here Doctor Crofts I m all alone just at present Suppose you come over and dine with me to morrow then if I should go to sleep you know you ll be able to let me know whether Lady Julia doesn t exaggerate Just between ourselves I don t quite believe all she says about my my snoring you know Whether it was that the earl restrained his appetite when at dinner under the doctor s eyes or whether the mid day mutton chop which had been ordered for him had the desired effect or whether the doctor s conversation was more lively than that of the Lady Julia we will not say but the earl on the evening in question was triumphant As he sat in his easy chair after dinner he hardly winked above once or twice and when he had taken the large bowl of tea which he usually swallowed in a semi somnolent condition he was quite lively Ah yes he said jumping up and rubbing his eyes I think I do feel lighter I enjoy a snooze after dinner I do indeed I like it but then when one comes to go to bed one does it in such a sneaking sort of way as though one were in disgrace And my sister she thinks it a crime literally a sin to go to sleep in a chair Nobody ever caught her napping By the by doctor Crofts did you know that mister Crosbie whom Bernard Dale brought down to Allington Lady Julia and he are staying at the same house now I met him once at missus Dale s Going to marry one of the girls isn t he Whereupon doctor Crofts explained that mister Crosbie was engaged to Lilian Dale Ah yes a nice girl I m told You know all those Dales are connections of ours My sister Fanny married their uncle Orlando My brother in law doesn t like travelling and so I don t see very much of him but of course I m interested about the family They re very old friends of mine said Crofts Yes I daresay There are two girls are there not Yes two And Miss Lily is the youngest There s nothing about the elder one getting married is there I ve not heard anything of it A very pretty girl she is too I remember seeing her at her uncle s last year I shouldn t wonder if she were to marry her cousin Bernard He is to have the property you know and he s my nephew I m not quite sure that it s a good thing for cousins to marry said Crofts They do you know very often and it suits some family arrangements I suppose Dale must provide for them and that would take one off his hands without any trouble doctor Crofts didn t exactly see the matter in this light but he was not anxious to argue it very closely with the earl The younger one he said has provided for herself What by getting a husband But I suppose Dale must give her something They re not married yet you know and from what I hear that fellow may prove a slippery customer He ll not marry her unless old Dale gives her something You ll see if he does I m told that he has got another string to his bow at Courcy Castle Soon after this Crofts took his horse and rode home having promised the earl that he would dine with him again before long It ll be a great convenience to me if you d come about that time said the earl and as you re a bachelor perhaps you won t mind it You ll come on Thursday at seven will you Take care of yourself It s as dark as pitch John go and open the first gates for doctor Crofts And then the earl took himself off to bed Crofts as he rode home could not keep his mind from thinking of the two girls at Allington He ll not marry her unless old Dale gives her something Had it come to that with the world that a man must be bribed into keeping his engagement with a lady Was there no romance left among mankind no feeling of chivalry He s got another string to his bow at Courcy Castle said the earl and his lordship seemed to be in no degree shocked as he said it It was in this tone that men spoke of women now a days and yet he himself had felt such awe of the girl he loved and such a fear lest he might injure her in her worldly position that he had not dared to tell her that he loved her CHAPTER XXI JOHN EAMES ENCOUNTERS TWO ADVENTURES AND DISPLAYS GREAT COURAGE IN BOTH Lily thought that her lover s letter was all that it should be She was not quite aware what might be the course of post between Courcy and Allington and had not therefore felt very grievously disappointed when the letter did not come on the very first day She had however in the course of the morning walked down to the post office in order that she might be sure that it was not remaining there Why miss they be all delivered you know that said missus Crump the post mistress But one might be left behind I thought John Postman went up to the house this very day with a newspaper for your mamma I can t make letters for people if folks don t write them But they are left behind sometimes missus Crump He wouldn t come up with one letter if he d got nothing else for anybody in the street Indeed but he would then I wouldn t let him leave a letter here no how nor yet a paper It s no good you re coming down here for letters Miss Lily If he don t write to you I can t make him do it And so poor Lily went home discomforted But the letter came on the next morning and all was right According to her judgment it lacked nothing either in fulness or in affection When he told her how he had planned his early departure in order that he might avoid the pain of parting with her on the last moment she smiled and pressed the paper and rejoiced inwardly that she had got the better of him as to that manoeuvre And then she kissed the words which told her that he had been glad to have her with him at the last moment When he declared that he had been happier at Allington than he was at Courcy she believed him thoroughly and rejoiced that it should be so And when he accused himself of being worldly she excused him persuading herself that he was nearly perfect in this respect as in others Of course a man living in London and having to earn his bread out in the world must be more worldly than a country girl but the fact of his being able to love such a girl to choose such a one for his wife was not that alone sufficient proof that the world had not enslaved him My heart is on the Allington lawns he said and then as she read the words she kissed the paper again In her eyes and to her ears and to her heart the letter was a beautiful letter I believe there is no bliss greater than that which a thorough love letter gives to a girl who knows that in receiving it she commits no fault who can open it before her father and mother with nothing more than the slight blush which the consciousness of her position gives her And of all love letters the first must be the sweetest What a value there is in every word How each expression is scanned and turned to the best account With what importance are all those little phrases invested which too soon become mere phrases used as a matter of course Crosbie had finished his letter by bidding God bless her And you too said Lily pressing the letter to her bosom Does he say anything particular asked missus Dale Yes mamma it s all very particular But there s nothing for the public ear He sends his love to you and Bell We are very much obliged to him So you ought to be And he says that he went to church going through Barchester and that the clergyman was the grandfather of that Lady Dumbello When he got to Courcy Castle Lady Dumbello was there What a singular coincidence said missus Dale I won t tell you a word more about his letter said Lily So she folded it up and put it in her pocket But as soon as she found herself alone in her own room she had it out again and read it over some half a dozen times That was the occupation of her morning that and the manufacture of some very intricate piece of work which was intended for the adornment of mister Crosbie s person Her hands however were very full of work or rather she intended that they should be full She would take with her to her new home when she was married all manner of household gear the produce of her own industry and economy She had declared that she wanted to do something for her future husband and she would begin that something at once And in this matter she did not belie her promises to herself or allow her good intentions to evaporate unaccomplished She soon surrounded herself with harder tasks than those embroidered slippers with which she indulged herself immediately after his departure And missus Dale and Bell though in their gentle way they laughed at her nevertheless they worked with her sitting sternly to their long tasks in order that Crosbie s house might not be empty when their darling should go to take her place there as his wife But it was absolutely necessary that the letter should be answered It would in her eyes have been a great sin to have let that day s post go without carrying a letter from her to Courcy Castle a sin of which she felt no temptation to be guilty It was an exquisite pleasure to her to seat herself at her little table with her neat desk and small appurtenances for epistle craft and to feel that she had a letter to write in which she had truly much to say Hitherto her correspondence had been uninteresting and almost weak in its nature From her mother and sister she had hardly yet been parted and though she had other friends she had seldom found herself with very much to tell them by post What could she communicate to Mary Eames at Guestwick which should be in itself exciting as she wrote it When she wrote to John Eames and told Dear John that mamma hoped to have the pleasure of seeing him to tea at such an hour the work of writing was of little moment to her though the note when written became one of the choicest treasures of him to whom it was addressed But now the matter was very different When she saw the words Dearest Adolphus on the paper before her she was startled with their significance And four months ago I had never even heard of him she said to herself almost with awe And now he was more to her and nearer to her than even was her sister or her mother She recollected how she had laughed at him behind his back and called him a swell on the first day of his coming to the Small House and how also she had striven in her innocent way to look her best when called upon to go out and walk with the stranger from London He was no longer a stranger now but her own dearest friend She had put down her pen that she might think of all this by no means for the first time and then resumed it with a sudden start as though fearing that the postman might be in the village before her letter was finished Dearest Adolphus I need not tell you how delighted I was when your letter was brought to me this morning But I will not repeat the whole of her letter here She had no incident to relate none even so interesting as that of mister Crosbie s encounter with mister Harding at Barchester She had met no Lady Dumbello and had no counterpart to Lady Alexandrina of whom as a friend she could say a word in praise John Eames s name she did not mention knowing that John Eames was not a favourite with mister Crosbie nor had she anything to say of John Eames that had not been already said He had indeed promised to come over to Allington but this visit had not been made when Lily wrote her first letter to Crosbie It was a sweet good honest love letter full of assurances of unalterable affection and unlimited confidence indulging in a little quiet fun as to the grandees of Courcy Castle and ending with a promise that she would be happy and contented if she might receive his letters constantly and live with the hope of seeing him at Christmas I am in time missus Crump am I not she said as she walked into the post office Of course you be for the next half hour T postman he bain t stirred from t ale us yet Just put it into t box wull ye But you won t leave it there Leave it there Did you ever hear the like of that If you re afeared to put it in you can take it away that s all about it Miss Lily And then missus Crump turned away to her avocations at the washing tub missus Crump had a bad temper but perhaps she had some excuse A separate call was made upon her time with reference to almost every letter brought to her office and for all this as she often told her friends in profound disgust she received as salary no more than tuppence farden a day It don t find me in shoe leather no more it don t As missus Crump was never seen out of her own house unless it was in church once a month this latter assertion about her shoe leather could hardly have been true Lily had received another letter and had answered it before Eames made his promised visit to Allington He as will be remembered had also had a correspondence He had answered Miss Roper s letter and had since that been living in fear of two things in a lesser fear of some terrible rejoinder from Amelia and in a greater fear of a more terrible visit from his lady love Were she to swoop down in very truth upon his Guestwick home and declare herself to his mother and sister as his affianced bride what mode of escape would then be left for him But this she had not yet done nor had she even answered his cruel missive What an ass I am to be afraid of her he said to himself as he walked along under the elms of Guestwick manor which overspread the road to Allington When he first went over to Allington after his return home he had mounted himself on horseback and had gone forth brilliant with spurs and trusting somewhat to the glories of his dress and gloves But he had then known nothing of Lily s engagement Now he was contented to walk and as he had taken up his slouched hat and stick in the passage of his mother s house he had been very indifferent as to his appearance He walked quickly along the road taking for the first three miles the shade of the Guestwick elms and keeping his feet on the broad greensward which skirts the outside of the earl s palings What an ass I am to be afraid of her And as he swung his big stick in his hand striking a tree here and there and knocking the stones from his path he began to question himself in earnest and to be ashamed of his position in the world Nothing on earth shall make me marry her he said not if they bring a dozen actions against me She knows as well as I do that I have never intended to marry her It s a cheat from beginning to end If she comes down here I ll tell her so before my mother But as the vision of her sudden arrival came before his eyes he acknowledged to himself that he still held her in great fear He had told her that he loved her He had written as much as that If taxed with so much he must confess his sin Then by degrees his mind turned away from Amelia Roper to Lily Dale not giving him a prospect much more replete with enjoyment than that other one He had said that he would call at Allington before he returned to town and he was now redeeming his promise But he did not know why he should go there He felt that he should sit silent and abashed in missus Dale s drawing room confessing by his demeanour that secret which it behoved him now to hide from every one He could not talk easily before Lily nor could he speak to her of the only subject which would occupy his thoughts when in her presence If indeed he might find her alone But perhaps that might be worse for him than any other condition When he was shown into the drawing room there was nobody there They were here a minute ago all three said the servant girl If you ll walk down the garden mister John you ll be sure to find some of em So John Eames with a little hesitation walked down the garden First of all he went the whole way round the walks meeting nobody Then he crossed the lawn returning again to the farther end and there emerging from the little path which led from the Great House he encountered Lily alone Oh John she said how d ye do I m afraid you did not find anybody in the house Mamma and Bell are with Hopkins away in the large kitchen garden I ve just come over said Eames because I promised I said I d come before I went back to London And they ll be very glad to see you and so am I Shall we go after them into the other grounds But perhaps you walked over and are tired I did walk said Eames not that I am very tired But in truth he did not wish to go after missus Dale though he was altogether at a loss as to what he would say to Lily while remaining with her He had fancied that he would like to have some opportunity of speaking to her alone before he went away of making some special use of the last interview which he should have with her before she became a married woman But now the opportunity was there and he hardly dared to avail himself of it You ll stay and dine with us said Lily No I ll not do that for I especially told my mother that I would be back I m sure it was very good of you to walk so far to see us If you really are not tired I think we will go to mamma as she would be very sorry to miss you This she said remembering at the moment what had been Crosbie s injunctions to her about John Eames But John had resolved that he would say those words which he had come to speak and that as Lily was there with him he would avail himself of the chance which fortune had given him I don t think I ll go into the squire s garden he said Uncle Christopher is not there He is about the farm somewhere If you don t mind Lily I think I ll stay here I suppose they ll be back soon Of course I should like to see them before I go away to London But Lily I came over now chiefly to see you It was you who asked me to promise Had Crosbie been right in those remarks of his Had she been imprudent in her little endeavour to be cordially kind to her old friend Shall we go into the drawing room she said feeling that she would be in some degree safer there than out among the shrubs and paths of the garden And I think she was right in this A man will talk of love out among the lilacs and roses who would be stricken dumb by the demure propriety of the four walls of a drawing room John Eames also had some feeling of this kind for he determined to remain out in the garden if he could so manage it I don t want to go in unless you wish it he said Indeed I d rather stay here So Lily you re going to be married And thus he rushed at once into the middle of his discourse Yes said she I believe I am I have not told you yet that I congratulated you I have known very well that you did so in your heart I have always been sure that you wished me well Indeed I have And if congratulating a person is hoping that she may always be happy I do congratulate you But Lily And then he paused abashed by the beauty purity and woman s grace which had forced him to love her I think I understand all that you would say I do not want ordinary words to tell me that I am to count you among my best friends No Lily you don t understand all that I would say You have never known how often and how much I have thought of you how dearly I have loved you John you must not talk of that now I cannot go without telling you When I came over here and missus Dale told me that you were to be married to that man You must not speak of mister Crosbie in that way she said turning upon him almost fiercely I did not mean to say anything disrespectful of him to you I should hate myself if I were to do so Of course you like him better than anybody else I love him better than all the world besides And so do I love you better than all the world besides And as he spoke he got up from his seat and stood before her I know how poor I am and unworthy of you and only that you are engaged to him I don t suppose that I should now tell you Of course you couldn t accept such a one as me But I have loved you ever since you remember and now that you are going to be his wife I cannot but tell you that it is so You will go and live in London but as to my seeing you there it will be impossible I could not go into that man s house Oh John No never not if you become his wife I have loved you as well as he does When missus Dale told me of it I thought I should have fallen I went away without seeing you because I was unable to speak to you I made a fool of myself and have been a fool all along I am foolish now to tell you this but I cannot help it You will forget it all when you meet some girl that you can really love And have I not really loved you Well never mind I have said what I came to say and I will now go If it ever happens that we are down in the country together perhaps I may see you again but never in London Good by Lily And he put out his hand to her ILLUSTRATION And have I not really loved you And won t you stay for mamma she said No Give her my love and to Bell They understand all about it They will know why I have gone If ever you should want anybody to do anything for you remember that I will do it whatever it is And as he paced away from her across the lawn the special deed in her favour to which his mind was turned that one thing which he most longed to do on her behalf was an act of corporal chastisement upon Crosbie If Crosbie would but ill treat her ill treat her with some antenuptial barbarity and if only he could be called in to avenge her wrongs And as he made his way back along the road towards Guestwick he built up within his own bosom a castle in the air for her part in which Lily Dale would by no means have thanked him Lily when she was left alone burst into tears She had certainly said very little to encourage her forlorn suitor and had so borne herself during the interview that even Crosbie could hardly have been dissatisfied but now that Eames was gone her heart became very tender towards him She felt that she did love him also not at all as she loved Crosbie but still with a love that was tender soft and true If Crosbie could have known all her thoughts at that moment I doubt whether he would have liked them She burst into tears and then hurried away into some nook where she could not be seen by her mother and Bell on their return Eames went on his way walking very quietly swinging his stick and kicking through the dust with his heart full of the scene which had just passed He was angry with himself thinking that he had played his part badly accusing himself in that he had been rough to her and selfish in the expression of his love and he was angry with her because she had declared to him that she loved Crosbie better than all the world besides He knew that of course she must do so that at any rate it was to be expected that such was the case Yet he thought she might have refrained from saying so to him She chooses to scorn me now he said to himself but the time may come when she will wish that she had scorned him That Crosbie was wicked bad and selfish he believed most fully He felt sure that the man would ill use her and make her wretched He had some slight doubt whether he would marry her and from this doubt he endeavoured to draw a scrap of comfort If Crosbie would desert her and if to him might be accorded the privilege of beating the man to death with his fists because of this desertion then the world would not be quite blank for him In all this he was no doubt very cruel to Lily but then had not Lily been very cruel to him He was still thinking of these things when he came to the first of the Guestwick pastures The boundary of the earl s property was very plainly marked for with it commenced also the shady elms along the roadside and the broad green margin of turf grateful equally to those who walked and to those who rode Eames had got himself on to the grass but in the fulness of his thoughts was unconscious of the change in his path when he was startled by a voice in the next field and the loud bellowing of a bull Lord De Guest s choice cattle he knew were there and there was one special bull which was esteemed by his lordship as of great value and regarded as a high favourite The people about the place declared that the beast was vicious but Lord De Guest had often been heard to boast that it was never vicious with him The boys tease him and the men are almost worse than the boys said the earl but he ll never hurt any one that has not hurt him Guided by faith in his own teaching the earl had taught himself to look upon his bull as a large horned innocent lamb of the flock As Eames paused on the road he fancied that he recognized the earl s voice and it was the voice of one in distress Then the bull s roar sounded very plain in his ear and almost close upon hearing which he rushed on to the gate and without much thinking what he was doing vaulted over it and advanced a few steps into the field Halloo shouted the earl There s a man Come on And then his continued shoutings hardly formed themselves into intelligible words but Eames plainly understood that he was invoking assistance under great pressure and stress of circumstances The bull was making short runs at his owner as though determined in each run to have a toss at his lordship and at each run the earl would retreat quickly for a few paces but he retreated always facing his enemy and as the animal got near to him would make digs at his face with the long spud which he carried in his hand But in thus making good his retreat he had been unable to keep in a direct line to the gate and there seemed to be great danger lest the bull should succeed in pressing him up against the hedge Come on shouted the earl who was fighting his battle manfully but was by no means anxious to carry off all the laurels of the victory himself Come on I say Then he stopped in his path shouted into the bull s face brandished his spud and threw about his arms thinking that he might best dismay the beast by the display of these warlike gestures Johnny Eames ran on gallantly to the peer s assistance as he would have run to that of any peasant in the land He was one to whom I should be perhaps wrong to attribute at this period of his life the gift of very high courage He feared many things which no man should fear but he did not fear personal mishap or injury to his own skin and bones When Cradell escaped out of the house in Burton Crescent making his way through the passage into the outer air he did so because he feared that Lupex would beat him or kick him or otherwise ill use him John Eames would also have desired to escape under similar circumstances but he would have so desired because he could not endure to be looked upon in his difficulties by the people of the house and because his imagination would have painted the horrors of a policeman dragging him off with a black eye and a torn coat There was no one to see him now and no policeman to take offence Therefore he rushed to the earl s assistance brandishing his stick and roaring in emulation of the bull When the animal saw with what unfairness he was treated and that the number of his foes was doubled while no assistance had lent itself on his side he stood for a while disgusted by the injustice of humanity He stopped and throwing his head up to the heavens bellowed out his complaint Don t come close said the earl who was almost out of breath Keep a little apart Ugh ugh whoop whoop And he threw up his arms manfully jobbing about with his spud ever and anon rubbing the perspiration from off his eyebrows with the back of his hand As the bull stood pausing meditating whether under such circumstances flight would not be preferable to gratified passion Eames made a rush in at him attempting to hit him on the head The earl seeing this advanced a step also and got his spud almost up to the animal s eye But these indignities the beast could not stand He made a charge bending his head first towards John Eames and then with that weak vacillation which is as disgraceful in a bull as in a general he changed his purpose and turned his horns upon his other enemy The consequence was that his steps carried him in between the two and that the earl and Eames found themselves for a while behind his tail Now for the gate said the earl Slowly does it slowly does it don t run said Johnny assuming in the heat of the moment a tone of counsel which would have been very foreign to him under other circumstances The earl was not a whit offended All right said he taking with a backward motion the direction of the gate Then as the bull again faced towards him he jumped from the ground labouring painfully with arms and legs and ever keeping his spud well advanced against the foe Eames holding his position a little apart from his friend stooped low and beat the ground with his stick and as though defying the creature The bull felt himself defied stood still and roared and then made another vacillating attack Hold on till we reach the gate said Eames Ugh ugh Whoop whoop shouted the earl And so gradually they made good their ground Now get over said Eames when they had both reached the corner of the field in which the gate stood And what ll you do said the earl I ll go at the hedge to the right And Johnny as he spoke dashed his stick about so as to monopolize for a moment the attention of the brute The earl made a spring at the gate and got well on to the upper rung The bull seeing that his prey was going made a final rush upon the earl and struck the timber furiously with his head knocking his lordship down on the other side Lord De Guest was already over but not off the rail and thus though he fell he fell in safety on the sward beyond the gate He fell in safety but utterly exhausted Eames as he had purposed made a leap almost sideways at a thick hedge which divided the field from one of the Guestwick copses There was a fairly broad ditch and on the other side a quickset hedge which had however been weakened and injured by trespassers at this corner close to the gate Eames was young and active and jumped well He jumped so well that he carried his body full into the middle of the quickset and then scrambled through to the other side not without much injury to his clothes and some damage also to his hands and face The beast recovering from his shock against the wooden bars looked wistfully at his last retreating enemy as he still struggled amidst the bushes He looked at the ditch and at the broken hedge but he did not understand how weak were the impediments in his way He had knocked his head against the stout timber which was strong enough to oppose him but was dismayed by the brambles which he might have trodden under foot without an effort How many of us are like the bull turning away conquered by opposition which should be as nothing to us and breaking our feet and worse still our hearts against rocks of adamant The bull at last made up his mind that he did not dare to face the hedge so he gave one final roar and then turning himself round walked placidly back amidst the herd Johnny made his way on to the road by a stile that led out of the copse and was soon standing over the earl while the blood ran down his cheeks from the scratches One of the legs of his trowsers had been caught by a stake and was torn from the hip downward and his hat was left in the field the only trophy for the bull I hope you re not hurt my lord he said Oh dear no but I m terribly out of breath Why you re bleeding all over He didn t get at you did he It s only the thorns in the hedge said Johnny passing his hand over his face But I ve lost my hat There are plenty more hats said the earl I think I ll have a try for it said Johnny with whom the means of getting hats had not been so plentiful as with the earl He looks quiet now And he moved towards the gate But Lord De Guest jumped upon his feet and seized the young man by the collar of his coat Go after your hat said he You must be a fool to think of it If you re afraid of catching cold you shall have mine I m not the least afraid of catching cold said Johnny Is he often like that my lord And he made a motion with his head towards the bull The gentlest creature alive he s like a lamb generally just like a lamb Perhaps he saw my red pocket handkerchief And Lord De Guest showed his friend that he carried such an article But where should I have been if you hadn t come up You d have got to the gate my lord Yes with my feet foremost and four men carrying me I m very thirsty You don t happen to carry a flask do you No my lord I don t Then we ll make the best of our way home and have a glass of wine there And on this occasion his lordship intended that his offer should be accepted CHAPTER XXII LORD DE GUEST AT HOME ILLUSTRATION untitled The earl and John Eames after their escape from the bull walked up to the Manor House together You can write a note to your mother and I ll send it by one of the boys said the earl This was his lordship s answer when Eames declined to dine at the Manor House because he would be expected home But I m so badly off for clothes my lord pleaded Johnny I tore my trowsers in the hedge There will be nobody there beside us two and doctor Crofts The doctor will forgive you when he hears the story and as for me I didn t care if you hadn t a stitch to your back You ll have company back to Guestwick so come along Eames had no further excuse to offer and therefore did as he was bidden He was by no means as much at home with the earl now as during those minutes of the combat He would rather have gone home being somewhat ashamed of being seen in his present tattered and bare headed condition by the servants of the house and moreover his mind would sometimes revert to the scene which had taken place in the garden at Allington But he found himself obliged to obey the earl and so he walked on with him through the woods The earl did not say very much being tired and somewhat thoughtful In what little he did say he seemed to be specially hurt by the ingratitude of the bull towards himself I never teased him or annoyed him in any way I suppose they are dangerous beasts said Eames Not a bit of it if they re properly treated It must have been my handkerchief I suppose I remember that I did blow my nose He hardly said a word in the way of thanks to his assistant Where should I have been if you had not come to me he had exclaimed immediately after his deliverance but having said that he didn t think it necessary to say much more to Eames But he made himself very pleasant and by the time he had reached the house his companion was almost glad that he had been forced to dine at the Manor House And now we ll have a drink said the earl I don t know how you feel but I never was so thirsty in my life Two servants immediately showed themselves and evinced some surprise at Johnny s appearance Has the gentleman hurt hisself my lord asked the butler looking at the blood upon our friend s face He has hurt his trowsers the worst I believe said the earl And if he was to put on any of mine they d be too short and too big wouldn t they I am sorry you should be so uncomfortable but you mustn t mind it for once I don t mind it a bit said Johnny And I m sure I don t said the earl mister Eames is going to dine here Vickers Yes my lord And his hat is down in the middle of the nineteen acres Let three or four men go for it Three or four men my lord Yes three or four men There s something gone wrong with that bull And you must get a boy with a pony to take a note into Guestwick to missus Eames Oh dear I m better now and he put down the tumbler from which he d been drinking Write your note here and then we ll go and see my pet pheasants before dinner Vickers and the footman knew that something had happened of much moment for the earl was usually very particular about his dinner table He expected every guest who sat there to be dressed in such guise as the fashion of the day demanded and he himself though his morning costume was by no means brilliant never dined even when alone without having put himself into a suit of black with a white cravat and having exchanged the old silver hunting watch which he carried during the day tied round his neck by a bit of old ribbon for a small gold watch with a chain and seals which in the evening always dangled over his waistcoat doctor Gruffen had once been asked to dinner at Guestwick Manor Just a bachelor s chop said the earl for there s nobody at home but myself Whereupon doctor Gruffen had come in coloured trowsers and had never again been asked to dine at Guestwick Manor All this Vickers knew well and now his lordship had brought young Eames home to dine with him with his clothes all hanging about him in a manner which Vickers declared in the servants hall wasn t more than half decent Therefore they all knew that something very particular must have happened It s some trouble about the bull I know said Vickers but bless you the bull couldn t have tore his things in that way Eames wrote his note in which he told his mother that he had had an adventure with Lord De Guest and that his lordship had insisted on bringing him home to dinner I have torn my trowsers all to pieces he added in a postscript and have lost my hat Everything else is all right He was not aware that the earl also sent a short note to missus Eames DEAR MADAM ran the earl s note Your son has under Providence probably saved my life I will leave the story for him to tell He has been good enough to accompany me home and will return to Guestwick after dinner with doctor Crofts who dines here I congratulate you on having a son with so much cool courage and good feeling Your very faithful servant DE GUEST Guestwick Manor Thursday October one hundred eighty six And then they went to see the pheasants Now I ll tell you what said the earl I advise you to take to shooting It s the amusement of a gentleman when a man chances to have the command of game But I m always up in London No you re not You re not up in London now You always have your holidays If you choose to try it I ll see that you have shooting enough while you re here It s better than going to sleep under the trees Ha ha ha I wonder what made you lay yourself down there You hadn t been fighting a bull that day No my lord I hadn t seen the bull then Well you think of what I ve been saying When I say a thing I mean it You shall have shooting enough if you have a mind to try it Then they looked at the pheasants and pottered about the place till the earl said it was time to dress for dinner That s hard upon you isn t it said he But at any rate you can wash your hands and get rid of the blood I ll be down in the little drawing room five minutes before seven and I suppose I ll find you there At five minutes before seven Lord De Guest came into the small drawing room and found Johnny seated there with a book before him The earl was a little fussy and showed by his manner that he was not quite at his ease as some men do when they have any piece of work on hand which is not customary to them He held something in his hand and shuffled a little as he made his way up the room He was dressed as usual in black but his gold chain was not as usual dangling over his waistcoat Eames he said I want you to accept a little present from me just as a memorial of our affair with the bull It will make you think of it sometimes when I m perhaps gone Oh my lord It s my own watch that I have been wearing for some time but I ve got another two or three I believe somewhere upstairs You mustn t refuse me I can t bear being refused There are two or three little seals too which I have worn I have taken off the one with my arms because that s of no use to you and it is to me It doesn t want a key but winds up at the handle in this way and the earl proceeded to explain the nature of the toy My lord you think too much of what happened to day said Eames stammering No I don t I think very little about it I know what I think of Put the watch in your pocket before the doctor comes There I hear his horse Why didn t he drive over and then he could have taken you back I can walk very well I ll make that all right The servant shall ride Crofts horse and bring back the little phaeton How d you do doctor You know Eames I suppose You needn t look at him in that way His leg is not broken it s only his trowsers And then the earl told the story of the bull Johnny will become quite a hero in town said Crofts Yes I fear he ll get the most of the credit and yet I was at it twice as long as he was I ll tell you what young men when I got to that gate I didn t think I d breath enough left in me to get over it It s all very well jumping into a hedge when you re only two and twenty but when a man comes to be sixty he likes to take his time about such things Dinner ready is it So am I I quite forgot that mutton chop of yours to day doctor But I suppose a man may eat a good dinner after a fight with a bull The evening passed by without any very pleasurable excitement and I regret to say that the earl went fast to sleep in the drawing room as soon as he had swallowed his cup of coffee During dinner he had been very courteous to both his guests but towards Eames he had used a good humoured and almost affectionate familiarity He had quizzed him for having been found asleep under the tree telling Crofts that he had looked very forlorn So that I haven t a doubt about his being in love said the earl And he had asked Johnny to tell the name of the fair one bringing up the remnants of his half forgotten classicalities to bear out the joke If I am to take more of the severe Falernian said he laying his hand on the decanter of port I must know the lady s name Whoever she be I m well sure you need not blush for her What you refuse to tell Then I ll drink no more And so the earl had walked out of the dining room but not till he had perceived by his guest s cheeks that the joke had been too true to be pleasant As he went however he leaned with his hand on Eames s shoulder and the servants looking on saw that the young man was to be a favourite He ll make him his heir said Vickers I shouldn t wonder a bit if he don t make him his heir But to this the footman objected endeavouring to prove to mister Vickers that in accordance with the law of the land his lordship s second cousin once removed whom the earl had never seen but whom he was supposed to hate must be his heir A hearl can never choose his own heir like you or me said the footman laying down the law Can t he though really now That s very hard on him isn t it said the pretty housemaid Psha said Vickers you know nothing about it My lord could make young Eames his heir to morrow that is the heir of his property He couldn t make him a hearl because that must go to the heirs of his body As to his leaving him the place here I don t just know how that d be and I m sure Richard don t But suppose he hasn t got any heirs of his body asked the pretty housemaid who was rather fond of putting down mister Vickers He must have heirs of his body said the butler Everybody has em If a man don t know em himself the law finds em out And then mister Vickers walked away avoiding further dispute In the meantime the earl was asleep upstairs and the two young men from Guestwick did not find that they could amuse themselves with any satisfaction Each took up a book but there are times at which a man is quite unable to read and when a book is only a cover for his idleness or dulness At last doctor Crofts suggested in a whisper that they might as well begin to think of going home Eh yes what said the earl I m not asleep In answer to which the doctor said that he thought he d go home if his lordship would let him order his horse But the earl was again fast bound in slumber and took no further notice of the proposition Perhaps we could get off without waking him suggested Eames in a whisper Eh what said the earl So they both resumed their books and submitted themselves to their martyrdom for a further period of fifteen minutes At the expiration of that time the footman brought in tea Eh what tea said the earl Yes we ll have a little tea I ve heard every word you ve been saying It was that assertion on the part of the earl which always made Lady Julia so angry You cannot have heard what I have been saying Theodore because I have said nothing she would reply But I should have heard it if you had the earl would rejoin snappishly On the present occasion neither Crofts nor Eames contradicted him and he took his tea and swallowed it while still three parts asleep If you ll allow me my lord I think I ll order my horse said the doctor Yes horse yes said the earl nodding But what are you to do Eames if I ride said the doctor I ll walk whispered Eames in his very lowest voice What what what said the earl jumping up on his feet Oh ah yes going away are you I suppose you might as well as sit here and see me sleeping But doctor I didn t snore did I Only occasionally Not loud did I Come Eames did I snore loud Well my lord you did snore rather loud two or three times Did I said the earl in a voice of great disappointment And yet do you know I heard every word you said The small phaeton had been already ordered and the two young men started back to Guestwick together a servant from the house riding the doctor s horse behind them Look here Eames said the earl as they parted on the steps of the hall door You re going back to town the day after to morrow you say so I shan t see you again No my lord said Johnny Look you here now I shall be up for the Cattle show before Christmas You must dine with me at my hotel on the twenty second of December Pawkins s in Jermyn Street seven o clock sharp Mind you do not forget now Put it down in your pocket book when you get home Good by doctor good by I see I must stick to that mutton chop in the middle of the day And then they drove off He ll make him his heir for certain said Vickers to himself as he slowly returned to his own quarters You were returning from Allington I suppose said Crofts when you came across Lord De Guest and the bull Yes I just walked over to say good by to them Did you find them all well I only saw one The other two were out missus Dale was it No it was Lily Sitting alone thinking of her fine London lover of course I suppose we ought to look upon her as a very lucky girl I have no doubt she thinks herself so I m sure I don t know said Johnny I believe he s a very good young man said the doctor but I can t say I quite liked his manner I should think not said Johnny But then in all probability he did not like mine a bit better or perhaps yours either And if so it s all fair I don t see that it s a bit fair He s a snob said Eames and I don t believe that I am He had taken a glass or two of the earl s severe Falernian and was disposed to a more generous confidence and perhaps also to stronger language than might otherwise have been the case No I don t think he is a snob said Crofts Had he been so missus Dale would have perceived it You ll see said Johnny touching up the earl s horse with energy as he spoke You ll see A man who gives himself airs is a snob and he gives himself airs And I don t believe he s a straightforward fellow It was a bad day for us all when he came among them at Allington I can t say that I see that I do But mind I haven t spoken a word of this to any one And I don t mean What would be the good I suppose she must marry him now Of course she must And be wretched all her life Oh h h h and he muttered a deep groan I ll tell you what it is Crofts He is going to take the sweetest girl out of this country that ever was in it and he don t deserve her I don t think she can be compared to her sister said Crofts slowly What not Lily said Eames as though the proposition made by the doctor were one that could not hold water for a minute I have always thought that Bell was the more admired of the two said Crofts I ll tell you what said Eames I have never yet set my eyes on any human creature whom I thought so beautiful as Lily Dale And now that beast is going to marry her I ll tell you what Crofts I ll manage to pick a quarrel with him yet Whereupon the doctor seeing the nature of the complaint from which his companion was suffering said nothing more either about Lily or about Bell Soon after this Eames was at his own door and was received there by his mother and sister with all the enthusiasm due to a hero He has saved the earl s life missus Eames had exclaimed to her daughter on reading Lord De Guest s note Oh goodness and she threw herself back upon the sofa almost in a fainting condition Saved Lord De Guest s life said Mary Yes under Providence said missus Eames as though that latter fact added much to her son s good deed But how did he do it By cool courage and good feeling so his lordship says But I wonder how he really did do it Whatever way it was he s torn all his clothes and lost his hat said Mary I don t care a bit about that said missus Eames I wonder whether the earl has any interest at the Income tax What a thing it would be if he could get Johnny a step It would be seventy pounds a year at once He was quite right to stay and dine when his lordship asked him And so doctor Crofts is there It couldn t have been anything in the doctoring way I suppose No I should say not because of what he says of his trowsers And so the two ladies were obliged to wait for John s return How did you do it John said his mother embracing him as soon as the door was opened How did you save the earl s life said Mary who was standing behind her mother Would his lordship really have been killed if it had not been for you asked missus Eames And was he very much hurt asked Mary Oh bother said Johnny on whom the results of the day s work together with the earl s Falernian had made some still remaining impression On ordinary occasions missus Eames would have felt hurt at being so answered by her son but at the present moment she regarded him as standing so high in general favour that she took no offence Oh Johnny do tell us Of course we must be very anxious to know it all There s nothing to tell except that a bull ran at the earl as I was going by so I went into the field and helped him and then he made me stay and dine with him But his lordship says that you saved his life said Mary Under Providence added their mother At any rate he has given me a gold watch and chain said Johnny drawing the present out of his pocket I wanted a watch badly All the same I didn t like taking it It would have been very wrong to refuse said his mother And I am so glad you have been so fortunate And look here Johnny when a friend like that comes in your way don t turn your back on him Then at last he thawed beneath their kindness and told them the whole of the story I fear that in recounting the earl s efforts with the spud he hardly spoke of his patron with all that deference which would have been appropriate CHAPTER XXIII mister PLANTAGENET PALLISER A week passed over mister Crosbie s head at Courcy Castle without much inconvenience to him from the well known fact of his matrimonial engagement Both George De Courcy and John De Courcy had in their different ways charged him with his offence and endeavoured to annoy him by recurring to the subject but he did not care much for the wit or malice of George or John De Courcy The countess had hardly alluded to Lily Dale after those few words which she said on the first day of his visit and seemed perfectly willing to regard his doings at Allington as the occupation natural to a young man in such a position He had been seduced down to a dull country house and had as a matter of course taken to such amusements as the place afforded He had shot the partridges and made love to the young lady taking those little recreations as compensation for the tedium of the squire s society Perhaps he had gone a little too far with the young lady but then no one knew better than the countess how difficult it is for a young man to go far enough without going too far It was not her business to make herself a censor on a young man s conduct The blame no doubt rested quite as much with Miss Dale as with him She was quite sorry that any young lady should be disappointed but if girls will be imprudent and set their caps at men above their mark they must encounter disappointment With such language did Lady De Courcy speak of the affair among her daughters and her daughters altogether agreed with her that it was out of the question that mister Crosbie should marry Lily Dale From Alexandrina he encountered during the week none of that raillery which he had expected He had promised to explain to her before he left the castle all the circumstances of his acquaintance with Lily and she at last showed herself determined to demand the fulfilment of this promise but previous to that she said nothing to manifest either offence or a lessened friendship And I regret to say that in the intercourse which had taken place between them that friendship was by no means less tender that it had been in London And when will you tell me what you promised she asked him one afternoon speaking in a low voice as they were standing together at the window of the billiard room in that idle half hour which always occurs before the necessity for dinner preparation has come She had been riding and was still in her habit and he had returned from shooting She knew that she looked more than ordinarily well in her tall straight hat and riding gear and was wont to hang about the house walking skilfully with her upheld drapery during this period of the day It was dusk but not dark and there was no artificial light in the billiard room There had been some pretence of knocking about the balls but it had been only pretence Even Diana she had said could not have played billiards in a habit Then she had put down her mace and they had stood talking together in the recess of a large bow window And what did I promise said Crosbie You know well enough Not that it is a matter of any special interest to me only as you undertook to promise of course my curiosity has been raised If it be of no special interest said Crosbie you will not object to absolve me from my promise That is just like you she said And how false you men always are You made up your mind to buy my silence on a distasteful subject by pretending to offer me your future confidence and now you tell me that you do not mean to confide in me You begin by telling me that the matter is one that does not in the least interest you That is so false again You know very well what I meant Do you remember what you said to me the day you came and am I not bound to tell you after that that your marriage with this or that young lady is not matter of special interest to me Still as your friend Well as my friend I shall be glad to know But I am not going to beg for your confidence only I tell you this fairly that no man is so mean in my eyes as a man who fights under false colours And am I fighting under false colours Yes you are And now as she spoke the Lady Alexandrina blushed beneath her hat and dull as was the remaining light of the evening Crosbie looking into her face saw her heightened colour Yes you are A gentleman is fighting under false colours who comes into a house like this with a public rumour of his being engaged and then conducts himself as though nothing of the kind existed Of course it is not anything to me specially but that is fighting under false colours Now sir you may redeem the promise you made me when you first came here or you may let it alone It must be acknowledged that the lady was fighting her battle with much courage and also with some skill In three or four days Crosbie would be gone and this victory if it were ever to be gained must be gained in those three or four days And if there were to be no victory then it would be only fair that Crosbie should be punished for his duplicity and that she should be avenged as far as any revenge might be in her power Not that she meditated any deep revenge or was prepared to feel any strong anger She liked Crosbie as well as she had ever liked any man She believed that he liked her also She had no conception of any very strong passion but conceived that a married life was more pleasant than one of single bliss She had no doubt that he had promised to make Lily Dale his wife but so had he previously promised her or nearly so It was a fair game and she would win it if she could If she failed she would show her anger but she would show it in a mild weak manner turning up her nose at Lily before Crosbie s face and saying little things against himself behind his back Her wrath would not carry her much beyond that Now sir you may redeem the promise you made me when you first came here or you may let it alone So she spoke and then she turned her face away from him gazing out into the darkness Alexandrina he said Well sir But you have no right to speak to me in that style You know that you have no right to call me by my name in that way You mean that you insist upon your title All ladies insist on what you call their title from gentlemen except under the privilege of greater intimacy than you have the right to claim You did not call Miss Dale by her Christian name till you had obtained permission I suppose You used to let me call you so Never Once or twice when you have done so I have not forbidden it as I should have done Very well sir as you have nothing to tell me I will leave you I must confess that I did not think you were such a coward And she prepared to go gathering up the skirts of her habit and taking up the whip which she had laid on the window sill Stay a moment Alexandrina he said I am not happy and you should not say words intended to make me more miserable And why are you unhappy Because I will tell you instantly if I may believe that I am telling you only and not the whole household Of course I shall not talk of it to others Do you think that I cannot keep a secret It is because I have promised to marry one woman and because I love another I have told you everything now and if you choose to say again that I am fighting under false colours I will leave the castle before you can see me again mister Crosbie 
5712_48848_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Now you know it all 
none	none	and may imagine whether or no I am very happy I think you said it was time to dress suppose we go And without further speech the two went off to their separate rooms Crosbie as soon as he was alone in his chamber sat himself down in his arm chair and went to work striving to make up his mind as to his future conduct It must not be supposed that the declaration just made by him had been produced solely by his difficulty at the moment The atmosphere of Courcy Castle had been at work upon him for the last week past And every word that he had heard and every word that he had spoken had tended to destroy all that was good and true within him and to foster all that was selfish and false He had said to himself a dozen times during that week that he never could be happy with Lily Dale and that he never could make her happy And then he had used the old sophistry in his endeavour to teach himself that it was right to do that which he wished to do Would it not be better for Lily that he should desert her than marry her against the dictates of his own heart And if he really did not love her would he not be committing a greater crime in marrying her than in deserting her He confessed to himself that he had been very wrong in allowing the outer world to get such a hold upon him that the love of a pure girl like Lily could not suffice for his happiness But there was the fact and he found himself unable to contend against it If by any absolute self sacrifice he could secure Lily s well being he would not hesitate for a moment But would it be well to sacrifice her as well as himself He had discussed the matter in this way within his own breast till he had almost taught himself to believe that it was his duty to break off his engagement with Lily and he had also almost taught himself to believe that a marriage with a daughter of the house of Courcy would satisfy his ambition and assist him in his battle with the world That Lady Alexandrina would accept him he felt certain if he could only induce her to forgive him for his sin in becoming engaged to Miss Dale How very prone she would be to forgiveness in this matter he had not divined having not as yet learned how easily such a woman can forgive such a sin if the ultimate triumph be accorded to herself And there was another reason which operated much with Crosbie urging him on in his present mood and wishes though it should have given an exactly opposite impulse to his heart He had hesitated as to marrying Lily Dale at once because of the smallness of his income Now he had a prospect of considerable increase to that income One of the commissioners at his office had been promoted to some greater commissionership and it was understood by everybody that the secretary at the General Committee Office would be the new commissioner As to that there was no doubt But then the question had arisen as to the place of secretary Crosbie had received two or three letters on the subject and it seemed that the likelihood of his obtaining this step in the world was by no means slight It would increase his official income from seven hundred a year to twelve and would place him altogether above the world His friend the present secretary had written to him assuring him that no other probable competitor was spoken of as being in the field against him If such good fortune awaited him would it not smooth any present difficulty which lay in the way of his marriage with Lily Dale But alas he had not looked at the matter in that light Might not the countess help him to this preferment And if his destiny intended for him the good things of this world secretaryships commissionerships chairmanships and such like would it not be well that he should struggle on in his upward path by such assistance as good connections might give him He sat thinking over it all in his own room on that evening He had written twice to Lily since his arrival at Courcy Castle His first letter has been given His second was written much in the same tone though Lily as she had read it had unconsciously felt somewhat less satisfied than she had been with the first Expressions of love were not wanting but they were vague and without heartiness They savoured of insincerity though there was nothing in the words themselves to convict them Few liars can lie with the full roundness and self sufficiency of truth and Crosbie bad as he was had not yet become bad enough to reach that perfection He had said nothing to Lily of the hopes of promotion which had been opened to him but he had again spoken of his own worldliness acknowledging that he received an unsatisfying satisfaction from the pomps and vanities of Courcy Castle In fact he was paving the way for that which he had almost resolved that he would do now he had told Lady Alexandrina that he loved her and he was obliged to confess to himself that the die was cast As he thought of all this there was not wanting to him some of the satisfaction of an escape Soon after making that declaration of love at Allington he had begun to feel that in making it he had cut his throat He had endeavoured to persuade himself that he could live comfortably with his throat cut in that way and as long as Lily was with him he would believe that he could do so but as soon as he was again alone he would again accuse himself of suicide This was his frame of mind even while he was yet at Allington and his ideas on the subject had become stronger during his sojourn at Courcy But the self immolation had not been completed and he now began to think that he could save himself I need hardly say that this was not all triumph to him Even had there been no material difficulty as to his desertion of Lily no uncle cousin and mother whose anger he must face no vision of a pale face more eloquent of wrong in its silence than even uncle cousin and mother with their indignant storm of words he was not altogether heartless How should he tell all this to the girl who had loved him so well who had so loved him that as he himself felt her love would fashion all her future life either for weal or for woe I am unworthy of her and will tell her so he said to himself How many a false hound of a man has endeavoured to salve his own conscience by such mock humility But he acknowledged at this moment as he rose from his seat to dress himself that the die was cast and that it was open to him now to say what he pleased to Lady Alexandrina Others have gone through the same fire before he said to himself as he walked downstairs and have come out scatheless And then he recalled to himself the names of various men of high repute in the world who were supposed to have committed in their younger days some such little mistake as that into which he had been betrayed In passing through the hall he overtook Lady Julia De Guest and was in time to open for her the door of the drawing room He then remembered that she had come into the billiard room at one side and had gone out at the other while he was standing with Alexandrina at the window He had not however then thought much of Lady Julia and as he now stood for her to pass by him through the door way he made to her some indifferent remark But Lady Julia was on some subjects a stern woman and not without a certain amount of courage In the last week she had seen what had been going on and had become more and more angry Though she had disowned any family connection with Lily Dale nevertheless she now felt for her sympathy and almost affection Nearly every day she had repeated stiffly to the countess some incident of Crosbie s courtship and engagement to Miss Dale speaking of it as with absolute knowledge as a thing settled at all points This she had done to the countess alone in the presence of the countess and Alexandrina and also before all the female guests of the castle But what she had said was received simply with an incredulous smile
5618_48831_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Dear me 
none	none	Lady Julia the countess had replied at last I shall begin to think you are in love with mister Crosbie yourself you harp so constantly on this affair of his One would think that young ladies in your part of the world must find it very difficult to get husbands seeing that the success of one young lady is trumpeted so loudly For the moment Lady Julia was silenced but it was not easy to silence her altogether when she had a subject for speech near her heart Almost all the Courcy world were assembled in the drawing room as she now walked into the room with Crosbie at her heels When she found herself near the crowd she turned round and addressed him in a voice more audible than that generally required for purposes of drawing room conversation mister Crosbie she said have you heard lately from our dear friend Lily Dale And she looked him full in the face in a manner more significant probably than even she had intended it to be There was at once a general hush in the room and all eyes were turned upon her and upon him Crosbie instantly made an effort to bear the attack gallantly but he felt that he could not quite command his colour or prevent a sudden drop of perspiration from showing itself upon his brow I had a letter from Allington yesterday he said I suppose you have heard of your brother s encounter with the bull The bull said Lady Julia And it was instantly manifest to all that her attack had been foiled and her flank turned Good gracious Lady Julia how very odd you are said the countess But what about the bull asked the Honourable George It seems that the earl was knocked down in the middle of one of his own fields Oh dear exclaimed Alexandrina And sundry other exclamations were made by all the assembled ladies But he wasn t hurt said Crosbie A young man named Eames seems to have fallen from the sky and carried off the earl on his back Ha ha ha ha growled the other earl as he heard of the discomfiture of his brother peer Lady Julia who had received her own letters that day from Guestwick knew that nothing of importance had happened to her brother but she felt that she was foiled for that time I hope that there has not really been any accident said mister Gazebee with a voice of great solicitude My brother was quite well last night thank you said she And then the little groups again formed themselves and Lady Julia was left alone on the corner of a sofa Was that all an invention of yours sir said Alexandrina to Crosbie Not quite I did get a letter this morning from my friend Bernard Dale that old harridan s nephew and Lord De Guest has been worried by some of his animals I wish I had told her that his stupid old neck had been broken Fie mister Crosbie What business has she to interfere with me But I mean to ask the same question that she asked and you won t put me off with a cock and bull story like that But then as she was going to ask the question dinner was announced And is it true that De Guest has been tossed by a bull said the earl as soon as the ladies were gone He had spoken nothing during dinner except what words he had muttered into the ear of Lady Dumbello It was seldom that conversation had many charms for him in his own house but there was a savour of pleasantry in the idea of Lord De Guest having been tossed by which even he was tickled Only knocked down I believe said Crosbie Ha ha ha growled the earl then he filled his glass and allowed some one else to pass the bottle Poor man There was not much left to him now in the world which did amuse him I don t see anything to laugh at said Plantagenet Palliser who was sitting at the earl s right hand opposite to Lord Dumbello Don t you said the earl Ha ha ha I ll be shot if I do From all I hear De Guest is an uncommon good farmer And I don t see the joke of tossing a farmer merely because he s a nobleman also Do you and he turned round to mister Gazebee who was sitting on the other side The earl was an earl and was also mister Gazebee s father in law mister Plantagenet Palliser was the heir to a dukedom Therefore mister Gazebee merely simpered and did not answer the question put to him mister Palliser said nothing more about it nor did the earl and then the joke died away mister Plantagenet Palliser was the Duke of Omnium s heir heir to that nobleman s title and to his enormous wealth and therefore was a man of mark in the world He sat in the House of Commons of course He was about five and twenty years of age and was as yet unmarried He did not hunt or shoot or keep a yacht and had been heard to say that he had never put a foot upon a race course in his life He dressed very quietly never changing the colour or form of his garments and in society was quiet reserved and very often silent He was tall slight and not ill looking but more than this cannot be said for his personal appearance except indeed this that no one could mistake him for other than a gentleman With his uncle the duke he was on good terms that is to say they had never quarrelled A very liberal allowance had been made to the nephew but the two relatives had no tastes in common and did not often meet Once a year mister Palliser visited the duke at his great country seat for two or three days and usually dined with him two or three times during the season in London mister Palliser sat for a borough which was absolutely under the duke s command but had accepted his seat under the distinct understanding that he was to take whatever part in politics might seem good to himself Under these well understood arrangements the duke and his heir showed to the world quite a pattern of a happy family So different to the earl and Lord Porlock the people of West Barsetshire used to say For the estates both of the duke and of the earl were situated in the western division of that county mister Palliser was chiefly known to the world as a rising politician We may say that he had everything at his command in the way of pleasure that the world could offer him He had wealth position power and the certainty of attaining the highest rank among perhaps the most brilliant nobility of the world He was courted by all who could get near enough to court him It is hardly too much to say that he might have selected a bride from all that was most beautiful and best among English women If he would have bought race horses and have expended thousands on the turf he would have gratified his uncle by doing so He might have been the master of hounds or the slaughterer of hecatombs of birds But to none of these things would he devote himself He had chosen to be a politician and in that pursuit he laboured with a zeal and perseverance which would have made his fortune at any profession or in any trade He was constant in committee rooms up to the very middle of August He was rarely absent from any debate of importance and never from any important division Though he seldom spoke he was always ready to speak if his purpose required it No man gave him credit for any great genius few even considered that he could become either an orator or a mighty statesman But the world said that he was a rising man and old Nestor of the Cabinet looked on him as one who would be able at some far future day to come among them as a younger brother Hitherto he had declined such inferior offices as had been offered to him biding his time carefully and he was as yet tied hand and neck to no party though known to be liberal in all his political tendencies He was a great reader not taking up a book here and another there as chance brought books before him but working through an enormous course of books getting up the great subject of the world s history filling himself full of facts though perhaps not destined to acquire the power of using those facts otherwise than as precedents He strove also diligently to become a linguist not without success as far as a competent understanding of various languages He was a thin minded plodding respectable man willing to devote all his youth to work in order that in old age he might be allowed to sit among the Councillors of the State Hitherto his name had not been coupled by the world with that of any woman whom he had been supposed to admire but latterly it had been observed that he had often been seen in the same room with Lady Dumbello It had hardly amounted to more than this but when it was remembered how undemonstrative were the two persons concerned how little disposed was either of them to any strong display of feeling even this was thought matter to be mentioned He certainly would speak to her from time to time almost with an air of interest and Lady Dumbello when she saw that he was in the room would be observed to raise her head with some little show of life and to look round as though there were something there on which it might be worth her while to allow her eyes to rest When such innuendoes were abroad no one would probably make more of them than Lady De Courcy Many when they heard that mister Palliser was to be at the castle had expressed their surprise at her success in that quarter Others when they learned that Lady Dumbello had consented to become her guest had also wondered greatly But when it was ascertained that the two were to be there together her good natured friends had acknowledged that she was a very clever woman To have either mister Palliser or Lady Dumbello would have been a feather in her cap but to succeed in getting both by enabling each to know that the other would be there was indeed a triumph As regards Lady Dumbello however the bargain was not fairly carried out for after all mister Palliser came to Courcy Castle only for two nights and a day and during the whole of that day he was closeted with sundry large blue books As for Lady De Courcy she did not care how he might be employed Blue books and Lady Dumbello were all the same to her mister Palliser had been at Courcy Castle and neither enemy nor friend could deny the fact This was his second evening and as he had promised to meet his constituents at Silverbridge at one P M on the following day with the view of explaining to them his own conduct and the political position of the world in general and as he was not to return from Silverbridge to Courcy Lady Dumbello if she made any way at all must take advantage of the short gleam of sunshine which the present hour afforded her No one however could say that she showed any active disposition to monopolize mister Palliser s attention When he sauntered into the drawing room she was sitting alone in a large low chair made without arms so as to admit the full expansion of her dress but hollowed and round at the back so as to afford her the support that was necessary to her She had barely spoken three words since she had left the dining room but the time had not passed heavily with her Lady Julia had again attacked the countess about Lily Dale and mister Crosbie and Alexandrina driven almost to rage had stalked off to the farther end of the room not concealing her special concern in the matter How I do wish they were married and done with said the countess and then we should hear no more about them All of which Lady Dumbello heard and understood and in all of it she took a certain interest She remembered such things learning thereby who was who and regulating her own conduct by what she learned She was by no means idle at this or at other such times going through we may say a considerable amount of really hard work in her manner of working There she had sat speechless unless when acknowledging by a low word of assent some expression of flattery from those around her Then the door opened and when mister Palliser entered she raised her head and the faintest possible gleam of satisfaction might have been discerned upon her features But she made no attempt to speak to him and when as he stood at the table he took up a book and remained thus standing for a quarter of an hour she neither showed nor felt any impatience After that Lord Dumbello came in and he stood at the table without a book Even then Lady Dumbello felt no impatience Plantagenet Palliser skimmed through his little book and probably learned something When he put it down he sipped a cup of tea and remarked to Lady De Courcy that he believed it was only twelve miles to Silverbridge I wish it was a hundred and twelve said the countess In that case I should be forced to start to night said mister Palliser Then I wish it was a thousand and twelve said Lady De Courcy In that case I should not have come at all said mister Palliser He did not mean to be uncivil and had only stated a fact The young men are becoming absolute bears said the countess to her daughter Margaretta He had been in the room nearly an hour when he did at last find himself standing close to Lady Dumbello close to her and without any other very near neighbour I should hardly have expected to find you here he said Nor I you she answered Though for the matter of that we are both near our own homes I am not near mine I meant Plumstead your father s place Yes that was my home once I wish I could show you my uncle s place The castle is very fine and he has some good pictures So I have heard Do you stay here long Oh no I go to Cheshire the day after to morrow Lord Dumbello is always there when the hunting begins Ah yes of course What a happy fellow he is never any work to do His constituents never trouble him I suppose I don t think they ever do much After that mister Palliser sauntered away again and Lady Dumbello passed the rest of the evening in silence It is to be hoped that they both were rewarded by that ten minutes of sympathetic intercourse for the inconvenience which they had suffered in coming to Courcy Castle But that which seems so innocent to us had been looked on in a different light by the stern moralists of that house By Jove said the Honourable George to his cousin mister Gresham I wonder how Dumbello likes it It seems to me that Dumbello takes it very easily There are some men who will take anything easily said George who since his own marriage had learned to have a holy horror of such wicked things She s beginning to come out a little said Lady Clandidlem to Lady De Courcy when the two old women found themselves together over a fire in some back sitting room Still waters always run deep you know I shouldn t at all wonder if she were to go off with him said Lady De Courcy He ll never be such a fool as that said Lady Clandidlem I believe men will be fools enough for anything said Lady De Courcy But of course if he did it would come to nothing afterwards I know one who would not be sorry If ever a man was tired of a woman Lord Dumbello is tired of her But in this as in almost everything else the wicked old woman spoke scandal Lord Dumbello was still proud of his wife and as fond of her as a man can be of a woman whose fondness depends upon mere pride There had not been much that was dangerous in the conversation between mister Palliser and Lady Dumbello but I cannot say the same as to that which was going on at the same moment between Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina She as I have said walked away in almost open dudgeon when Lady Julia recommenced her attack about poor Lily nor did she return to the general circle during the evening There were two large drawing rooms at Courcy Castle joined together by a narrow link of a room which might have been called a passage had it not been lighted by two windows coming down to the floor carpeted as were the drawing rooms and warmed with a separate fireplace Hither she betook herself and was soon followed by her married sister Amelia That woman almost drives me mad said Alexandrina as they stood together with their toes upon the fender But my dear you of all people should not allow yourself to be driven mad on such a subject That s all very well Amelia The question is this my dear what does mister Crosbie mean to do How should I know If you don t know it will be safer to suppose that he is going to marry this girl and in that case Well what in that case Are you going to be another Lady Julia What do I care about the girl I don t suppose you care much about the girl and if you care as little about mister Crosbie there s an end of it only in that case Alexandrina Well what in that case You know I don t want to preach to you Can t you tell me at once whether you really like him You and I have always been good friends And the married sister put her arm affectionately round the waist of her who wished to be married I like him well enough And has he made any declaration to you In a sort of a way he has Hark here he is And Crosbie coming in from the larger room joined the sisters at the fireplace We were driven away by the clack of Lady Julia s tongue said the elder I never met such a woman said Crosbie There cannot well be many like her said Alexandrina And after that they all stood silent for a minute or two Lady Amelia Gazebee was considering whether or no she would do well to go and leave the two together If it were intended that mister Crosbie should marry her sister it would certainly be well to give him an opportunity of expressing such a wish on his own part But if Alexandrina was simply making a fool of herself then it would be well for her to stay I suppose she would rather I should go said the elder sister to herself and then obeying the rule which should guide all our actions from one to another she went back and joined the crowd Will you come on into the other room said Crosbie I think we are very well here Alexandrina replied But I wish to speak to you particularly said he And cannot you speak here No They will be passing backwards and forwards Lady Alexandrina said nothing further but led the way into the other large room That also was lighted and there were in it four or five persons Lady Rosina was reading a work on the Millennium with a light to herself in one corner Her brother John was asleep in an arm chair and a young gentleman and lady were playing chess There was however ample room for Crosbie and Alexandrina to take up a position apart And now mister Crosbie what have you got to say to me But first I mean to repeat Lady Julia s question as I told you that I should do When did you hear last from Miss Dale It is cruel in you to ask me such a question after what I have already told you You know that I have given to Miss Dale a promise of marriage Very well sir I don t see why you should bring me in here to tell me anything that is so publicly known as that With such a herald as Lady Julia it was quite unnecessary If you can only answer me in that tone I will make an end of it at once When I told you of my engagement I told you also that another woman possessed my heart Am I wrong to suppose that you knew to whom I alluded Indeed I did not mister Crosbie I am no conjuror and I have not scrutinized you so closely as your friend Lady Julia It is you that I love I am sure I need hardly say so now Hardly indeed considering that you are engaged to Miss Dale As to that I have of course to own that I have behaved foolishly worse than foolishly if you choose to say so You cannot condemn me more absolutely than I condemn myself But I have made up my mind as to one thing I will not marry where I do not love Oh if Lily could have heard him as he then spoke It would be impossible for me to speak in terms too high of Miss Dale but I am quite sure that I could not make her happy as her husband Why did you not think of that before you asked her said Alexandrina But there was very little of condemnation in her tone I ought to have done so but it is hardly for you to blame me with severity Had you when we were last together in London had you been less Less what Less defiant said Crosbie all this might perhaps have been avoided Lady Alexandrina could not remember that she had been defiant but however she let that pass Oh yes of course it was my fault I went down there to Allington with my heart ill at ease and now I have fallen into this trouble I tell you all as it has happened It is impossible that I should marry Miss Dale It would be wicked in me to do so seeing that my heart belongs altogether to another I have told you who is that other and now may I hope for an answer An answer to what Alexandrina will you be my wife If it had been her object to bring him to a point blank declaration and proposition of marriage she had certainly achieved her object now And she had that trust in her own power of management and in her mother s that she did not fear that in accepting him she would incur the risk of being served as he was serving Lily Dale She knew her own position and his too well for that If she accepted him she would in due course of time become his wife let Miss Dale and all her friends say what they might to the contrary As to that head she had no fear But nevertheless she did not accept him at once Though she wished for the prize her woman s nature hindered her from taking it when it was offered to her How long is it mister Crosbie she said since you put the same question to Miss Dale I have told you everything Alexandrina as I promised that I would do If you intend to punish me for doing so And I might ask another question How long will it be before you put the same question to some other girl He turned round as though to walk away from her in anger but when he had gone half the distance to the door he returned By heaven he said and he spoke somewhat roughly too I ll have an answer You at any rate have nothing with which to reproach me All that I have done wrong I have done through you or on your behalf You have heard my proposal Do you intend to accept it I declare you startle me If you demanded my money or my life you could not be more imperious Certainly not more resolute in my determination And if I decline the honour I shall think you the most fickle of your sex And if I were to accept it I would swear that you were the best the dearest and the sweetest of women I would rather have your good opinion than your bad certainly said Lady Alexandrina And then it was understood by both of them that that affair was settled Whenever she was called on in future to speak of Lily she always called her that poor Miss Dale but she never again spoke a word of reproach to her future lord about that little adventure I shall tell mamma to night she said to him as she bade him good night in some sequestered nook to which they had betaken themselves Lady Julia s eye was again on them as they came out from the sequestered nook but Alexandrina no longer cared for Lady Julia George I cannot quite understand about that mister Palliser Isn t he to be a duke and oughtn t he to be a lord now This question was asked by missus George De Courcy of her husband when they found themselves together in the seclusion of the nuptial chamber Yes he ll be Duke of Omnium when the old fellow dies I think he s one of the slowest fellows I ever came across He ll take deuced good care of the property though But George do explain it to me It is so stupid not to understand and I am afraid of opening my mouth for fear of blundering Then keep your mouth shut my dear You ll learn all those sort of things in time and nobody notices it if you don t say anything Yes but George I don t like to sit silent all the night I d sooner be up here with a novel if I can t speak about anything Look at Lady Dumbello She doesn t want to be always talking Lady Dumbello is very different from me But do tell me who is mister Palliser He s the duke s nephew If he were the duke s son he would be the Marquis of Silverbridge And will he be plain Mister till his uncle dies Yes a very plain Mister What a pity for him But George if I have a baby and if he should be a boy and if Oh nonsense it will be time enough to talk of that when he comes I m going to sleep CHAPTER XXIV A MOTHER IN LAW AND A FATHER IN LAW On the following morning mister Plantagenet Palliser was off upon his political mission before breakfast either that or else some private comfort was afforded to him in guise of solitary rolls and coffee The public breakfast at Courcy Castle was going on at eleven o clock and at that hour mister Palliser was already closeted with the Mayor of Silverbridge I must get off by the three point forty five train said mister Palliser Who is there to speak after me Well I shall say a few words and Growdy he ll expect them to listen to him Growdy has always stood very firm by his grace mister Palliser Mind we are in the room sharp at one And you can have a fly for me to get away to the station ready in the yard I won t go a moment before I can help I shall be just an hour and a half myself No thank you I never take any wine in the morning And I may here state that mister Palliser did get away by the three point forty five train leaving mister Growdy still talking on the platform Constituents must be treated with respect but time has become so scarce now a days that that respect has to be meted out by the quarter of an hour with parsimonious care In the meantime there was more leisure at Courcy Castle Neither the countess nor Lady Alexandrina came down to breakfast but their absence gave rise to no special remark Breakfast at the castle was a morning meal at which people showed themselves or did not show themselves as it pleased them Lady Julia was there looking very glum and Crosbie was sitting next to his future sister in law Margaretta who already had placed herself on terms of close affection with him As he finished his tea she whispered into his ear mister Crosbie if you could spare half an hour mamma would so like to see you in her own room Crosbie declared that he would be delighted to wait upon her and did in truth feel some gratitude in being welcomed as a son in law into the house And yet he felt also that he was being caught and that in ascending into the private domains of the countess he would be setting the seal upon his own captivity Nevertheless he went with a smiling face and a light step Lady Margaretta ushering him the way Mamma said she I have brought mister Crosbie up to you I did not know that you were here Alexandrina or I should have warned him The countess and her youngest daughter had been breakfasting together in the elder lady s sitting room and were now seated in a very graceful and well arranged deshabille The tea cups out of which they had been drinking were made of some elegant porcelain the teapot and cream jug were of chased silver and as delicate in their way The remnant of food consisted of morsels of French roll which had not even been allowed to crumble themselves in a disorderly fashion and of infinitesimal pats of butter If the morning meal of the two ladies had been as unsubstantial as the appearance of the fragments indicated it must be presumed that they intended to lunch early The countess herself was arrayed in an elaborate morning wrapper of figured silk but the simple Alexandrina wore a plain white muslin peignoir fastened with pink ribbon Her hair which she usually carried in long rolls now hung loose over her shoulders and certainly added something to her stock of female charms The countess got up as Crosbie entered and greeted him with an open hand but Alexandrina kept her seat and merely nodded at him a little welcome I must run down again said Margaretta or I shall have left Amelia with all the cares of the house upon her Alexandrina has told me all about it said the countess with her sweetest smile and I have given her my approval I really do think you will suit each other very well I am very much obliged to you said Crosbie I m sure at any rate of this that she will suit me very well Yes I think she will She is a good sensible girl Psha mamma pray don t go on in that Goody Twoshoes sort of way So you are my dear If you were not it would not be well for you to do as you are going to do If you were giddy and harum scarum and devoted to rank and wealth and that sort of thing it would not be well for you to marry a commoner without fortune I m sure mister Crosbie will excuse me for saying so much as that Of course I know said Crosbie that I had no right to look so high Well we ll say nothing more about it said the countess Pray don t said Alexandrina It sounds so like a sermon Sit down mister Crosbie said the countess and let us have a little conversation She shall sit by you if you like it Nonsense Alexandrina if he asks it Don t mamma I mean to remain where I am Very well my dear then remain where you are She is a wilful girl mister Crosbie as you will say when you hear that she has told me all that you told her last night Upon hearing this he changed colour a little but said nothing She has told me continued the countess about that young lady at Allington Upon my word I m afraid you have been very naughty I have been foolish Lady De Courcy Of course I did not mean anything worse than that Yes you have been foolish amusing yourself in a thoughtless way you know and perhaps a little piqued because a certain lady was not to be won so easily as your Royal Highness wished Well now all that must be settled you know as quickly as possible I don t want to ask any indiscreet questions but if the young lady has really been left with any idea that you meant anything don t you think you should undeceive her at once Of course he will mamma Of course you will and it will be a great comfort to Alexandrina to know that the matter is arranged You hear what Lady Julia is saying almost every hour of her life Now of course Alexandrina does not care what an old maid like Lady Julia may say but it will be better for all parties that the rumour should be put a stop to If the earl were to hear it he might you know And the countess shook her head thinking that she could thus best indicate what the earl might do if he were to take it into his head to do anything Crosbie could not bring himself to hold any very confidential intercourse with the countess about Lily but he gave a muttered assurance that he should as a matter of course make known the truth to Miss Dale with as little delay as possible He could not say exactly when he would write nor whether he would write to her or to her mother but the thing should be done immediately on his return to town If it will make the matter easier I will write to missus Dale said the countess But to this scheme mister Crosbie objected very strongly And then a few words were said about the earl I will tell him this afternoon said the countess and then you can see him to morrow morning I don t suppose he will say very much you know and perhaps he may think you won t mind my saying it I m sure that Alexandrina might have done better But I don t believe that he ll raise any strong objection There will be something about settlements and that sort of thing of course Then the countess went away and Alexandrina was left with her lover for half an hour When the half hour was over he felt that he would have given all that he had in the world to have back the last four and twenty hours of his existence But he had no hope To jilt Lily Dale would no doubt be within his power but he knew that he could not jilt Lady Alexandrina De Courcy On the next morning at twelve o clock he had his interview with the father and a very unpleasant interview it was He was ushered into the earl s room and found the great peer standing on the rug with his back to the fire and his hands in his breeches pockets So you mean to marry my daughter said he I m not very well as you see I seldom am These last words were spoken in answer to Crosbie s greeting Crosbie had held out his hand to the earl and had carried his point so far that the earl had been forced to take one of his own out of his pocket and give it to his proposed son in law If your lordship has no objection I have at any rate her permission to ask for yours I believe you have not any fortune have you She s got none of course you know that I have a few thousand pounds and I believe she has as much About as much as will buy bread to keep the two of you from starving It s nothing to me You can marry her if you like only look here I ll have no nonsense I ve had an old woman in with me this morning one of those that are here in the house telling me some story about some other girl that you have made a fool of It s nothing to me how much of that sort of thing you may have done so that you do none of it here But if you play any prank of that kind with me you ll find that you ve made a mistake Crosbie hardly made any answer to this but got himself out of the room as quickly as he could You d better talk to Gazebee about the trifle of money you ve got said the earl Then he dismissed the subject from his mind and no doubt imagined that he had fully done his duty by his daughter On the day after this Crosbie was to go On the last afternoon shortly before dinner he was waylaid by Lady Julia who had passed the day in preparing traps to catch him mister Crosbie she said let me have one word with you Is this true Lady Julia he said I really do not know why you should inquire into my private affairs Yes sir you do know you know very well That poor young lady who has no father and no brother is my neighbour and her friends are my friends She is a friend of my own and being an old woman I have a right to speak for her If this is true mister Crosbie you are treating her like a villain Lady Julia I really must decline to discuss the matter with you I ll tell everybody what a villain you are I will indeed a villain and a poor weak silly fool She was too good for you that s what she was Crosbie as Lady Julia was addressing to him the last words hurried upstairs away from her but her ladyship standing on a landing place spoke up loudly so that no word should be lost on her retreating enemy We positively must get rid of that woman the countess who heard it all said to Margaretta She is disturbing the house and disgracing herself every day She went to papa this morning mamma She did not get much by that move said the countess On the following morning Crosbie returned to town but just before he left the castle he received a third letter from Lily Dale I have been rather disappointed at not hearing this morning said Lily for I thought the postman would have brought me a letter But I know you ll be a better boy when you get back to London and I won t scold you Scold you indeed No I ll never scold you not though I shouldn t hear for a month He would have given all that he had in the world three times told if he could have blotted out that visit to Courcy Castle from the past facts of his existence CHAPTER XXV ADOLPHUS CROSBIE SPENDS AN EVENING AT HIS CLUB ILLUSTRATION untitled Crosbie as he was being driven from the castle to the nearest station in a dog cart hired from the hotel could not keep himself from thinking of that other morning not yet a fortnight past on which he had left Allington and as he thought of it he knew that he was a villain On this morning Alexandrina had not come out from the house to watch his departure and catch the last glance of his receding figure As he had not started very early she had sat with him at the breakfast table but others also had sat there and when he got up to go she did no more than smile softly and give him her hand It had been already settled that he was to spend his Christmas at Courcy as it had been also settled that he was to spend it at Allington Lady Amelia was of all the family the most affectionate to him and perhaps of them all she was the one whose affection was worth the most She was not a woman endowed with a very high mind or with very noble feelings She had begun life trusting to the nobility of her blood for everything and declaring somewhat loudly among her friends that her father s rank and her mother s birth imposed on her the duty of standing closely by her own order Nevertheless at the age of thirty three she had married her father s man of business under circumstances which were not altogether creditable to her But she had done her duty in her new sphere of life with some constancy and a fixed purpose and now that her sister was going to marry as she had done a man much below herself in social standing she was prepared to do her duty as a sister and a sister in law We shall be up in town in November and of course you ll come to us at once Albert Villa you know in Hamilton Terrace saint John s Wood We dine at seven and on Sundays at two and you ll always find a place Mind you come to us and make yourself quite at home I do so hope you and Mortimer will get on well together I m sure we shall said Crosbie But he had had higher hopes in marrying into this noble family than that of becoming intimate with Mortimer Gazebee What those hopes were he could hardly define to himself now that he had brought himself so near to the fruition of them Lady De Courcy had certainly promised to write to her first cousin who was Under Secretary of State for India with reference to that secretaryship at the General Committee Office but Crosbie when he came to weigh in his mind what good might result to him from this was disposed to think that his chance of obtaining the promotion would be quite as good without the interest of the Under Secretary of State for India as with it Now that he belonged as we may say to this noble family he could hardly discern what were the advantages which he had expected from this alliance He had said to himself that it would be much to have a countess for a mother in law but now even already although the possession to which he had looked was not yet garnered he was beginning to tell himself that the thing was not worth possessing As he sat in the train with a newspaper in his hand he went on acknowledging to himself that he was a villain Lady Julia had spoken the truth to him on the stairs at Courcy and so he confessed over and over again But he was chiefly angry with himself for this that he had been a villain without gaining anything by his villany that he had been a villain and was to lose so much by his villany He made comparison between Lily and Alexandrina and owned to himself over and over again that Lily would make the best wife that a man could take to his bosom As to Alexandrina he knew the thinness of her character She would stick by him no doubt and in a circuitous discontented unhappy way would probably be true to her duties as a wife and mother She would be nearly such another as Lady Amelia Gazebee But was that a prize sufficiently rich to make him contented with his own prowess and skill in winning it And was that a prize sufficiently rich to justify him to himself for his terrible villany Lily Dale he had loved and he now declared to himself that he could have continued to love her through his whole life But what was there for any man to love in Alexandrina De Courcy While resolving during his first four or five days at the castle that he would throw Lily Dale overboard he had contrived to quiet his conscience by inward allusions to sundry heroes of romance He had thought of Lothario Don Juan and of Lovelace and had told himself that the world had ever been full of such heroes And the world too had treated such heroes well not punishing them at all as villains but caressing them rather and calling them curled darlings Why should not he be a curled darling as well as another Ladies had ever been fond of the Don Juan character and Don Juan had generally been popular with men also And then he named to himself a dozen modern Lotharios men who were holding their heads well above water although it was known that they had played this lady false and brought that other one to death s door or perhaps even to death itself War and love were alike and the world was prepared to forgive any guile to militants in either camp But now that he had done the deed he found himself forced to look at it from quite another point of view Suddenly that character of Lothario showed itself to him in a different light and one in which it did not please him to look at it as belonging to himself He began to feel that it would be almost impossible for him to write that letter to Lily which it was absolutely necessary that he should write He was in a position in which his mind would almost turn itself to thoughts of self destruction as the only means of escape A fortnight ago he was a happy man having everything before him that a man ought to want and now now that he was the accepted son in law of an earl and the confident expectant of high promotion he was the most miserable degraded wretch in the world He changed his clothes at his lodgings in Mount Street and went down to his club to dinner He could at any rate do nothing that night His letter to Allington must no doubt be written at once but as he could not send it before the next night s post he was not forced to set to work upon it that evening As he walked along Piccadilly on his way to saint James s Square it occurred to him that it might be well to write a short line to Lily telling her nothing of the truth a note written as though his engagement with her was still unbroken but yet written with care saying nothing about that engagement so as to give him a little time Then he thought that he would telegraph to Bernard and tell everything to him Bernard would of course be prepared to avenge his cousin in some way but for such vengeance Crosbie felt that he should care little Lady Julia had told him that Lily was without father or brother thereby accusing him of the basest cowardice I wish she had a dozen brothers he said to himself But he hardly knew why he expressed such a wish He returned to London on the last day of October and he found the streets at the West End nearly deserted He thought therefore that he should be quite alone at his club but as he entered the dinner room he saw one of his oldest and most intimate friends standing before the fire Fowler Pratt was the man who had first brought him into Sebright s and had given him almost his earliest start on his successful career in life Since that time he and his friend Fowler Pratt had lived in close communion though Pratt had always held a certain ascendancy in their friendship He was in age a few years senior to Crosbie and was in truth a man of better parts But he was less ambitious less desirous of shining in the world and much less popular with men in general He was possessed of a moderate private fortune on which he lived in a quiet modest manner and was unmarried not likely to marry inoffensive useless and prudent For the first few years of Crosbie s life in London he had lived very much with his friend Pratt and had been accustomed to depend much on his friend s counsel but latterly since he had himself become somewhat noticeable he had found more pleasure in the society of such men as Dale who were not his superiors either in age or wisdom But there had been no coolness between him and Pratt and now they met with perfect cordiality I thought you were down in Barsetshire said Pratt And I thought you were in Switzerland I have been in Switzerland said Pratt And I have been in Barsetshire said Crosbie Then they ordered their dinner together And so you re going to be married said Pratt when the waiter had carried away the cheese Who told you that Well but you are Never mind who told me if I was told the truth But if it be not true I have heard it for the last month said Pratt and it has been spoken of as a thing certain and it is true is it not I believe it is said Crosbie slowly Why what on earth is the matter with you that you speak of it in that way Am I to congratulate you or am I not The lady I m told is a cousin of Dale s Crosbie had turned his chair from the table round to the fire and said nothing in answer to this He sat with his glass of sherry in his hand looking at the coals and thinking whether it would not be well that he should tell the whole story to Pratt No one could give him better advice and no one as far as he knew his friend would be less shocked at the telling of such a story Pratt had no romance about women and had never pretended to very high sentiments Come up into the smoking room and I ll tell you all about it said Crosbie So they went off together and as the smoking room was untenanted Crosbie was able to tell his story He found it very hard to tell much harder than he had beforehand fancied I have got into terrible trouble he began by saying Then he told how he had fallen suddenly in love with Lily how he had been rash and imprudent how nice she was infinitely too good for such a man as I am he said how she had accepted him and then how he had repented I should have told you beforehand he then said that I was already half engaged to Lady Alexandrina De Courcy The reader however will understand that this half engagement was a fiction And now you mean that you are altogether engaged to her Exactly so And that Miss Dale must be told that on second thoughts you have changed your mind I know that I have behaved very badly said Crosbie Indeed you have said his friend It is one of those troubles in which a man finds himself involved almost before he knows where he is Well I can t look at it exactly in that light A man may amuse himself with a girl and I can understand his disappointing her and not offering to marry her though even that sort of thing isn t much to my taste But by George to make an offer of marriage to such a girl as that in September to live for a month in her family as her affianced husband and then coolly go away to another house in October and make an offer to another girl of higher rank You know very well that that has had nothing to do with it It looks very like it And how are you going to communicate these tidings to Miss Dale I don t know said Crosbie who was beginning to be very sore And you have quite made up your mind that you ll stick to the earl s daughter The idea of jilting Alexandrina instead of Lily had never as yet presented itself to Crosbie and now as he thought of it he could not perceive that it was feasible Yes he said I shall marry Lady Alexandrina that is if I do not cut the whole concern and my own throat into the bargain If I were in your shoes I think I should cut the whole concern I could not stand it What do you mean to say to Miss Dale s uncle I don t care a for Miss Dale s uncle said Crosbie If he were to walk in at that door this moment I would tell him the whole story without As he was yet speaking one of the club servants opened the door of the smoking room and seeing Crosbie seated in a lounging chair near the fire went up to him with a gentleman s card Crosbie took the card and read the name mister Dale Allington The gentleman is in the waiting room said the servant Crosbie for the moment was struck dumb He had declared that very moment that he should feel no personal disinclination to meet mister Dale and now that gentleman was within the walls of the club waiting to see him Who s that asked Pratt And then Crosbie handed him the card Whew w w hew whistled Pratt Did you tell the gentleman I was here asked Crosbie I said I thought you were upstairs sir That will do said Pratt The gentleman will no doubt wait for a minute And then the servant went out of the room Now Crosbie you must make up your mind By one of these women and all her friends you will ever be regarded as a rascal and they of course will look out to punish you with such punishment as may come to their hands You must now choose which shall be the sufferer The man was a coward at heart The reflection that he might even now at this moment meet the old squire on pleasant terms or at any rate not on terms of defiance pleaded more strongly in Lily s favour than had any other argument since Crosbie had first made up his mind to abandon her He did not fear personal ill usage he was not afraid lest he should be kicked or beaten but he did not dare to face the just anger of the angry man If I were you said Pratt I would not go down to that man at the present moment for a trifle But what can I do Shirk away out of the club Only if you do that it seems to me that you ll have to go on shirking for the rest of your life Pratt I must say that I expected something more like friendship from you What can I do for you There are positions in which it is impossible to help a man I tell you plainly that you have behaved very badly I do not see that I can help you Would you see him Certainly not if I am to be expected to take your part Take any part you like only tell him the truth And what is the truth I was part engaged to that other girl before and then when I came to think of it I knew that I was not fit to marry Miss Dale I know I have behaved badly but Pratt thousands have done the same thing before I can only say that I have not been so unfortunate as to reckon any of those thousands among my friends You mean to tell me then that you are going to turn your back on me said Crosbie I haven t said anything of the kind I certainly won t undertake to defend you for I don t see that your conduct admits of defence I will see this gentleman if you wish it and tell him anything that you may desire me to tell him At this moment the servant returned with a note for Crosbie mister Dale had called for paper and envelope and sent up to him the following missive Do you intend to come down to me I know that you are in the house For heaven s sake go to him said Crosbie He is well aware that I was deceived about his niece that I thought he was to give her some fortune He knows all about that and that when I learned from him that she was to have nothing Upon my word Crosbie I wish you could find another messenger Ah you do not understand said Crosbie in his agony You think that I am inventing this plea about her fortune now It isn t so He will understand We have talked all this over before and he knew how terribly I was disappointed Shall I wait for you here or will you come to my lodgings Or I will go down to the Beaufort and will wait for you there And it was finally arranged that he should get himself out of this club and wait at the other for Pratt s report of the interview Do you go down first said Crosbie Yes I had better said Pratt Otherwise you may be seen mister Dale would have his eye upon you and there would be a row in the house There was a smile of sarcasm on Pratt s face as he spoke which angered Crosbie even in his misery and made him long to tell his friend that he would not trouble him with this mission that he would manage his own affairs himself but he was weakened and mentally humiliated by the sense of his own rascality and had already lost the power of asserting himself and of maintaining his ascendancy He was beginning to recognize the fact that he had done that for which he must endure to be kicked to be kicked morally if not materially and that it was no longer possible for him to hold his head up without shame Pratt took mister Dale s note in his hand and went down into the stranger s room There he found the squire standing so that he could see through the open door of the room to the foot of the stairs down which Crosbie must descend before he could leave the club As a measure of first precaution the ambassador closed the door then he bowed to mister Dale and asked him if he would take a chair I wanted to see mister Crosbie said the squire I have your note to that gentleman in my hand said he He has thought it better that you should have this interview with me and under all the circumstances perhaps it is better Is he such a coward that he dare not see me There are some actions mister Dale that will make a coward of any man My friend Crosbie is I take it brave enough in the ordinary sense of the word but he has injured you It is all true then Yes mister Dale I fear it is all true And you call that man your friend mister I don t know what your name is Pratt Fowler Pratt I have known Crosbie for fourteen years ever since he was a boy and it is not my way mister Dale to throw over an old friend under any circumstances Not if he committed a murder No not though he committed a murder If what I hear is true this man is worse than a murderer Of course mister Dale I cannot know what you have heard I believe that mister Crosbie has behaved very badly to your niece Miss Dale I believe that he was engaged to marry her or at any rate that some such proposition had been made Proposition Why sir it was a thing so completely understood that everybody knew it in the county It was so positively fixed that there was no secret about it Upon my honour mister Pratt I can t as yet understand it If I remember right it s not a fortnight since he left my house at Allington not a fortnight And that poor girl was with him on the morning of his going as his betrothed bride Not a fortnight since And now I ve had a letter from an old family friend telling me that he is going to marry one of Lord De Courcy s daughters I went instantly off to Courcy and found that he had started for London Now I have followed him here and you tell me it s all true I am afraid it is mister Dale too true I don t understand it I don t indeed I cannot bring myself to believe that the man who was sitting the other day at my table should be so great a scoundrel Did he mean it all the time that he was there No certainly not Lady Alexandrina De Courcy was I believe an old friend of his with whom perhaps he had had some lover s quarrel On his going to Courcy they made it up and this is the result And that is to be sufficient for my poor girl You will of course understand that I am not defending mister Crosbie The whole affair is very sad very sad indeed I can only say in his excuse that he is not the first man who has behaved badly to a lady And that is his message to me is it And that is what I am to tell my niece You have been deceived by a scoundrel But what then You are not the first mister Pratt I give you my word as a gentleman I do not understand it I have lived a good deal out of the world and am therefore perhaps more astonished than I ought to be mister Dale I feel for you Feel for me What is to become of my girl And do you suppose that I will let this other marriage go on that I will not tell the De Courcys and all the world at large what sort of a man this is that I will not get at him to punish him Does he think that I will put up with this I do not know what he thinks I must only beg that you will not mix me up in the matter as though I were a participator in his offence Will you tell him from me that I desire to see him I do not think that that would do any good Never mind sir you have brought me his message will you have the goodness now to take back mine to him Do you mean at once this evening now Yes at once this evening now this minute Ah he has left the club he is not here now he went when I came to you Then he is a coward as well as a scoundrel In answer to which assertion mister Fowler Pratt merely shrugged his shoulders He is a coward as well as a scoundrel Will you have the kindness to tell your friend from me that he is a coward and a scoundrel and a liar sir If it be so Miss Dale is well quit of her engagement That is your consolation is it That may be all very well now a days but when I was a young man I would sooner have burnt out my tongue than have spoken in such a way on such a subject I would indeed Good night mister Pratt Pray make your friend understand that he has not yet seen the last of the Dales although as you hint the ladies of that family will no doubt have learned that he is not fit to associate with them Then taking up his hat the squire made his way out of the club I would not have done it said Pratt to himself for all the beauty and all the wealth and all the rank that ever were owned by a woman CHAPTER XXVI LORD DE COURCY IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY Lady Julia De Guest had not during her life written many letters to mister Dale of Allington nor had she ever been very fond of him But when she felt certain how things were going at Courcy or rather as we may say how they had already gone she took pen in hand and sat herself to work doing as she conceived her duty by her neighbour MY DEAR mister DALE she said I believe I need make no secret of having known that your niece Lilian is engaged to mister Crosbie of London I think it proper to warn you that if this be true mister Crosbie is behaving himself in a very improper manner here I am not a person who concerns myself much in the affairs of other people and under ordinary circumstances the conduct of mister Crosbie would be nothing to me or indeed less than nothing but I do to you as I would wish that others should do unto me I believe it is only too true that mister Crosbie has proposed to Lady Alexandrina De Courcy and been accepted by her I think you will believe that I would not say this without warrant and if there be anything in it it may be well for the poor young lady s sake that you should put yourself in the way of learning the truth Believe me to be yours sincerely JULIA DE GUEST Courcy Castle Thursday The squire had never been very fond of any of the De Guest family and had perhaps liked Lady Julia the least of them all He was wont to call her a meddling old woman remembering her bitterness and pride in those now long bygone days in which the gallant major had run off with Lady Fanny When he first received this letter he did not on the first reading of it believe a word of its contents Cross grained old harridan he said out loud to his nephew Look what that aunt of yours has written to me Bernard read the letter twice and as he did so his face became hard and angry You don t mean to say you believe it said the squire I don t think it will be safe to disregard it What you think it possible that your friend is doing as she says It is certainly possible He was angry when he found that Lily had no fortune Heavens Bernard And you can speak of it in that way I don t say that it is true but I think we should look to it I will go to Courcy Castle and learn the truth The squire at last decided that he would go He went to Courcy Castle and found that Crosbie had started two hours before his arrival He asked for Lady Julia and learned from her that Crosbie had actually left the house as the betrothed husband of Lady Alexandrina The countess I am sure will not contradict it if you will see her said Lady Julia But this the squire was unwilling to do He would not proclaim the wretched condition of his niece more loudly than was necessary and therefore he started on his pursuit of Crosbie What was his success on that evening we have already learned Both Lady Alexandrina and her mother heard of mister Dale s arrival at the castle but nothing was said between them on the subject Lady Amelia Gazebee heard of it also and she ventured to discuss the matter with her sister You don t know exactly how far it went do you No yes not exactly that is said Alexandrina I suppose he did say something about marriage to the girl Yes I m afraid he did Dear dear It s very unfortunate What sort of people are those Dales I suppose he talked to you about them No he didn t not very much I daresay she is an artful sly thing It s a great pity men should go on in such a way Yes it is said Lady Amelia And I do suppose that in this case the blame has been more with him than with her It s only right I should tell you that But what can I do I don t say you can do anything but it s as well you should know But I don t know and you don t know and I can t see that there is any use talking about it now I knew him a long while before she did and if she has allowed him to make a fool of her it isn t my fault Nobody says it is my dear But you seem to preach to me about it What can I do for the girl The fact is he don t care for her a bit and never did Then he shouldn t have told her that he did That s all very well Amelia but people don t always do exactly all that they ought to do I suppose mister Crosbie isn t the first man that has proposed to two ladies I dare say it was wrong but I can t help it As to mister Dale coming here with a tale of his niece s wrongs I think it very absurd very absurd indeed It makes it look as though there had been a scheme to catch mister Crosbie and it s my belief that there was such a scheme I only hope that there ll be no quarrel Men don t fight duels now a days Amelia But do you remember what Frank Gresham did to mister Moffat when he behaved so badly to poor Augusta mister Crosbie isn t afraid of that kind of thing And I always thought that Frank was very wrong very wrong indeed What s the good of two men beating each other in the street Well I m sure I hope there ll be no quarrel But I own I don t like the look of it You see the uncle must have known all about it and have consented to the marriage or he would not have come here I don t see that it can make any difference to me Amelia No my dear I don t see that it can We shall be up in town soon and I will see as much as possible of mister Crosbie The marriage I hope will take place soon He talks of February Don t put it off Alley whatever you do There are so many slips you know in these things I m not a bit afraid of that said Alexandrina sticking up her head I daresay not and you may be sure that we will keep an eye on him Mortimer will get him up to dine with us as often as possible and as his leave of absence is all over he can t get out of town He s to be here at Christmas isn t he Of course he is Mind you keep him to that And as to these Dales I would be very careful if I were you not to say anything unkind of them to any one It sounds badly in your position And with this last piece of advice Lady Amelia Gazebee allowed the subject to drop On that day Lady Julia returned to her own home Her adieux to the whole family at Courcy Castle were very cold but about mister Crosbie and his lady love at Allington she said no further word to any of them Alexandrina did not show herself at all on the occasion and indeed had not spoken to her enemy since that evening on which she had felt herself constrained to retreat from the drawing room Good by said the countess You have been so good to come and we have enjoyed it so much I thank you very much Good morning said Lady Julia with a stately courtesy Pray remember me to your brother I wish we could have seen him I hope he has not been hurt by the the bull And then Lady Julia went her way What a fool I have been to have that woman in the house said the countess before the door was closed behind her guest s back Indeed you have said Lady Julia screaming back through the passage Then there was a long silence then a suppressed titter and after that a loud laugh Oh mamma what shall we do said Lady Amelia Do said Margaretta why should we do anything She has heard the truth for once in her life Dear Lady Dumbello what will you think of us said the countess turning round to another guest who was also just about to depart Did any one ever know such a woman before I think she s very nice said Lady Dumbello smiling I can t quite agree with you there said Lady Clandidlem But I do believe she means to do her best She is very charitable and all that sort of thing I m sure I don t know said Rosina I asked her for a subscription to the mission for putting down the Papists in the west of Ireland and she refused me point blank Now my dear if you re quite ready said Lord Dumbello coming into the room Then there was another departure but on this occasion the countess waited till the doors were shut and the retreating footsteps were no longer heard Have you observed said she to Lady Clandidlem that she has not held her head up since mister Palliser went away Indeed I have said Lady Clandidlem As for poor Dumbello he s the blindest creature I ever saw in my life We shall hear of something before next May said Lady De Courcy shaking her head but for all that she ll never be Duchess of Omnium I wonder what your mamma will say of me when I go away to morrow said Lady Clandidlem to Margaretta as they walked across the hall together She won t say that you are going to run away with any gentleman said Margaretta At any rate not with the earl said Lady Clandidlem Ha ha ha Well we are all very good natured are we not The best is that it means nothing Thus by degrees all the guests went and the family of the De Courcys was left to the bliss of their own domestic circle This we may presume was not without its charms seeing that there were so many feelings in common between the mother and her children There were drawbacks to it no doubt arising perhaps chiefly from the earl s bodily infirmities When your father speaks to me said missus George to her husband he puts me in such a shiver that I cannot open my mouth to answer him You should stand up to him said George He can t hurt you you know Your money s your own and if I m ever to be the heir it won t be by his doing But he gnashes his teeth at me You shouldn t care for that if he don t bite He used to gnash them at me and when I had to ask him for money I didn t like it but now I don t mind him a bit He threw the peerage at me one day but it didn t go within a yard of my head If he throws anything at me George I shall drop upon the spot But the countess had a worse time with the earl than any of her children It was necessary that she should see him daily and necessary also that she should say much that he did not like to hear and make many petitions that caused him to gnash his teeth The earl was one of those men who could not endure to live otherwise than expensively and yet was made miserable by every recurring expense He ought to have known by this time that butchers and bakers and corn chandlers and coal merchants will not supply their goods for nothing and yet it always seemed as though he had expected that at this special period they would do so He was an embarrassed man no doubt and had not been fortunate in his speculations at Newmarket or Homburg but nevertheless he had still the means of living without daily torment and it must be supposed that his self imposed sufferings with regard to money rose rather from his disposition than his necessities His wife never knew whether he were really ruined or simply pretending it She had now become so used to her position in this respect that she did not allow fiscal considerations to mar her happiness Food and clothing had always come to her including velvet gowns new trinkets and a man cook and she presumed that they would continue to come But that daily conference with her husband was almost too much for her She struggled to avoid it and as far as the ways and means were concerned would have allowed them to arrange themselves if he would only have permitted it But he insisted on seeing her daily in his own sitting room and she had acknowledged to her favourite daughter Margaretta that those half hours would soon be the death of her I sometimes feel she said that I am going mad before I can get out And she reproached herself probably without reason in that she had brought much of this upon herself In former days the earl had been constantly away from home and the countess had complained Like many other women she had not known when she was well off She had complained urging upon her lord that he should devote more of his time to his own hearth It is probable that her ladyship s remonstrances had been less efficacious than the state of his own health in producing that domestic constancy which he now practised but it is certain that she looked back with bitter regret to the happy days when she was deserted jealous and querulous Don t you wish we could get Sir Omicron to order him to the German Spas she had said to Margaretta Now Sir Omicron was the great London physician and might no doubt do much in that way But no such happy order had as yet been given and as far as the family could foresee paterfamilias intended to pass the winter with them at Courcy The guests as I have said were all gone and none but the family were in the house when her ladyship waited upon her lord one morning at twelve o clock a few days after mister Dale s visit to the castle He always breakfasted alone and after breakfast found in a French novel and a cigar what solace those innocent recreations were still able to afford him When the novel no longer excited him and when he was saturated with smoke he would send for his wife After that his valet would dress him She gets it worse than I do the man declared in the servants hall and minds it a deal more I can give warning and she can t Better No I ain t better the husband said in answer to his wife s inquiries I never shall be better while you keep that cook in the kitchen But where are we to get another if we send him away It s not my business to find cooks I don t know where you re to get one It s my belief you won t have a cook at all before long It seems you have got two extra men into the house without telling me We must have servants you know when there is company It wouldn t do to have Lady Dumbello here and no one to wait on her Who asked Lady Dumbello I didn t I m sure my dear you liked having her here D Lady Dumbello and then there was a pause The countess had no objection whatsoever to the above proposition and was rejoiced that that question of the servants was allowed to slip aside through the aid of her ladyship Look at that letter from Porlock said the earl and he pushed over to the unhappy mother a letter from her eldest son Of all her children he was the one she loved the best but him she was never allowed to see under her own roof I sometimes think that he is the greatest rascal with whom I ever had occasion to concern myself said the earl She took the letter and read it The epistle was certainly not one which a father could receive with pleasure from his son but the disagreeable nature of its contents was the fault rather of the parent than of the child The writer intimated that certain money due to him had not been paid with necessary punctuality and that unless he received it he should instruct his lawyer to take some authorized legal proceedings Lord De Courcy had raised certain moneys on the family property which he could not have raised without the company operation of his heir and had bound himself in return for that company operation to pay a certain fixed income to his eldest son This he regarded as an allowance from himself but Lord Porlock regarded it as his own by lawful claim The son had not worded his letter with any affectionate phraseology Lord Porlock begs to inform Lord De Courcy Such had been the commencement I suppose he must have his money else how can he live said the countess trembling Live shouted the earl And so you think it proper that he should write such a letter as that to his father It is all very unfortunate she replied I don t know where the money s to come from As for him if he were starving it would serve him right He s a disgrace to the name and the family From all I hear he won t live long Oh De Courcy don t talk of it in that way What way am I to talk of it If I say that he s my greatest comfort and living as becomes a nobleman and is a fine healthy man of his age with a good wife and a lot of legitimate children will that make you believe it Women are such fools Nothing that I say will make him worse than he is But he may reform Reform He s over forty and when I last saw him he looked nearly sixty There you may answer his letter I won t And about the money Why doesn t he write to Gazebee about his dirty money Why does he trouble me I haven t got his money Ask Gazebee about his money I won t trouble myself about it Then there was another pause during which the countess folded the letter and put it in her pocket How long is George going to remain here with that woman he asked I m sure she is very harmless pleaded the countess I always think when I see her that I m sitting down to dinner with my own housemaid I never saw such a woman How he can put up with it But I don t suppose he cares for anything It has made him very steady Steady And as she will be confined before long it may be as well that she should remain here If Porlock doesn t marry you know And so he means to live here altogether does he I ll tell you what it is I won t have it He s better able to keep a house over his own head and his wife s than I am to do it for them and so you may tell them I won t have it D ye hear Then there was another short pause D ye hear he shouted at her Yes of course I hear I was only thinking you wouldn t wish me to turn them out just as her confinement is coming on I know what that means Then they d never go I won t have it and if you don t tell them I will In answer to this Lady De Courcy promised that she would tell them thinking perhaps that the earl s mode of telling might not be beneficial in that particular epoch which was now coming in the life of missus George Did you know said he breaking out on a new subject that a man had been here named Dale calling on somebody in this house In answer to which the countess acknowledged that she had known it Then why did you keep it from me And that gnashing of the teeth took place which was so specially objectionable to missus George It was a matter of no moment He came to see Lady Julia De Guest Yes but he came about that man Crosbie I suppose he did Why have you let that girl be such a fool You ll find he ll play her some knave s trick Oh dear no And why should she want to marry such a man as that He s quite a gentleman you know and very much thought of in the world It won t be at all bad for her poor thing It is so very hard for a girl to get married now a days without money And so they re to take up with anybody As far as I can see this is a worse affair than that of Amelia Amelia has done very well my dear Oh if you call it doing well for your girls I don t I call it doing uncommon badly about as bad as they well can do But it s your affair I have never meddled with them and don t intend to do it now I really think she ll be happy and she is devotedly attached to the young man Devotedly attached to the young man The tone and manner in which the earl repeated these words were such as to warrant an opinion that his lordship might have done very well on the stage had his attention been called to that profession It makes me sick to hear people talk in that way She wants to get married and she s a fool for her pains I can t help that only remember that I ll have no nonsense here about that other girl If he gives me trouble of that sort by I ll be the death of him When is the marriage to be ILLUSTRATION Devotedly attached to the young man They talk of February I won t have any tomfoolery and expense If she chooses to marry a clerk in an office she shall marry him as clerks are married He ll be the secretary before that De Courcy What difference does that make Secretary indeed What sort of men do you suppose secretaries are A beggar that came from nobody knows where I won t have any tomfoolery d ye hear Whereupon the countess said that she did hear and soon afterwards managed to escape The valet then took his turn and repeated after his hour of service that Old Nick in his tantrums had been more like the Prince of Darkness than ever CHAPTER XXVII ON MY HONOUR I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT In the meantime Lady Alexandrina endeavoured to realize to herself all the advantages and disadvantages of her own position She was not possessed of strong affections nor of depth of character nor of high purpose but she was no fool nor was she devoid of principle She had asked herself many times whether her present life was so happy as to make her think that a permanent continuance in it would suffice for her desires and she had always replied to herself that she would fain change to some other life if it were possible She had also questioned herself as to her rank of which she was quite sufficiently proud and had told herself that she could not degrade herself in the world without a heavy pang But she had at last taught herself to believe that she had more to gain by becoming the wife of such a man as Crosbie than by remaining as an unmarried daughter of her father s house There was much in her sister Amelia s position which she did not envy but there was less to envy in that of her sister Rosina The Gazebee house in saint John s Wood Road was not so magnificent as Courcy Castle but then it was less dull less embittered by torment and was moreover her sister s own Very many do marry commoners she had said to Margaretta Oh yes of course It makes a difference you know when a man has a fortune Of course it did make a difference Crosbie had no fortune was not even so rich as mister Gazebee could keep no carriage and would have no country house But then he was a man of fashion was more thought of in the world than mister Gazebee might probably rise in his own profession and was at any rate thoroughly presentable She would have preferred a gentleman with Lfive thousand a year but then as no gentleman with Lfive thousand a year came that way would she not be happier with mister Crosbie than she would be with no husband at all She was not very much in love with mister Crosbie but she thought that she could live with him comfortably and that on the whole it would be a good thing to be married And she made certain resolves as to the manner in which she would do her duty by her husband Her sister Amelia was paramount in her own house ruling indeed with a moderate endurable dominion and ruling much to her husband s advantage Alexandrina feared that she would not be allowed to rule but she could at any rate try She would do all in her power to make him comfortable and would be specially careful not to irritate him by any insistence on her own higher rank She would be very meek in this respect and if children should come she would be as painstaking about them as though her own father had been merely a clergyman or a lawyer She thought also much about poor Lilian Dale asking herself sundry questions with an idea of being high principled as to her duty in that respect Was she wrong in taking mister Crosbie away from Lilian Dale In answer to these questions she was able to assure herself comfortably that she was not wrong mister Crosbie would not under any circumstances marry Lilian Dale He had told her so more than once and that in a solemn way She could therefore be doing no harm to Lilian Dale If she entertained any inner feeling that Crosbie s fault in jilting Lilian Dale was less than it would have been had she herself not been an earl s daughter that her own rank did in some degree extenuate her lover s falseness she did not express it in words even to herself She did not get very much sympathy from her own family I m afraid he does not think much of his religious duties I m told that young men of that sort seldom do said Rosina I don t say you re wrong said Margaretta By no means Indeed I think less of it now than I did when Amelia did the same thing I shouldn t do it myself that s all Her father told her that he supposed she knew her own mind Her mother who endeavoured to comfort and in some sort to congratulate her nevertheless harped constantly on the fact that she was marrying a man without rank and without a fortune Her congratulations were apologetic and her comfortings took the guise of consolation Of course you won t be rich my dear but I really think you ll do very well mister Crosbie may be received anywhere and you never need be ashamed of him By which the countess implied that her elder married daughter was occasionally called on to be ashamed of her husband I wish he could keep a carriage for you but perhaps that will come some day Upon the whole Alexandrina did not repent and stoutly told her father that she did know her own mind During all this time Lily Dale was as yet perfect in her happiness That delay of a day or two in the receipt of the expected letter from her lover had not disquieted her She had promised him that she would not distrust him and she was firmly minded to keep her promises Indeed no idea of breaking it came to her at this time She was disappointed when the postman would come and bring no letter for her disappointed as is the husbandman when the longed for rain does not come to refresh the parched earth but she was in no degree angry He will explain it she said to herself And she assured Bell that men never recognized the hunger and thirst after letters which women feel when away from those whom they love Then they heard at the Small House that the squire had gone away from Allington During the last few days Bernard had not been much with them and now they heard the news not through their cousin but from Hopkins I really can t undertake to say Miss Bell where the master s gone to It s not likely the master d tell me where he was going to not unless it was about seeds or the likes of that He has gone very suddenly said Bell Well miss I ve nothing to say to that And why shouldn t he go sudden if he likes I only know he had his gig and went to the station If you was to bury me alive I couldn t tell you more I should like to try said Lily as they walked away He is such a cross old thing I wonder whether Bernard has gone with my uncle And then they thought no more about it On the day after that Bernard came down to the Small House but he said nothing by way of accounting for the squire s absence He is in London I know said Bernard I hope he ll call on mister Crosbie said Lily But on this subject Bernard said not a word He did ask Lily whether she had heard from Adolphus in answer to which she replied with as indifferent a voice as she could assume that she had not had a letter that morning I shall be angry with him if he s not a good correspondent said missus Dale when she and Lily were alone together No mamma you mustn t be angry with him I won t let you be angry with him Please to remember he s my lover and not yours But I can see you when you watch for the postman I won t watch for the postman any more if it makes you have bad thoughts about him Yes they are bad thoughts I won t have you think that he doesn t do everything that is right On the next morning the postman brought a letter or rather a note and Lily at once saw that it was from Crosbie She had contrived to intercept it near the back door at which the postman called so that her mother should not watch her watchings nor see her disappointment if none should come Thank you Jane she said very calmly when the eager kindly girl ran to her with the little missive and she walked off to some solitude trying to hide her impatience The note had seemed so small that it amazed her but when she opened it the contents amazed her more There was neither beginning nor end There was no appellation of love and no signature It contained but two lines I will write to you at length to morrow This is my first day in London and I have been so driven about that I cannot write That was all and it was scrawled on half a sheet of note paper Why at any rate had he not called her his dearest Lily Why had he not assured her that he was ever her own Such expressions meaning so much may be conveyed in a glance of the pen Ah she said if he knew how I hunger and thirst after his love She had but a moment left to her before she must join her mother and sister and she used that moment in remembering her promise I know it is all right she said to herself He does not think of these things as I do He had to write at the last moment as he was leaving his office And then with a quiet smiling face she walked into the breakfast parlour What does he say Lily asked Bell What would you give to know said Lily I wouldn t give twopence for the whole of it said Bell When you get anybody to write to you letters I wonder whether you ll show them to everybody But if there s any special London news I suppose we might hear it said missus Dale But suppose there s no special London news mamma The poor man had only been in town one day you know and there never is any news at this time of the year Had he seen uncle Christopher I don t think he had but he doesn t say We shall get all the news from him when he comes He cares much more about London news than Adolphus does And then there was no more said about the letter But Lily had read her two former letters over and over again at the breakfast table and though she had not read them aloud she had repeated many words out of them and had so annotated upon them that her mother who had heard her could have almost re written them Now she did not even show the paper and then her absence during which she had read the letter had hardly exceeded a minute or two All this missus Dale observed and she knew that her daughter had been again disappointed In fact that day Lily was very serious but she did not appear to be unhappy Early after breakfast Bell went over to the parsonage and missus Dale and her youngest daughter sat together over their work Mamma she said I hope you and I are not to be divided when I go to live in London We shall never be divided in heart my love Ah but that will not be enough for happiness though perhaps enough to prevent absolute unhappiness I shall want to see you touch you and pet you as I do now And she came and knelt on the cushion at her mother s feet You will have some one else to caress and pet perhaps many others Do you mean to say that you are going to throw me off mamma God forbid my darling It is not mothers that throw off their children What shall I have left when you and Bell are gone from me But we will never be gone That s what I mean We are to be just the same to you always even though we are married I must have my right to be here as much as I have it now and in return you shall have your right to be there His house must be a home to you not a cold place which you may visit now and again with your best clothes on You know what I mean when I say that we must not be divided But Lily Well mamma I have no doubt we shall be happy together you and I But you were going to say more than that Only this that your house will be his house and will be full without me A daughter s marriage is always a painful parting Is it mamma Not that I would have it otherwise than it is Do not think that I would wish to keep you at home with me Of course you will both marry and leave me I hope that he to whom you are going to devote yourself may be spared to love you and protect you Then the widow s heart became too full and she put away her child from her that she might hide her face Mamma mamma I wish I was not going from you No Lily do not say that I should not be contented with life if I did not see both my girls married I think that it is the only lot which can give to a woman perfect content and satisfaction I would have you both married I should be the most selfish being alive if I wished otherwise Bell will settle herself near you and then you will see more of her and love her better than you do me I shall not love her better I wish she would marry some London man and then you would come with us and be near to us Do you know mamma I sometimes think you don t like this place here Your uncle has been very kind to give it to us I know he has and we have been very happy here But if Bell should leave you Then should I go also Your uncle has been very kind but I sometimes feel that his kindness is a burden which I should not be strong enough to bear solely on my own shoulders And what should keep me here then missus Dale as she said this felt that the here of which she spoke extended beyond the limits of the home which she held through the charity of her brother in law Might not all the world as far as she was concerned in it be contained in that here How was she to live if both her children should be taken away from her She had already realized the fact that Crosbie s house could never be a home to her never even a temporary home Her visits there must be of that full dressed nature to which Lily had alluded It was impossible that she could explain this to Lily She would not prophesy that the hero of her girl s heart would be inhospitable to his wife s mother but such had been her reading of Crosbie s character Alas alas as matters were to go his hospitality or inhospitality would be matter of small moment to them Again in the afternoon the two sisters were together and Lily was still more serious than her wont It might almost have been gathered from her manner that this marriage of hers was about to take place at once and that she was preparing to leave her home Bell she said I wonder why doctor Crofts never comes to see us now It isn t a month since he was here at our party A month But there was a time when he made some pretext for being here every other day Yes when mamma was ill Ay and since mamma was well too But I suppose I must not break the promise you made me give you He s not to be talked about even yet is he I didn t say he was not to be talked about You know what I meant Lily and what I meant then I mean now And how long will it be before you mean something else I do hope it will come some day I do indeed It never will Lily I once fancied that I cared for doctor Crofts but it was only fancy I know it because She was going to explain that her knowledge on that point was assured to her because since that day she had felt that she might have learned to love another man But that other man had been mister Crosbie and so she stopped herself I wish he would come and ask you himself He will never do so He would never ask such a question without encouragement and I shall give him none Nor will he ever think of marrying till he can do so without without what he thinks to be imprudence as regards money He has courage enough to be poor himself without unhappiness but he has not courage to endure poverty with a wife I know well what his feelings are Well we shall see said Lily I shouldn t wonder if you were married first now Bell For my part I m quite prepared to wait for three years Late on that evening the squire returned to Allington Bernard having driven over to meet him at the station He had telegraphed to his nephew that he would be back by a late train and no more than this had been heard from him since he went On that day Bernard had seen none of the ladies at the Small House With Bell at the present moment it was impossible that he should be on easy terms He could not meet her alone without recurring to the one special subject of interest between them and as to that he did not choose to speak without much forethought He had not known himself when he had gone about his wooing so lightly thinking it a slight thing whether or no he might be accepted Now it was no longer a slight thing to him I do not know that it was love that made him so eager not good honest downright love But he had set his heart upon the object and with the wilfulness of a Dale was determined that it should be his He had no remotest idea of giving up his cousin but he had at last persuaded himself that she was not to be won without some toil and perhaps also some delay Nor had he been in a humour to talk either to missus Dale or to Lily He feared that Lady Julia s news was true that at any rate there might be in it something of truth and while thus in doubt he could not go down to the Small House So he hung about the place by himself with a cigar in his mouth fearing that something evil was going to happen and when the message came for him almost shuddered as he seated himself in the gig What would it become him to do in this emergency if Crosbie had truly been guilty of the villany with which Lady Julia had charged him Thirty years ago he would have called the man out and shot at him till one of them was hit Now a days it was hardly possible for a man to do that and yet what would the world say of him if he allowed such an injury as this to pass without vengeance His uncle as he came forth from the station with his travelling bag in his hand was stern gloomy and silent He came out and took his place in the gig almost without speaking There were strangers about and therefore his nephew at first could ask no question but as the gig turned the corner out of the station house yard he demanded the news What have you heard he said But even then the squire did not answer at once He shook his head and turned away his face as though he did not choose to be interrogated Have you seen him sir asked Bernard No he has not dared to see me Then it is true True yes it is all true Why did you bring the scoundrel here It has been your fault No sir I must contradict that I did not know him for a scoundrel But it was your duty to have known him before you brought him here among them Poor girl how is she to be told Then she does not know it I fear not Have you seen them I saw them yesterday and she did not know it then she may have heard it to day I don t think so I believe he has been too great a coward to write to her A coward indeed How can any man find the courage to write such a letter as that By degrees the squire told his tale How he had gone to Lady Julia had made his way to London had tracked Crosbie to his club and had there learned the whole truth from Crosbie s friend Fowler Pratt we already know The coward escaped me while I was talking to the man he sent down said the squire It was a concerted plan and I think he was right I should have brained him in the hall of the club On the following morning Pratt had called upon him at his inn with Crosbie s apology His apology said the squire I have it in my pocket Poor reptile wretched worm of a man 
5712_48842_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I cannot understand it 
none	none	On my honour Bernard I do not understand it I think men are changed since I knew much of them It would have been impossible for me to write such a letter as that He went on telling how Pratt had brought him this letter and had stated that Crosbie declined an interview The gentleman had the goodness to assure me that no good could come from such a meeting You mean I answered that I cannot touch pitch and not be defiled He acknowledged that the man was pitch Indeed he could not say a word for his friend I know Pratt He is a gentleman I am sure he would not excuse him Excuse him How could any one excuse him Words could not be found to excuse him And then he sat silent for some half mile On my honour Bernard I can hardly yet bring myself to believe it It is so new to me It makes me feel that the world is changed and that it is no longer worth a man s while to live in it And he is engaged to this other girl Oh yes with the full consent of the family It is all arranged and the settlements no doubt in the lawyer s hands by this time He must have gone away from here determined to throw her over Indeed I don t suppose he ever meant to marry her He was just passing away his time here in the country He meant it up to the time of his leaving I don t think it Had he found me able and willing to give her a fortune he might perhaps have married her But I don t think he meant it for a moment after I told him that she would have nothing Well here we are I may truly say that I never before came back to my own house with so sore a heart They sat silently over their supper the squire showing more open sorrow than might have been expected from his character What am I to say to them in the morning he repeated over and over again How am I to do it And if I tell the mother how is she to tell her child Do you think that he has given no intimation of his purpose As far as I can tell none That man Pratt knew that he had not done so yesterday afternoon I asked him what were the intentions of his blackguard friend and he said that he did not know that Crosbie would probably have written to me Then he brought me this letter There it is and the squire threw the letter over the table read it and let me have it back He thinks probably that the trouble is now over as far as he is concerned It was a vile letter to have written not because the language was bad or the mode of expression unfeeling or the facts falsely stated but because the thing to be told was in itself so vile There are deeds which will not bear a gloss sins as to which the perpetrator cannot speak otherwise than as a reptile circumstances which change a man and put upon him the worthlessness of vermin Crosbie had struggled hard to write it going home to do it after his last interview on that night with Pratt But he had sat moodily in his chair at his lodgings unable to take the pen in his hand Pratt was to come to him at his office on the following morning and he went to bed resolving that he would write it at his desk On the next day Pratt was there before a word of it had been written I can t stand this kind of thing said Pratt If you mean me to take it you must write it at once Then with inward groaning Crosbie sat himself at his table and the words at last were forthcoming Such words as they were I know that I can have no excuse to make to you or to her But circumstanced as I now am the truth is the best I feel that I should not make Miss Dale happy and therefore as an honest man I think I best do my duty by relinquishing the honour which she and you had proposed for me There was more of it but we all know of what words such letters are composed and how men write when they feel themselves constrained to write as reptiles As an honest man repeated the squire On my honour Bernard as a gentleman I do not understand it I cannot believe it possible that the man who wrote that letter was sitting the other day as a guest at my table What are we to do to him said Bernard after a while Treat him as you would a rat Throw your stick at him if he comes under your feet but beware above all things that he does not get into your house That is too late for us now There must be more than that uncle I don t know what more There are deeds for committing which a man is doubly damned because he has screened himself from overt punishment by the nature of his own villany We have to remember Lily s name and do what may best tend to her comfort Poor girl poor girl Then they were silent till the squire rose and took his bed candle Bernard he said let my sister in law know early to morrow that I will see her here if she will be good enough to come to me after breakfast Do not have anything else said at the Small House It may be that he has written to day Then the squire went to bed and Bernard sat over the dining room fire meditating on it all How would the world expect that he should behave to Crosbie and what should he do when he met Crosbie at the club CHAPTER XXVIII THE BOARD ILLUSTRATION untitled Crosbie as we already know went to his office in Whitehall on the morning after his escape from Sebright s at which establishment he left the Squire of Allington in conference with Fowler Pratt He had seen Fowler Pratt again that same night and the course of the story will have shown what took place at that interview He went early to his office knowing that he had before him the work of writing two letters neither of which would run very glibly from his pen One was to be his missive to the squire to be delivered by his friend the other that fatal epistle to poor Lily which as the day passed away he found himself utterly unable to accomplish The letter to the squire he did write under certain threats and as we have seen was considered to have degraded himself to the vermin rank of humanity by the meanness of his production But on reaching his office he found that other cares awaited him cares which he would have taken much delight in bearing had the state of his mind enabled him to take delight in anything On entering the lobby of his office at ten o clock he became aware that he was received by the messengers assembled there with almost more than their usual deference He was always a great man at the General Committee Office but there are shades of greatness and shades of deference which though quite beyond the powers of definition nevertheless manifest themselves clearly to the experienced ear and eye He walked through to his own apartment and there found two official letters addressed to him lying on his table The first which came to hand though official was small and marked private and it was addressed in the handwriting of his old friend Butterwell the outgoing secretary I shall see you in the morning nearly as soon as you get this said the semi official note but I must be the first to congratulate you on the acquisition of my old shoes They will be very easy in the wearing to you though they pinched my corns a little at first I dare say they want new soling and perhaps they are a little down at heels but you will find some excellent cobbler to make them all right and will give them a grace in the wearing which they have sadly lacked since they came into my possession I wish you much joy with them c c He then opened the larger official letter but that had now but little interest for him He could have made a copy of the contents without seeing them The Board of Commissioners had had great pleasure in promoting him to the office of secretary vacated by the promotion of mister Butterwell to a seat at their own Board and then the letter was signed by mister Butterwell himself How delightful to him would have been this welcome on his return to his office had his heart in other respects been free from care And as he thought of this he remembered all Lily s charms He told himself how much she excelled the noble scion of the De Courcy stock with whom he was now destined to mate himself how the bride he had rejected excelled the one he had chosen in grace beauty faith freshness and all feminine virtues If he could only wipe out the last fortnight from the facts of his existence But fortnights such as those are not to be wiped out not even with many sorrowful years of tedious scrubbing And at this moment it seemed to him as though all those impediments which had frightened him when he had thought of marrying Lily Dale were withdrawn That which would have been terrible with seven or eight hundred a year would have been made delightful with twelve or thirteen Why had his fate been so unkind to him Why had not this promotion come to him but one fortnight earlier Why had it not been declared before he had made his visit to that terrible castle He even said to himself that if he had positively known the fact before Pratt had seen mister Dale he would have sent a different message to the squire and would have braved the anger of all the race of the De Courcys But in that he lied to himself and he knew that he did so An earl in his imagination was hedged by so strong a divinity that his treason towards Alexandrina could do no more than peep at what it would It had been considered but little by him when the project first offered itself to his mind to jilt the niece of a small rural squire but it was not in him to jilt the daughter of a countess That house full of babies in saint John s Wood appeared to him now under a very different guise from that which it wore as he sat in his room at Courcy Castle on the evening of his arrival there Then such an establishment had to him the flavour of a graveyard It was as though he were going to bury himself alive Now that it was out of his reach he thought of it as a paradise upon earth And then he considered what sort of a paradise Lady Alexandrina would make for him It was astonishing how ugly was the Lady Alexandrina how old how graceless how destitute of all pleasant charm seen through the spectacles which he wore at the present moment During his first hour at the office he did nothing One or two of the younger clerks came in and congratulated him with much heartiness He was popular at his office and they had got a step by his promotion Then he met one or two of the elder clerks and was congratulated with much less heartiness I suppose it s all right said one bluff old gentleman My time is gone by I know I married too early to be able to wear a good coat when I was young and I never was acquainted with any lords or lords families The sting of this was the sharper because Crosbie had begun to feel how absolutely useless to him had been all that high interest and noble connection which he had formed He had really been promoted because he knew more about his work than any of the other men and Lady De Courcy s influential relation at the India Board had not yet even had time to write a note upon the subject At eleven mister Butterwell came into Crosbie s room and the new secretary was forced to clothe himself in smiles mister Butterwell was a pleasant handsome man of about fifty who had never yet set the Thames on fire and had never attempted to do so He was perhaps a little more civil to great men and a little more patronizing to those below him than he would have been had he been perfect But there was something frank and English even in his mode of bowing before the mighty ones and to those who were not mighty he was rather too civil than either stern or supercilious He knew that he was not very clever but he knew also how to use those who were clever He seldom made any mistake and was very scrupulous not to tread on men s corns Though he had no enemies yet he had a friend or two and we may therefore say of mister Butterwell that he had walked his path in life discreetly At the age of thirty five he had married a lady with some little fortune and now he lived a pleasant easy smiling life in a villa at Putney When mister Butterwell heard as he often did hear of the difficulty which an English gentleman has of earning his bread in his own country he was wont to look back on his own career with some complacency He knew that he had not given the world much yet he had received largely and no one had begrudged it to him Tact mister Butterwell used to say to himself as he walked along the paths of his Putney villa Tact Tact Tact Crosbie he said as he entered the room cheerily I congratulate you with all my heart I do indeed You have got the step early in life and you deserve it thoroughly much better than I did when I was appointed to the same office Oh no said Crosbie gloomily But I say Oh yes We are deuced lucky to have such a man and so I told the commissioners I m sure I m very much obliged to you I ve known it all along before you left even Sir Raffle Buffle had told me he was to go to the Income tax Office The chair is two thousand there you know and I had been promised the first seat at the Board Ah I wish I d known said Crosbie You are much better as you are said Butterwell There s no pleasure like a surprise Besides one knows a thing of that kind and yet doesn t know it I don t mind saying now that I knew it swearing that I knew it but I wouldn t have said so to a living being the day before yesterday There are such slips between the cups and the lips Suppose Sir Raffle had not gone to the Income tax Exactly so said Crosbie But it s all right now Indeed I sat at the Board yesterday though I signed the letter afterwards I m not sure that I don t lose more than I gain What with three hundred a year more and less work Ah but look at the interest of the thing The secretary sees everything and knows everything But I m getting old and as you say the lighter work will suit me By the by will you come down to Putney to morrow missus Butterwell will be delighted to see the new secretary There s nobody in town now so you can have no ground for refusing But mister Crosbie did find some ground for refusing It would have been impossible for him to have sat and smiled at missus Butterwell s table in his present frame of mind In a mysterious half explanatory manner he let mister Butterwell know that private affairs of importance made it absolutely necessary that he should remain that evening in town And indeed as he said he was not his own master just at present By the by of course not I had quite forgotten to congratulate you on that head So you re going to be married Well I m very glad and hope you ll be as lucky as I have been Thank you said Crosbie again rather gloomily A young lady from near Guestwick isn t it or somewhere in those parts N no stammered Crosbie The lady comes from Barsetshire Why I heard the name Isn t she a Bell or Tait or Ball or some such name as that No said Crosbie assuming what boldness he could command Her name is De Courcy One of the earl s daughters Yes said Crosbie Oh I beg your pardon I d heard wrong You re going to be allied to a very noble family and I am heartily glad to hear of your success in life Then Butterwell shook him very cordially by the hand having offered him no such special testimony of approval when under the belief that he was going to marry a Bell a Tait or a Ball All the same mister Butterwell began to think that there was something wrong He had heard from an indubitable source that Crosbie had engaged himself to a niece of a squire with whom he had been staying near Guestwick a girl without any money and mister Butterwell in his wisdom had thought his friend Crosbie to be rather a fool for his pains But now he was going to marry one of the De Courcys mister Butterwell was rather at his wits ends Well we shall be sitting at two you know and of course you ll come to us If you re at leisure before that I ll make over what papers I have to you I ve not been a Lord Eldon in my office and they won t break your back Immediately after that Fowler Pratt had been shown into Crosbie s room and Crosbie had written the letter to the squire under Pratt s eye He could take no joy in his promotion When Pratt left him he tried to lighten his heart He endeavoured to throw Lily and her wrongs behind him and fix his thoughts on his advancing successes in life but he could not do it A self imposed trouble will not allow itself to be banished If a man lose a thousand pounds by a friend s fault or by a turn in the wheel of fortune he can if he be a man put his grief down and trample it under foot he can exorcise the spirit of his grievance and bid the evil one depart from out of his house But such exorcism is not to be used when the sorrow has come from a man s own folly and sin especially not if it has come from his own selfishness Such are the cases which make men drink which drive them on to the avoidance of all thought which create gamblers and reckless prodigals which are the promoters of suicide How could he avoid writing this letter to Lily He might blow his brains out and so let there be an end of it all It was to such reflections that he came when he sat himself down endeavouring to reap satisfaction from his promotion But Crosbie was not a man to commit suicide In giving him his due I must protest that he was too good for that He knew too well that a pistol bullet could not be the be all and the end all here and there was too much manliness in him for so cowardly an escape The burden must be borne But how was he to bear it There he sat till it was two o clock neglecting mister Butterwell and his office papers and not stirring from his seat till a messenger summoned him before the Board The Board as he entered the room was not such a Board as the public may perhaps imagine such Boards to be There was a round table with a few pens lying about and a comfortable leathern arm chair at the side of it farthest from the door Sir Raffle Buffle was leaving his late colleagues and was standing with his back to the fire place talking very loudly Sir Raffle was a great bully and the Board was uncommonly glad to be rid of him but as this was to be his last appearance at the Committee Office they submitted to his voice meekly mister Butterwell was standing close to him essaying to laugh mildly at Sir Raffle s jokes A little man hardly more than five feet high with small but honest looking eyes and close cut hair was standing behind the arm chair rubbing his hands together and longing for the departure of Sir Raffle in order that he might sit down This was mister Optimist the new chairman in praise of whose appointment the Daily Jupiter had been so loud declaring that the present Minister was showing himself superior to all Ministers who had ever gone before him in giving promotion solely on the score of merit The Daily Jupiter a fortnight since had published a very eloquent article strongly advocating the claims of mister Optimist and was naturally pleased to find that its advice had been taken Has not an obedient Minister a right to the praise of those powers which he obeys ILLUSTRATION The Board mister Optimist was in truth an industrious little gentleman very well connected who had served the public all his life and who was at any rate honest in his dealings Nor was he a bully such as his predecessor It might however be a question whether he carried guns enough for the command in which he was now to be employed There was but one other member of the Board Major Fiasco by name a discontented broken hearted silent man who had been sent to the General Committee Office some few years before because he was not wanted anywhere else He was a man who had intended to do great things when he entered public life and had possessed the talent and energy for things moderately great He had also possessed to a certain extent the ear of those high in office but in some way matters had not gone well with him and in running his course he had gone on the wrong side of the post He was still in the prime of life and yet all men knew that Major Fiasco had nothing further to expect from the public or from the Government Indeed there were not wanting those who said that Major Fiasco was already in receipt of a liberal income for which he gave no work in return that he merely filled a chair for four hours a day four or five days a week signing his name to certain forms and documents reading or pretending to read certain papers but in truth doing no good Major Fiasco on the other hand considered himself to be a deeply injured individual and he spent his life in brooding over his wrongs He believed now in nothing and in nobody He had begun public life striving to be honest and he now regarded all around him as dishonest He had no satisfaction in any man other than that which he found when some event would show to him that this or that other compeer of his own had proved himself to be self interested false or fraudulent Don t tell me Butterwell he would say for with mister Butterwell he maintained some semi official intimacy and he would take that gentleman by the button hole holding him close Don t tell me I know what men are I ve seen the world I ve been looking at things with my eyes open I knew what he was doing And then he would tell of the sly deed of some official known well to them both not denouncing it by any means but affecting to take it for granted that the man in question was a rogue Butterwell would shrug his shoulders and laugh gently and say that upon his word he didn t think the world so bad as Fiasco made it out to be Nor did he for Butterwell believed in many things He believed in his Putney villa on this earth and he believed also that he might achieve some sort of Putney villa in the world beyond without undergoing present martyrdom His Putney villa first with all its attendant comforts and then his duty to the public afterwards It was thus that mister Butterwell regulated his conduct and as he was solicitous that the villa should be as comfortable a home to his wife as to himself and that it should be specially comfortable to his friends I do not think that we need quarrel with his creed mister Optimist believed in everything but especially he believed in the Prime Minister in the Daily Jupiter in the General Committee Office and in himself He had long thought that everything was nearly right but now that he himself was chairman at the General Committee Office he was quite sure that everything must be right In Sir Raffle Buffle indeed he had never believed and now it was perhaps the greatest joy of his life that he should never again be called upon to hear the tones of that terrible knight s hated voice Seeing who were the components of the new Board it may be presumed that Crosbie would look forward to enjoying a not uninfluential position in his office There were indeed some among the clerks who did not hesitate to say that the new secretary would have it pretty nearly all his own way As for Old Opt there would be they said no difficulty about him Only tell him that such and such a decision was his own and he would be sure to believe the teller Butterwell was not fond of work and had been accustomed to lean upon Crosbie for many years As for Fiasco he would be cynical in words but wholly indifferent in deed If the whole office were made to go to the mischief Fiasco in his own grim way would enjoy the confusion Wish you joy Crosbie said Sir Raffle standing up on the rug waiting for the new secretary to go up to him and shake hands But Sir Raffle was going and the new secretary did not indulge him Thank ye Sir Raffle said Crosbie without going near the rug mister Crosbie I congratulate you most sincerely said mister Optimist Your promotion has been the result altogether of your own merit You have been selected for the high office which you are now called upon to fill solely because it has been thought that you are the most fit man to perform the onerous duties attached to it Hum h m ha As regards my share in the recommendation which we found ourselves bound to submit to the Treasury I must say that I never felt less hesitation in my life and I believe I may declare as much as regards the other members of the Board And mister Optimist looked around him for approving words He had come forward from his standing ground behind his chair to welcome Crosbie and had shaken his hand cordially Fiasco also had risen from his seat and had assured Crosbie in a whisper that he had feathered his nest uncommon well Then he had sat down again Indeed you may as far as I am concerned said Butterwell I told the Chancellor of the Exchequer said Sir Raffle speaking very loud and with much authority that unless he had some first rate man to send from elsewhere I could name a fitting candidate Sir Raffle he said I mean to keep it in the office and therefore shall be glad of your opinion In that case mister Chancellor said I mister Crosbie must be the man mister Crosbie shall be the man said the Chancellor And mister Crosbie is the man Your friend Sark spoke to Lord Brock about it said Fiasco Now the Earl of Sark was a young nobleman of much influence at the present moment and Lord Brock was the Prime Minister You should thank Lord Sark Had as much to do with it as if my footman had spoken said Sir Raffle I am very much obliged to the Board for their good opinion said Crosbie gravely I am obliged to Lord Sark as well and also to your footman Sir Raffle if as you seem to say he has interested himself in my favour I didn t say anything of the kind said Sir Raffle I thought it right to make you understand that it was my opinion given of course officially which prevailed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Well gentlemen as I shall be wanted in the city I will say good morning to you Is my carriage ready Boggs Upon which the attendant messenger opened the door and the great Sir Raffle Buffle took his final departure from the scene of his former labours As to the duties of your new office and mister Optimist continued his speech taking no other notice of the departure of his enemy than what was indicated by an increased brightness of his eye and a more satisfactory tone of voice you will find yourself quite familiar with them Indeed he will said Butterwell And I am quite sure that you will perform them with equal credit to yourself satisfaction to the department and advantage to the public We shall always be glad to have your opinion on any subject of importance that may come before us and as regards the internal discipline of the office we feel that we may leave it safely in your hands In any matter of importance you will of course consult us and I feel very confident that we shall go on together with great comfort and with mutual confidence Then mister Optimist looked at his brother commissioners sat down in his arm chair and taking in his hands some papers before him began the routine business of the day It was nearly five o clock when on this special occasion the secretary returned from the board room to his own office Not for a moment had the weight been off his shoulders while Sir Raffle had been bragging or mister Optimist making his speech He had been thinking not of them but of Lily Dale and though they had not discovered his thoughts they had perceived that he was hardly like himself I never saw a man so little elated by good fortune in my life said mister Optimist Ah he s got something on his mind said Butterwell He s going to be married I believe If that s the case it s no wonder he shouldn t be elated said Major Fiasco who was himself a bachelor When in his own room again Crosbie at once seized on a sheet of note paper as though by hurrying himself on with it he could get that letter to Allington written But though the paper was before him and the pen in his hand the letter did not would not get itself written With what words was he to begin it To whom should it be written How was he to declare himself the villain which he had made himself The letters from his office were taken away every night shortly after six and at six o clock he had not written a word I will do it at home to night he said to himself and then tearing off a scrap of paper he scratched those few lines which Lily received and which she had declined to communicate to her mother or sister Crosbie as he wrote them conceived that they would in some way prepare the poor girl for the coming blow that they would at any rate make her know that all was not right but in so supposing he had not counted on the constancy of her nature nor had he thought of the promise which she had given him that nothing should make her doubt him He wrote the scrap and then taking his hat walked off through the gloom of the November evening up Charing Cross and saint Martin s Lane towards the Seven Dials and Bloomsbury into regions of the town with which he had no business and which he never frequented He hardly knew where he went or wherefore How was he to escape from the weight of the burden which was now crushing him It seemed to him as though he would change his position with thankfulness for that of the junior clerk in his office if only that junior clerk had upon his mind no such betrayal of trust as that of which he was guilty At half past seven he found himself at Sebright s and there he dined A man will dine even though his heart be breaking Then he got into a cab and had himself taken home to Mount Street During his walk he had sworn to himself that he would not go to bed that night till the letter was written and posted It was twelve before the first words were marked on the paper and yet he kept his oath Between two and three in the cold moonlight he crawled out and deposited his letter in the nearest post office CHAPTER XXIX JOHN EAMES RETURNS TO BURTON CRESCENT John Eames and Crosbie returned to town on the same day It will be remembered how Eames had assisted Lord De Guest in the matter of the bull and how great had been the earl s gratitude on the occasion The memory of this and the strong encouragement which he received from his mother and sister for having made such a friend by his gallantry lent some slight satisfaction to his last hours at home But his two misfortunes were too serious to allow of anything like real happiness He was leaving Lily behind him engaged to be married to a man whom he hated and he was returning to Burton Crescent where he would have to face Amelia Roper Amelia either in her rage or in her love The prospect of Amelia in her rage was very terrible to him but his greatest fear was of Amelia in her love He had in his letter declined matrimony but what if she talked down all his objections and carried him off to church in spite of himself When he reached London and got into a cab with his portmanteau he could hardly fetch up courage to bid the man drive him to Burton Crescent I might as well go to an hotel for the night he said to himself and then I can learn how things are going on from Cradell at the office Nevertheless he did give the direction to Burton Crescent and when it was once given felt ashamed to change it But as he was driven up to the well known door his heart was so low within him that he might almost be said to have lost it When the cabman demanded whether he should knock he could not answer and when the maid servant at the door greeted him he almost ran away Who s at home said he asking the question in a very low voice There s missus said the girl and Miss Spruce and missus Lupex He s away somewhere in his tantrums again and there s mister Is Miss Roper here he said still whispering Oh yes Miss Mealyer s here said the girl speaking in a cruelly loud voice She was in the dining room just now putting out the table Miss Mealyer And the girl as she called out the name opened the dining room door Johnny Eames felt that his knees were too weak to support him But Miss Mealyer was not in the dining room She had perceived the advancing cab of her sworn adorer and had thought it expedient to retreat from her domestic duties and fortify herself among her brushes and ribbons Had it been possible that she should know how very weak and cowardly was the enemy against whom she was called upon to put herself in action she might probably have fought her battle somewhat differently and have achieved a speedy victory at the cost of an energetic shot or two But she did not know She thought it probable that she might obtain power over him and manage him but it did not occur to her that his legs were so weak beneath him that she might almost blow him over with a breath None but the worst and most heartless of women know the extent of their own power over men as none but the worst and most heartless of men know the extent of their power over women Amelia Roper was not a good specimen of the female sex but there were worse women than her She ain t there mister Eames but you ll see her in the drawen room said the girl And it s she ll be glad to see you back again mister Eames But he scrupulously passed the door of the upstairs sitting room not even looking within it and contrived to get himself into his own chamber without having encountered anybody Here s yer ot water mister Eames said the girl coming up to him after an interval of half an hour and dinner ll be on the table in ten minutes mister Cradell is come in and so is missus s son It was still open to him to go out and dine at some eating house in the Strand He could start out leaving word that he was engaged and so postpone the evil hour He had almost made up his mind to do so and certainly would have done it had not the sitting room door opened as he was on the landing place The door opened and he found himself confronting the assembled company First came Cradell and leaning on his arm I regret to say was missus Lupex Egyptia conjux Then there came Miss Spruce with young Roper Amelia and her mother brought up the rear together There was no longer question of flight now and poor Eames before he knew what he was doing was carried down into the dining room with the rest of the company They were all glad to see him and welcomed him back warmly but he was so much beside himself that he could not ascertain whether Amelia s voice was joined with the others He was already seated at table and had before him a plate of soup before he recognized the fact that he was sitting between missus Roper and missus Lupex The latter lady had separated herself from mister Cradell as she entered the room Under all the circumstances perhaps it will be better for us to be apart she said A lady can t make herself too safe can she missus Roper There s no danger between you and me is there mister Eames specially when Miss Amelia is opposite The last words however were intended to be whispered into his ear But Johnny made no answer to her contenting himself for the moment with wiping the perspiration from his brow There was Amelia opposite to him looking at him the very Amelia to whom he had written declining the honour of marrying her Of what her mood towards him might be he could form no judgment from her looks Her face was simply stern and impassive and she seemed inclined to eat her dinner in silence A slight smile of derision had passed across her face as she heard missus Lupex whisper and it might have been discerned that her nose at the same time became somewhat elevated but she said not a word I hope you ve enjoyed yourself mister Eames among the vernal beauties of the country said missus Lupex Very much thank you he replied There s nothing like the country at this autumnal season of the year As for myself I ve never been accustomed to remain in London after the breaking up of the beau monde We ve usually been to Broadstairs which is a very charming place with most elegant society but now and she shook her head by which all the company knew that she intended to allude to the sins of mister Lupex I d never wish to sleep out of London for my part said missus Roper When a woman s got a house over her head I don t think her mind s ever easy out of it She had not intended any reflection on missus Lupex for not having a house of her own but that lady immediately bristled up That s just what the snails say missus Roper And as for having a house of one s own it s a very good thing no doubt sometimes but that s according to circumstances It has suited me lately to live in lodgings but there s no knowing whether I mayn t fall lower than that yet and have but here she stopped herself and looking over at mister Cradell nodded her head And have to let them said missus Roper I hope you ll be more lucky with your lodgers than I have been with some of mine Jemima hand the potatoes to Miss Spruce Miss Spruce do let me send you a little more gravy There s plenty here really missus Roper was probably thinking of mister Todgers I hope I shall said missus Lupex But as I was saying Broadstairs is delightful Were you ever at Broadstairs mister Cradell Never missus Lupex I generally go abroad in my leave One sees more of the world you know I was at Dieppe last June and found that very delightful though rather lonely I shall go to Ostend this year only December is so late for Ostend It was a deuced shame my getting December wasn t it Johnny Yes it was said Eames I managed better And what have you been doing mister Eames said missus Lupex with one of her sweetest smiles Whatever it may have been you ve not been false to the cause of beauty I m sure And she looked over to Amelia with a knowing smile But Amelia was engaged upon her plate and went on with her dinner without turning her eyes either on missus Lupex or on John Eames I haven t done anything particular said Eames I ve just been staying with my mother We ve been very social here haven t we Miss Amelia continued missus Lupex Only now and then a cloud comes across the heavens and the lights at the banquet are darkened Then she put her handkerchief up to her eyes sobbing deeply and they all knew that she was again alluding to the sins of her husband As soon as dinner was over the ladies with young mister Roper retired and Eames and Cradell were left to take their wine over the dining room fire or their glass of gin and water as it might be Well Caudle old fellow said one Well Johnny my boy said the other What s the news at the office said Eames Muggeridge has been playing the very mischief Muggeridge was the second clerk in Cradell s room We re going to put him into Coventry and not speak to him except officially But to tell you the truth my hands have been so full here at home that I haven t thought much about the office What am I to do about that woman Do about her How do about her Yes what am I to do about her How am I to manage with her There s Lupex off again in one of his fits of jealousy But it s not your fault I suppose Well I can t just say I am fond of her and that s the long and the short of it deuced fond of her But my dear Caudle you know she s that man s wife Oh yes I know all about it I m not going to defend myself It s wrong I know pleasant but wrong But what s a fellow to do I suppose in strict morality I ought to leave the lodgings But by George I don t see why a man s to be turned out in that way And then I couldn t make a clean score with old mother Roper But I say old fellow who gave you the gold chain Well it was an old family friend at Guestwick or rather I should say a man who said he knew my father And he gave you that because he knew your governor Is there a watch to it Yes there s a watch It wasn t exactly that There was some trouble about a bull To tell the truth it was Lord De Guest the queerest fellow Caudle you ever met in your life but such a trump I ve got to go and dine with him at Christmas And then the old story of the bull was told I wish I could find a lord in a field with a bull said Cradell We may however be permitted to doubt whether mister Cradell would have earned a watch even if he had had his wish You see continued Cradell reverting to the subject on which he most delighted to talk I m not responsible for that man s ill conduct Does anybody say you are No nobody says so But people seem to think so When he is by I hardly speak to her She is thoughtless and giddy as women are and takes my arm and that kind of thing you know It makes him mad with rage but upon my honour I don t think she means any harm I don t suppose she does said Eames Well she may or she mayn t I hope with all my heart she doesn t And where is he now This is between ourselves you know but she went to find him this afternoon Unless he gives her money she can t stay here nor for the matter of that will she be able to go away If I mention something to you you won t tell any one Of course I won t I wouldn t have it known to any one for the world I ve lent her seven pounds ten It s that which makes me so short with mother Roper Then I think you re a fool for your pains Ah that s so like you I always said you d no feeling of real romance If I cared for a woman I d give her the coat off my back I d do better than that said Johnny I d give her the heart out of my body I d be chopped up alive for a girl I loved but it shouldn t be for another man s wife That s a matter of taste But she s been to Lupex to day at that house he goes to in Drury Lane She had a terrible scene there He was going to commit suicide in the middle of the street and she declares that it all comes from jealousy Think what a time I have of it standing always as one may say on gunpowder He may turn up here any moment you know But upon my word for the life of me I cannot desert her If I were to turn my back on her she wouldn t have a friend in the world And how s L D I ll tell you what it is you ll have some trouble with the divine Amelia Shall I By Jove you will But how s L D all this time L D is engaged to be married to a man named Adolphus Crosbie said poor Johnny slowly If you please we will not say any more about her Whew w w That s what makes you so down in the mouth L D going to marry Crosbie Why that s the man who is to be the new secretary at the General Committee Office Old

none	none	who was their chair has come to us you know There s been a general move at the G C and this Crosbie has got to be secretary He s a lucky chap isn t he I don t know anything about his luck He s one of those fellows that make me hate them the first time I look at them I ve a sort of a feeling that I shall live to kick him some day That s the time is it Then I suppose Amelia will have it all her own way now I ll tell you what Caudle I d sooner get up through the trap door and throw myself off the roof into the area than marry Amelia Roper Have you and she had any conversation since you came back Not a word Then I tell you fairly you ve got trouble before you Amelia and Maria missus Lupex I mean are as thick as thieves just at present and they have been talking you over Maria that is missus Lupex lets it all out to me You ll have to mind where you are old fellow Eames was not inclined to discuss the matter any further so he finished his toddy in silence Cradell however who felt that there was something in his affairs of which he had reason to be proud soon returned to the story of his own very extraordinary position By Jove I don t know that a man was ever so circumstanced he said She looks to me to protect her and yet what can I do At last Cradell got up and declared that he must go to the ladies She s so nervous that unless she has some one to countenance her she becomes unwell Eames declared his purpose of going to the divan or to the theatre or to take a walk in the streets The smiles of beauty had no longer charms for him in Burton Crescent They ll expect you to take a cup of tea the first night said Cradell but Eames declared that they might expect it I m in no humour for it said he I ll tell you what Cradell I shall leave this place and take rooms for myself somewhere I ll never go into a lodging house again As he so spoke he was standing at the dining room door but he was not allowed to escape in this easy way Jemima as he went out into the passage was there with a three cornered note in her hand From Miss Mealyer she said Miss Mealyer is in the back parlour all by herself Poor Johnny took the note and read it by the lamp over the front door Are you not going to speak to me on the day of your return It cannot be that you will leave the house without seeing me for a moment I am in the back parlour When he had read these words he paused in the passage with his hat on Jemima who could not understand why any young man should hesitate as to seeing his lady love in the back parlour alone whispered to him again in her audible way Miss Mealyer is there sir and all the rest on em s upstairs So compelled Eames put down his hat and walked with slow steps into the back parlour How was it to be with the enemy Was he to encounter Amelia in anger or Amelia in love She had seemed to be stern and defiant when he had ventured to steal a look at her across the dining table and now he expected that she would turn upon him with loud threatenings and protestations as to her wrongs But it was not so When he entered the room she was standing with her back to him leaning on the mantel piece and at the first moment she did not essay to speak He walked into the middle of the room and stood there waiting for her to begin Shut the door she said looking over her shoulder I suppose you don t want the girl to hear all you ve got to say to me Then he shut the door but still Amelia stood with her back to him leaning upon the mantel piece It did not seem that he had much to say for he remained perfectly silent Well said Amelia after a long pause and she then again looked over her shoulder Well mister Eames Jemima gave me your note and so I ve come said he And is this the way we meet she exclaimed turning suddenly upon him and throwing her long black hair back over her shoulders There certainly was some beauty about her Her eyes were large and bright and her shoulders were well turned She might have done as an artist s model for a Judith but I doubt whether any man looking well into her face could think that she would do well as a wife Oh John is it to be thus after love such as ours And she clasped her hands together and stood before him I don t know what you mean said Eames If you are engaged to marry L D tell me so at once Be a man and speak out sir No said Eames I am not engaged to marry the lady to whom you allude On your honour I won t have her spoken about I m not going to marry her and that s enough Do you think that I wish to speak of her What can L D be to me as long as she is nothing to you Oh Johnny why did you write me that heartless letter Then she leaned upon his shoulder or attempted to do so I cannot say that Eames shook her off seeing that he lacked the courage to do so but he shuffled his shoulder about so that the support was uneasy to her and she was driven to stand erect again Why did you write that cruel letter she said again Because I thought it best Amelia What s a man to do with ninety pounds a year you know But your mother allows you twenty And what s a man to do with a hundred and ten Rising five pounds every year said the well informed Amelia Of course we should live here with mamma and you would just go on paying her as you do now If your heart was right Johnny you wouldn t think so much about money If you loved me as you said you did Then a little sob came and the words were stopped The words were stopped but she was again upon his shoulder What was he to do In truth his only wish was to escape and yet his arm quite in opposition to his own desires found its way round her waist In such a combat a woman has so many points in her favour Oh Johnny she said again as soon as she felt the pressure of his arm Gracious what a beautiful watch you ve got and she took the trinket out of his pocket Did you buy that No it was given to me John Eames did L D give it you No no no he shouted stamping on the floor as he spoke Oh I beg your pardon said Amelia quelled for the moment by his energy Perhaps it was your mother No it was a man Never mind about the watch now I wouldn t mind anything Johnny if you would tell me that you loved me again Perhaps I oughtn t to ask you and it isn t becoming in a lady but how can I help it when you know you ve got my heart Come upstairs and have tea with us now won t you What was he to do He said that he would go up and have tea and as he led her to the door he put down his face and kissed her Oh Johnny Eames But then a woman in such a contest has so many points in her favour CHAPTER XXX IS IT FROM HIM I have already declared that Crosbie wrote and posted the fatal letter to Allington and we must now follow it down to that place On the morning following the squire s return to his own house missus Crump the post mistress at Allington received a parcel by post directed to herself She opened it and found an enclosure addressed to missus Dale with a written request that she would herself deliver it into that lady s own hand at once This was Crosbie s letter It s from Miss Lily s gentleman said missus Crump looking at the handwriting There s something up or he wouldn t be writing to her mamma in this way But missus Crump lost no time in putting on her bonnet and trudging up with the letter to the Small House I must see the missus herself said missus Crump Whereupon missus Dale was called downstairs into the hall and there received the packet Lily was in the breakfast parlour and had seen the post mistress arrive had seen also that she carried a letter in her hand For a moment she had thought that it was for her and imagined that the old woman had brought it herself from simple good nature But Lily when she heard her mother mentioned instantly withdrew and shut the parlour door Her heart misgave her that something was wrong but she hardly tried to think what it might be After all the regular postman might bring the letter she herself expected Bell was not yet downstairs and she stood alone over the tea cups on the breakfast table feeling that there was something for her to fear Her mother did not come at once into the room but after a pause of a moment or two went again upstairs So she remained either standing against the table or at the window or seated in one of the two arm chairs for a space of ten minutes when Bell entered the room Isn t mamma down yet said Bell Bell said Lily something has happened Mamma has got a letter Happened What has happened Is anybody ill Who is the letter from And Bell was going to return through the door in search of her mother Stop Bell said Lily Do not go to her yet I think it s from Adolphus Oh Lily what do you mean I don t know dear We ll wait a little longer Don t look like that Bell And Lily strove to appear calm and strove almost successfully You have frightened me so said Bell I am frightened myself He only sent me one line yesterday and now he has sent nothing If some misfortune should have happened to him missus Crump brought down the letter herself to mamma and that is so odd you know Are you sure it was from him No I have not spoken to her I will go up to her now Don t you come Bell Oh Bell do not look so unhappy She then went over and kissed her sister and after that with very gentle steps made her way up to her mother s room Mamma may I come in she said Oh my child I know it is from him mamma Tell me all at once missus Dale had read the letter With quick glancing eyes she had made herself mistress of its whole contents and was already aware of the nature and extent of the sorrow which had come upon them It was a sorrow that admitted of no hope The man who had written that letter could never return again nor if he should return could he be welcomed back to them The blow had fallen and it was to be borne Inside the letter to herself had been a very small note addressed to Lily Give her the enclosed Crosbie had said in his letter if you do not now think it wrong to do so I have left it open that you may read it missus Dale however had not yet read it and she now concealed it beneath her handkerchief I will not repeat at length Crosbie s letter to missus Dale It covered four sides of letter paper and was such a letter that any man who wrote it must have felt himself to be a rascal We saw that he had difficulty in writing it but the miracle was that any man could have found it possible to write it I know you will curse me said he and I deserve to be cursed I know that I shall be punished for this and I must bear my punishment My worst punishment will be this that I never more shall hold up my head again And then again he said My only excuse is my conviction that I should never make her happy She has been brought up as an angel with pure thoughts with holy hopes with a belief in all that is good and high and noble I have been surrounded through my whole life by things low and mean and ignoble How could I live with her or she with me I know now that this is so but my fault has been that I did not know it when I was there with her I choose to tell you all he continued towards the end of the letter and therefore I let you know that I have engaged myself to marry another woman Ah I can foresee how bitter will be your feelings when you read this but they will not be so bitter as mine while I write it Yes I am already engaged to one who will suit me and whom I may suit You will not expect me to speak ill of her who is to be near and dear to me But she is one with whom I may mate myself without an inward conviction that I shall destroy all her happiness by doing so Lilian he said shall always have my prayers and I trust that she may soon forget in the love of an honest man that she ever knew one so dishonest as Adolphus Crosbie Of what like must have been his countenance as he sat writing such words of himself under the ghastly light of his own small solitary lamp Had he written his letter at his office in the day time with men coming in and out of his room he could hardly have written of himself so plainly He would have bethought himself that the written words might remain and be read hereafter by other eyes than those for which they were intended But as he sat alone during the small hours of the night almost repenting of his sin with true repentance he declared to himself that he did not care who might read them They should at any rate be true Now they had been read by her to whom they had been addressed and the daughter was standing before the mother to hear her doom Tell me all at once Lily had said but in what words was her mother to tell her Lily she said rising from her seat and leaving the two letters on the couch that addressed to the daughter was hidden beneath a handkerchief but that which she had read she left open and in sight She took both the girl s hands in hers as she looked into her face and spoke to her Lily my child Then she burst into sobs and was unable to tell her tale Is it from him mamma May I read it He cannot be It is from mister Crosbie Is he ill mamma Tell me at once If he is ill I will go to him No my darling he is not ill Not yet do not read it yet Oh Lily It brings bad news very bad news Mamma if he is not in danger I can read it Is it bad to him or only bad to me At this moment the servant knocked and not waiting for an answer half opened the door If you please ma am mister Bernard is below and wants to speak to you mister Bernard ask Miss Bell to see him Miss Bell is with him ma am but he says that he specially wants to speak to you missus Dale felt that she could not leave Lily alone She could not take the letter away nor could she leave her child with the letter open I cannot see him said missus Dale Ask him what it is Tell him I cannot come down just at present And then the servant went and Bernard left his message with Bell Bernard she had said do you know of anything Is there anything wrong about mister Crosbie Then in a few words he told her all and understanding why his aunt had not come down to him he went back to the Great House Bell almost stupefied by the tidings seated herself at the table unconsciously leaning upon her elbows It will kill her she said to herself My Lily my darling Lily It will surely kill her But the mother was still with the daughter and the story was still untold Mamma said Lily whatever it is I must of course be made to know it I begin to guess the truth It will pain you to say it Shall I read the letter missus Dale was astonished at her calmness It could not be that she had guessed the truth or she would not stand like that with tearless eyes and unquelled courage before her You shall read it but I ought to tell you first Oh my child my own one Lily was now leaning against the bed and her mother was standing over her caressing her Then tell me said she But I know what it is He has thought it all over while away from me and he finds that it must not be as we have supposed Before he went I offered to release him and now he knows that he had better accept my offer Is it so mamma In answer to this missus Dale did not speak but Lily understood from her signs that it was so He might have written it to me myself said Lily very proudly Mamma we will go down to breakfast He has sent nothing to me then There is a note He bids me read it but I have not opened it It is here Give it me said Lily almost sternly Let me have his last words to me and she took the note from her mother s hands Lily said the note your mother will have told you all Before you read these few words you will know that you have trusted one who was quite untrustworthy I know that you will hate me I cannot even ask you to forgive me You will let me pray that you may yet be happy A C She read these few words still leaning against the bed Then she got up and walking to a chair seated herself with her back to her mother missus Dale moving silently after her stood over the back of the chair not daring to speak to her So she sat for some five minutes with her eyes fixed upon the open window and with Crosbie s note in her hand I will not hate him and I do forgive him she said at last struggling to command her voice and hardly showing that she could not altogether succeed in her attempt I may not write to him again but you shall write and tell him so Now we will go down to breakfast And so saying she got up from her chair missus Dale almost feared to speak to her her composure was so complete and her manner so stern and fixed She hardly knew how to offer pity and sympathy seeing that pity seemed to be so little necessary and that even sympathy was not demanded And she could not understand all that Lily had said What had she meant by the offer to release him Had there then been some quarrel between them before he went Crosbie had made no such allusion in his letter But missus Dale did not dare to ask any questions You frighten me Lily she said Your very calmness frightens me Dear mamma and the poor girl absolutely smiled as she embraced her mother You need not be frightened by my calmness I know the truth well I have been very unfortunate very The brightest hopes of my life are all gone and I shall never again see him whom I love beyond all the world Then at last she broke down and wept in her mother s arms There was not a word of anger spoken then against him who had done all this missus Dale felt that she did not dare to speak in anger against him and words of anger were not likely to come from poor Lily She indeed hitherto did not know the whole of his offence for she had not read his letter Give it me mamma she said at last It has to be done sooner or later Not now Lily I have told you all all that you need know at present Yes now mamma and again that sweet silvery voice became stern I will read it now and there shall be an end Whereupon missus Dale gave her the letter and she read it in silence Her mother though standing somewhat behind her watched her narrowly as she did so She was now lying over upon the bed and the letter was on the pillow as she propped herself upon her arm Her tears were running and ever and again she would stop to dry her eyes Her sobs too were very audible but she went on steadily with her reading till she came to the line on which Crosbie told that he had already engaged himself to another woman Then her mother could see that she paused suddenly and that a shudder slightly convulsed all her limbs He has been very quick she said almost in a whisper and then she finished the letter Tell him mamma she said that I do forgive him and I will not hate him You will tell him that from me will you not And then she raised herself from the bed missus Dale would give her no such assurance In her present mood her feelings against Crosbie were of a nature which she herself hardly could understand or analyze She felt that if he were present she could almost fly at him as would a tigress She had never hated before as she now hated this man He was to her a murderer and worse than a murderer He had made his way like a wolf into her little fold and torn her ewe lamb and left her maimed and mutilated for life How could a mother forgive such an offence as that or consent to be the medium through which forgiveness should be expressed You must mamma or if you do not I shall do so Remember that I love him You know what it is to have loved one single man He has made me very unhappy I hardly know yet how unhappy But I have loved him and do love him I believe in my heart that he still loves me Where this has been there must not be hatred and unforgiveness I will pray that I may become able to forgive him said missus Dale But you must write to him those words Indeed you must mamma She bids me tell you that she has forgiven you and will not hate you Promise me that I can make no promise now Lily I will think about it and endeavour to do my duty Lily was now seated and was holding the skirt of her mother s dress Mamma she said looking up into her mother s face you must be very good to me now and I must be very good to you We shall be always together now I must be your friend and counsellor and be everything to you more than ever I must fall in love with you now and she smiled again and the tears were almost dry upon her cheeks At last they went down to the breakfast room from which Bell had not moved missus Dale entered the room first and Lily followed hiding herself for a moment behind her mother Then she came forward boldly and taking Bell in her arms clasped her close to her bosom Bell she said he has gone Lily Lily Lily said Bell weeping He has gone We shall talk it over in a few days and shall know how to do so without losing ourselves in misery To day we will say no more about it I am so thirsty Bell do give me my tea and she sat herself down at the breakfast table Lily s tea was given to her and she drank it Beyond that I cannot say that any of them partook with much heartiness of the meal They sat there as they would have sat if no terrible thunderbolt had fallen among them and no word further was spoken about Crosbie and his conduct Immediately after breakfast they went into the other room and Lily as was her wont sat herself immediately down to her drawing Her mother looked at her with wistful eyes longing to bid her spare herself but she shrank from interfering with her For a quarter of an hour Lily sat over her board with her brush or pencil in her hand and then she rose up and put it away It is no good pretending she said I am only spoiling the things but I will be better to morrow I ll go away and lie down by myself mamma And so she went Soon after this missus Dale took her bonnet and went up to the Great House having received her brother in law s message from Bell I know what he has to tell me she said but I might as well go It will be necessary that we should speak to each other about it So she walked across the lawn and up into the hall of the Great House Is my brother in the book room she said to one of the maids and then knocking at the door went in unannounced The squire rose from his arm chair and came forward to meet her Mary he said I believe you know it all Yes she said You can read that and she handed him Crosbie s letter How was one to know that any man could be so wicked as that And she has heard it asked the squire Is she able to bear it Wonderfully She has amazed me by her strength It frightens me for I know that a relapse must come She has never sunk for a moment beneath it For myself I feel as though it were her strength that enables me to bear my share of it And then she described to the squire all that had taken place that morning Poor child said the squire Poor child What can we do for her Would it be good for her to go away for a time She is a sweet good lovely girl and has deserved better than that Sorrow and disappointment come to us all but they are doubly heavy when they come so early missus Dale was almost surprised at the amount of sympathy which he showed And what is to be his punishment she asked The scorn which men and women will feel for him those at least whose esteem or scorn are matters of concern to any one I know no other punishment You would not have Lily s name brought before a tribunal of law Certainly not that And I will not have Bernard calling him out Indeed it would be for nothing for in these days a man is not expected to fight duels You cannot think that I would wish that What punishment is there then I know of none There are evils which a man may do and no one can punish him I know of nothing I went up to London after him but he contrived to crawl out of my way What can you do to a rat but keep clear of him missus Dale had felt in her heart that it would be well if Crosbie could be beaten till all his bones were sore I hardly know whether such should have been a woman s thought but it was hers She had no wish that he should be made to fight a duel In that there would have been much that was wicked and in her estimation nothing that was just But she felt that if Bernard would thrash the coward for his cowardice she would love her nephew better than ever she had loved him Bernard also had considered it probable that he might be expected to horsewhip the man who had jilted his cousin and as regarded the absolute bodily risk he would not have felt any insuperable objection to undertake the task But such a piece of work was disagreeable to him in many ways He hated the idea of a row at his club He was most desirous that his cousin s name should not be made public He wished to avoid anything that might be impolitic A wicked thing had been done and he was quite ready to hate Crosbie as Crosbie ought to be hated but as regarded himself it made him unhappy to think that the world might probably expect him to punish the man who had so lately been his friend And then he did not know where to catch him or how to thrash him when caught He was very sorry for his cousin and felt strongly that Crosbie should not be allowed to escape But what was he to do Would she like to go anywhere said the squire again anxious if he could to afford solace by some act of generosity At this moment he would have settled a hundred a year for life upon his niece if by so doing he could have done her any good She will be better at home said missus Dale Poor thing For a while she will wish to avoid going out I suppose so and then there was a pause I ll tell you what Mary I don t understand it On my honour I don t understand it It is to me as wonderful as though I had caught the man picking my pence out of my pocket I don t think any man in the position of a gentleman would have done such a thing when I was young I don t think any man would have dared to do it But now it seems that a man may act in that way and no harm come to him He had a friend in London who came to me and talked about it as though it were some ordinary everyday transaction of life Yes you may come in Bernard The poor child knows it all now Bernard offered to his aunt what of solace and sympathy he had to offer and made some sort of half expressed apology for having introduced this wolf into their flock We always thought very much of him at his club said Bernard I don t know much about your London clubs now a days said his uncle nor do I wish to do so if the society of that man can be endured after what he has now done I don t suppose half a dozen men will ever know anything about it said Bernard Umph ejaculated the squire He could not say that he wished Crosbie s villany to be widely discussed seeing that Lily s name was so closely connected with it But yet he could not support the idea that Crosbie should not be punished by the frown of the world at large It seemed to him that from this time forward any man speaking to Crosbie should be held to have disgraced himself by so doing Give her my best love he said as missus Dale got up to take her leave my very best love If her old uncle can do anything for her she has only to let me know She met the man in my house and I feel that I owe her much Bid her come and see me It will be better for her than moping at home And Mary this he said to her whispering into her ear think of what I said to you about Bell missus Dale as she walked back to her own house acknowledged to herself that her brother in law s manner was different to her from anything that she had hitherto known of him During the whole of that day Crosbie s name was not mentioned at the Small House Neither of the girls stirred out and Bell spent the greater part of the afternoon sitting with her arm round her sister s waist upon the sofa Each of them had a book but though there was little spoken there was as little read Who can describe the thoughts that were passing through Lily s mind as she remembered the hours which she had passed with Crosbie of his warm assurances of love of his accepted caresses of her uncontrolled and acknowledged joy in his affection It had all been holy to her then and now those things which were then sacred had been made almost disgraceful by his fault And yet as she thought of this she declared to herself over and over again that she would forgive him nay that she had forgiven him And he shall know it too she said speaking almost out loud Lily dear Lily said Bell turn your thoughts away from it for a while if you can They won t go away said Lily And that was all that was said between them on the subject Everybody would know it I doubt whether that must not be one of the bitterest drops in the cup which a girl in such circumstances is made to drain Lily perceived early in the day that the parlour maid well knew that she had been jilted The girl s manner was intended to convey sympathy but it did convey pity and Lily for a moment felt angry But she remembered that it must be so and smiled upon the girl and spoke kindly to her What mattered it All the world would know it in a day or two On the following day she went up by her mother s advice to see her uncle My child said he I am sorry for you My heart bleeds for you Uncle she said do not mind it Only do this for me do not talk about it I mean to me No no I will not That there should ever have been in my house so great a rascal Uncle uncle I will not have that I will not listen to a word against him from any human being not a word Remember that And her eyes flashed as she spoke He did not answer her but took her hand and pressed it and then she left him The Dales were ever constant he said to himself as he walked up and down the terrace before his house Ever constant CHAPTER XXXI THE WOUNDED FAWN ILLUSTRATION untitled Nearly two months passed away and it was now Christmas time at Allington It may be presumed that there was no intention at either house that the mirth should be very loud Such a wound as that received by Lily Dale was one from which recovery could not be quick and it was felt by all the family that a weight was upon them which made gaiety impracticable As for Lily herself it may be said that she bore her misfortune with all a woman s courage For the first week she stood up as a tree that stands against the wind which is soon to be shivered to pieces because it will not bend During that week her mother and sister were frightened by her calmness and endurance She would perform her daily task She would go out through the village and appear at her place in church on the first Sunday She would sit over her book of an evening keeping back her tears and would chide her mother and sister when she found that they were regarding her with earnest anxiety Mamma let it all be as though it had never been she said Ah dear if that were but possible God forbid that it should be possible inwardly Lily replied but it is possible outwardly I feel that you are more tender to me than you used to be and that upsets me If you would only scold me because I am idle I should soon be better But her mother could not speak to her as she perhaps might have spoken had no grief fallen upon her pet She could not cease from those anxious tender glances which made Lily know that she was looked on as a fawn wounded almost to death At the end of the first week she gave way I won t get up Bell she said one morning almost petulantly I am ill I had better lie here out of the way Don t make a fuss about it I m stupid and foolish and that makes me ill Thereupon missus Dale and Bell were frightened and looked into each other s blank faces remembering stories of poor broken hearted girls who had died because their loves had been unfortunate as small wax tapers whose lights are quenched if a breath of wind blows upon them too strongly But then Lily was in truth no such slight taper as that Nor was she the stem that must be broken because it will not bend She bent herself to the blast during that week of illness and then arose with her form still straight and graceful and with her bright light unquenched After that she would talk more openly to her mother about her loss openly and with a true appreciation of the misfortune which had befallen her but with an assurance of strength which seemed to ridicule the idea of a broken heart I know that I can bear it she said and that I can bear it without lasting unhappiness Of course I shall always love him and must feel almost as you felt when you lost my father In answer to this missus Dale could say nothing She could not speak out her thoughts about Crosbie and explain to Lily that he was unworthy of her love Love does not follow worth and is not given to excellence nor is it destroyed by ill usage nor killed by blows and mutilation When Lily declared that she still loved the man who had so ill used her missus Dale would be silent Each perfectly understood the other but on that matter even they could not interchange their thoughts with freedom You must promise never to be tired of me mamma said Lily Mothers do not often get tired of their children whatever the children may do of their mothers I m not so sure of that when the children turn out old maids And I mean to have a will of my own too mamma and a way also if it be possible When Bell is married I shall consider it a partnership and I shan t do what I m told any longer Forewarned will be forearmed Exactly and I don t want to take you by surprise For a year or two longer till Bell is gone I mean to be dutiful but it would be very stupid for a girl to be dutiful all her life All of which missus Dale understood thoroughly It amounted to an assertion on Lily s part that she had loved once and could never love again that she had played her game hoping as other girls hope that she might win the prize of a husband but that having lost she could never play the game again It was that inward conviction on Lily s part which made her say such words to her mother But missus Dale would by no means allow herself to share this conviction She declared to herself that time would cure Lily s wound and that her child might yet be crowned by the bliss of a happy marriage She would not in her heart consent to that plan in accordance with which Lily s destiny in life was to be regarded as already fixed She had never really liked Crosbie as a suitor and would herself have preferred John Eames with all the faults of his hobbledehoyhood on his head It might yet come to pass that John Eames love might be made happy But in the meantime Lily as I have said had become strong in her courage and recommenced the work of living with no lackadaisical self assurance that because she had been made more unhappy than others therefore she should allow herself to be more idle Morning and night she prayed for him and daily almost hour by hour she assured herself that it was still her duty to love him It was hard this duty of loving without any power of expressing such love But still she would do her duty Tell me at once mamma she said one morning when you hear that the day is fixed for his marriage Pray don t keep me in the dark It is to be in February said missus Dale But let me know the day It must not be to me like ordinary days But do not look unhappy mamma I am not going to make a fool of myself I shan t steal off and appear in the church like a ghost And then having uttered her little joke a sob came and she hid her face on her mother s bosom In a moment she raised it again Believe me mamma that I am not unhappy she said After the expiration of that second week missus Dale did write a letter to Crosbie I suppose she said it is right that I should acknowledge the receipt of your letter I do not know that I have aught else to say to you It would not become me as a woman to say what I think of your conduct but I believe that your conscience will tell you the same things If it do not you must indeed be hardened I have promised my child that I will send to you a message from her She bids me tell you that she has forgiven you and that she does not hate you May God also forgive you and may you recover his love MARY DALE I beg that no rejoinder may be made to this letter either to myself or to any of my family The squire wrote no answer to the letter which he had received nor did he take any steps towards the immediate punishment of Crosbie Indeed he had declared that no such steps could be taken explaining to his nephew that such a man could be served only as one serves a rat I shall never see him he said once again if I did I should not scruple to hit him on the head with my stick but I should think ill of myself to go after him with such an object And yet it was a terrible sorrow to the old man that the scoundrel who had so injured him and his should escape scot free He had not forgiven Crosbie No idea of forgiveness had ever crossed his mind He would have hated himself had he thought it possible that he could be induced to forgive such an injury There is an amount of rascality in it of low meanness which I do not understand he would say over and over again to his nephew And then as he would walk alone on the terrace he would speculate within his own mind whether Bernard would take any steps towards avenging his cousin s injury He is right he would say to himself Bernard is quite right But when I was young I could not have stood it In those days a gentleman might have a fellow out who had treated him as he has treated us A man was satisfied in feeling that he had done something I suppose the world is different now a days The world is different but the squire by no means acknowledged in his heart that there had been any improvement Bernard also was greatly troubled in his mind He would have had no objection to fight a duel with Crosbie had duels in these days been possible But he believed them to be no longer possible at any rate without ridicule And if he could not fight the man in what other way was he to punish him Was it not the fact that for such a fault the world afforded no punishment Was it not in the power of a man like Crosbie to amuse himself for a week or two at the expense of a girl s happiness for life and then to escape absolutely without any ill effects to himself I shall be barred out of my club lest I should meet him Bernard said to himself but he will not be barred out Moreover there was a feeling within him that the matter would be one of triumph to Crosbie rather than otherwise In having secured for himself the pleasure of his courtship with such a girl as Lily Dale without encountering the penalty usually consequent upon such amusement he would be held by many as having merited much admiration He had sinned against all the Dales and yet the suffering arising from his sin was to fall upon the Dales exclusively Such was Bernard s reasoning as he speculated on the whole affair sadly enough wishing to be avenged but not knowing where to look for vengeance For myself I believe him to have been altogether wrong as to the light in which he supposed that Crosbie s falsehood would be regarded by Crosbie s friends Men will still talk of such things lightly professing that all is fair in love as it is in war and speaking almost with envy of the good fortunes of a practised deceiver But I have never come across the man who thought in this way with reference to an individual case Crosbie s own judgment as to the consequences to himself of what he had done was more correct than that formed by Bernard Dale He had regarded the act as venial as long as it was still to do while it was still within his power to leave it undone but from the moment of its accomplishment it had forced itself upon his own view in its proper light He knew that he had been a scoundrel and he knew that other men would so think of him His friend Fowler Pratt who had the reputation of looking at women simply as toys had so regarded him Instead of boasting of what he had done he was as afraid of alluding to any matter connected with his marriage as a man is of talking of the articles which he has stolen He had already felt that men at his club looked askance at him and though he was no coward as regarded his own skin and bones he had an undefined fear lest some day he might encounter Bernard Dale purposely armed with a stick The squire and his nephew were wrong in supposing that Crosbie was unpunished And as the winter came on he felt that he was closely watched by the noble family of De Courcy Some of that noble family he had already learned to hate cordially The Honourable John came up to town in November and persecuted him vilely insisted on having dinners given to him at Sebright s of smoking throughout the whole afternoon in his future brother in law s rooms and on borrowing his future brother in law s possessions till at last Crosbie determined that it would be wise to quarrel with the Honourable John and he quarrelled with him accordingly turning him out of his rooms and telling him in so many words that he would have no more to do with him You ll have to do it as I did Mortimer Gazebee had said to him I didn t like it because of the family but Lady Amelia told me that it must be so Whereupon Crosbie took the advice of Mortimer Gazebee But the hospitality of the Gazebees was perhaps more distressing to him than even the importunities of the Honourable John It seemed as though his future sister in law was determined not to leave him alone Mortimer was sent to fetch him up for the Sunday afternoons and he found that he was constrained to go to the villa in saint John s Wood even in opposition to his own most strenuous will He could not quite analyze the circumstances of his own position but he felt as though he were a cock with his spurs cut off as a dog with his teeth drawn He found himself becoming humble and meek He had to acknowledge to himself that he was afraid of Lady Amelia and almost even afraid of Mortimer Gazebee He was aware that they watched him and knew all his goings out and comings in They called him Adolphus and made him tame That coming evil day in February was dinned into his ears Lady Amelia would go and look at furniture for him and talked by the hour about bedding and sheets You had better get your kitchen things at Tomkins They re all good and he ll give you ten per cent off if you pay him ready money which of course you will you know Was it for this that he had sacrificed Lily Dale for this that he had allied himself with the noble house of De Courcy Mortimer had been at him about the settlements from the very first moment of his return to London and had already bound him up hand and foot His life was insured and the policy was in Mortimer s hands His own little bit of money had been already handed over to be tied up with Lady Alexandrina s little bit It seemed to him that in all the arrangements made the intention was that he should die off speedily and that Lady Alexandrina should be provided with a decent little income sufficient for saint John s Wood Things were to be so settled that he could not even spend the proceeds of his own money or of hers They were to go under the fostering hand of Mortimer Gazebee in paying insurances If he would only die the day after his marriage there would really be a very nice sum of money for Alexandrina almost worthy of the acceptance of an earl s daughter Six months ago he would have considered himself able to turn Mortimer Gazebee round his finger on any subject that could be introduced between them When they chanced to meet Gazebee had been quite humble to him treating him almost as a superior being He had looked down on Gazebee from a very great height But now it seemed as though he were powerless in this man s hands But perhaps the countess had become his greatest aversion She was perpetually writing to him little notes in which she gave him multitudes of commissions sending him about as though he had been her servant And she pestered him with advice which was even worse than her commissions telling him of the style of life in which Alexandrina would expect to live and warning him very frequently that such an one as he could not expect to be admitted within the bosom of so noble a family without paying very dearly for that inestimable privilege Her letters had become odious to him and he would chuck them on one side leaving them for the whole day unopened He had already made up his mind that he would quarrel with the countess also very shortly after his marriage indeed that he would separate himself from the whole family if it were possible And yet he had entered into this engagement mainly with the view of reaping those advantages which would accrue to him from being allied to the De Courcys The squire and his nephew were wretched in thinking that this man was escaping without punishment but they might have spared themselves that misery It had been understood from the first that he was to spend his Christmas at Courcy Castle From this undertaking it was quite out of his power to enfranchise himself but he resolved that his visit should be as short as possible Christmas Day unfortunately came on a Monday and it was known to the De Courcy world that Saturday was almost a dies non at the General Committee Office As to those three days there was no escape for him but he made Alexandrina understand that the three Commissioners were men of iron as to any extension of those three days I must be absent again in February of course he said almost making his wail audible in the words he used and therefore it is quite impossible that I should stay now beyond the Monday Had there been attractions for him at Courcy Castle I think he might have arranged with mister Optimist for a week or ten days We shall be all alone the countess wrote to him and I hope you will have an opportunity of learning more of our ways than you have ever really been able to do as yet This was bitter as gall to him But in this world all valuable commodities have their price and when men such as Crosbie aspire to obtain for themselves an alliance with noble families they must pay the market price for the article which they purchase You ll all come up and dine with us on Monday the squire said to missus Dale about the middle of the previous week Well I think not said missus Dale we are better perhaps as we are At this moment the squire and his sister in law were on much more friendly terms than had been usual with them and he took her reply in good part understanding her feeling Therefore he pressed his request and succeeded I think you re wrong he said I don t suppose that we shall have a very merry Christmas You and the girls will hardly have that whether you eat your pudding here or at the Great House But it will be better for us all to make the attempt It s the right thing to do That s the way I look at it I ll ask Lily said missus Dale Do do Give her my love and tell her from me that in spite of all that has come and gone Christmas Day should still be to her a day of rejoicing We ll dine about three so that the servants can have the afternoon Of course we ll go said Lily why not We always do And we ll have blind man s buff with all the Boyces as we had last year if uncle will ask them up But the Boyces were not asked up for that occasion But Lily though she put on it all so brave a face had much to suffer and did in truth suffer greatly If you my reader ever chanced to slip into the gutter on a wet day did you not find that the sympathy of the bystanders was by far the severest part of your misfortune Did you not declare to yourself that all might yet be well if the people would only walk on and not look at you And yet you cannot blame those who stood and pitied you or perhaps essayed to rub you down and assist you in the recovery of your bedaubed hat You yourself if you see a man fall cannot walk by as though nothing uncommon had happened to him It was so with Lily The people of Allington could not regard her with their ordinary eyes They would look at her tenderly knowing that she was a wounded fawn and thus they aggravated the soreness of her wound Old missus Hearn condoled with her telling her that very likely she would be better off as she was Lily would not lie about it in any way missus Hearn she said the subject is painful to me missus Hearn said no more about it but on every meeting between them she looked the things she did not say Miss Lily said Hopkins one day Miss Lily and as he looked up into her face a tear had almost formed itself in his old eye I knew what he was from the first Oh dear oh dear if I could have had him killed Hopkins how dare you said Lily If you speak to me again in such a way I will tell my uncle She turned away from him but immediately turned back again and put out her little hand to him I beg your pardon she said I know how kind you are and I love you for it And then she went away I ll go after him yet and break the dirty neck of him said Hopkins to himself as he walked down the path Shortly before Christmas Day she called with her sister at the vicarage Bell in the course of the visit left the room with one of the Boyce girls to look at the last chrysanthemums of the year Then missus Boyce took advantage of the occasion to make her little speech My dear Lily she said you will think me cold if I do not say one word to you No I shall not said Lily almost sharply shrinking from the finger that threatened to touch her sore There are things which should never be talked about Well well perhaps so said missus Boyce But for a minute or two she was unable to fall back upon any other topic and sat looking at Lily with painful tenderness I need hardly say what were Lily s sufferings under such a gaze but she bore it acknowledging to herself in her misery that the fault did not lie with missus Boyce How could missus Boyce have looked at her otherwise than tenderly It was settled then that Lily was to dine up at the Great House on Christmas Day and thus show to the Allington world that she was not to be regarded as a person shut out from the world by the depth of her misfortune That she was right there can I think be no doubt but as she walked across the little bridge with her mother and sister after returning from church she would have given much to be able to have turned round and have gone to bed instead of to her uncle s dinner CHAPTER XXXII PAWKINS S IN JERMYN STREET The show of fat beasts in London took place this year on the twentieth day of December and I have always understood that a certain bullock exhibited by Lord De Guest was declared by the metropolitan butchers to have realized all the possible excellences of breeding feeding and condition 
5618_48830_000002_000001	train-clean-360	No doubt the butchers of the next half century will have learned much better and the Guestwick beast could it be embalmed and then produced would excite only ridicule at the agricultural ignorance of the present age but Lord De Guest took the praise that was offered to him and found himself in a seventh heaven of delight 
5618_48830_000002_000002	train-clean-360	He was never so happy as when surrounded by butchers graziers and salesmen who were able to appreciate the work of his life and who regarded him as a model nobleman 
5618_48830_000002_000003	train-clean-360	 Look at that fellow he said to Eames pointing to the prize bullock 
5618_48830_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Eames had joined his patron at the show after his office hours looking on upon the living beef by gaslight 
none	none	Isn t he like his sire 
5618_48830_000002_000006	train-clean-360	He was got by Lambkin you know 
5618_48830_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Lambkin said Johnny who had not as yet been able to learn much about the Guestwick stock 
5618_48830_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Lambkin 
5618_48830_000004_000001	train-clean-360	The bull that we had the trouble with 
none	none	He has just got his sire s back and fore quarters 
5618_48830_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you see 
5618_48830_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I daresay said Johnny who looked very hard but could not see 
5618_48830_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It s very odd exclaimed the earl but do you know that bull has been as quiet since that day as quiet as as anything 
5618_48830_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I think it must have been my pocket handkerchief 
5618_48830_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I daresay it was said Johnny or perhaps the flies 
5618_48830_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Flies said the earl angrily 
none	none	Do you suppose he isn t used to flies 
5618_48830_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Come away 
none	none	I ordered dinner at seven and it s past six now My brother in law Colonel Dale is up in town and he dines with us So he took Johnny s arm and led him off through the show calling his attention as he went to several beasts which were inferior to his own And then they walked down through Portman Square and Grosvenor Square and across Piccadilly to Jermyn Street John Eames acknowledged to himself that it was odd that he should have an earl leaning on his arm as he passed along through the streets 
5618_48830_000009_000002	train-clean-360	At home in his own life his daily companions were Cradell and Amelia Roper missus Lupex and missus Roper 
5618_48830_000009_000003	train-clean-360	The difference was very great and yet he found it quite as easy to talk to the earl as to missus Lupex 
none	none	You know the Dales down at Allington of course said the earl
5618_48830_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I know them 
5618_48830_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 But perhaps you never met the colonel 
5618_48830_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think I ever did 
5618_48830_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 He s a queer sort of fellow very well in his way but he never does anything 
none	none	He and my sister live at Torquay and as far as I can find out they neither of them have any occupation of any sort He s come up to town now because we both had to meet our family lawyers and sign some papers but he looks on the journey as a great hardship 
5618_48830_000014_000002	train-clean-360	As for me I m a year older than he is but I wouldn t mind going up and down from Guestwick every day 
5618_48830_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 It s looking after the bull that does it said Eames 
5618_48830_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 By George you re right Master Johnny 
5618_48830_000016_000001	train-clean-360	My sister and Crofts may tell me what they like but when a man s out in the open air for eight or nine hours every day it doesn t much matter where he goes to sleep after that 
none	none	This is Pawkins s capital good house but not so good as it used to be while old Pawkins was alive Show mister Eames up into a bedroom to wash his hands 
5618_48830_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Colonel Dale was much like his brother in face but was taller even thinner and apparently older 
5618_48830_000017_000001	train-clean-360	When Eames went into the sitting room the colonel was there alone and had to take upon himself the trouble of introducing himself 
none	none	He did not get up from his arm chair but nodded gently at the young man
5618_48830_000017_000003	train-clean-360	 mister Eames I believe 
5618_48830_000017_000004	train-clean-360	I knew your father at Guestwick a great many years ago then he turned his face back towards the fire and sighed 
5618_48830_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 It s got very cold this afternoon said Johnny trying to make conversation 
5618_48830_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 It s always cold in London said the colonel 
none	none	If you had to be here in August you wouldn t say so God forbid said the colonel and he sighed again with his eyes fixed upon the fire Eames had heard of the very gallant way in which Orlando Dale had persisted in running away with Lord De Guest s sister in opposition to very terrible obstacles and as he now looked at the intrepid lover he thought that there must have been a great change since those days 
5618_48830_000021_000002	train-clean-360	After that nothing more was said till the earl came down 
none	none	Pawkins s house was thoroughly old fashioned in all things and the Pawkins of that day himself stood behind the earl s elbow when the dinner began and himself removed the cover from the soup tureen Lord De Guest did not require much personal attention but he would have felt annoyed if this hadn t been done As it was he had a civil word to say to Pawkins about the fat cattle thereby showing that he did not mistake Pawkins for one of the waiters 
5618_48830_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Pawkins then took his lordship s orders about the wine and retired 
none	none	He keeps up the old house pretty well said the earl to his brother in law
5618_48830_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 It isn t like what it was thirty years ago but then everything of that sort has got worse and worse 
none	none	I suppose it has said the colonel
5618_48830_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I remember when old Pawkins had as good a glass of port as I ve got at home or nearly 
5618_48830_000025_000001	train-clean-360	They can t get it now you know 
5618_48830_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I never drink port said the colonel 
5618_48830_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 I seldom take anything after dinner except a little negus 
5618_48830_000027_000000	train-clean-360	His brother in law said nothing but made a most eloquent grimace as he turned his face towards his soup plate 
5618_48830_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Eames saw it and could hardly refrain from laughing 
5618_48830_000027_000002	train-clean-360	When at half past nine o clock the colonel retired from the room the earl as the door was closed threw up his hands and uttered the one word negus 
5618_48830_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Then Eames took heart of grace and had his laughter out 
none	none	The dinner was very dull and before the colonel went to bed Johnny regretted that he had been induced to dine at Pawkins s It might be a very fine thing to be asked to dinner with an earl and John Eames had perhaps received at his office some little accession of dignity from the circumstance of which he had been not unpleasantly aware but as he sat at the table on which there were four or five apples and a plate of dried nuts looking at the earl as he endeavoured to keep his eyes open and at the colonel to whom it seemed absolutely a matter of indifference whether his companions were asleep or awake he confessed to himself that the price he was paying was almost too dear missus Roper s tea table was not pleasant to him but even that would have been preferable to the black dinginess of Pawkins s mahogany with the company of two tired old men with whom he seemed to have no mutual subject of conversation 
5618_48830_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Once or twice he tried a word with the colonel for the colonel sat with his eyes open looking at the fire 
5618_48830_000028_000004	train-clean-360	But he was answered with monosyllables and it was evident to him that the colonel did not wish to talk 
5618_48830_000028_000005	train-clean-360	To sit still with his hands closed over each other on his lap was work enough for Colonel Dale during his after dinner hours 
5618_48830_000029_000000	train-clean-360	But the earl knew what was going on 
5618_48830_000029_000001	train-clean-360	During that terrible conflict between him and his slumber in which the drowsy god fairly vanquished him for some twenty minutes his conscience was always accusing him of treating his guests badly 
none	none	He was very angry with himself and tried to arouse himself and talk 
5618_48830_000029_000003	train-clean-360	But his brother in law would not help him in his efforts and even Eames was not bright in rendering him assistance 
5618_48830_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Then for twenty minutes he slept soundly and at the end of that he woke himself with one of his own snorts By George he said jumping up and standing on the rug we ll have some coffee and after that he did not sleep any more 
none	none	Dale said he won t you take some more wine ILLUSTRATION Won t you take some more wine Nothing more said the colonel still looking at the fire and shaking his head very slowly
5618_48830_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Come Johnny fill your glass He had already got into the way of calling his young friend Johnny having found that missus Eames generally spoke of her son by that name 
5618_48830_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been filling my glass all the time said Eames taking the decanter again in his hand as he spoke 
5618_48830_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I m glad you ve found something to amuse you for it has seemed to me that you and Dale haven t had much to say to each other 
5618_48830_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I ve been listening all the time 
5618_48830_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve been asleep said the colonel 
5618_48830_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Then there s been some excuse for my holding my tongue said the earl 
5618_48830_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 By the by Dale what do you think of that fellow Crosbie 
none	none	Eames ears were instantly on the alert and the spirit of dullness vanished from him
5618_48830_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Think of him said the colonel 
5618_48830_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 He ought to have every bone in his skin broken said the earl 
5618_48830_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 So he ought said Eames getting up from his chair in his eagerness and speaking in a tone somewhat louder than was perhaps becoming in the presence of his seniors 
5618_48830_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 So he ought my lord 
5618_48830_000041_000002	train-clean-360	He is the most abominable rascal that ever I met in my life 
5618_48830_000041_000003	train-clean-360	I wish I was Lily Dale s brother Then he sat down again remembering that he was speaking in the presence of Lily s uncle and of the father of Bernard Dale who might be supposed to occupy the place of Lily s brother 
5618_48830_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The colonel turned his head round and looked at the young man with surprise 
none	none	I beg your pardon sir said Eames but I have known missus Dale and your nieces all my life Oh have you said the colonel
5618_48830_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 Nevertheless it is perhaps as well not to make too free with a young lady s name 
none	none	Not that I blame you in the least mister Eames
5618_48830_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I should think not said the earl 
none	none	I honour him for his feeling Johnny my boy if ever I am unfortunate enough to meet that man I shall tell him my mind and I believe you will do the same On hearing this John Eames winked at the earl and made a motion with his head towards the colonel whose back was turned to him 
5618_48830_000044_000002	train-clean-360	And then the earl winked back at Eames 
5618_48830_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 De Guest said the colonel I think I ll go upstairs I always have a little arrowroot in my own room 
5618_48830_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll ring the bell for a candle said the host 
none	none	Then the colonel went and as the door was closed behind him the earl raised his two hands and uttered that single word negus Whereupon Johnny burst out laughing and coming round to the fire sat himself down in the arm chair which the colonel had left I ve no doubt it s all right said the earl but I shouldn t like to drink negus myself nor yet to have arrowroot up in my bedroom
5618_48830_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t suppose there s any harm in it 
5618_48830_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear no I wonder what Pawkins says about him 
none	none	But I suppose they have them of all sorts in an hotel
5618_48830_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 The waiter didn t seem to think much of it when he brought it 
none	none	No no If he d asked for senna and salts the waiter wouldn t have showed any surprise 
5618_48830_000051_000002	train-clean-360	By the by you touched him up about that poor girl 
none	none	Did I my lord 
5618_48830_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t mean it 
5618_48830_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 You see he s Bernard Dale s father and the question is whether Bernard shouldn t punish the fellow for what he has done 
5618_48830_000053_000001	train-clean-360	Somebody ought to do it 
none	none	It isn t right that he should escape Somebody ought to let mister Crosbie know what a scoundrel he has made himself I d do it to morrow only I m afraid No no no said the earl you are not the right person at all What have you got to do with it You ve merely known them as family friends but that s not enough
5618_48830_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 No I suppose not said Eames sadly 
none	none	Perhaps it s best as it is said the earl I don t know that any good would be got by knocking him over the head 
5618_48830_000057_000002	train-clean-360	And if we are to be Christians I suppose we ought to be Christians 
5618_48830_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What sort of a Christian has he been 
5618_48830_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 That s true enough and if I was Bernard I should be very apt to forget my Bible lessons about meekness 
5618_48830_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you know my lord I should think it the most Christian thing in the world to pitch into him I should indeed 
5618_48830_000060_000001	train-clean-360	There are some things for which a man ought to be beaten black and blue 
5618_48830_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 So that he shouldn t do them again 
none	none	Exactly 
5618_48830_000062_000001	train-clean-360	You might say it isn t Christian to hang a man 
none	none	I d always hang a murderer 
5618_48830_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It wasn t right to hang men for stealing sheep 
none	none	Much better hang such a fellow as Crosbie said Eames
5618_48830_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I believe so 
5618_48830_000065_000001	train-clean-360	If any fellow wanted now to curry favour with the young lady what an opportunity he d have 
5618_48830_000066_000000	train-clean-360	Johnny remained silent for a moment or two before he answered 
5618_48830_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 I m not so sure of that he said mournfully as though grieving at the thought that there was no chance of currying favour with Lily by thrashing her late lover 
5618_48830_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t pretend to know much about girls said Lord De Guest but I should think it would be so 
none	none	I should fancy that nothing would please her so much as hearing that he had caught it and that all the world knew that he d caught it The earl had declared that he didn t know much about girls and in so saying he was no doubt right
5618_48830_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 If I thought so said Eames I d find him out to morrow 
none	none	Why so 
5618_48830_000069_000001	train-clean-360	what difference does it make to you 
5618_48830_000069_000002	train-clean-360	Then there was another pause during which Johnny looked very sheepish 
5618_48830_000069_000003	train-clean-360	 You don t mean to say that you re in love with Miss Lily Dale 
5618_48830_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know much about being in love with her said Johnny turning very red as he spoke 
5618_48830_000070_000001	train-clean-360	And then he made up his mind in a wild sort of way to tell all the truth to his friend 
5618_48830_000070_000002	train-clean-360	Pawkins s port wine may perhaps have had something to do with the resolution 
5618_48830_000070_000003	train-clean-360	 But I d go through fire and water for her my lord 
5618_48830_000070_000004	train-clean-360	I knew her years before he had ever seen her and have loved her a great deal better than he will ever love any one 
5618_48830_000070_000005	train-clean-360	When I heard that she had accepted him I had half a mind to cut my own throat or else his 
5618_48830_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Highty tighty said the earl 
5618_48830_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 It s very ridiculous I know said Johnny and of course she would never have accepted me 
none	none	I don t see that at all I haven t a shilling in the world
5618_48830_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Girls don t care much for that 
5618_48830_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 And then a clerk in the Income tax Office 
5618_48830_000076_000001	train-clean-360	It s such a poor thing 
5618_48830_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 The other fellow was only a clerk in another office 
none	none	The earl living down at Guestwick did not understand that the Income tax Office in the city and the General Committee Office at Whitehall were as far apart as Dives and Lazarus and separated by as impassable a gulf Oh yes said Johnny but his office is another kind of thing and then he was a swell himself
5618_48830_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 By George I don t see it said the earl 
5618_48830_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t wonder a bit at her accepting a fellow like that 
5618_48830_000081_000001	train-clean-360	I hated him the first moment I saw him but that s no reason she should hate him 
none	none	He had that sort of manner you know 
5618_48830_000081_000003	train-clean-360	He was a swell and girls like that kind of thing 
5618_48830_000081_000004	train-clean-360	I never felt angry with her but I could have eaten him As he spoke he looked as though he would have made some such attempt had Crosbie been present 
5618_48830_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you ever ask her to have you said the earl 
none	none	No how could I ask her when I hadn t bread to give her
5618_48830_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 And you never told her that you were in love with her I mean and all that kind of thing 
5618_48830_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 She knows it now said Johnny I went to say good by to her the other day when I thought she was going to be married 
5618_48830_000085_000001	train-clean-360	I could not help telling her then 
5618_48830_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 But it seems to me my dear fellow that you ought to be very much obliged to Crosbie that is to say if you ve a mind to 
5618_48830_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 I know what you mean my lord 
5618_48830_000087_000001	train-clean-360	I am not a bit obliged to him 
5618_48830_000087_000002	train-clean-360	It s my belief that all this will about kill her 
5618_48830_000087_000003	train-clean-360	As to myself if I thought she d ever have me 
none	none	Then he was again silent and the earl could see that the tears were in his eyes I think I begin to understand it said the earl and I ll give you a bit of advice 
5618_48830_000089_000001	train-clean-360	You come down and spend your Christmas with me at Guestwick 
none	none	Oh my lord
5618_48830_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind my lording me but do as I tell you 
5618_48830_000091_000001	train-clean-360	Lady Julia sent you a message though I forgot all about it till now 
5618_48830_000091_000002	train-clean-360	She wants to thank you herself for what you did in the field 
5618_48830_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 That s all nonsense my lord 
none	none	Very well you can tell her so 
5618_48830_000093_000001	train-clean-360	You may take my word for this too my sister hates Crosbie quite as much as you do 
5618_48830_000093_000002	train-clean-360	I think she d pitch into him as you call it herself if she knew how 
5618_48830_000093_000003	train-clean-360	You come down to Guestwick for the Christmas and then go over to Allington and tell them all plainly what you mean 
5618_48830_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 I couldn t say a word to her now 
5618_48830_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Say it to the squire then 
5618_48830_000095_000001	train-clean-360	Go to him and tell him what you mean holding your head up like a man 
5618_48830_000095_000002	train-clean-360	Don t talk to me about swells 
5618_48830_000095_000003	train-clean-360	The man who means honestly is the best swell I know 
none	none	He s the only swell I recognize Go to old Dale and say you come from me from Guestwick Manor 
5618_48830_000095_000006	train-clean-360	Tell him that if he ll put a little stick under the pot to make it boil I ll put a bigger one 
none	none	He ll understand what that means Oh no my lord But I say oh yes and the earl who was now standing on the rug before the fire dug his hands deep down into his trousers pockets I m very fond of that girl and would do much for her You ask Lady Julia if I didn t say so to her before I ever knew of your casting a sheep s eye that way And I ve a sneaking kindness for you too Master Johnny 
5618_48830_000097_000003	train-clean-360	Lord bless you I knew your father as well as I ever knew any man and to tell the truth I believe I helped to ruin him He held land of me you know and there can t be any doubt that he did ruin himself 
5618_48830_000097_000004	train-clean-360	He knew no more about a beast when he d done than than than that waiter 
5618_48830_000097_000005	train-clean-360	If he d gone on to this day he wouldn t have been any wiser 
none	none	Johnny sat silent with his eyes full of tears What was he to say to his friend
5618_48830_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 You come down with me continued the earl and you ll find we ll make it all straight 
none	none	I daresay you re right about not speaking to the girl just at present 
5618_48830_000099_000002	train-clean-360	But tell everything to the uncle and then to the mother 
5618_48830_000099_000003	train-clean-360	And above all things never think that you re not good enough yourself 
none	none	A man should never think that 
5618_48830_000099_000005	train-clean-360	My belief is that in life people will take you very much at your own reckoning 
5618_48830_000099_000006	train-clean-360	If you are made of dirt like that fellow Crosbie you ll be found out at last no doubt 
5618_48830_000099_000007	train-clean-360	But then I don t think you are made of dirt 
none	none	I hope not
5618_48830_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 And so do I You can come down I suppose with me the day after to morrow 
5618_48830_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid not 
none	none	I have had all my leave
5618_48830_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I write to old Buffle and ask it as a favour 
none	none	No said Johnny I shouldn t like that 
5618_48830_000104_000001	train-clean-360	But I ll see to morrow and then I ll let you know 
none	none	I can go down by the mail train on Saturday at any rate
5618_48830_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 That won t be comfortable 
5618_48830_000105_000001	train-clean-360	See and come with me if you can 
none	none	Now good night my dear fellow and remember this when I say a thing I mean it 
5618_48830_000105_000003	train-clean-360	I think I may boast that I never yet went back from my word 
none	none	The earl as he spoke gave his left hand to his guest and looking somewhat grandly up over the young man s head he tapped his own breast thrice with his right hand 
5618_48830_000106_000001	train-clean-360	As he went through the little scene John Eames felt that he was every inch an earl 
none	none	I don t know what to say to you my lord
5618_48830_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Say nothing not a word more to me 
none	none	But say to yourself that 
5618_48831_000117_000003	train-clean-360	faint heart never won fair lady 
5618_48830_000108_000002	train-clean-360	Good night my dear boy good night 
5618_48830_000108_000003	train-clean-360	I dine out to morrow but you can call and let me know at about six 
5618_48830_000109_000000	train-clean-360	Eames then left the room without another word and walked out into the cold air of Jermyn Street 
5618_48830_000109_000001	train-clean-360	The moon was clear and bright and the pavement in the shining light seemed to be as clean as a lady s hand 
none	none	All the world was altered to him since he had entered Pawkins s Hotel Was it then possible that Lily Dale might even yet become his wife 
5618_48830_000109_000004	train-clean-360	Could it be true that he even now was in a position to go boldly to the Squire of Allington and tell him what were his views with reference to Lily 
5618_48830_000109_000005	train-clean-360	And how far would he be justified in taking the earl at his word 
none	none	Some incredible amount of wealth would be required before he could marry Lily Dale Two or three hundred pounds a year at the very least The earl could not mean him to understand that any such sum as that would be made up with such an object Nevertheless he resolved as he walked home to Burton Crescent that he would go down to Guestwick and that he would obey the earl s behest As regarded Lily herself he felt that nothing could be said to her for many a long day as yet
5618_48830_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh John how late you are said Amelia slipping out from the back parlour as he let himself in with his latch key 
none	none	Yes I am very late said John taking his candle and passing her by on the stairs without another word 
5618_48831_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXXIII 
none	none	THE TIME WILL COME Did you hear that young Eames is staying at Guestwick Manor As these were the first words which the squire spoke to missus Dale as they walked together up to the Great House after church on Christmas Day it was clear enough that the tidings of Johnny s visit when told to him had made some impression
5618_48831_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 At Guestwick Manor said missus Dale 
none	none	Dear me 
5618_48831_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Do you hear that Bell 
5618_48831_000006_000003	train-clean-360	There s promotion for Master Johnny 
5618_48831_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you remember mamma said Bell that he helped his lordship in his trouble with the bull 
none	none	Lily who remembered accurately all the passages of her last interview with John Eames said nothing but felt in some sort sore at the idea that he should be so near her at such a time In some unconscious way she had liked him for coming to her and saying all that he did say 
5618_48831_000008_000002	train-clean-360	She valued him more highly after that scene than she did before 
5618_48831_000008_000003	train-clean-360	But now she would feel herself injured and hurt if he ever made his way into her presence under circumstances as they existed 
5618_48831_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I should not have thought that Lord De Guest was the man to show so much gratitude for so slight a favour said the squire 
5618_48831_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 However I m going to dine there to morrow 
none	none	To meet young Eames said missus Dale
5618_48831_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes especially to meet young Eames 
none	none	At least I ve been very specially asked to come and I ve been told that he is to be there
5618_48831_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 And is Bernard going 
5618_48831_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed I m not said Bernard 
none	none	I shall come over and dine with you A half formed idea flitted across Lily s mind teaching her to imagine for a moment that she might possibly be concerned in this arrangement But the thought vanished as quickly as it came merely leaving some soreness behind it There are certain maladies which make the whole body sore The patient let him be touched on any point let him even be nearly touched will roar with agony as though his whole body had been bruised So it is also with maladies of the mind Sorrows such as that of poor Lily s leave the heart sore at every point and compel the sufferer to be ever in fear of new wounds 
5618_48831_000014_000006	train-clean-360	Lily bore her cross bravely and well but not the less did it weigh heavily upon her at every turn because she had the strength to walk as though she did not bear it 
5618_48831_000014_000007	train-clean-360	Nothing happened to her or in her presence that did not in some way connect itself with her misery 
none	none	Her uncle was going over to meet John Eames at Lord De Guest s 
5618_48831_000014_000009	train-clean-360	Of course the men there would talk about her and all such talking was an injury to her 
5618_48831_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The afternoon of that day did not pass away brightly 
5618_48831_000015_000001	train-clean-360	As long as the servants were in the room the dinner went on much as other dinners At such times a certain amount of hypocrisy must always be practised in closely domestic circles 
none	none	At mixed dinner parties people can talk before Richard and William the same words that they would use if Richard and William were not there 
5618_48831_000015_000003	train-clean-360	People so mixed do not talk together their inward home thoughts 
5618_48831_000015_000004	train-clean-360	But when close friends are together a little conscious reticence is practised till the door is tiled 
none	none	At such a meeting as this that conscious reticence was of service and created an effect which was salutary 
5618_48831_000015_000006	train-clean-360	When the door was tiled and when the servants were gone how could they be merry together 
5618_48831_000015_000007	train-clean-360	By what mirth should the beards be made to wag on that Christmas Day 
none	none	My father has been up in town said Bernard
5618_48831_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 He was with Lord De Guest at Pawkins s 
none	none	Why didn t you go and see him asked missus Dale Well I don t know He did not seem to wish it 
5618_48831_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I shall go down to Torquay in February 
5618_48831_000018_000003	train-clean-360	I must be up in London you know in a fortnight for good Then they were all silent again for a few minutes 
5618_48831_000018_000004	train-clean-360	If Bernard could have owned the truth he would have acknowledged that he had not gone up to London because he did not yet know how to treat Crosbie when he should meet him 
none	none	His thoughts on this matter threw some sort of shadow across poor Lily s mind making her feel that her wound was again opened
5618_48831_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I want him to give up his profession altogether said the squire speaking firmly and slowly 
5618_48831_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 It would be better I think for both of us that he should do so 
none	none	Would it be wise at his time of life said missus Dale and when he has been doing so well
5618_48831_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I think it would be wise 
none	none	If he were my son it would be thought better that he should live here upon the property among the people who are to become his tenants than remain up in London or perhaps be sent to India He has one profession as the heir of this place and that I think should be enough I should have but an idle life of it down here said Bernard
5618_48831_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 That would be your own fault 
5618_48831_000023_000001	train-clean-360	But if you did as I would have you your life would not be idle In this he was alluding to Bernard s proposed marriage but as to that nothing further could be said in Bell s presence 
5618_48831_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Bell understood it all and sat quite silent with demure countenance perhaps even with something of sternness in her face 
none	none	But the fact is said missus Dale speaking in a low tone and having well considered what she was about to say that Bernard is not exactly the same as your son
5618_48831_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not said the squire 
5618_48831_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I have even offered to settle the property on him if he will leave the service 
none	none	You do not owe him so much as you would owe your son and therefore he does not owe you as much as he would owe his father
5618_48831_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 If you mean that I cannot constrain him I know that well enough As regards money I have offered to do for him quite as much as any father would feel called upon to do for an only son 
5618_48831_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope you don t think me ungrateful said Bernard 
5618_48831_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 No I do not but I think you unmindful 
5618_48831_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I have nothing more to say about it however not about that 
5618_48831_000029_000002	train-clean-360	If you should marry And then he stopped himself feeling that he could not go on in Bell s presence 
none	none	If he should marry said missus Dale it may well be that his wife would like a house of her own
5618_48831_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Wouldn t she have this house said the squire angrily 
5618_48831_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Isn t it big enough 
none	none	I only want one room for myself and I d give up that if it were necessary
5618_48831_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 That s nonsense said missus Dale 
none	none	It isn t nonsense said the squire
5618_48831_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll be squire of Allington for the next twenty years said missus Dale 
none	none	And as long as you are the squire you ll be master of this house at least I hope so 
5618_48831_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I don t approve of monarchs abdicating in favour of young people 
5618_48831_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think uncle Christopher would look at all well like Charles the Fifth said Lily 
5618_48831_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I would always keep a cell for you my darling if I did said the squire regarding her with that painful special tenderness 
5618_48831_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Lily who was sitting next to missus Dale put her hand out secretly and got hold of her mother s thereby indicating that she did not intend to occupy the cell offered to her by her uncle or to look to him as the companion of her monastic seclusion 
none	none	After that there was nothing more then said as to Bernard s prospects
5618_48831_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Hearn is dining at the vicarage I suppose asked the squire 
5618_48831_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she went in after church said Bell 
5618_48831_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I saw her go with missus Boyce 
none	none	She told me she never would dine with them again after dark in winter said missus Dale
5618_48831_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 The last time she was there the boy let the lamp blow out as she was going home and she lost her way 
5618_48831_000039_000002	train-clean-360	The truth was she was angry because mister Boyce didn t go with her 
none	none	She s always angry said the squire
5618_48831_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 She hardly speaks to me now When she paid her rent the other day to Jolliffe she said she hoped it would do me much good as though she thought me a brute for taking it 
none	none	So she does said Bernard She s very old you know said Bell I d give her the house for nothing if I were you uncle said Lily No my dear if you were me you would not 
5618_48831_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I should be very wrong to do so 
none	none	Why should missus Hearn have her house for nothing any more than her meat or her clothes It would be much more reasonable were I to give her so much money into her hand yearly but it would be wrong in me to do so seeing that she is not an object of charity and it would be wrong in her to take it
5618_48831_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And she wouldn t take it said missus Dale 
5618_48831_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think she would 
5618_48831_000046_000001	train-clean-360	But if she did I m sure she would grumble because it wasn t double the amount 
5618_48831_000046_000002	train-clean-360	And if mister Boyce had gone home with her she would have grumbled because he walked too fast 
none	none	She is very old said Bell again
5618_48831_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 But nevertheless she ought to know better than to speak disparagingly of me to my servants 
none	none	She should have more respect for herself And the squire showed by the tone of his voice that he thought very much about it 
5618_48831_000049_000000	train-clean-360	It was very long and very dull that Christmas evening making Bernard feel strongly that he would be very foolish to give up his profession and tie himself down to a life at Allington 
none	none	Women are more accustomed than men to long dull unemployed hours and therefore missus Dale and her daughters bore the tedium courageously While he yawned stretched himself and went in and out of the room they sat demurely listening as the squire laid down the law on small matters and contradicting him occasionally when the spirit of either of them prompted her specially to do so
5618_48831_000049_000002	train-clean-360	 Of course you know much better than I do he would say 
none	none	Not at all missus Dale would answer
5618_48831_000049_000004	train-clean-360	 I don t pretend to know anything about it 
5618_48831_000049_000005	train-clean-360	But So the evening wore itself away and when the squire was left alone at half past nine he did not feel that the day had passed badly with him 
5618_48831_000049_000006	train-clean-360	That was his style of life and he expected no more from it than he got 
5618_48831_000049_000007	train-clean-360	He did not look to find things very pleasant and if not happy he was at any rate contented 
5618_48831_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Only think of Johnny Eames being at Guestwick Manor said Bell as they were going home 
none	none	I don t see why he shouldn t be there said Lily I would rather it should be he than I because Lady Julia is so grumpy But asking your uncle Christopher especially to meet him said missus Dale
5618_48831_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 There must be some reason for it Then Lily felt the soreness come upon her again and spoke no further upon the subject 
none	none	We all know that there was a special reason and that Lily s soreness was not false in its mysterious forebodings Eames on the evening after his dinner at Pawkins s had seen the earl and explained to him that he could not leave town till the Saturday evening but that he could remain over the Tuesday 
5618_48831_000053_000002	train-clean-360	He must be at his office by twelve on Wednesday and could manage to do that by an early train from Guestwick 
none	none	Very well Johnny said the earl talking to his young friend with the bedroom candle in his hand as he was going up to dress
5618_48831_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 Then I ll tell you what I ve been thinking of it 
5618_48831_000054_000002	train-clean-360	I ll ask Dale to come over to dinner on Tuesday and if he ll come I ll explain the whole matter to him myself 
5618_48831_000054_000003	train-clean-360	He s a man of business and he ll understand If he won t come why then you must go over to Allington and find him if you can on the Tuesday morning or I ll go to him myself which will be better 
5618_48831_000054_000004	train-clean-360	You mustn t keep me now as I am ever so much too late 
5618_48831_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Eames did not attempt to keep him but went away feeling that the whole matter was being arranged for him in a very wonderful way 
none	none	And when he got to Allington he found that the squire had accepted the earl s invitation 
5618_48831_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Then he declared to himself that there was no longer any possibility of retractation for him 
5618_48831_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Of course he did not wish to retract 
none	none	The one great longing of his life was to call Lily Dale his own 
5618_48831_000055_000005	train-clean-360	But he felt afraid of the squire that the squire would despise him and snub him and that the earl would perceive that he had made a mistake when he saw how his client was scorned and snubbed 
none	none	It was arranged that the earl was to take the squire into his own room for a few minutes before dinner and Johnny felt that he would be hardly able to stand his ground in the drawing room when the two old men should make their appearance together 
5618_48831_000056_000000	train-clean-360	He got on very well with Lady Julia who gave herself no airs and made herself very civil 
5618_48831_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Her brother had told her the whole story and she felt as anxious as he did to provide Lily with another husband in place of that horrible man Crosbie 
none	none	She has been very fortunate in her escape she said to her brother very fortunate The earl agreed with this saying that in his opinion his own favourite Johnny would make much the nicer lover of the two But Lady Julia had her doubts as to Lily s acquiescence But Theodore he must not speak to Miss Lilian Dale herself about it yet a while No said the earl not for a month or so He will have a better chance if he can remain silent for six months said Lady Julia Bless my soul somebody else will have picked her up before that said the earl 
5618_48831_000060_000000	train-clean-360	In answer to this Lady Julia merely shook her head 
none	none	Johnny went over to his mother on Christmas Day after church and was received by her and by his sister with great honour And she gave him many injunctions as to his behaviour at the earl s table even descending to small details about his boots and linen 
5618_48831_000061_000002	train-clean-360	But Johnny had already begun to feel at the Manor that after all people are not so very different in their ways of life as they are supposed to be 
5618_48831_000061_000003	train-clean-360	Lady Julia s manners were certainly not quite those of missus Roper but she made the tea very much in the way in which it was made at Burton Crescent and Eames found that he could eat his egg at any rate on the second morning without any tremor in his hand in spite of the coronet on the silver egg cup 
5618_48831_000061_000004	train-clean-360	He did feel himself to be rather out of his place in the Manor pew on the Sunday conceiving that all the congregation was looking at him but he got over this on Christmas Day and sat quite comfortably in his soft corner during the sermon almost going to sleep 
5618_48831_000061_000005	train-clean-360	And when he walked with the earl after church to the gate over which the noble peer had climbed in his agony and inspected the hedge through which he had thrown himself he was quite at home with his little jokes bantering his august companion as to the mode of his somersault 
none	none	But be it always remembered that there are two modes in which a young man may be free and easy with his elder and superior the mode pleasant and the mode offensive Had it been in Johnny s nature to try the latter the earl s back would soon have been up at once and the play would have been over 
5618_48831_000061_000008	train-clean-360	But it was not in Johnny s nature to do so and therefore it was that the earl liked him 
5618_48831_000062_000000	train-clean-360	At last came the hour of dinner on Tuesday or at least the hour at which the squire had been asked to show himself at the Manor House Eames as by agreement with his patron did not come down so as to show himself till after the interview 
5618_48831_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Lady Julia who had been present at their discussions had agreed to receive the squire and then a servant was to ask him to step into the earl s own room 
5618_48831_000062_000002	train-clean-360	It was pretty to see the way in which the three conspired together planning and plotting with an eagerness that was beautifully green and fresh 
none	none	He can be as cross as an old stick when he likes it said the earl speaking of the squire and we must take care not to rub him the wrong way I shan t know what to say to him when I come down said Johnny Just shake hands with him and don t say anything said Lady Julia
5618_48831_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll give him some port wine that ought to soften his heart said the earl and then we ll see how he is in the evening 
none	none	Eames heard the wheels of the squire s little open carriage and trembled The squire unconscious of all schemes soon found himself with Lady Julia and within two minutes of his entrance was walked off to the earl s private room Certainly he said certainly and followed the man servant 
5618_48831_000067_000003	train-clean-360	The earl as he entered was standing in the middle of the room and his round rosy face was a picture of good humour 
none	none	I m very glad you ve come Dale said he
5618_48831_000068_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve something I want to say to you 
none	none	mister Dale who neither in heart nor in manner was so light a man as the earl took the proffered hand of his host and bowed his head slightly signifying that he was willing to listen to anything I think I told you continued the earl that young John Eames is down here but he goes back to morrow as they can t spare him at his office He s a very good fellow as far as I am able to judge an uncommonly good young man 
5618_48831_000070_000002	train-clean-360	I ve taken a great fancy to him myself 
none	none	In answer to this mister Dale did not say much 
5618_48831_000071_000001	train-clean-360	He sat down and in some general terms expressed his good will towards all the Eames family 
5618_48831_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 As you know Dale I m a very bad hand at talking and therefore I won t beat about the bush in what I ve got to say at present 
none	none	Of course we ve all heard of that scoundrel Crosbie and the way he has treated your niece Lilian He is a scoundrel an unmixed scoundrel 
5618_48831_000073_000001	train-clean-360	But the less we say about that the better 
none	none	It is ill mentioning a girl s name in such a matter as that
5618_48831_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 But my dear Dale I must mention it at the present moment 
5618_48831_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Dear young child I would do anything to comfort her 
5618_48831_000074_000002	train-clean-360	And I hope that something may be done to comfort her 
5618_48831_000074_000003	train-clean-360	Do you know that that young man was in love with her long before Crosbie ever saw her 
5618_48831_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 What John Eames 
none	none	Yes John Eames And I wish heartily for his sake that he had won her regard before she had met that rascal whom you had to stay down at your house A man cannot help these things De Guest said the squire No no no There are such men about the world and it is impossible to know them at a glance 
5618_48831_000078_000001	train-clean-360	He was my nephew s friend and I am not going to say that my nephew was in fault 
5618_48831_000078_000002	train-clean-360	But I wish I only say that I wish she had first known what are this young man s feelings towards her 
none	none	But she might not have thought of him as you do
5618_48831_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 He is an uncommonly good looking young fellow straight made broad in the chest with a good honest eye and a young man s proper courage 
none	none	He has never been taught to give himself airs like a dancing monkey but I think he s all the better for that
5618_48831_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 But it s too late now De Guest 
none	none	No no that s just where it is 
5618_48831_000082_000001	train-clean-360	It mustn t be too late 
5618_48831_000082_000002	train-clean-360	That child is not to lose her whole life because a villain has played her false Of course she ll suffer 
none	none	Just at present it wouldn t do I suppose to talk to her about a new sweetheart 
5618_48831_000082_000004	train-clean-360	But Dale the time will come the time will come the time always does come 
none	none	It has never come to you and me said the squire with the slightest possible smile on his dry cheeks 
5618_48831_000083_000001	train-clean-360	The story of their lives had been so far the same each had loved and each had been disappointed and then each had remained single through life 
none	none	Yes it has said the earl with no slight touch of feeling and even of romance in what he said We have retricked our beams in our own ways and our lives have not been desolate 
5618_48831_000084_000002	train-clean-360	But for her you and her mother will look forward to see her married some day 
5618_48831_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 I have not thought about it 
5618_48831_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 But I want you to think about it 
5618_48831_000086_000001	train-clean-360	I want to interest you in this fellow s favour and in doing so I mean to be very open with you I suppose you ll give her something 
none	none	I don t know I m sure said the squire almost offended at an inquiry of such a nature
5618_48831_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then whether you do or not I ll give him something said the earl 
5618_48831_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t have ventured to meddle in the matter had I not intended to put myself in such a position with reference to him as would justify me in asking the question And the peer as he spoke drew himself up to his full height 
5618_48831_000088_000002	train-clean-360	 If such a match can be made it shall not be a bad marriage for your niece in a pecuniary point of view 
5618_48831_000088_000003	train-clean-360	I shall have pleasure in giving to him but I shall have more pleasure if she can share what I give 
5618_48831_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 She ought to be very much obliged to you said the squire 
none	none	I think she would be if she knew young Eames I hope the day may come when she will be so 
5618_48831_000090_000002	train-clean-360	I hope that you and I may see them happy together and that you too may thank me for having assisted in making them so 
none	none	Shall we go in to Lady Julia now The earl had felt that he had not quite succeeded that his offer had been accepted somewhat coldly and had not much hope that further good could be done on that day even with the help of his best port wine
5618_48831_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 Half a moment said the squire 
5618_48831_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 There are matters as to which I never find myself able to speak quickly and this certainly seems to be one of them 
none	none	If you will allow me I will think over what you have said and then see you again
5618_48831_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Certainly certainly 
none	none	But for your own part in the matter for your great generosity and kind heart I beg to offer you my warmest thanks Then the squire bowed low and preceded the earl out of the room 
5618_48831_000094_000000	train-clean-360	Lord De Guest still felt that he had not succeeded 
none	none	We may probably say looking at the squire s character and peculiarities that no marked success was probable at the first opening out of such a subject 
5618_48831_000094_000002	train-clean-360	He had said of himself that he was never able to speak quickly in matters of moment but he would more correctly have described his own character had he declared that he could not think of them quickly 
5618_48831_000094_000003	train-clean-360	As it was the earl was disappointed but had he been able to read the squire s mind his disappointment would have been less strong 
5618_48831_000094_000004	train-clean-360	mister Dale knew well enough that he was being treated well and that the effort being made was intended with kindness to those belonging to him but it was not in his nature to be demonstrative and quick at expressions of gratitude 
none	none	So he entered the drawing room with a cold placid face leading Eames and Lady Julia also to suppose that no good had been done
5618_48831_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you do sir said Johnny walking up to him in a wild sort of manner going through a premeditated lesson but doing it without any presence of mind 
none	none	How do you do Eames said the squire speaking with a very cold voice And then there was nothing further said till the dinner was announced
5618_48831_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Dale I know you drink port said the earl when Lady Julia left them 
none	none	If you say you don t like that I shall say you know nothing about it
5618_48831_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah that s the twenty said the squire tasting it 
5618_48831_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 I should rather think it is said the earl 
5618_48831_000099_000001	train-clean-360	 I was lucky enough to get it early and it hasn t been moved for thirty years 
5618_48831_000099_000002	train-clean-360	I like to give it to a man who knows it as you do at the first glance 
none	none	Now there s my friend Johnny there it s thrown away upon him No my lord it is not I think it s uncommonly nice Uncommonly nice 
5618_48831_000101_000001	train-clean-360	So is champagne or ginger beer or lollipops for those who like them 
none	none	Do you mean to tell me you can taste wine with half a pickled orange in your mouth
5618_48831_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 It ll come to him soon enough said the squire 
none	none	Twenty port won t come to him when he is as old as we are said the earl forgetting that by that time sixty port will be as wonderful to the then living seniors of the age as was his own pet vintage to him The good wine did in some sort soften the squire but as a matter of course nothing further was said as to the new matrimonial scheme The earl did observe however that mister Dale was civil and even kind to his own young friend asking a question here and there as to his life in London and saying something about the work at the Income tax Office It is hard work said Eames If you re under the line they make a great row about it send for you and look at you as though you d been robbing the bank but they think nothing of keeping you till five But how long do you have for lunch and reading the papers said the earl
5618_48831_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 Not ten minutes 
none	none	We take a paper among twenty of us for half the day 
5618_48831_000107_000002	train-clean-360	That s exactly nine minutes to each and as for lunch we only have a biscuit dipped in ink 
5618_48831_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 Dipped in ink said the squire 
5618_48831_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 It comes to that for you have to be writing while you munch it 
none	none	I hear all about you said the earl Sir Raffle Buffle is an old crony of mine
5618_48831_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t suppose he ever heard my name as yet said Johnny 
none	none	But do you really know him well Lord De Guest
5618_48831_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 Haven t seen him these thirty years but I did know him 
none	none	We call him old Huffle Scuffle Huffle Scuffle Ha ha ha 
5618_48831_000114_000002	train-clean-360	He always was Huffle Scuffle a noisy pretentious empty headed fellow 
none	none	But I oughtn t to say so before you young man 
5618_48831_000114_000004	train-clean-360	Come we ll go into the drawing room 
5618_48831_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 And what did he say asked Lady Julia as soon as the squire was gone 
5618_48831_000116_000000	train-clean-360	There was no attempt at concealment and the question was asked in Johnny s presence 
5618_48831_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he did not say much 
5618_48831_000117_000001	train-clean-360	And coming from him that ought to be taken as a good sign 
5618_48831_000117_000002	train-clean-360	He is to think of it and let me see him again You hold your head up Johnny and remember that you shan t want a friend on your side 
none	none	Faint heart never won fair lady At seven o clock on the following morning Eames started on his return journey and was at his desk at twelve o clock as per agreement with his taskmaster at the Income tax Office CHAPTER XXXIV THE COMBAT ILLUSTRATION untitled I have said that John Eames was at his office punctually at twelve but an incident had happened before his arrival there very important in the annals which are now being told so important that it is essentially necessary that it should be described with some minuteness of detail Lord De Guest in the various conversations which he had had with Eames as to Lily Dale and her present position had always spoken of Crosbie with the most vehement abhorrence He is a damned blackguard said the earl and the fire had come out of his round eyes as he spoke Now the earl was by no means given to cursing and swearing in the sense which is ordinarily applied to these words When he made use of such a phrase as that quoted above it was to be presumed that he in some sort meant what he said and so he did and had intended to signify that Crosbie by his conduct had merited all such condemnation as was the fitting punishment for blackguardism of the worst description He ought to have his neck broken said Johnny I don t know about that said the earl The present times have become so pretty behaved that corporal punishment seems to have gone out of fashion I shouldn t care so much about that if any other punishment had taken its place But it seems to me that a blackguard such as Crosbie can escape now altogether unscathed He hasn t escaped yet said Johnny Don t you go and put your finger in the pie and make a fool of yourself said the earl If it had behoved any one to resent in any violent fashion the evil done by Crosbie Bernard Dale the earl s nephew should have been the avenger This the earl felt but under these circumstances he was disposed to think that there should be no such violent vengeance Things were different when I was young he said to himself But Eames gathered from the earl s tone that the earl s words were not strictly in accordance with his thoughts and he declared to himself over and over again that Crosbie had not yet escaped He got into the train at Guestwick taking a first class ticket because the earl s groom in livery was in attendance upon him Had he been alone he would have gone in a cheaper carriage Very weak in him was it not little also and mean My friend can you say that you would not have done the same at his age Are you quite sure that you would not do the same now that you are double his age Be that as it may Johnny Eames did that foolish thing and gave the groom in livery half a crown into the bargain We shall have you down again soon mister John said the groom who seemed to understand that mister Eames was to be made quite at home at the manor He went fast to sleep in the carriage and did not awake till the train was stopped at the Barchester Junction Waiting for the up train from Barchester sir said the guard They re always late Then he went to sleep again and was aroused in a few minutes by some one entering the carriage in a great hurry The branch train had come in just as the guardians of the line then present had made up their minds that the passengers on the main line should not be kept waiting any longer The transfer of men women and luggage was therefore made in great haste and they who were now taking their new seats had hardly time to look about them An old gentleman very red about the gills first came into Johnny s carriage which up to that moment he had shared with an old lady The old gentleman was abusing everybody because he was hurried and would not take himself well into the compartment but stuck in the doorway standing on the step Now sir when you re quite at leisure said a voice behind the old man which instantly made Eames start up in his seat I m not at all at leisure said the old man and I m not going to break my legs if I know it Take your time sir said the guard So I mean said the old man seating himself in the corner nearest to the open door opposite to the old lady Then Eames saw plainly that it was Crosbie who had first spoken and that he was getting into the carriage Crosbie at the first glance saw no one but the old gentleman and the old lady and he immediately made for the unoccupied corner seat He was busy with his umbrella and his dressing bag and a little flustered by the pushing and hurrying The carriage was actually in motion before he perceived that John Eames was opposite to him Eames had instinctively drawn up his legs so as not to touch him He felt that he had become very red in the face and to tell the truth the perspiration had broken out upon his brow It was a great occasion great in its imminent trouble and great in its opportunity for action How was he to carry himself at the first moment of his recognition by his enemy and what was he to do afterwards It need hardly be explained that Crosbie had also been spending his Christmas with a certain earl of his acquaintance and that he too was returning to his office In one respect he had been much more fortunate than poor Eames for he had been made happy with the smiles of his lady love Alexandrina and the countess had fluttered about him softly treating him as a tame chattel now belonging to the noble house of De Courcy and in this way he had been initiated into the inner domesticities of that illustrious family The two extra men servants hired to wait upon Lady Dumbello had vanished The champagne had ceased to flow in a perennial stream Lady Rosina had come out from her solitude and had preached at him constantly Lady Margaretta had given him some lessons in economy The Honourable John in spite of a late quarrel had borrowed five pounds from him The Honourable George had engaged to come and stay with his sister during the next May The earl had used a father in law s privilege and had called him a fool Lady Alexandrina had told him more than once in rather a tart voice that this must be done and that that must be done and the countess had given him her orders as though it was his duty in the course of nature to obey every word that fell from her Such had been his Christmas delights and now as he returned back from the enjoyment of them he found himself confronted in the railway carriage with Johnny Eames The eyes of the two met and Crosbie made a slight inclination of his head To this Eames gave no acknowledgment whatever but looked straight into the other s face Crosbie immediately saw that they were not to know each other and was well contented that it should be so Among all his many troubles the enmity of John Eames did not go for much He showed no appearance of being disconcerted though our friend had shown much He opened his bag and taking out a book was soon deeply engaged in it pursuing his studies as though the man opposite was quite unknown to him I will not say that his mind did not run away from his book for indeed there were many things of which he found it impossible not to think but it did not revert to John Eames Indeed when the carriages reached Paddington he had in truth all but forgotten him and as he stepped out of the carriage with his bag in his hand was quite free from any remotest trouble on his account But it had not been so with Eames himself Every moment of the journey had for him been crowded with thought as to what he would do now that chance had brought his enemy within his reach He had been made quite wretched by the intensity of his thinking and yet when the carriages stopped he had not made up his mind His face had been covered with perspiration ever since Crosbie had come across him and his limbs had hardly been under his own command Here had come to him a great opportunity and he felt so little confidence in himself that he almost knew that he would not use it properly Twice and thrice he had almost flown at Crosbie s throat in the carriage but he was restrained by an idea that the world and the police would be against him if he did such a thing in the presence of that old lady But when Crosbie turned his back upon him and walked out it was absolutely necessary that he should do something He was not going to let the man escape after all that he had said as to the expediency of thrashing him Any other disgrace would be preferable to that Fearing therefore lest his enemy should be too quick for him he hurried out after him and only just gave Crosbie time to turn round and face the carriages before he was upon him You confounded scoundrel he screamed out You confounded scoundrel and seized him by the throat throwing himself upon him and almost devouring him by the fury of his eyes The crowd upon the platform was not very dense but there were quite enough of people to make a very respectable audience for this little play Crosbie in his dismay retreated a step or two and his retreat was much accelerated by the weight of Eames s attack He endeavoured to free his throat from his foe s grasp but in that he failed entirely For the minute however he did manage to escape any positive blow owing his safety in that respect rather to Eames s awkwardness than to his own efforts Something about the police he was just able to utter and there was as a matter of course an immediate call for a supply of those functionaries In about three minutes three policemen assisted by six porters had captured our poor friend Johnny but this had not been done quick enough for Crosbie s purposes The bystanders taken by surprise had allowed the combatants to fall back upon mister Smith s book stall and there Eames laid his foe prostrate among the newspapers falling himself into the yellow shilling novel depot by the over fury of his own energy but as he fell he contrived to lodge one blow with his fist in Crosbie s right eye one telling blow and Crosbie had to all intents and purposes been thrashed Con founded scoundrel rascal blackguard shouted Johnny with what remnants of voice were left to him as the police dragged him off If you only knew what he s done But in the meantime the policemen held him fast As a matter of course the first burst of public sympathy went with Crosbie He had been assaulted and the assault had come from Eames In the British bosom there is so firm a love of well constituted order that these facts alone were sufficient to bring twenty knights to the assistance of the three policemen and the six porters so that for Eames even had he desired it there was no possible chance of escape But he did not desire it One only sorrow consumed him at present He had as he felt attacked Crosbie but had attacked him in vain He had had his opportunity and had misused it He was perfectly unconscious of that happy blow and was in absolute ignorance of the great fact that his enemy s eye was already swollen and closed and that in another hour it would be as black as his hat He is a con founded rascal ejaculated Eames as the policemen and porters hauled him about You don t know what he s done No we don t said the senior constable but we know what you have done I say Bushers where s that gentleman He d better come along with us Crosbie had been picked up from among the newspapers by another policeman and two or three other porters and was attended also by the guard of the train who knew him and knew that he had come up from Courcy Castle Three or four hangers on were standing also around him together with a benevolent medical man who was proposing to him an immediate application of leeches If he could have done as he wished he would have gone his way quietly allowing Eames to do the same A great evil had befallen him but he could in no way mitigate that evil by taking the law of the man who had attacked him To have the thing as little talked about as possible should be his endeavour What though he should have Eames locked up and fined and scolded by a police magistrate That would not in any degree lessen his calamity If he could have parried the attack and got the better of his foe if he could have administered the black eye instead of receiving it then indeed he could have laughed the matter off at his club and his original crime would have been somewhat glozed over by his success in arms But such good fortune had not been his He was forced however on the moment to decide as to what he would do We ve got him here in custody sir said Bushers touching his hat It had become known from the guard that Crosbie was somewhat of a big man a frequent guest at Courcy Castle and of repute and station in the higher regions of the Metropolitan world The magistrates will be sitting at Paddington now sir or will be by the time we get there By this time some mighty railway authority had come upon the scene and made himself cognizant of the facts of the row a stern official who seemed to carry the weight of many engines on his brow one at the very sight of whom smokers would drop their cigars and porters close their fists against sixpences a great man with an erect chin a quick step and a well brushed hat powerful with an elaborately upturned brim This was the platform superintendent dominant even over the policemen Step into my room mister Crosbie he said Stubbs bring that man in with you And then before Crosbie had been able to make up his mind as to any other line of conduct he found himself in the superintendent s room accompanied by the guard and by the two policemen who conducted Johnny Eames between them What s all this said the superintendent still keeping on his hat for he was aware how much of the excellence of his personal dignity was owing to the arrangement of that article and as he spoke he frowned upon the culprit with his utmost severity mister Crosbie I am very sorry that you should have been exposed to such brutality on our platform You don t know what he has done said Johnny He is the most confounded scoundrel living He has broken But then he stopped himself He was going to tell the superintendent that the confounded scoundrel had broken a beautiful young lady s heart but he bethought himself that he would not allude more specially to Lily Dale in that hearing Do you know who he is mister Crosbie said the superintendent Oh yes said Crosbie whose eye was already becoming blue He is a clerk in the Income tax Office and his name is Eames I believe you had better leave him to me But the superintendent at once wrote down the words Income tax Office Eames on his tablet We can t allow a row like that to take place on our platform and not notice it I shall bring it before the directors It s a most disgraceful affair mister Eames most disgraceful But Johnny by this time had perceived that Crosbie s eye was in a state which proved satisfactorily that his morning s work had not been thrown away and his spirits were rising accordingly He did not care two straws for the superintendent or even for the policemen if only the story could be made to tell well for himself hereafter It was his object to have thrashed Crosbie and now as he looked at his enemy s face he acknowledged that Providence had been good to him That s your opinion said Johnny Yes sir it is said the superintendent and I shall know how to represent the matter to your superiors young man You don t know all about it said Eames and I don t suppose you ever will I had made up my mind what I d do the first time I saw that scoundrel there and now I ve done it He d have got much worse in the railway carriage only there was a lady there mister Crosbie I really think we had better take him before the magistrates To this however Crosbie objected He assured the superintendent that he would himself know how to deal with the matter which however was exactly what he did not know Would the superintendent allow one of the railway servants to get a cab for him and to find his luggage He was very anxious to get home without being subjected to any more of mister Eames s insolence You haven t done with mister Eames s insolence yet I can tell you All London shall hear of it and shall know why If you have any shame in you you shall be ashamed to show your face Unfortunate man Who can say that punishment adequate punishment had not overtaken him For the present he had to sneak home with a black eye with the knowledge inside him that he had been whipped by a clerk in the Income tax Office and for the future he was bound over to marry Lady Alexandrina De Courcy He got himself smuggled off in a cab without being forced to go again upon the platform his luggage being brought to him by two assiduous porters But in all this there was very little balm for his hurt pride As he ordered the cabman to drive to Mount Street he felt that he had ruined himself by that step in life which he had taken at Courcy Castle Whichever way he looked he had no comfort D the fellow he said almost out loud in the cab but though he did with his outward voice allude to Eames the curse in his inner thoughts was uttered against himself Johnny was allowed to make his way down to the platform and there find his own carpet bag One young porter however came up and fraternized with him You guve it him tidy just at that last moment sir But laws sir you should have let out at him at fust What s the use of clawing a man s neck collar It was then a quarter past eleven but nevertheless Eames appeared at his office precisely at twelve CHAPTER XXXV VAE VICTIS Crosbie had two engagements for that day one being his natural engagement to do his work at his office and the other an engagement which was now very often becoming as natural to dine at saint John s Wood with Lady Amelia Gazebee It was manifest to him when he looked at himself in the glass that he could keep neither of these engagements Oh laws mister Crosbie the woman of the house exclaimed when she saw him Yes I know said he I ve had an accident and got a black eye What s a good thing for it Oh an accident said the woman who knew well that that mark had been made by another man s fist They do say that a bit of raw beef is about the best thing But then it must be held on constant all the morning Anything would be better than leeches which tell long enduring tales and therefore Crosbie sat through the greater part of the morning holding the raw beef to his eye But it was necessary that he should write two notes as he held it one to mister Butterwell at his office and the other to his future sister in law He felt that it would hardly be wise to attempt any entire concealment of the nature of his catastrophe as some of the circumstances would assuredly become known If he said that he had fallen over the coal scuttle or on to the fender thereby cutting his face people would learn that he had fibbed and would learn also that he had had some reason for fibbing Therefore he constructed his notes with a phraseology that bound him to no details To Butterwell he said that he had had an accident or rather a row and that he had come out of it with considerable damage to his frontispiece He intended to be at the office on the next day whether able to appear decently there or not But for the sake of decency he thought it well to give himself that one half day s chance Then to the Lady Amelia he also said that he had had an accident and had been a little hurt It is nothing at all serious and affects only my appearance so that I had better remain in for a day I shall certainly be with you on Sunday Don t let Gazebee trouble himself to come to me as I shan t be at home after to day Gazebee did trouble himself to come to Mount Street so often and South Audley Street in which was mister Gazebee s office was so disagreeably near to Mount Street that Crosbie inserted this in order to protect himself if possible Then he gave special orders that he was to be at home to no one fearing that Gazebee would call for him after the hours of business to make him safe and carry him off bodily to saint John s Wood The beefsteak and the dose of physic and the cold water application which was kept upon it all night was not efficacious in dispelling that horrid black blue colour by ten o clock on the following morning It certainly have gone down mister Crosbie it certainly have said the mistress of the lodgings touching the part affected with her finger But the black won t go out of them all in a minute it won t indeed Couldn t you just stay in one more day But will one day do it missus Phillips missus Phillips couldn t take upon herself to say that it would They mostly come with little red streaks across the black before they goes away said missus Phillips who would seem to have been the wife of a prize fighter so well was she acquainted with black eyes And that won t be till to morrow said Crosbie affecting to be mirthful in his agony Not till the third day and then they wears themselves out gradual I never knew leeches do any good He stayed at home the second day and then resolved that he would go to his office black eye and all In that morning s newspaper he saw an account of the whole transaction saying how mister C of the office of General Committees who was soon about to lead to the hymeneal altar the beautiful daughter of the Earl De C had been made the subject of a brutal personal attack on the platform of the Great Western Railway Station and how he was confined to his room from the injuries which he had received The paragraph went on to state that the delinquent had as it was believed dared to raise his eyes to the same lady and that his audacity had been treated with scorn by every member of the noble family in question It was however satisfactory to know so said the newspaper that mister C had amply avenged himself and had so flogged the young man in question that he had been unable to stir from his bed since the occurrence On reading this Crosbie felt that it would be better that he should show himself at once and tell as much of the truth as the world would be likely to ascertain at last without his telling So on that third morning he put on his hat and gloves and had himself taken to his office though the red streaky period of his misfortune had hardly even yet come upon him The task of walking along the office passage through the messengers lobby and into his room was very disagreeable Of course everybody looked at him and of course he failed in his attempt to appear as though he did not mind it Boggs he said to one of the men as he passed by just see if mister Butterwell is in his room and then as he expected mister Butterwell came to him after the expiration of a few minutes Upon my word that is serious said mister Butterwell looking into the secretary s damaged face I don t think I would have come out if I had been you Of course it s disagreeable said Crosbie but it s better to put up with it Fellows do tell such horrid lies if a man isn t seen for a day or two I believe it s best to put a good face upon it That s more than you can do just at present eh Crosbie And then mister Butterwell tittered But how on earth did it happen The paper says that you pretty well killed the fellow who did it The paper lies as papers always do I didn t touch him at all Didn t you though I should like to have had a poke at him after getting such a tap in the face as that The policemen came and all that sort of thing One isn t allowed to fight it out in a row of that kind as one would have to do on Salisbury heath Not that I mean to say that I could lick the fellow How s a man to know whether he can or not How indeed unless he gets a licking or gives it But who was he and what s this about his having been scorned by the noble family Trash and lies of course He had never seen any of the De Courcy people I suppose the truth is it was about that other eh Crosbie I knew you d find yourself in some trouble before you d done I don t know what it was about or why he should have made such a brute of himself You have heard about those people at Allington Oh yes I have heard about them God knows I didn t mean to say anything against them They knew nothing about it But the young fellow knew them Ah yes I see all about it He wants to step into your shoes I can t say that he sets about it in a bad way But what do you mean to do Nothing Nothing Won t that look queer I think I should have him before the magistrates You see Butterwell I am bound to spare that girl s name I know I have behaved badly Well yes I fear you have mister Butterwell said this with some considerable amount of decision in his voice as though he did not intend to mince matters or in any way to hide his opinion Crosbie had got into a way of condemning himself in this matter of his marriage but was very anxious that others on hearing such condemnation from him should say something in the way of palliating his fault It would be so easy for a friend to remark that such little peccadilloes were not altogether uncommon and that it would sometimes happen in life that people did not know their own minds He had hoped for some such benevolence from Fowler Pratt but had hoped in vain Butterwell was a good natured easy man anxious to stand well with all about him never pretending to any very high tone of feeling or of morals and yet Butterwell would say no word of comfort to him He could get no one to slur over his sin for him as though it were no sin only an unfortunate mistake no one but the De Courcys who had as it were taken possession of him and swallowed him alive It can t be helped now said Crosbie But as for that fellow who made such a brutal attack on me the other morning he knows that he is safe behind her petticoats I can do nothing which would not make some mention of her name necessary Ah yes I see said Butterwell It s very unfortunate very I don t know that I can do anything for you Will you come before the Board to day Yes of course I shall said Crosbie who was becoming very sore His sharp ear had told him that all Butterwell s respect and cordiality were gone at any rate for the time Butterwell though holding the higher official rank had always been accustomed to treat him as though he the inferior were to be courted He had possessed and had known himself to possess in his office as well as in the outside world a sort of rank much higher than that which from his position he could claim legitimately Now he was being deposed There could be no better touchstone in such a matter than Butterwell He would go as the world went but he would perceive almost intuitively how the world intended to go Tact tact tact as he was in the habit of saying to himself when walking along the paths of his Putney villa Crosbie was now secretary whereas a few months before he had been simply a clerk but nevertheless mister Butterwell s instinct told him that Crosbie had fallen Therefore he declined to offer any sympathy to the man in his misfortune and felt aware as he left the secretary s room that it might probably be some time before he visited it again Crosbie resolved in his soreness that henceforth he would brazen it out He would go to the Board with as much indifference as to his black eye as he was able to assume and if any one said aught to him he would be ready with his answer He would go to his club and let him who intended to show him any slight beware of him in his wrath He could not turn upon John Eames but he could turn upon others if it were necessary He had not gained for himself a position before the world and held it now for some years to allow himself to be crushed at once because he had made a mistake If the world his world chose to go to war with him he would be ready for the fight As for Butterwell Butterwell the incompetent Butterwell the vapid for Butterwell who in every little official difficulty had for years past come to him he would let Butterwell know what it was to be thus disloyal to one who had condescended to be his friend He would show them all at the Board that he scorned them and could be their master Then too as he was making some other resolves as to his future conduct he made one or two resolutions respecting the De Courcy people He would make it known to them that he was not going to be their very humble servant He would speak out his mind with considerable plainness and if upon that they should choose to break off this alliance they might do so he would not break his heart And as he leaned back in his arm chair thinking of all this an idea made its way into his brain a floating castle in the air rather than the image of a thing that might by possibility be realized and in this castle in the air he saw himself kneeling again at Lily s feet asking her pardon and begging that he might once more be taken to her heart mister Crosbie is here to day said mister Butterwell to mister Optimist Oh indeed said mister Optimist very gravely for he had heard all about the row at the railway station They ve made a monstrous show of him I am very sorry to hear it It s so so so If it were one of the younger clerks you know we should tell him that it was discreditable to the department If a man gets a blow in the eye he can t help it you know He didn t do it himself I suppose said Major Fiasco I am well aware that he didn t do it himself continued mister Optimist but I really think that in his position he should have kept himself out of any such encounter He would have done so if he could with all his heart said the major I don t suppose he liked being thrashed any better than I should Nobody gives me a black eye said mister Optimist Nobody has as yet said the major I hope they never will said mister Butterwell Then the hour for their meeting having come round mister Crosbie came into the Board room We have been very sorry to hear of this misfortune said mister Optimist very gravely Not half so sorry as I have been said Crosbie with a laugh It s an uncommon nuisance to have a black eye and to go about looking like a prize fighter And like a prize fighter that didn t win his battle too said Fiasco I don t know that there s much difference as to that said Crosbie But the whole thing is a nuisance and if you please we won t say anything more about it mister Optimist almost entertained an opinion that it was his duty to say something more about it Was not he the chief Commissioner and was not mister Crosbie secretary to the Board Ought he looking at their respective positions to pass over without a word of notice such a manifest impropriety as this Would not Sir Raffle Buffle have said something had mister Butterwell when secretary come to the office with a black eye He wished to exercise all the full rights of a chairman but nevertheless as he looked at the secretary he felt embarrassed and was unable to find the proper words H m ha well we ll go to business now if you please he said as though reserving to himself the right of returning to the secretary s black eye when the more usual business of the Board should be completed But when the more usual business of the Board had been completed the secretary left the room without any further reference to his eye Crosbie when he got back to his own apartment found Mortimer Gazebee waiting there for him My dear fellow said Gazebee this is a very nasty affair Uncommonly nasty said Crosbie so nasty that I don t mean to talk about it to anybody Lady Amelia is quite unhappy He always called her Lady Amelia even when speaking of her to his own brothers and sisters He was too well behaved to take the liberty of calling an earl s daughter by her plain Christian name even though that earl s daughter was his own wife She fears that you have been a good deal hurt Not at all hurt but disfigured as you see And so you beat the fellow well that did it No I didn t said Crosbie very angrily I didn t beat him at all You don t believe everything you read in the newspapers do you No I don t believe everything Of course I didn t believe about his having aspired to an alliance with Lady Alexandrina That was untrue of course mister Gazebee showed by the tone of his voice that imprudence so unparalleled as that was quite incredible You shouldn t believe anything except this that I have got a black eye You certainly have got that Lady Amelia thinks you would be more comfortable if you would come up to us this evening You can t go out of course but Lady Amelia said very good naturedly that you need not mind with her Thank you no I ll come on Sunday Of course Lady Alexandrina will be very anxious to hear from her sister and Lady Amelia begged me very particularly to press you to come Thank you no not to day Why not Oh simply because I shall be better at home How can you be better at home You can have anything that you want Lady Amelia won t mind you know Another beefsteak to his eye as he sat in the drawing room a cold water bandage or any little medical appliance of that sort these were the things which Lady Amelia would in her domestic good nature condescend not to mind I won t trouble her this evening said Crosbie Well upon my word I think you re wrong All manner of stories will get down to Courcy Castle and to the countess s ears and you don t know what harm may come of it Lady Amelia thinks she had better write and explain it but she can t do so till she has heard something about it from you Look here Gazebee I don t care one straw what story finds its way down to Courcy Castle But if the earl were to hear anything and be offended He may recover from his offence as he best likes My dear fellow that s talking wildly you know What on earth do you suppose the earl can do to me Do you think I m going to live in fear of Lord De Courcy all my life because I m going to marry his daughter I shall write to Alexandrina myself to day and you can tell her sister so I ll be up to dinner on Sunday unless my face makes it altogether out of the question And you won t come in time for church Would you have me go to church with such a face as this Then mister Mortimer Gazebee went and when he got home he told his wife that Crosbie was taking things with a high hand The fact is my dear that he s ashamed of himself and therefore tries to put a bold face upon it It was very foolish of him throwing himself in the way of that young man very and so I shall tell him on Sunday If he chooses to give himself airs to me I shall make him understand that he is very wrong He should remember now that the way in which he conducts himself is a matter of moment to all our family Of course he should said mister Gazebee When the Sunday came the red streaky period had arrived but had by no means as yet passed away The men at the office had almost become used to it but Crosbie in spite of his determination to go down to the club had not yet shown himself elsewhere Of course he did not go to church but at five he made his appearance at the house in saint John s Wood They always dined at five on Sundays having some idea that by doing so they kept the Sabbath better than they would have done had they dined at seven If keeping the Sabbath consists in going to bed early or is in any way assisted by such a practice they were right To the cook that semi early dinner might perhaps be convenient as it gave her an excuse for not going to church in the afternoon as the servants and children s dinner gave her a similar excuse in the morning Such little attempts at goodness proceeding half the way or perhaps as in this instance one quarter of the way on the disagreeable path towards goodness are very common with respectable people such as Lady Amelia If she would have dined at one o clock and have eaten cold meat one perhaps might have felt that she was entitled to some praise Dear dear dear this is very sad isn t it Adolphus she said on first seeing him Well it is sad Amelia he said He always called her Amelia because she called him Adolphus but Gazebee himself was never quite pleased when he heard it Lady Amelia was older than Crosbie and entitled to call him anything she liked but he should have remembered the great difference in their rank It is sad Amelia he said But will you oblige me in one thing What thing Adolphus Not to say a word more about it The black eye is a bad thing no doubt and has troubled me much but the sympathy of my friends has troubled me a great deal more I had all the family commiseration from Gazebee on Friday and if it is repeated again I shall lie down and die Shall oo die uncle Dolphus cause oo ve got a bad eye asked De Courcy Gazebee the eldest hope of the family looking up into his face No my hero said Crosbie taking the boy up into his arms not because I ve got a black eye There isn t very much harm in that and you ll have a great many before you leave school But because the people will go on talking about it But aunt Dina on t like oo if oo ve got an ugly bad eye But Adolphus said Lady Amelia settling herself for an argument that s all very well you know and I m sure I m very sorry to cause you any annoyance but really one doesn t know how to pass over such a thing without speaking of it I have had a letter from mamma I hope Lady De Courcy is quite well Quite well thank you But as a matter of course she is very anxious about this affair She had read what has been said in the newspapers and it may be necessary that Mortimer should take it up as the family solicitor Quite out of the question said Adolphus I don t think I should advise any such step as that said Gazebee Perhaps not very likely not But you cannot be surprised Mortimer that my mother under such circumstances should wish to know what are the facts of the case Not at all surprised said Gazebee Then once for all I ll tell you the facts As I got out of the train a man I d seen once before in my life made an attack upon me and before the police came up I got a blow in the face Now you know all about it At that moment dinner was announced Will you give Lady Amelia your arm said the husband It s a very sad occurrence said Lady Amelia with a slight toss of her head and I m afraid will cost my sister a great deal of vexation You agree with De Courcy do you that aunt Dina won t like me with an ugly black eye I really don t think it s a joking matter said the Lady Amelia And then there was nothing more said about it during the dinner There was nothing more said about it during the dinner but it was plain enough from Lady Amelia s countenance that she was not very well pleased with her future brother in law s conduct She was very hospitable to him pressing him to eat but even in doing that she made repeated little references to his present unfortunate state She told him that she did not think fried plum pudding would be bad for him but that she would recommend him not to drink port wine after dinner By the by Mortimer you d better have some claret up she remarked Adolphus shouldn t take anything that is heating Thank you said Crosbie I ll have some brandy and water if Gazebee will give it me Brandy and water said Lady Amelia Crosbie in truth was not given to the drinking of brandy and water but he was prepared to call for raw gin if he were driven much further by Lady Amelia s solicitude At these Sunday dinners the mistress of the house never went away into the drawing room and the tea was always brought into them at the table on which they had dined It was another little step towards keeping holy the first day of the week When Lady Rosina was there she was indulged with the sight of six or seven solid good books which were laid upon the mahogany as soon as the bottles were taken off it At her first prolonged visit she had obtained for herself the privilege of reading a sermon but as on such occasions both Lady Amelia and mister Gazebee would go to sleep and as the footman had also once shown a tendency that way the sermon had been abandoned But the master of the house on these evenings when his sister in law was present was doomed to sit in idleness or else to find solace in one of the solid good books But Lady Rosina just now was in the country and therefore the table was left unfurnished And what am I to say to my mother said Lady Amelia when they were alone Give her my kindest regards said Crosbie It was quite clear both to the husband and to the wife that he was preparing himself for rebellion against authority For some ten minutes there was nothing said Crosbie amused himself by playing with the boy whom he called Dicksey by way of a nickname for De Courcy Mamma he calls me Dicksey Am I Dicksey I ll call oo old Cross and then aunt Dina on t like oo I wish you would not call the child nicknames Adolphus It seems as though you would wish to cast a slur upon the one which he bears I should hardly think that he would feel disposed to do that said mister Gazebee Hardly indeed said Crosbie It has never yet been disgraced in the annals of our country by being made into a nickname said the proud daughter of the house She was probably unaware that among many of his associates her father had been called Lord De Curse ye from the occasional energy of his language And any such attempt is painful in my ears I think something of my family I can assure you Adolphus and so does my husband A very great deal said mister Gazebee So do I of mine said Crosbie That s natural to all of us One of my ancestors came over with William the Conqueror I think he was one of the assistant cooks in the king s tent A cook said young De Courcy Yes my boy a cook That was the way most of our old families were made noble They were cooks or butlers to the kings or sometimes something worse But your family isn t noble No I ll tell you how that was The king wanted this cook to poison half a dozen of his officers who wished to have a way of their own but the cook said No my Lord King I am a cook not an executioner So they sent him into the scullery and when they called all the other servants barons and lords they only called him Cookey They ve changed the name to Crosbie since that by degrees mister Gazebee was awestruck and the face of the Lady Amelia became very dark Was it not evident that this snake when taken into their innermost bosoms that they might there warm him was becoming an adder and preparing to sting them There was very little more conversation that evening and soon after the story of the cook Crosbie got up and went away to his own home CHAPTER XXXVI SEE THE CONQUERING HERO COMES John Eames had reached his office precisely at twelve o clock but when he did so he hardly knew whether he was standing on his heels or his head The whole morning had been to him one of intense excitement and latterly to a certain extent one of triumph But he did not at all know what might be the results Would he be taken before a magistrate and locked up Would there be a row at the office Would Crosbie call him out and if so would it be incumbent on him to fight a duel with pistols What would Lord De Guest say Lord De Guest who had specially warned him not to take upon himself the duty of avenging Lily s wrongs What would all the Dale family say of his conduct And above all what would Lily say and think Nevertheless the feeling of triumph was predominant and now at this interval of time he was beginning to remember with pleasure the sensation of his fist as it went into Crosbie s eye During his first day at the office he heard nothing about the affair nor did he say a word of it to any one It was known in his room that he had gone down to spend his Christmas holiday with Lord De Guest and he was treated with some increased consideration accordingly And moreover I must explain in order that I may give Johnny Eames his due he was gradually acquiring for himself a good footing among the Income tax officials He knew his work and did it with some manly confidence in his own powers and also with some manly indifference to the occasional frowns of the mighty men of the department He was moreover popular being somewhat of a radical in his official demeanour and holding by his own rights even though mighty men should frown In truth he was emerging from his hobbledehoyhood and entering upon his young manhood having probably to go through much folly and some false sentiment in that period of his existence but still with fair promise of true manliness beyond to those who were able to read the signs of his character Many questions on that first day were asked him about the glories of his Christmas but he had very little to say on the subject Indeed nothing could have been much more commonplace than his Christmas visit had it not been for the one great object which had taken him down to that part of the country and for the circumstance with which his holiday had been ended On neither of these subjects was he disposed to speak openly but as he walked home to Burton Crescent with Cradell he did tell him of the affair with Crosbie And you went in at him on the station asked Cradell with admiring doubt ILLUSTRATION And you went in at him on the station Yes I did If I didn t do it there where was I to do it I d said I would and therefore when I saw him I did it Then the whole affair was told as to the black eye the police and the superintendent And what s to come next asked our hero Well he ll put it in the hands of a friend of course as I did with Fisher in that affair with Lupex And upon my word Johnny I shall have to do something of the kind again His conduct last night was outrageous would you believe it Oh he s a fool He s a fool you wouldn t like to meet when he s in one of his mad fits I can tell you that I absolutely had to sit up in my own bedroom all last night Mother Roper told me that if I remained in the drawing room she would feel herself obliged to have a policeman in the house What could I do you know I made her have a fire for me of course And then you went to bed I waited ever so long because I thought that Maria would want to see me At last she sent me a note Maria is so imprudent you know If he had found anything in her writing it would have been terrible you know quite terrible And who can say whether Jemima mayn t tell And what did she say Come that s tellings Master Johnny I took very good care to take it with me to the office this morning for fear of accidents But Eames was not so widely awake to the importance of his friend s adventures as he might have been had he not been weighted with adventures of his own I shouldn t care so much said he about that fellow Crosbie going to a friend as I should about his going to a police magistrate He ll put it in a friend s hands of course said Cradell with the air of a man who from experience was well up in such matters And I suppose you ll naturally come to me It s a deuced bore to a man in a public office and all that kind of thing of course But I m not the man to desert my friend I ll stand by you Johnny my boy Oh thank you said Eames I don t think that I shall want that You must be ready with a friend you know I should write down to a man I know in the country and ask his advice said Eames an older sort of friend you know By Jove old fellow take care what you re about Don t let them say of you that you show the white feather Upon my honour I d sooner have anything said of me than that I would indeed anything I m not afraid of that said Eames with a touch of scorn in his voice There isn t much thought about white feathers now a days not in the way of fighting duels After that Cradell managed to carry back the conversation to missus Lupex and his own peculiar position and as Eames did not care to ask from his companion further advice in his own matters he listened nearly in silence till they reached Burton Crescent I hope you found the noble earl well said missus Roper to him as soon as they were all seated at dinner I found the noble earl pretty well thank you said Johnny It had become plainly understood by all the Roperites that Eames s position was quite altered since he had been honoured with the friendship of Lord De Guest missus Lupex next to whom he always sat at dinner with a view to protecting her as it were from the dangerous neighbourhood of Cradell treated him with a marked courtesy Miss Spruce always called him sir missus Roper helped him the first of the gentlemen and was mindful about his fat and gravy and Amelia felt less able than she was before to insist upon the possession of his heart and affections It must not be supposed that Amelia intended to abandon the fight and allow the enemy to walk off with his forces but she felt herself constrained to treat him with a deference that was hardly compatible with the perfect equality which should attend any union of hearts It is such a privilege to be on visiting terms with the nobility said missus Lupex When I was a girl I used to be very intimate You ain t a girl any longer and so you d better not talk about it said Lupex mister Lupex had been at that little shop in Drury Lane after he came down from his scene painting My dear you needn t be a brute to me before all missus Roper s company If led away by feelings which I will not now describe I left my proper circles in marrying you you need not before all the world teach me how much I have to regret And missus Lupex putting down her knife and fork applied her handkerchief to her eyes That s pleasant for a man over his meals isn t it said Lupex appealing to Miss Spruce I have plenty of that kind of thing and you can t think how I like it Them whom God has joined together let no man put asunder said Miss Spruce As for me myself I m only an old woman This little ebullition threw a gloom over the dinner table and nothing more was said on the occasion as to the glories of Eames s career But in the course of the evening Amelia heard of the encounter which had taken place at the railway station and at once perceived that she might use the occasion for her own purposes John she whispered to her victim finding an opportunity for coming upon him when almost alone what is this I hear I insist upon knowing Are you going to fight a duel Nonsense said Johnny But it is not nonsense You don t know what my feelings will be if I think that such a thing is going to happen But then you are so hard hearted I ain t hard hearted a bit and I m not going to fight a duel But is it true that you beat mister Crosbie at the station It is true I did beat him Oh John not that I mean to say you were wrong and indeed I honour you for the feeling There can be nothing so dreadful as a young man s deceiving a young woman and leaving her after he has won her heart particularly when she has had his promise in plain words or perhaps even in black and white John thought of that horrid foolish wretched note which he had written And a poor girl if she can t right herself by a breach of promise doesn t know what to do Does she John A girl who d right herself that way wouldn t be worth having I don t know about that When a poor girl is in such a position she has to be aided by her friends I suppose then Miss Lily Dale won t bring a breach of promise against him This mention of Lily s name in such a place was sacrilege in the ears of poor Eames I cannot tell said he what may be the intention of the lady of whom you speak But from what I know of her friends I should not think that she will be disgraced by such a proceeding That may be all very well for Miss Lily Dale Amelia said and then she hesitated It would not be well she thought absolutely to threaten him as yet not as long as there was any possibility that he might be won without a threat Of course I know all about it she continued She was your L D you know Not that I was ever jealous of her To you she was no more than one of childhood s friends Was she Johnny He stamped his foot upon the floor and then jumped up from his seat I hate all that sort of twaddle about childhood s friends and you know I do You ll make me swear that I ll never come into this room again Johnny So I will The whole thing makes me sick And as for that missus Lupex If this is what you learn John by going to a lord s house I think you had better stay at home with your own friends Of course I had much better stay at home with my own friends Here s missus Lupex and at any rate I can t stand her So he went off and walked round the Crescent and down to the New Road and almost into the Regent s Park thinking of Lily Dale and of his own cowardice with Amelia Roper On the following morning he received a message at about one o clock by the mouth of the Board room messenger informing him that his presence was required in the Board room Sir Raffle Buffle has desired your presence mister Eames My presence Tupper what for said Johnny turning upon the messenger almost with dismay Indeed I can t say mister Eames but Sir Raffle Buffle has desired your presence in the Board room Such a message as that in official life always strikes awe into the heart of a young man And yet young men generally come forth from such interviews without having received any serious damage and generally talk about the old gentlemen whom they have encountered with a good deal of light spirited sarcasm or chaff as it is called in the slang phraseology of the day It is that same majesty which doth hedge a king that does it The turkey cock in his own farmyard is master of the occasion and the thought of him creates fear A bishop in his lawn a judge on the bench a chairman in the big room at the end of a long table or a policeman with his bull s eye lamp upon his beat can all make themselves terrible by means of those appanages of majesty which have been vouchsafed to them But how mean is the policeman in his own home and how few thought much of Sir Raffle Buffle as he sat asleep after dinner in his old slippers How well can I remember the terror created within me by the air of outraged dignity with which a certain fine old gentleman now long since gone could rub his hands slowly one on the other and look up to the ceiling slightly shaking his head as though lost in the contemplation of my iniquities I would become sick in my stomach and feel as though my ankles had been broken That upward turn of the eye unmanned me so completely that I was speechless as regarded any defence I think that that old man could hardly have known the extent of his own power Once upon a time a careless lad having the charge of a bundle of letters addressed to the King petitions and such like which in the course of business would not get beyond the hands of some lord in waiting s deputy assistant sent the bag which contained them to the wrong place to Windsor perhaps if the Court were in London or to saint James s if it were at Windsor He was summoned and the great man of the occasion contented himself with holding his hands up to the heavens as he stood up from his chair and exclaiming twice Mis sent the Monarch s pouch Mis sent the Monarch s pouch That young man never knew how he escaped from the Board room but for a time he was deprived of all power of exertion and could not resume his work till he had had six months leave of absence and been brought round upon rum and asses milk In that instance the peculiar use of the word Monarch had a power which the official magnate had never contemplated The story is traditional but I believe that the circumstance happened as lately as in the days of George the Third John Eames could laugh at the present chairman of the Income tax Office with great freedom and call him old Huffle Scuffle and the like but now that he was sent for he also in spite of his radical propensities felt a little weak about his ankle joints He knew from the first hearing of the message that he was wanted with reference to that affair at the railway station Perhaps there might be a rule that any clerk should be dismissed who used his fists in any public place There were many rules entailing the punishment of dismissal for many offences and he began to think that he did remember something of such a regulation However he got up looked once around him upon his friends and then followed Tupper into the Board room There s Johnny been sent for by old Scuffles said one clerk That s about his row with Crosbie said another The Board can t do anything to him for that Can t it said the first Didn t young Outonites have to resign because of that row at the Cider Cellars though his cousin Sir Constant Outonites did all that he could for him But he was regularly up the spout with accommodation bills I tell you that I wouldn t be in Eames s shoes for a trifle Crosbie is secretary at the Committee Office where Scuffles was chairman before he came here and of course they re as thick as thieves I shouldn t wonder if they didn t make him go down and apologize Johnny won t do that said the other In the meantime John Eames was standing in the august presence Sir Raffle Buffle was throned in his great oak arm chair at the head of a long table in a very large room and by him at the corner of the table was seated one of the assistant secretaries of the office Another member of the Board was also at work upon the long table but he was reading and signing papers at some distance from Sir Raffle and paid no heed whatever to the scene The assistant secretary looking on could see that Sir Raffle was annoyed by this want of attention on the part of his colleague but all this was lost upon Eames mister Eames said Sir Raffle speaking with a peculiarly harsh voice and looking at the culprit through a pair of gold rimmed glasses which he perched for the occasion upon his big nose Isn t that mister Eames Yes said the assistant secretary this is Eames Ah and then there was a pause Come a little nearer mister Eames will you and Johnny drew nearer advancing noiselessly over the Turkey carpet Let me see in the second class isn t he Ah Do you know mister Eames that I have received a letter from the secretary to the Directors of the Great Western Railway Company detailing circumstances which if truly stated in that letter redound very much to your discredit I did get into a row there yesterday sir Got into a row It seems to me that you have got into a very serious row and that I must tell the Directors of the Great Western Railway Company that the law must be allowed to take its course I shan t mind that sir in the least said Eames brightening up a little under this view of the case Not mind that sir said Sir Raffle or rather he shouted out the words at the offender before him I am inclined to think that he overdid it missing the effect which a milder tone might have attained Perhaps there was lacking to him some of that majesty of demeanour and dramatic propriety of voice which had been so efficacious in the little story as to the King s bag of letters As it was Johnny gave a slight jump but after his jump he felt better than he had been before Not mind sir being dragged before the criminal tribunals of your country and being punished as a felon or rather as a misdemeanour for an outrage committed on a public platform Not mind it What do you mean sir I mean that I don t think the magistrate would say very much about it sir And I don t think mister Crosbie would come forward But mister Crosbie must come forward young man Do you suppose that an outrage against the peace of the Metropolis is to go unpunished because he may not wish to pursue the matter I m afraid you must be very ignorant young man Perhaps I am said Johnny Very ignorant indeed very ignorant indeed And are you aware sir that it would become a question with the Commissioners of this Board whether you could be retained in the service of this department if you were publicly punished by a police magistrate for such a disgraceful outrage as that Johnny looked round at the other Commissioner but that gentleman did not raise his face from his papers mister Eames is a very good clerk whispered the assistant secretary but in a voice which made his words audible to Eames one of the best young men we have he added in a voice which was not audible Oh ah very well Now I ll tell you what mister Eames I hope this will be a lesson to you a very serious lesson The assistant secretary leaning back in his chair so as to be a little behind the head of Sir Raffle did manage to catch the eye of the other Commissioner The other Commissioner barely looking round smiled a little and then the assistant secretary smiled also Eames saw this and he smiled too Whether any ulterior consequences may still await the breach of the peace of which you have been guilty I am not yet prepared to say continued Sir Raffle You may go now And Johnny returned to his own place with no increased reverence for the dignity of the chairman On the following morning one of his colleagues showed him with great glee the passage in the newspaper which informed the world that he had been so desperately beaten by Crosbie that he was obliged to keep his bed at this present time in consequence of the flogging that he had received Then his anger was aroused and he bounced about the big room of the Income tax Office regardless of assistant secretaries head clerks and all other official grandees whatsoever denouncing the iniquities of the public press and declaring his opinion that it would be better to live in Russia than in a country which allowed such audacious falsehoods to be propagated He never touched me Fisher I don t think he ever tried but upon my honour he never touched me But Johnny it was bold in you to make up to Lord De Courcy s daughter said Fisher I never saw one of them in my life He s going it altogether among the aristocracy now said another I suppose you wouldn t look at anybody under a viscount Can I help what that thief of an editor puts into his paper Flogged Huffle Scuffle told me I was a felon but that wasn t half so bad as this fellow and Johnny kicked the newspaper across the room Indict him for a libel said Fisher Particularly for saying you wanted to marry a countess s daughter said another clerk I never heard such a scandal in my life declared a third and then to say that the girl wouldn t look at you But not the less was it felt by all in the office that Johnny Eames was becoming a leading man among them and that he was one with whom each of them would be pleased to be intimate And even among the grandees this affair of the railway station did him no real harm It was known that Crosbie had deserved to be thrashed and known that Eames had thrashed him It was all very well for Sir Raffle Buffle to talk of police magistrates and misdemeanours but all the world at the Income tax Office knew very well that Eames had come out from that affair with his head upright and his right foot foremost Never mind about the newspaper a thoughtful old senior clerk said to him As he did get the licking and you didn t you can afford to laugh at the newspaper And you wouldn t write to the editor No no certainly not No one thinks of defending himself to a newspaper except an ass unless it be some fellow who wants to have his name puffed You may write what s as true as the gospel but they ll know how to make fun of it Johnny therefore gave up his idea of an indignant letter to the editor but he felt that he was bound to give some explanation of the whole matter to Lord De Guest The affair had happened as he was coming from the earl s house and all his own concerns had now been made so much a matter of interest to his kind friend that he thought that he could not with propriety leave the earl to learn from the newspapers either the facts or the falsehoods And therefore before he left his office he wrote the following letter Income tax Office December twenty nine one hundred eighty six MY LORD He thought a good deal about the style in which he ought to address the peer never having hitherto written to him He began My dear Lord on one sheet of paper and then put it aside thinking that it looked over bold MY LORD As you have been so very kind to me I feel that I ought to tell you what happened the other morning at the railway station as I was coming back from Guestwick That scoundrel Crosbie got into the same carriage with me at the Barchester Junction and sat opposite to me all the way up to London I did not speak a word to him or he to me but when he got out at the Paddington Station I thought I ought not to let him go away so I I can t say that I thrashed him as I wished to do but I made an attempt and I did give him a black eye A whole quantity of policemen got round us and I hadn t a fair chance I know you will think that I was wrong and perhaps I was but what could I do when he sat opposite to me there for two hours looking as though he thought himself the finest fellow in all London They ve put a horrible paragraph into one of the newspapers saying that I got so flogged that I haven t been able to stir since It is an atrocious falsehood as is all the rest of the newspaper account I was not touched He was not nearly so bad a customer as the bull and seemed to take it all very quietly I must acknowledge though that he didn t get such a beating as he deserved Your friend Sir R B sent for me this morning and told me I was a felon I didn t seem to care much for that for he might as well have called me a murderer or a burglar but I shall care very much indeed if I have made you angry with me But what I most fear is the anger of some one else at Allington Believe me to be my Lord Yours very much obliged and most sincerely JOHN EAMES I knew he d do it if ever he got the opportunity said the earl when he had read his letter and he walked about his room striking his hands together and then thrusting his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets I knew he was made of the right stuff and the earl rejoiced greatly in the prowess of his favourite I d have done it myself if I d seen him I do believe I would Then he went back to the breakfast room and told Lady Julia What do you think said he Johnny Eames has come across Crosbie and given him a desperate beating No said Lady Julia putting down her newspaper and spectacles and expressing by the light of her eyes anything but Christian horror at the wickedness of the deed But he has though I knew he would if he saw him Beaten him Actually beaten him Sent him home to Lady Alexandrina with two black eyes Two black eyes What a young pickle But did he get hurt himself Not a scratch he says And what ll they do to him Nothing Crosbie won t be fool enough to do anything A man becomes an outlaw when he plays such a game as he has played Anybody s hand may be raised against him with impunity He can t show his face you know He can t come forward and answer questions as to what he has done There are offences which the law can t touch but which outrage public feeling so strongly that any one may take upon himself the duty of punishing them He has been thrashed and that will stick to him till he dies Do tell Johnny from me that I hope he didn t get hurt said Lady Julia The old lady could not absolutely congratulate him on his feat of arms but she did the next thing to it But the earl did congratulate him with a full open assurance of his approval I hope he said I should have done the same at your age under similar circumstances and I m very glad that he proved less difficult than the bull I m quite sure you didn t want any one to help you with Master Crosbie As for that other person at Allington if I understand such matters at all I think she will forgive you It may however be a question whether the earl did understand such matters at all And then he added in a postscript When you write to me again and don t be long first begin your letter My dear Lord De Guest that is the proper way CHAPTER XXXVII AN OLD MAN S COMPLAINT ILLUSTRATION untitled Have you been thinking again of what I was saying to you Bell Bernard said to his cousin one morning Thinking of it Bernard Why should I think more of it I had hoped that you had forgotten it yourself No he said I am not so easy hearted as that I cannot look on such a thing as I would the purchase of a horse which I could give up without sorrow if I found that the animal was too costly for my purse I did not tell you that I loved you till I was sure of myself and having made myself sure I cannot change at all And yet you would have me change Yes of course I would If your heart be free now it must of course be changed before you come to love any man Such change as that is to be looked for But when you have loved then it will not be easy to change you But I have not Then I have a right to hope I have been hanging on here Bell longer than I ought to have done because I could not bring myself to leave you without speaking of this again I did not wish to seem to you to be importunate If you could only believe me in what I say It is not that I do not believe I am not a puppy or a fool to flatter myself that you must be in love with me I believe you well enough But still it is possible that your mind may alter It is impossible I do not know whether my uncle or your mother have spoken to you about this Such speaking would have no effect In fact her mother had spoken to her but she truly said that such speaking would have no effect If her cousin could not win the battle by his own skill he might have been quite sure looking at her character as it was known to him that he would not be able to win it by the skill of others We have all been made very unhappy he went on to say by this calamity which has fallen on poor Lily And because she has been deceived by the man she did love I am to make matters square by marrying a man I and then she paused Dear Bernard you should not drive me to say words which will sound harsh to you No words can be harsher than those which you have already spoken But Bell at any rate you may listen to me Then he told her how desirable it was with reference to all the concerns of the Dale family that she should endeavour to look favourably on his proposition It would be good for them all he said especially for Lily as to whom at the present moment their uncle felt so kindly He as Bernard pleaded was so anxious at heart for this marriage that he would do anything that was asked of him if he were gratified But if he were not gratified in this he would feel that he had ground for displeasure Bell as she had been desired to listen did listen very patiently But when her cousin had finished her answer was very short Nothing that my uncle can say or think or do can make any difference in this said she You will think nothing then of the happiness of others I would not marry a man I did not love to ensure any amount of happiness to others at least I know I ought not to do so But I do not believe I should ensure any one s happiness by this marriage Certainly not yours After this Bernard had acknowledged to himself that the difficulties in his way were great I will go away till next autumn he said to his uncle If you would give up your profession and remain here she would not be so perverse I cannot do that sir I cannot risk the well being of my life on such a chance Then his uncle had been angry with him as well as with his niece In his anger he determined that he would go again to his sister in law and after some unreasonable fashion he resolved that it would become him to be very angry with her also if she declined to assist him with all her influence as a mother Why should they not both marry he said to himself Lord De Guest s offer as to young Eames had been very generous As he had then declared he had not been able to express his own opinion at once but on thinking over what the earl had said he had found himself very willing to heal the family wound in the manner proposed if any such healing might be possible That however could not be done quite as yet When the time should come and he thought it might come soon perhaps in the spring when the days should be fine and the evenings again long he would be willing to take his share with the earl in establishing that new household To Crosbie he had refused to give anything and there was upon his conscience a shade of remorse in that he had so refused But if Lily could be brought to love this other man he would be more open handed She should have her share as though she was in fact his daughter But then if he intended to do so much for them at the Small House should not they in return do something also for him So thinking he went again to his sister in law determined to explain his views even though it might be at the risk of some hard words between them As regarded himself he did not much care for hard words spoken to him He almost expected that people s words should be hard and painful He did not look for the comfort of affectionate soft greetings and perhaps would not have appreciated them had they come to him He caught missus Dale walking in the garden and brought her into his own room feeling that he had a better chance there than in her own house She with an old dislike to being lectured in that room had endeavoured to avoid the interview but had failed So I met John Eames at the manor he had said to her in the garden Ah yes and how did he get on there I cannot conceive poor Johnny keeping holiday with the earl and his sister How did he behave to them and how did they behave to him I can assure you he was very much at home there Was he indeed Well I hope it will do him good He is I m sure a very good young man only rather awkward I didn t think him awkward at all You ll find Mary that he ll do very well a great deal better than his father did I m sure I hope he may After that missus Dale made her attempt to escape but the squire had taken her prisoner and led her captive into the house Mary he said as soon as he had induced her to sit down it is time that this should be settled between my nephew and niece I am afraid there will be nothing to settle What do you mean that you disapprove of it By no means personally I should approve of it very strongly But that has nothing to do with the question Yes it has I beg your pardon but it must have and should have a great deal to do with it Of course I am not saying that anybody should now ever be compelled to marry anybody I hope not I never said that they ought and never thought so But I do think that the wishes of all her family should have very great weight with a girl that has been well brought up I don t know whether Bell has been well brought up but in such a matter as this nobody s wishes would weigh a feather with her and indeed I could not take upon myself even to express a wish To you I can say that I should have been very happy if she could have regarded her cousin as you wish her to do You mean that you are afraid to tell her so I am afraid to do what I think is wrong if you mean that I don t think it would be wrong and therefore I shall speak to her myself You must do as you like about that mister Dale I can t prevent you I shall think you wrong to harass her on such a matter and I fear also that her answer will not be satisfactory to you If you choose to tell her your opinion you must do so Of course I shall think you wrong that s all missus Dale s voice as she said this was stern enough and so was her countenance She could not forbid the uncle to speak his mind to his niece but she especially disliked the idea of any interference with her daughter The squire got up and walked about the room trying to compose himself that he might answer her rationally but without anger May I go now said missus Dale May you go Of course you may go if you like it If you think that I am intruding upon you in speaking to you of the welfare of your two girls whom I endeavour to regard as my own daughters except in this that I know they have never been taught to love me if you think that it is an interference on my part to show anxiety for their welfare of course you may go I did not mean to say anything to hurt you mister Dale Hurt me What does it signify whether I am hurt or not I have no children of my own and of course my only business in life is to provide for my nephews and nieces I am an old fool if I expect that they are to love me in return and if I venture to express a wish I am interfering and doing wrong It is hard very hard I know well that they have been brought up to dislike me and yet I am endeavouring to do my duty by them mister Dale that accusation has not been deserved They have not been brought up to dislike you I believe that they have both loved and respected you as their uncle but such love and respect will not give you a right to dispose of their hands Who wants to dispose of their hands There are some things in which I think no uncle no parent should interfere and of all such things this is the chief If after that you may choose to tell her your wishes of course you can do so It will not be much good after you have set her against me mister Dale you have no right to say such things to me and you are very unjust in doing so If you think that I have set my girls against you it will be much better that we should leave Allington altogether I have been placed in circumstances which have made it difficult for me to do my duty to my children but I have endeavoured to do it not regarding my own personal wishes I am quite sure however that it would be wrong in me to keep them here if I am to be told by you that I have taught them to regard you unfavourably Indeed I cannot suffer such a thing to be said to me All this missus Dale said with an air of decision and with a voice expressing a sense of injury received which made the squire feel that she was very much in earnest Is it not true he said defending himself that in all that relates to the girls you have ever regarded me with suspicion No it is not true And then she corrected herself feeling that there was something of truth in the squire s last assertion Certainly not with suspicion she said But as this matter has gone so far I will explain what my real feelings have been In worldly matters you can do much for my girls and have done much And wish to do more said the squire I am sure you do But I cannot on that account give up my place as their only living parent They are my children and not yours And even could I bring myself to allow you to act as their guardian and natural protector they would not consent to such an arrangement You cannot call that suspicion I can call it jealousy And should not a mother be jealous of her children s love During all this time the squire was walking up and down the room with his hands in his trousers pockets And when missus Dale had last spoken he continued his walk for some time in silence Perhaps it is well that you should have spoken out he said The manner in which you accused me made it necessary I did not intend to accuse you and I do not do so now but I think that you have been and that you are very hard to me very hard indeed I have endeavoured to make your children and yourself also sharers with me in such prosperity as has been mine I have striven to add to your comfort and to their happiness I am most anxious to secure their future welfare You would have been very wrong had you declined to accept this on their behalf but I think that in return for it you need not have begrudged me the affection and obedience which generally follows from such good offices mister Dale I have begrudged you nothing of this I am hurt I am hurt he continued And she was surprised by his look of pain even more than by the unaccustomed warmth of his words What you have said has I have known been the case all along But though I had felt it to be so I own that I am hurt by your open words Because I have said that my own children must ever be my own Ah you have said more than that You and the girls have been living here close to me for how many years is it now and during all those years there has grown up for me no kindly feeling Do you think that I cannot hear and see and feel Do you suppose that I am a fool and do not know As for yourself you would never enter this house if you did not feel yourself constrained to do so for the sake of appearances I suppose it is all as it should be Having no children of my own I owe the duty of a parent to my nieces but I have no right to expect from them in return either love regard or obedience I know I am keeping you here against your will Mary I won t do so any longer And he made a sign to her that she was to depart As she rose from her seat her heart was softened towards him In these latter days he had shown much kindness to the girls a kindness that was more akin to the gentleness of love than had ever come from him before Lily s fate had seemed to melt even his sternness and he had striven to be tender in his words and ways And now he spoke as though he had loved the girls and had loved them in vain Doubtless he had been a disagreeable neighbour to his sister in law making her feel that it was never for her personally that he had opened his hand Doubtless he had been moved by an unconscious desire to undermine and take upon himself her authority with her own children Doubtless he had looked askance at her from the first day of her marriage with his brother She had been keenly alive to all this since she had first known him and more keenly alive to it than ever since the failure of those efforts she had made to live with him on terms of affection made during the first year or two of her residence at the Small House But nevertheless in spite of all her heart bled for him now She had gained her victory over him having fully held her own position with her children but now that he complained that he had been beaten in the struggle her heart bled for him My brother she said and as she spoke she offered him her hands it may be that we have not thought as kindly of each other as we should have done I have endeavoured said the old man I have endeavoured And then he stopped either hindered by some excess of emotion or unable to find the words which were necessary for the expression of his meaning Let us endeavour once again both of us What begin again at near seventy No Mary there is no more beginning again for me All this shall make no difference to the girls As long as I am here they shall have the house If they marry I will do for them what I can I believe Bernard is much in earnest in his suit and if Bell will listen to him she shall still be welcomed here as mistress of Allington What you have said shall make no difference but as to beginning again it is simply impossible After that missus Dale walked home through the garden by herself He had studiously told her that that house in which they lived should be lent not to her but to her children during his lifetime He had positively declined the offer of her warmer regard He had made her understand that they were to look on each other almost as enemies but that she enemy as she was should still be allowed the use of his munificence because he chose to do his duty by his nieces It will be better for us that we shall leave it she said to herself as she seated herself in her own arm chair over the drawing room fire CHAPTER XXXVIII DOCTOR CROFTS IS CALLED IN missus Dale had not sat long in her drawing room before tidings were brought to her which for a while drew her mind away from that question of her removal Mamma said Bell entering the room I really do believe that Jane has got scarlatina Jane the parlour maid had been ailing for the last two days but nothing serious had hitherto been suspected missus Dale instantly jumped up Who is with her she asked It appeared from Bell s answer that both she and Lily had been with the girl and that Lily was still in the room Whereupon missus Dale ran upstairs and there was on the sudden a commotion in the house In an hour or so the village doctor was there and he expressed an opinion that the girl s ailment was certainly scarlatina missus Dale not satisfied with this sent off a boy to Guestwick for doctor Crofts having herself maintained an opposition of many years standing against the medical reputation of the apothecary and gave a positive order to the two girls not to visit poor Jane again She herself had had scarlatina and might do as she pleased Then too a nurse was hired All this changed for a few hours the current of missus Dale s thoughts but in the evening she went back to the subject of her morning conversation and before the three ladies went to bed they held together an open council of war upon the subject doctor Crofts had been found to be away from Guestwick and word had been sent on his behalf that he would be over at Allington early on the following morning missus Dale had almost made up her mind that the malady of her favourite maid was not scarlatina but had not on that account relaxed her order as to the absence of her daughters from the maid s bedside Let us go at once said Bell who was even more opposed to any domination on the part of her uncle than was her mother In the discussion which had been taking place between them the whole matter of Bernard s courtship had come upon the carpet Bell had kept her cousin s offer to herself as long as she had been able to do so but since her uncle had pressed the subject upon missus Dale it was impossible for Bell to remain silent any longer You do not want me to marry him mamma do you she had said when her mother had spoken with some show of kindness towards Bernard In answer to this missus Dale had protested vehemently that she had no such wish and Lily who still held to her belief in doctor Crofts was almost equally animated To them all the idea that their uncle should in any way interfere in their own views of life on the strength of the pecuniary assistance which they had received from him was peculiarly distasteful But it was especially distasteful that he should presume to have even an opinion as to their disposition in marriage They declared to each other that their uncle could have no right to object to any marriage which either of them might contemplate as long as their mother should approve of it The poor old squire had been right in saying that he was regarded with suspicion He was so regarded The fault had certainly been his own in having endeavoured to win the daughters without thinking it worth his while to win the mother The girls had unconsciously felt that the attempt was made and had vigorously rebelled against it It had not been their fault that they had been brought to live in their uncle s house and made to ride on his ponies and to eat partially of his bread They had so eaten and so lived and declared themselves to be grateful The squire was good in his way and they recognized his goodness but not on that account would they transfer to him one jot of the allegiance which as children they owed to their mother When she told them her tale explaining to them the words which their uncle had spoken that morning they expressed their regret that he should be so grieved but they were strong in assurances to their mother that she had been sinned against and was not sinning Let us go at once said Bell It is much easier said than done my dear Of course it is mamma else we shouldn t be here now What I mean is this let us take some necessary first step at once It is clear that my uncle thinks that our remaining here should give him some right over us I do not say that he is wrong to think so Perhaps it is natural Perhaps in accepting his kindness we ought to submit ourselves to him If that be so it is a conclusive reason for our going Could we not pay him rent for the house said Lily as missus Hearn does You would like to remain here mamma if you could do that But we could not do that Lily We must choose for ourselves a smaller house than this and one that is not burdened with the expense of a garden Even if we paid but a moderate rent for this place we should not have the means of living here Not if we lived on toast and tea said Lily laughing But I should hardly wish you to live upon toast and tea and indeed I fancy that I should get tired of such a diet myself Never mamma said Lily As for me I confess to a longing after mutton chops but I don t think you would ever want such vulgar things At any rate it would be impossible to remain here said Bell Uncle Christopher would not take rent from mamma and even if he did we should not know how to go on with our other arrangements after such a change No we must give up the dear old Small House It is a dear old house said Lily thinking as she spoke more of those late scenes in the garden when Crosbie had been with them in the autumn months than of any of the former joys of her childhood After all I do not know that I should be right to move said missus Dale doubtingly Yes yes said both the girls at once Of course you will be right mamma there cannot be a doubt about it mamma If we can get any cottage or even lodgings that would be better than remaining here now that we know what uncle Christopher thinks of it It will make him very unhappy said missus Dale But even this argument did not in the least move the girls They were very sorry that their uncle should be unhappy They would endeavour to show him by some increased show of affection that their feelings towards him were not unkind Should he speak to them they would endeavour to explain to him that their thoughts towards him were altogether affectionate But they could not remain at Allington increasing their load of gratitude seeing that he expected a certain payment which they did not feel themselves able to render We should be robbing him if we stayed here Bell declared wilfully robbing him of what he believes to be his just share of the bargain So it was settled among them that notice should be given to their uncle of their intention to quit the Small House of Allington And then came the question as to their new home missus Dale was aware that her income was at any rate better than that possessed by missus Eames and therefore she had fair ground for presuming that she could afford to keep a house at Guestwick If we do go away that is what we must do she said And we shall have to walk out with Mary Eames instead of Susan Boyce said Lily It won t make so much difference after all In that respect we shall gain as much as we lose said Bell And then it will be so nice to have the shops said Lily ironically Only we shall never have any money to buy anything said Bell But we shall see more of the world said Lily Lady Julia s carriage comes into town twice a week and the Miss Gruffens drive about in great style Upon the whole we shall gain a great deal only for the poor old garden Mamma I do think I shall break my heart at parting with Hopkins and as to him I shall be disappointed in mankind if he ever holds his head up again after I am gone But in truth there was very much of sadness in their resolution and to missus Dale it seemed as though she were managing matters badly for her daughters and allowing poverty and misfortune to come upon them through her own fault She well knew how great a load of sorrow was lying on Lily s heart hidden beneath those little attempts at pleasantry which she made When she spoke of being disappointed in mankind missus Dale could hardly repress an outward shudder that would betray her thoughts And now she was consenting to take them forth from their comfortable home from the luxury of their lawns and gardens and to bring them to some small dingy corner of a provincial town because she had failed to make herself happy with her brother in law Could she be right to give up all the advantages which they enjoyed at Allington advantages which had come to them from so legitimate a source because her own feelings had been wounded In all their future want of comfort in the comfortless dowdiness of the new home to which she would remove them would she not always blame herself for having brought them to that by her own false pride And yet it seemed to her that she now had no alternative She could not now teach her daughters to obey their uncle s wishes in all things She could not make Bell understand that it would be well that she should marry Bernard because the squire had set his heart on such a marriage She had gone so far that she could not now go back I suppose we must move at Lady day said Bell who was in favour of instant action If so had you not better let uncle Christopher know at once I don t think that we can find a house by that time We can get in somewhere continued Bell There are plenty of lodgings in Guestwick you know But the sound of the word lodgings was uncomfortable in missus Dale s ears If we are to go let us go at once said Lily We need not stand much upon the order of our going Your uncle will be very much shocked said missus Dale He cannot say that it is your fault said Bell It was thus agreed between them that the necessary information should be at once given to the squire and that the old well loved house should be left for ever It would be a great fall in a worldly point of view from the Allington Small House to an abode in some little street of Guestwick At Allington they had been county people raised to a level with their own squire and other squires by the circumstance of their residence but at Guestwick they would be small even among the people of the town They would be on an equality with the Eameses and much looked down upon by the Gruffens They would hardly dare to call any more at Guestwick Manor seeing that they certainly could not expect Lady Julia to call upon them at Guestwick missus Boyce no doubt would patronize them and they could already anticipate the condolence which would be offered to them by missus Hearn Indeed such a movement on their part would be tantamount to a confession of failure in the full hearing of so much of the world as was known to them I must not allow my readers to suppose that these considerations were a matter of indifference to any of the ladies at the Small House To some women of strong mind of highly strung philosophic tendencies such considerations might have been indifferent But missus Dale was not of this nature nor were her daughters The good things of the world were good in their eyes and they valued the privilege of a pleasant social footing among their friends They were by no means capable of a wise contempt of the advantages which chance had hitherto given to them They could not go forth rejoicing in the comparative poverty of their altered condition But then neither could they purchase those luxuries which they were about to abandon at the price which was asked for them Had you not better write to my uncle said one of the girls But to this missus Dale objected that she could not make a letter on such a subject clearly intelligible and that therefore she would see the squire on the following morning It will be very dreadful she said but it will soon be over It is not what he will say at the moment that I fear so much as the bitter reproaches of his face when I shall meet him afterwards So on the following morning she again made her way and now without invitation to the squire s study mister Dale she began starting upon her work with some confusion in her manner and hurry in her speech I have been thinking over what we were saying together yesterday and I have come to a resolution which I know I ought to make known to you without a moment s delay The squire also had thought of what had passed between them and had suffered much as he had done so but he had thought of it without acerbity or anger His thoughts were ever gentler than his words and his heart softer than any exponent of his heart that he was able to put forth He wished to love his brother s children and to be loved by them but even failing that he wished to do good to them It had not occurred to him to be angry with missus Dale after that interview was over The conversation had not gone pleasantly with him but then he hardly expected that things would go pleasantly No idea had occurred to him that evil could come upon any of the Dale ladies from the words which had then been spoken He regarded the Small House as their abode and home as surely as the Great House was his own In giving him his due it must be declared that any allusion to their holding these as a benefit done to them by him had been very far from his thoughts missus Hearn who held her cottage at half its real value grumbled almost daily at him as her landlord but it never occurred to him that therefore he should raise her rent or that in not doing so he was acting with special munificence It had ever been to him a grumbling cross grained unpleasant world and he did not expect from missus Hearn or from his sister in law anything better than that to which he had ever been used It will make me very happy said he if it has any bearing on Bell s marriage with her cousin mister Dale that is out of the question I would not vex you by saying so if I were not certain of it but I know my child so well Then we must leave it to time Mary Yes of course but no time will suffice to make Bell change her mind We will however leave the subject And now mister Dale I have to tell you of something else we have resolved to leave the Small House Resolved on what said the squire turning his eyes full upon her We have resolved to leave the Small House Leave the Small House he said repeating her words and where on earth do you mean to go We think we shall go into Guestwick And why Ah that is so hard to explain If you would only accept the fact as I tell it to you and not ask for the reasons which have guided me But that is out of the question Mary In such a matter as that I must ask your reasons and I must tell you also that in my opinion you will not be doing your duty to your daughters in carrying out such an intention unless your reasons are very strong indeed But they are very strong said missus Dale and then she paused I cannot understand it said the squire I cannot bring myself to believe that you are really in earnest Are you not comfortable there More comfortable than we have any right to be with our means But I thought you always did very nicely with your money You never get into debt No I never get into debt It is not that exactly The fact is mister Dale we have no right to live there without paying rent but we could not afford to live there if we did pay rent Who has talked about rent he said jumping up from his chair Some one has been speaking falsehoods of me behind my back No gleam of the real truth had yet come to him No idea had reached his mind that his relatives thought it necessary to leave his house in consequence of any word that he himself had spoken He had never considered himself to have been in any special way generous to them and would not have thought it reasonable that they should abandon the house in which they had been living even if his anger against them had been strong and hot Mary he said I must insist upon getting to the bottom of this As for your leaving the house it is out of the question Where can you be better off or so well As to going into Guestwick what sort of life would there be for the girls I put all that aside as out of the question but I must know what has induced you to make such a proposition Tell me honestly has any one spoken evil of me behind my back missus Dale had been prepared for opposition and for reproach but there was a decision about the squire s words and an air of masterdom in his manner which made her recognize more fully than she had yet done the difficulty of her position She almost began to fear that she would lack power to carry out her purpose Indeed it is not so mister Dale Then what is it I know that if I attempt to tell you you will be vexed and will contradict me Vexed I shall be probably And yet I cannot help it Indeed I am endeavouring to do what is right by you and by the children Never mind me your duty is to think of them Of course it is and in doing this they most cordially agree with me In using such argument as that missus Dale showed her weakness and the squire was not slow to take advantage of it Your duty is to them he said but I do not mean by that that your duty is to let them act in any way that may best please them for the moment I can understand that they should be run away with by some romantic nonsense but I cannot understand it of you The truth is this mister Dale You think that my children owe to you that sort of obedience which is due to a parent and as long as they remain here accepting from your hands so large a part of their daily support it is perhaps natural that you should think so In this unhappy affair about Bell I have never said anything of the kind said the squire interrupting her No you have not said so And I do not wish you to think that I make any complaint But I feel that it is so and they feel it And therefore we have made up our minds to go away missus Dale as she finished was aware that she had not told her story well but she had acknowledged to herself that it was quite out of her power to tell it as it should be told Her main object was to make her brother in law understand that she certainly would leave his house and to make him understand this with as little pain to himself as possible She did not in the least mind his thinking her foolish if only she could so carry her point as to be able to tell her daughters on her return that the matter was settled But the squire from his words and manners seemed indisposed to give her this privilege Of all the propositions which I ever heard said he it is the most unreasonable It amounts to this that you are too proud to live rent free in a house which belongs to your husband s brother and therefore you intend to subject yourself and your children to the great discomfort of a very straitened income If you yourself only were concerned I should have no right to say anything but I think myself bound to tell you that as regards the girls everybody that knows you will think you to have been very wrong It is in the natural course of things that they should live in that house The place has never been let As far as I know no rent has ever been paid for the house since it was built It has always been given to some member of the family who has been considered as having the best right to it I have considered your footing there as firm as my own here A quarrel between me and your children would be to me a great calamity though perhaps they might be indifferent to it But if there were such a quarrel it would afford no reason for their leaving that house Let me beg you to think over the matter again ILLUSTRATION Let me beg you to think over the matter again The squire could assume an air of authority on certain occasions and he had done so now missus Dale found that she could only answer him by a simple repetition of her own intention and indeed failed in making him any serviceable answer whatsoever I know that you are very good to my girls she said I will say nothing about that he answered not thinking at that moment of the Small House but of the full possession which he had desired to give to the elder of all the privileges which should belong to the mistress of Allington thinking also of the means by which he was hoping to repair poor Lily s shattered fortunes What words were further said had no great significance and missus Dale got herself away feeling that she had failed As soon as she was gone the squire arose and putting on his great coat went forth with his hat and stick to the front of the house He went out in order that his thoughts might be more free and that he might indulge in that solace which an injured man finds in contemplating his injury He declared to himself that he was very hardly used so hardly used that he almost began to doubt himself and his own motives Why was it that the people around him disliked him so strongly avoided him and thwarted him in the efforts which he made for their welfare He offered to his nephew all the privileges of a son much more indeed than the privileges of a son merely asking in return that he would consent to live permanently in the house which was to be his own But his nephew refused He cannot bear to live with me said the old man to himself sorely He was prepared to treat his nieces with more generosity than the daughters of the House of Allington had usually received from their fathers and they repelled his kindness running away from him and telling him openly that they would not be beholden to him He walked slowly up and down the terrace thinking of this very bitterly He did not find in the contemplation of his grievance all that solace which a grievance usually gives because he accused himself in his thoughts rather than others He declared to himself that he was made to be hated and protested to himself that it would be well that he should die and be buried out of memory so that the remaining Dales might have a better chance of living happily and then as he thus discussed all this within his own bosom his thoughts were very tender and though he was aggrieved he was most affectionate to those who had most injured him But it was absolutely beyond his power to reproduce outwardly with words and outward signs such thoughts and feelings It was now very nearly the end of the year but the weather was still soft and open The air was damp rather than cold and the lawns and fields still retained the green tints of new vegetation As the squire was walking on the terrace Hopkins came up to him and touching his hat remarked that they should have frost in a day or two I suppose we shall said the squire We must have the mason to the flues of that little grape house sir before I can do any good with a fire there Which grape house said the squire crossly Why the grape house in the other garden sir It ought to have been done last year by rights This Hopkins said to punish his master for being cross to him On that matter of the flues of missus Dale s grape house he had with much consideration spared his master during the last winter and he felt that this ought to be remembered now I can t put any fire in it not to do any real good till something s done That s sure Then don t put any fire in it said the squire Now the grapes in question were supposed to be peculiarly fine and were the glory of the garden of the Small House They were always forced though not forced so early as those at the Great House and Hopkins was in a state of great confusion They ll never ripen sir not the whole year through Then let them be unripe said the squire walking about Hopkins did not at all understand it The squire in his natural course was very unwilling to neglect any such matter as this but would be specially unwilling to neglect anything touching the Small House So Hopkins stood on the terrace raising his hat and scratching his head There s something wrong amongst them said he to himself sorrowfully But when the squire had walked to the end of the terrace and had turned upon the path which led round the side of the house he stopped and called to Hopkins Have what is needful done to the flue he said Yes sir very well sir It ll only be re setting the bricks Nothing more ain t needful just this winter Have the place put in perfect order while you re about it said the squire and then he walked away CHAPTER XXXIX doctor CROFTS IS TURNED OUT Have you heard the news my dear from the Small House said missus Boyce to her husband some two or three days after missus Dale s visit to the squire It was one o clock and the parish pastor had come in from his ministrations to dine with his wife and children What news said mister Boyce for he had heard none missus Dale and the girls are going to leave the Small House they re going into Guestwick to live missus Dale going away nonsense said the vicar What on earth should take her into Guestwick She doesn t pay a shilling of rent where she is I can assure you it s true my dear I was with missus Hearn just now and she had it direct from missus Dale s own lips missus Hearn said she d never been taken so much aback in her whole life There s been some quarrel you may be sure of that mister Boyce sat silent pulling off his dirty shoes preparatory to his dinner Tidings so important as touching the social life of his parish had not come to him for many a day and he could hardly bring himself to credit them at so short a notice missus Hearn says that missus Dale spoke ever so firmly about it as though determined that nothing should change her And did she say why Well not exactly But missus Hearn said she could understand there had been words between her and the squire It couldn t be anything else you know Probably it had something to do with that man Crosbie They ll be very pushed about money said mister Boyce thrusting his feet into his slippers That s just what I said to missus Hearn And those girls have never been used to anything like real economy What s to become of them I don t know and missus Boyce as she expressed her sympathy for her dear friends received considerable comfort from the prospect of their future poverty It always is so and missus Boyce was not worse than her neighbours You ll find they ll make it up before the time comes said mister Boyce to whom the excitement of such a change in affairs was almost too good to be true I am afraid not said missus Boyce I m afraid not They are both so determined I always thought that riding and giving the girls hats and habits was injurious It was treating them as though they were the squire s daughters and they were not the squire s daughters It was almost the same thing But now we see the difference said the judicious missus Boyce I often said that dear missus Dale was wrong and it turns out that I was right It will make no difference to me as regards calling on them and that sort of thing Of course it won t Not but what there must be a difference and a very great difference too It will be a terrible come down for poor Lily with the loss of her fine husband and all After dinner when mister Boyce had again gone forth upon his labours the same subject was discussed between missus Boyce and her daughters and the mother was very careful to teach her children that missus Dale would be just as good a person as ever she had been and quite as much a lady even though she should live in a very dingy house at Guestwick from which lesson the Boyce girls learned plainly that missus Dale with Bell and Lily were about to have a fall in the world and that they were to be treated accordingly From all this it will be discovered that missus Dale had not given way to the squire s arguments although she had found herself unable to answer them As she had returned home she had felt herself to be almost vanquished and had spoken to the girls with the air and tone of a woman who hardly knew in which course lay the line of her duty But they had not seen the squire s manner on the occasion nor heard his words and they could not understand that their own purpose should be abandoned because he did not like it So they talked their mother into fresh resolves and on the following morning she wrote a note to her brother in law assuring him that she had thought much of all that he had said but again declaring that she regarded herself as bound in duty to leave the Small House To this he had returned no answer and she had communicated her intention to missus Hearn thinking it better that there should be no secret in the matter I am sorry to hear that your sister in law is going to leave us mister Boyce said to the squire that same afternoon Who told you that asked the squire showing by his tone that he by no means liked the topic of conversation which the parson had chosen Well I had it from missus Boyce and I think missus Hearn told her I wish missus Hearn would mind her own business and not spread idle reports The squire said nothing more and mister Boyce felt that he had been very unjustly snubbed doctor Crofts had come over and pronounced as a fact that it was scarlatina Village apothecaries are generally wronged by the doubts which are thrown upon them for the town doctors when they come always confirm what the village apothecaries have said There can be no doubt as to its being scarlatina the doctor declared but the symptoms are all favourable There was however much worse coming than this Two days afterwards Lily found herself to be rather unwell She endeavoured to keep it to herself fearing that she should be brought under the doctor s notice as a patient but her efforts were unavailing and on the following morning it was known that she had also taken the disease doctor Crofts declared that everything was in her favour The weather was cold The presence of the malady in the house had caused them all to be careful and moreover good advice was at hand at once The doctor begged missus Dale not to be uneasy but he was very eager in begging that the two sisters might not be allowed to be together Could you not send Bell into Guestwick to missus Eames s said he But Bell did not choose to be sent to missus Eames s and was with great difficulty kept out of her mother s bedroom to which Lily as an invalid was transferred If you will allow me to say so he said to Bell on the second day after Lily s complaint had declared itself you are wrong to stay here in the house I certainly shall not leave mamma when she has got so much upon her hands said Bell But if you should be taken ill she would have more on her hands pleaded the doctor I could not do it Bell replied If I were taken over to Guestwick I should be so uneasy that I should walk back to Allington the first moment that I could escape from the house I think your mother would be more comfortable without you And I think she would be more comfortable with me I don t ever like to hear of a woman running away from illness but when a sister or a daughter does so it is intolerable So Bell remained without permission indeed to see her sister but performing various outside administrations which were much needed And thus all manner of trouble came upon the inhabitants of the Small House falling upon them as it were in a heap together It was as yet barely two months since those terrible tidings had come respecting Crosbie tidings which it was felt at the time would of themselves be sufficient to crush them and now to that misfortune other misfortunes had been added one quick upon the heels of another In the teeth of the doctor s kind prophecy Lily became very ill and after a few days was delirious She would talk to her mother about Crosbie speaking of him as she used to speak in the autumn that was passed But even in her madness she remembered that they had resolved to leave their present home and she asked the doctor twice whether their lodgings in Guestwick were ready for them It was thus that Crofts first heard of their intention Now in these days of Lily s worst illness he came daily over to Allington remaining there on one occasion the whole night For all this he would take no fee nor had he ever taken a fee from missus Dale I wish you would not come so often Bell said to him one evening as he stood with her at the drawing room fire after he had left the patient s room you are overloading us with obligations On that day Lily was over the worst of the fever and he had been able to tell missus Dale that he did not think that she was now in danger It will not be necessary much longer he said the worst of it is over It is such a luxury to hear you say so I suppose we shall owe her life to you but nevertheless Oh no scarlatina is not such a terrible thing now as it used to be Then why should you have devoted your time to her as you have done It frightens me when I think of the injury we must have done you My horse has felt it more than I have said the doctor laughing My patients at Guestwick are not so very numerous Then instead of going he sat himself down And it is really true he said that you are all going to leave this house Quite true We shall do so at the end of March if Lily is well enough to be moved Lily will be well long before that I hope not indeed that she ought to be moved out of her own rooms for many weeks to come yet Unless we are stopped by her we shall certainly go at the end of March Bell now had also sat down and they both remained for some time looking at the fire in silence And why is it Bell he said at last But I don t know whether I have a right to ask You have a right to ask any question about us she said My uncle is very kind He is more than kind he is generous But he seems to think that our living here gives him a right to interfere with mamma We don t like that and therefore we are going The doctor still sat on one side of the fire and Bell still sat opposite to him but the conversation did not form itself very freely between them It is bad news he said at last At any rate when we are ill you will not have so far to come and see us Yes I understand That means that I am ungracious not to congratulate myself on having you all so much nearer to me but I do not in the least I cannot bear to think of you as living anywhere but here at Allington Dales will be out of their place in a street at Guestwick That s hard upon the Dales too It is hard upon them It s a sort of offshoot from that very tyrannical law of noblesse oblige I don t think you ought to go away from Allington unless the circumstances are very imperative But they are very imperative In that case indeed And then again he fell into silence Have you never seen that mamma is not happy here she said after another pause For myself I never quite understood it all before as I do now but now I see it And I have seen it have seen at least what you mean She has led a life of restraint but then how frequently is such restraint the necessity of a life I hardly think that your mother would move on that account No It is on our account But this restraint as you call it makes us unhappy and she is governed by seeing that My uncle is generous to her as regards money but in other things in matters of feeling I think he has been ungenerous Bell said the doctor and then he paused She looked up at him but made no answer He had always called her by her Christian name and they two had ever regarded each other as close friends At the present moment she had forgotten all else besides this and yet she had infinite pleasure in sitting there and talking to him I am going to ask you a question which perhaps I ought not to ask only that I have known you so long that I almost feel that I am speaking to a sister You may ask me what you please said she It is about your cousin Bernard About Bernard said Bell It was now dusk and as they were sitting without other light than that of the fire she knew that he could not discern the colour which covered her face as her cousin s name was mentioned But had the light of day pervaded the whole room I doubt whether Crofts would have seen that blush for he kept his eyes firmly fixed upon the fire Yes about Bernard I don t know whether I ought to ask you I m sure I can t say said Bell speaking words of the nature of which she was not conscious There has been a rumour in Guestwick that he and you It is untrue said Bell quite untrue If you hear it repeated you should contradict it I wonder why people should say such things It would have been an excellent marriage all your friends must have approved it What do you mean doctor Crofts How I do hate those words an excellent marriage In them is contained more of wicked worldliness than any other words that one ever hears spoken You want me to marry my cousin simply because I should have a great house to live in and a coach I know that you are my friend but I hate such friendship as that I think you misunderstand me Bell I mean that it would have been an excellent marriage provided you had both loved each other No I don t misunderstand you Of course it would be an excellent marriage if we loved each other You might say the same if I loved the butcher or the baker What you mean is that it makes a reason for loving him I don t think I did mean that Then you mean nothing After that there were again some minutes of silence during which doctor Crofts got up to go away You have scolded me very dreadfully he said with a slight smile and I believe I have deserved it for interfering No not at all for interfering But at any rate you must forgive me before I go I won t forgive you at all unless you repent of your sins and alter altogether the wickedness of your mind You will become very soon as bad as doctor Gruffen Shall I Oh but I will forgive you for after all you are the most generous man in the world Oh yes of course I am Well good by But doctor Crofts you should not suppose others to be so much more worldly than yourself You do not care for money so very much But I do care very much If you did you would not come here for nothing day after day I do care for money very much I have sometimes nearly broken my heart because I could not get opportunities of earning it It is the best friend that a man can have Oh doctor Crofts the best friend that a man can have if it be honestly come by A woman can hardly realize the sorrow which may fall upon a man from the want of such a friend Of course a man likes to earn a decent living by his profession and you can do that That depends upon one s ideas of decency Ah mine never ran very high I ve always had a sort of aptitude for living in a pigsty a clean pigsty you know with nice fresh bean straw to lie upon I think it was a mistake when they made a lady of me I do indeed I do not said doctor Crofts That s because you don t quite know me yet I ve not the slightest pleasure in putting on three different dresses a day I do it very often because it comes to me to do it from the way in which we have been taught to live But when we get to Guestwick I mean to change all that and if you come in to tea you ll see me in the same brown frock that I wear in the morning unless indeed the morning work makes the brown frock dirty Oh doctor Crofts you ll have it pitch dark riding home under the Guestwick elms I don t mind the dark he said and it seemed as though he hardly intended to go even yet But
5712_48842_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 I do said Bell 
none	none	and I shall ring for candles But he stopped her as she put her hand out to the bell pull Stop a moment Bell You need hardly have the candles before I go and you need not begrudge my staying either seeing that I shall be all alone at home Begrudge your staying But however you shall begrudge it or else make me very welcome He still held her by the wrist which he had caught as he prevented her from summoning the servant What do you mean said she You know you are welcome to us as flowers in May You always were welcome but now when you have come to us in our trouble At any rate you shall never say that I turn you out Shall I never say so And still he held her by the wrist He had kept his chair throughout but she was standing before him between him and the fire But she though he held her in this way thought little of his words or of his action They had known each other with great intimacy and though Lily would still laugh at her saying that doctor Crofts was her lover she had long since taught herself that no such feeling as that would ever exist between them Shall I never say so Bell What if so poor a man as I ask for the hand that you will not give to so rich a man as your cousin Bernard She instantly withdrew her arm and moved back very quickly a step or two across the rug She did it almost with the motion which she might have used had he insulted her or had a man spoken such words who would not under any circumstances have a right to speak them Ah yes I thought it would be so he said I may go now and may know that I have been turned out What is it you mean doctor Crofts What is it you are saying Why do you talk that nonsense trying to see if you can provoke me Yes it is nonsense I have no right to address you in that way and certainly should not have done it now that I am in your house in the way of my profession I beg your pardon Now he also was standing but he had not moved from his side of the fireplace Are you going to forgive me before I go Forgive you for what said she For daring to love you for having loved you almost as long as you can remember for loving you better than all beside This alone you should forgive but will you forgive me for having told it He had made her no offer nor did she expect that he was about to make one She herself had hardly yet realized the meaning of his words and she certainly had asked herself no question as to the answer which she should give to them There are cases in which lovers present themselves in so unmistakeable a guise that the first word of open love uttered by them tells their whole story and tells it without the possibility of a surprise And it is generally so when the lover has not been an old friend when even his acquaintance has been of modern date It had been so essentially in the case of Crosbie and Lily Dale When Crosbie came to Lily and made his offer he did it with perfect ease and thorough self possession for he almost knew that it was expected And Lily though she had been flurried for a moment had her answer pat enough She already loved the man with all her heart delighted in his presence basked in the sunshine of his manliness rejoiced in his wit and had tuned her ears to the tone of his voice It had all been done and the world expected it Had he not made his offer Lily would have been ill treated though alas alas there was future ill treatment so much heavier in store for her But there are other cases in which a lover cannot make himself known as such without great difficulty and when he does do so cannot hope for an immediate answer in his favour It is hard upon old friends that this difficulty should usually fall the heaviest upon them Crofts had been so intimate with the Dale family that very many persons had thought it probable that he would marry one of the girls missus Dale herself had thought so and had almost hoped it Lily had certainly done both These thoughts and hopes had somewhat faded away but yet their former existence should have been in the doctor s favour But now when he had in some way spoken out Bell started back from him and would not believe that he was in earnest She probably loved him better than any man in the world and yet when he spoke to her of love she could not bring herself to understand him I don t know what you mean doctor Crofts indeed I do not she said I had meant to ask you to be my wife simply that But you shall not have the pain of making me a positive refusal As I rode here to day I thought of it During my frequent rides of late I have thought of little else But I told myself that I had no right to do it I have not even a house in which it would be fit that you should live doctor Crofts if I loved you if I wished to marry you and then she stopped herself But you do not No I think not I suppose not No But in any way no consideration about money has anything to do with it But I am not that butcher or that baker whom you could love No said Bell and then she stopped herself from further speech not as intending to convey all her answer in that one word but as not knowing how to fashion any further words I knew it would be so said the doctor It will I fear be thought by those who condescend to criticize this lover s conduct and his mode of carrying on his suit that he was very unfit for such work Ladies will say that he wanted courage and men will say that he wanted wit I am inclined however to believe that he behaved as well as men generally do behave on such occasions and that he showed himself to be a good average lover There is your bold lover who knocks his lady love over as he does a bird and who would anathematize himself all over and swear that his gun was distraught and look about as though he thought the world was coming to an end if he missed to knock over his bird And there is your timid lover who winks his eyes when he fires who has felt certain from the moment in which he buttoned on his knickerbockers that he at any rate would kill nothing and who when he hears the loud congratulations of his friends cannot believe that he really did bag that beautiful winged thing by his own prowess The beautiful winged thing which the timid man carries home in his bosom declining to have it thrown into a miscellaneous cart so that it may never be lost in a common crowd of game is better to him than are the slaughtered hecatombs to those who kill their birds by the hundred But doctor Crofts had so winked his eye that he was not in the least aware whether he had winged his bird or no Indeed having no one at hand to congratulate him he was quite sure that the bird had flown away uninjured into the next field No was the only word which Bell had given in answer to his last sidelong question and No is not a comfortable word to lovers But there had been that in Bell s No which might have taught him that the bird was not escaping without a wound if he had still had any of his wits about him Now I will go said he Then he paused for an answer but none came And you will understand what I meant when I spoke of being turned out Nobody turns you out And Bell as she spoke had almost descended to a sob It is time at any rate that I should go is it not And Bell don t suppose that this little scene will keep me away from your sister s bedside I shall be here to morrow and you will find that you will hardly know me again for the same person Then in the dark he put out his hand to her Good by she said giving him her hand He pressed hers very closely but she though she wished to do so could not bring herself to return the pressure Her hand remained passive in his showing no sign of offence but it was absolutely passive Good by dearest friend he said Good by she answered and then he was gone She waited quite still till she heard the front door close after him and then she crept silently up to her own bedroom and sat herself down in a low rocking chair over the fire It was in accordance with a custom already established that her mother should remain with Lily till the tea was ready downstairs for in these days of illness such dinners as were provided were eaten early Bell therefore knew that she had still some half hour of her own during which she might sit and think undisturbed And what naturally should have been her first thoughts that she had ruthlessly refused a man who as she now knew loved her well and for whom she had always felt at any rate the warmest friendship Such were not her thoughts nor were they in any way akin to this They ran back instantly to years gone by over long years as her few years were counted and settled themselves on certain halcyon days in which she had dreamed that he had loved her and had fancied that she had loved him How she had schooled herself for those days since that and taught herself to know that her thoughts had been over bold And now it had all come round The only man that she had ever liked had loved her Then there came to her a memory of a certain day in which she had been almost proud to think that Crosbie had admired her in which she had almost hoped that it might be so and as she thought of this she blushed and struck her foot twice upon the floor Dear Lily she said to herself poor Lily But the feeling which induced her then to think of her sister had had no relation to that which had first brought Crosbie into her mind And this man had loved her through it all this priceless peerless man this man who was as true to the backbone as that other man had shown himself to be false who was as sound as the other man had proved himself to be rotten A smile came across her face as she sat looking at the fire thinking of this A man had loved her whose love was worth possessing She hardly remembered whether or no she had refused him or accepted him She hardly asked herself what she would do As to all that it was necessary that she should have many thoughts but the necessity did not press upon her quite immediately For the present at any rate she might sit and triumph and thus triumphant she sat there till the old nurse came in and told her that her mother was waiting for her below CHAPTER XL PREPARATIONS FOR THE WEDDING ILLUSTRATION untitled The fourteenth of February was finally settled as the day on which mister Crosbie was to be made the happiest of men A later day had been at first named the twenty seventh or twenty eighth having been suggested as an improvement over the first week in March but Lady Amelia had been frightened by Crosbie s behaviour on that Sunday evening and had made the countess understand that there should be no unnecessary delay He doesn t scruple at that kind of thing Lady Amelia had said in one of her letters showing perhaps less trust in the potency of her own rank than might have been expected from her The countess however had agreed with her and when Crosbie received from his mother in law a very affectionate epistle setting forth all the reasons which would make the fourteenth so much more convenient a day than the twenty eighth he was unable to invent an excuse for not being made happy a fortnight earlier than the time named in the bargain His first impulse had been against yielding arising from some feeling which made him think that more than the bargain ought not to be exacted But what was the use to him of quarrelling What the use at least of quarrelling just then He believed that he could more easily enfranchise himself from the De Courcy tyranny when he should be once married than he could do now When Lady Alexandrina should be his own he would let her know that he intended to be her master If in doing so it would be necessary that he should divide himself altogether from the De Courcys such division should be made At the present moment he would yield to them at any rate in this matter And so the fourteenth of February was fixed for the marriage In the second week in January Alexandrina came up to look after her things or in more noble language to fit herself with becoming bridal appanages As she could not properly do all this work alone or even under the surveillance and with the assistance of a sister Lady De Courcy was to come up also But Alexandrina came first remaining with her sister in saint John s Wood till the countess should arrive The countess had never yet condescended to accept of her son in law s hospitality but always went to the cold comfortless house in Portman Square the house which had been the De Courcy town family mansion for many years and which the countess would long since have willingly exchanged for some abode on the other side of Oxford Street but the earl had been obdurate his clubs and certain lodgings which he had occasionally been wont to occupy were on the right side of Oxford Street why should he change his old family residence So the countess was coming up to Portman Square not having been even asked on this occasion to saint John s Wood Don t you think we d better mister Gazebee had said to his wife almost trembling at the renewal of his own proposition I think not my dear Lady Amelia had answered Mamma is not very particular but there are little things you know Oh yes of course said mister Gazebee and then the conversation had been dropped He would most willingly have entertained his august mother in law during her visit to the metropolis and yet her presence in his house would have made him miserable as long as she remained there But for a week Alexandrina sojourned under mister Gazebee s roof during which time Crosbie was made happy with all the delights of an expectant bridegroom Of course he was given to understand that he was to dine at the Gazebees every day and spend all his evenings there and under the circumstances he had no excuse for not doing so Indeed at the present moment his hours would otherwise have hung heavily enough upon his hands In spite of his bold resolution with reference to his eye and his intention not to be debarred from the pleasures of society by the marks of the late combat he had not since that occurrence frequented his club very closely and though London was now again becoming fairly full he did not find himself going out so much as had been his wont The brilliance of his coming marriage did not seem to have added much to his popularity in fact the world his world was beginning to look coldly at him Therefore that daily attendance at saint John s Wood was not felt to be so irksome as might have been expected A residence had been taken for the couple in a very fashionable row of buildings abutting upon the Bayswater Road called Princess Royal Crescent The house was quite new and the street being unfinished had about it a strong smell of mortar and a general aspect of builders poles and brickbats but nevertheless it was acknowledged to be a quite correct locality From one end of the crescent a corner of Hyde Park could be seen and the other abutted on a very handsome terrace indeed in which lived an ambassador from South America a few bankers senior clerks and a peer of the realm We know how vile is the sound of Baker Street and how absolutely foul to the polite ear is the name of Fitzroy Square The houses however in those purlieus are substantial warm and of good size The house in Princess Royal Crescent was certainly not substantial for in these days substantially built houses do not pay It could hardly have been warm for to speak the truth it was even yet not finished throughout and as for the size though the drawing room was a noble apartment consisting of a section of the whole house with a corner cut out for the staircase it was very much cramped in its other parts and was made like a cherub in this respect that it had no rear belonging to it But if you have no private fortune of your own you cannot have everything as the countess observed when Crosbie objected to the house because a closet under the kitchen stairs was to be assigned to him as his own dressing room When the question of the house was first debated Lady Amelia had been anxious that saint John s Wood should be selected as the site but to this Crosbie had positively objected I think you don t like saint John s Wood Lady Amelia had said to him somewhat sternly thinking to awe him into a declaration that he entertained no general enmity to the neighbourhood But Crosbie was not weak enough for this No I do not he said I have always disliked it It amounts to a prejudice I daresay But if I were made to live here I am convinced I should cut my throat in the first six months Lady Amelia had then drawn herself up declaring her sorrow that her house should be so hateful to him Oh dear no said he I like it very much for you and enjoy coming here of all things I speak only of the effect which living here myself would have upon me Lady Amelia was quite clever enough to understand it all but she had her sister s interest at heart and therefore persevered in her affectionate solicitude for her brother in law giving up that point as to saint John s Wood Crosbie himself had wished to go to one of the new Pimlico squares down near Vauxhall Bridge and the river actuated chiefly by consideration of the enormous distance lying between that locality and the northern region in which Lady Amelia lived but to this Lady Alexandrina had objected strongly If indeed they could have achieved Eaton Square or a street leading out of Eaton Square if they could have crept on to the hem of the skirt of Belgravia the bride would have been delighted And at first she was very nearly being taken in with the idea that such was the proposal made to her Her geographical knowledge of Pimlico had not been perfect and she had nearly fallen into a fatal error But a friend had kindly intervened For heaven s sake my dear don t let him take you anywhere beyond Eccleston Square had been exclaimed to her in dismay by a faithful married friend Thus warned Alexandrina had been firm and now their tent was to be pitched in Princess Royal Crescent from one end of which the Hyde Park may be seen The furniture had been ordered chiefly under the inspection and by the experience of the Lady Amelia Crosbie had satisfied himself by declaring that she at any rate could get the things cheaper than he could buy them and that he had no taste for such employment Nevertheless he had felt that he was being made subject to tyranny and brought under the thumb of subjection He could not go cordially into this matter of beds and chairs and therefore at last deputed the whole matter to the De Courcy faction And for this there was another reason not hitherto mentioned mister Mortimer Gazebee was finding the money with which all the furniture was being bought He with an honest but almost unintelligible zeal for the De Courcy family had tied up every shilling on which he could lay his hand as belonging to Crosbie in the interest of Lady Alexandrina He had gone to work for her scraping here and arranging there strapping the new husband down upon the grindstone of his matrimonial settlement as though the future bread of his Gazebee s own children were dependent on the validity of his legal workmanship And for this he was not to receive a penny or gain any advantage immediate or ulterior It came from his zeal his zeal for the coronet which Lord De Courcy wore According to his mind an earl and an earl s belongings were entitled to such zeal It was the theory in which he had been educated and amounted to a worship which unconsciously he practised Personally he disliked Lord De Courcy who ill treated him He knew that the earl was a heartless cruel bad man But as an earl he was entitled to an amount of service which no commoner could have commanded from mister Gazebee mister Gazebee having thus tied up all the available funds in favour of Lady Alexandrina s seemingly expected widowhood was himself providing the money with which the new house was to be furnished You can pay me a hundred and fifty a year with four per cent till it is liquidated he had said to Crosbie and Crosbie had assented with a grunt Hitherto though he had lived in London expensively and as a man of fashion he had never owed any one anything He was now to begin that career of owing But when a clerk in a public office marries an earl s daughter he cannot expect to have everything his own way Lady Amelia had bought the ordinary furniture the beds the stair carpets the washing stands and the kitchen things Gazebee had got a bargain of the dinner table and sideboard But Lady Alexandrina herself was to come up with reference to the appurtenances of the drawing room It was with reference to matters of costume that the countess intended to lend her assistance matters of costume as to which the bill could not be sent in to Gazebee and be paid for by him with five per cent duly charged against the bridegroom The bridal trousseau must be produced by De Courcy s means and therefore it was necessary that the countess herself should come upon the scene I will have no bills d ye hear snarled the earl gnashing and snapping upon his words with one specially ugly black tooth I won t have any bills about this affair And yet he made no offer of ready money It was very necessary under such circumstances that the countess herself should come upon the scene An ambiguous hint had been conveyed to mister Gazebee during a visit of business which he had lately made to Courcy Castle that the milliner s bills might as well be pinned on to those of the furniture makers the crockery mongers and the like The countess putting it in her own way had gently suggested that the fashion of the thing had changed lately and that such an arrangement was considered to be the proper thing among people who lived really in the world But Gazebee was a clear headed honest man and he knew the countess He did not think that such an arrangement could be made on the present occasion Whereupon the countess pushed her suggestion no further but made up her mind that she must come up to London herself It was pleasant to see the Ladies Amelia and Alexandrina as they sat within a vast emporium of carpets in Bond Street asking questions of the four men who were waiting upon them putting their heads together and whispering calculating accurately as to extra twopences a yard and occasioning as much trouble as it was possible for them to give It was pleasant because they managed their large hoops cleverly among the huge rolls of carpets because they were enjoying themselves thoroughly and taking to themselves the homage of the men as clearly their due But it was not so pleasant to look at Crosbie who was fidgeting to get away to his office to whom no power of choosing in the matter was really given and whom the men regarded as being altogether supernumerary The ladies had promised to be at the shop by half past ten so that Crosbie should reach his office at eleven or a little after But it was nearly eleven before they left the Gazebee residence and it was very evident that half an hour among the carpets would be by no means sufficient It seemed as though miles upon miles of gorgeous colouring were unrolled before them and then when any pattern was regarded as at all practicable it was unrolled backwards and forwards till a room was nearly covered by it Crosbie felt for the men who were hauling about the huge heaps of material but Lady Amelia sat as composed as though it were her duty to inspect every yard of stuff in the warehouse I think we ll look at that one at the bottom again Then the men went to work and removed a mountain No my dear that green in the scroll work won t do It would fly directly if any hot water were spilt The man smiling ineffably declared that that particular green never flew anywhere But Lady Amelia paid no attention to him and the carpet for which the mountain had been removed became part of another mountain That might do said Alexandrina gazing upon a magnificent crimson ground through which rivers of yellow meandered carrying with them in their streams an infinity of blue flowers And as she spoke she held her head gracefully on one side and looked down upon the carpet doubtingly Lady Amelia poked it with her parasol as though to test its durability and whispered something about yellows showing the dirt Crosbie took out his watch and groaned ILLUSTRATION That might do It s a superb carpet my lady and about the newest thing we have We put down four hundred and fifty yards of it for the Duchess of South Wales at Cwddglwlch Castle only last month Nobody has had it since for it has not been in stock Whereupon Lady Amelia again poked it and then got up and walked upon it Lady Alexandrina held her head a little more on one side Five and three said Lady Amelia Oh no my lady five and seven and the cheapest carpet we have in the house There is twopence a yard more in the colour there is indeed And the discount asked Lady Amelia Two and a half my lady Oh dear no said Lady Amelia I always have five per cent for immediate payment quite immediate you know Upon which the man declared the question must be referred to his master Two and a half was the rule of the house Crosbie who had been looking out of the window said that upon his honour he couldn t wait any longer And what do you think of it Adolphus asked Alexandrina Think of what Of the carpet this one you know Oh what do I think of the carpet I don t think I quite like all these yellow bands and isn t it too red I should have thought something brown with a small pattern would have been better But upon my word I don t much care Of course he doesn t said Lady Amelia Then the two ladies put their heads together for another five minutes and the carpet was chosen subject to that question of the discount And now about the rug said Lady Amelia But here Crosbie rebelled and insisted that he must leave them and go to his office You can t want me about the rug he said Well perhaps not said Lady Amelia But it was manifest that Alexandrina did not approve of being thus left by her male attendant The same thing happened in Oxford Street with reference to the chairs and sofas and Crosbie began to wish that he were settled even though he should have to dress himself in the closet below the kitchen stairs He was learning to hate the whole household in saint John s Wood and almost all that belonged to it He was introduced there to little family economies of which hitherto he had known nothing and which were disgusting to him and the necessity for which was especially explained to him It was to men placed as he was about to place himself that these economies were so vitally essential to men who with limited means had to maintain a decorous outward face towards the fashionable world Ample supplies of butchers meat and unlimited washing bills might be very well upon fifteen hundred a year to those who went out but seldom and who could use the first cab that came to hand when they did go out But there were certain things that Lady Alexandrina must do and therefore the strictest household economy became necessary Would Lily Dale have required the use of a carriage got up to look as though it were private at the expense of her husband s beefsteaks and clean shirts That question and others of that nature were asked by Crosbie within his own mind not unfrequently But nevertheless he tried to love Alexandrina or rather to persuade himself that he loved her If he could only get her away from the De Courcy faction and especially from the Gazebee branch of it he would break her of all that He would teach her to sit triumphantly in a street cab and to cater for her table with a plentiful hand Teach her at some age over thirty and with such careful training as she had already received Did he intend to forbid her ever again to see her relations ever to go to saint John s Wood or to correspond with the countess and Lady Margaretta Teach her indeed Had he yet to learn that he could not wash a blackamoor white that he could not have done so even had he himself been well adapted for the attempt whereas he was in truth nearly as ill adapted as a man might be But who could pity him Lily whom he might have had in his bosom would have been no blackamoor Then came the time of Lady De Courcy s visit to town and Alexandrina moved herself off to Portman Square There was some apparent comfort in this to Crosbie for he would thereby be saved from those daily dreary journeys up to the north west I may say that he positively hated that windy corner near the church round which he had to walk in getting to the Gazebee residence and that he hated the lamp which guided him to the door and the very door itself This door stood buried as it were in a wall and opened on to a narrow passage which ran across a so called garden or front yard containing on each side two iron receptacles for geraniums painted to look like Palissy ware and a naked female on a pedestal No spot in London was as he thought so cold as the bit of pavement immediately in front of that door And there he would be kept five ten fifteen minutes as he declared though I believe in my heart that the time never exceeded three while Richard was putting off the trappings of his work and putting on the trappings of his grandeur If people would only have their doors opened to you by such assistance as may come most easily and naturally to the work I stood lately for some minutes on a Tuesday afternoon at a gallant portal and as I waxed impatient a pretty maiden came and opened it She was a pretty maiden though her hands and face and apron told tales of the fire grates Laws sir she said the visitors day is Wednesday and if you would come then there would be the man in livery She took my card with the corner of her apron and did just as well as the man in livery but what would have happened to her had her little speech been overheard by her mistress Crosbie hated the house in saint John s Wood and therefore the coming of the countess was a relief to him Portman Square was easily to be reached and the hospitalities of the countess would not be pressed upon him so strongly as those of the Gazebees When he first called he was shown into the great family dining room which looked out towards the back of the house The front windows were of course closed as the family was not supposed to be in London Here he remained in the room for some quarter of an hour and then the countess descended upon him in all her grandeur Perhaps he had never before seen her so grand Her dress was very large and rustled through the broad doorway as if demanding even a broader passage She had on a wonder of a bonnet and a velvet mantle that was nearly as expansive as her petticoats She threw her head a little back as she accosted him and he instantly perceived that he was enveloped in the fumes of an affectionate but somewhat contemptuous patronage In old days he had liked the countess because her manner to him had always been flattering In his intercourse with her he had been able to feel that he gave quite as much as he got and that the countess was aware of the fact In all the circumstances of their acquaintance the ascendancy had been with him and therefore the acquaintance had been a pleasant one The countess had been a good natured agreeable woman whose rank and position had made her house pleasant to him and therefore he had consented to shine upon her with such light as he had to give Why was it that the matter was reversed now that there was so much stronger a cause for good feeling between them He knew that there was such change and with bitter internal upbraidings he acknowledged to himself that this woman was getting the mastery over him As the friend of the countess he had been a great man in her eyes in all her little words and looks she had acknowledged his power but now as her son in law he was to become a very little man such as was Mortimer Gazebee My dear Adolphus she said taking both his hands the day is coming very near now is it not Very near indeed he said Yes it is very near I hope you feel yourself a happy man Oh yes that s of course It ought to be Speaking very seriously I mean that it ought to be a matter of course She is everything that a man should desire in a wife I am not alluding now to her rank though of course you feel what a great advantage she gives you in this respect Crosbie muttered something as to his consciousness of having drawn a prize in the lottery but he so muttered it as not to convey to the lady s ears a proper sense of his dependent gratitude I know of no man more fortunate than you have been she continued and I hope that my dear girl will find that you are fully aware that it is so I think that she is looking rather fagged You have allowed her to do more than was good for her in the way of shopping She has done a good deal certainly said Crosbie She is so little used to anything of that kind But of course as things have turned out it was necessary that she should see to these things herself I rather think she liked it said Crosbie I believe she will always like doing her duty We are just going now to Madame Millefranc s to see some silks perhaps you would wish to go with us Just at this moment Alexandrina came into the room and looked as though she were in all respects a smaller edition of her mother They were both well grown women with handsome large figures and a certain air about them which answered almost for beauty As to the countess her face on close inspection bore as it was entitled to do deep signs of age but she so managed her face that any such close inspection was never made and her general appearance for her time of life was certainly good Very little more than this could be said in favour of her daughter Oh dear no mamma she said having heard her mother s last words He s the worst person in a shop in the world He likes nothing and dislikes nothing Do you Adolphus Indeed I do I like all the cheap things and dislike all the dear things Then you certainly shall not go with us to Madame Millefranc s said Alexandrina It would not matter to him there you know my dear said the countess thinking perhaps of the suggestion she had lately made to mister Gazebee On this occasion Crosbie managed to escape simply promising to return to Portman Square in the evening after dinner By the by Adolphus said the countess as he handed her into the hired carriage which stood at the door I wish you would go to Lambert s on Ludgate Hill for me He has had a bracelet of mine for nearly three months Do there s a good creature Get it if you can and bring it up this evening Crosbie as he made his way back to his office swore that he would not do the bidding of the countess He would not trudge off into the city after her trinkets But at five o clock when he left his office he did go there He apologized to himself by saying that he had nothing else to do and bethought himself that at the present moment his lady mother in law s smiles might be more convenient than her frowns So he went to Lambert s on Ludgate Hill and there learned that the bracelet had been sent down to Courcy Castle full two months since After that he dined at his club at Sebright s He dined alone sitting by no means in bliss with his half pint of sherry on the table before him A man now and then came up and spoke to him one a few words and another a few and two or three congratulated him as to his marriage but the club was not the same thing to him as it had formerly been He did not stand in the centre of the rug speaking indifferently to all or any around him ready with his joke and loudly on the alert with the last news of the day How easy it is to be seen when any man has fallen from his pride of place though the altitude was ever so small and the fall ever so slight Where is the man who can endure such a fall without showing it in his face in his voice in his step and in every motion of every limb Crosbie knew that he had fallen and showed that he knew it by the manner in which he ate his mutton chop At half past eight he was again in Portman Square and found the two ladies crowding over a small fire in a small back drawing room The furniture was all covered with brown holland and the place had about it that cold comfortless feeling which uninhabited rooms always produce Crosbie as he had walked from the club up to Portman Square had indulged in some serious thoughts The kind of life which he had hitherto led had certainly passed away from him He could never again be the pet of a club or indulged as one to whom all good things were to be given without any labour at earning them on his own part Such for some years had been his good fortune but such could be his good fortune no longer Was there anything within his reach which he might take in lieu of that which he had lost He might still be victorious at his office having more capacity for such victory than others around him But such success alone would hardly suffice for him Then he considered whether he might not even yet be happy in his own home whether Alexandrina when separated from her mother might not become such a wife as he could love Nothing softens a man s feelings so much as failure or makes him turn so anxiously to an idea of home as buffetings from those he meets abroad He had abandoned Lily because his outer world had seemed to him too bright to be deserted He would endeavour to supply her place with Alexandrina because his outer world had seemed to him too harsh to be supported Alas alas a man cannot so easily repent of his sins and wash himself white from their stains When he entered the room the two ladies were sitting over the fire as I have stated and Crosbie could immediately perceive that the spirit of the countess was not serene In fact there had been a few words between the mother and child on that matter of the trousseau and Alexandrina had plainly told her mother that if she were to be married at all she would be married with such garments belonging to her as were fitting for an earl s daughter It was in vain that her mother had explained with many circumlocutional phrases that the fitness in this respect should be accommodated rather to the plebeian husband than to the noble parent Alexandrina had been very firm and had insisted on her rights giving the countess to understand that if her orders for finery were not complied with she would return as a spinster to Courcy and prepare herself for partnership with Rosina My dear said the countess piteously you can have no idea of what I shall have to go through with your father And of course you could get all these things afterwards Papa has no right to treat me in such a way And if he would not give me any money himself he should have let me have some of my own Ah my dear that was mister Gazebee s fault I don t care whose fault it was It certainly was not mine I won t have him to tell me him was intended to signify Adolphus Crosbie that he had to pay for my wedding clothes Of course not that my dear No nor yet for the things which I wanted immediately I d much rather go and tell him at once that the marriage must be put off Alexandrina of course carried her point the countess reflecting with a maternal devotion equal almost to that of the pelican that the earl could not do more than kill her So the things were ordered as Alexandrina chose to order them and the countess desired that the bills might be sent in to mister Gazebee Much self devotion had been displayed by the mother but the mother thought that none had been displayed by the daughter and therefore she had been very cross with Alexandrina Crosbie taking a chair sat himself between them and in a very good humoured tone explained the little affair of the bracelet Your ladyship s memory must have played you false said he with a smile My memory is very good said the countess very good indeed If Twitch got it and didn t tell me that was not my fault Twitch was her ladyship s lady s maid Crosbie seeing how the land lay said nothing more about the bracelet After a minute or two he put out his hand to take that of Alexandrina They were to be married now in a week or two and such a sign of love might have been allowed to him even in the presence of the bride s mother He did succeed in getting hold of her fingers but found in them none of the softness of a response Don t said Lady Alexandrina withdrawing her hand and the tone of her voice as she spoke the word was not sweet to his ears He remembered at the moment a certain scene which took place one evening at the little bridge at Allington and Lily s voice and Lily s words and Lily s passion as he caressed her Oh my love my love my love My dear said the countess they know how tired I am I wonder whether they are going to give us any tea Whereupon Crosbie rang the bell and on resuming his chair moved it a little farther away from his lady love Presently the tea was brought to them by the housekeeper s assistant who did not appear to have made herself very smart for the occasion and Crosbie thought that he was de trop This however was a mistake on his part As he had been admitted into the family such little matters were no longer subject of care Two or three months since the countess would have fainted at the idea of such a domestic appearing with a tea tray before mister Crosbie Now however she was utterly indifferent to any such consideration Crosbie was to be admitted into the family thereby becoming entitled to certain privileges and thereby also becoming subject to certain domestic drawbacks In missus Dale s little household there had been no rising to grandeur but then also there had never been any bathos of dirt Of this also Crosbie thought as he sat with his tea in his hand He soon however got himself away When he rose to go Alexandrina also rose and he was permitted to press his nose against her cheekbone by way of a salute Good night Adolphus said the countess putting out her hand to him But stop a minute I know there is something I want you to do for me But you will look in as you go to your office to morrow morning CHAPTER XLI DOMESTIC TROUBLES When Crosbie was making his ineffectual inquiry after Lady De Courcy s bracelet at Lambert s John Eames was in the act of entering missus Roper s front door in Burton Crescent Oh John where s mister Cradell were the first words which greeted him and they were spoken by the divine Amelia Now in her usual practice of life Amelia did not interest herself much as to the whereabouts of mister Cradell Where s Cradell said Eames repeating the question Upon my word I don t know I walked to the office with him but I haven t seen him since We don t sit in the same room you know John and then she stopped What s up now said John John That woman s off and left her husband As sure as your name s John Eames that foolish fellow has gone off with her What Cradell I don t believe it She went out of this house at two o clock in the afternoon and has never been back since That certainly was only four hours from the present time and such an absence from home in the middle of the day was but weak evidence on which to charge a married woman with the great sin of running off with a lover This Amelia felt and therefore she went on to explain
5712_48848_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 He s there 
none	none	upstairs in the drawing room the very picture of disconsolateness Who Cradell Lupex is He s been drinking a little I m afraid but he s very unhappy indeed He had an appointment to meet his wife here at four o clock and when he came he found her gone He rushed up into their room and now he says she has broken open a box he had and taken off all his money But he never had any money He paid mother some the day before yesterday That s just the reason he shouldn t have any to day She certainly has taken things she wouldn t have taken if she d merely gone out shopping or anything like that for I ve been up in the room and looked about it She d three necklaces They weren t much account but she must have them all on or else have got them in her pocket Cradell has never gone off with her in that way He may be a fool Oh he is you know I ve never seen such a fool about a woman as he has been But he wouldn t be a party to stealing a lot of trumpery trinkets or taking her husband s money Indeed I don t think he has anything to do with it Then Eames thought over the circumstances of the day and remembered that he had certainly not seen Cradell since the morning It was that public servant s practice to saunter into Eames s room in the middle of the day and there consume bread and cheese and beer in spite of an assertion which Johnny had once made as to crumbs of biscuit bathed in ink But on this special day he had not done so I can t think he has been such a fool as that said Johnny But he has said Amelia It s dinner time now and where is he Had he any money left Johnny So interrogated Eames disclosed a secret confided to him by his friend which no other circumstances would have succeeded in dragging from his breast She borrowed twelve pounds from him about a fortnight since immediately after quarter day And she owed him money too before that Oh what a soft exclaimed Amelia and he hasn t paid mother a shilling for the last two months It was his money perhaps that missus Roper got from Lupex the day before yesterday If so it comes to the same thing as far as she is concerned you know And what are we to do now said Amelia as she went before her lover upstairs Oh John what will become of me if ever you serve me in that way What should I do if you were to go off with another lady Lupex hasn t gone off said Eames who hardly knew what to say when the matter was brought before him with so closely personal a reference But it s the same thing said Amelia Hearts is divided Hearts that have been joined together ought never to be divided ought they And then she hung upon his arm just as they got to the drawing room door Hearts and darts are all my eye said Johnny My belief is that a man had better never marry at all How d you do mister Lupex Is anything the matter mister Lupex was seated on a chair in the middle of the room and was leaning with his head over the back of it So despondent was he in his attitude that his head would have fallen off and rolled on to the floor had it followed the course which its owner seemed to intend that it should take His hands hung down also along the back legs of the chair till his fingers almost touched the ground and altogether his appearance was pendent drooping and wobegone Miss Spruce was seated in one corner of the room with her hands folded in her lap before her and missus Roper was standing on the rug with a look of severe virtue on her brow of virtue which to judge by its appearance was very severe Nor was its severity intended to be exercised solely against missus Lupex missus Roper was becoming very tired of mister Lupex also and would not have been unhappy if he also had run away leaving behind him so much of his property as would have paid his bill mister Lupex did not stir when first addressed by John Eames but a certain convulsive movement was to be seen on the back of his head indicating that this new arrival in the drawing room had produced a fresh accession of agony The chair too quivered under him and his fingers stretched themselves nearer to the ground and shook themselves mister Lupex we re going to dinner immediately said missus Roper mister Eames where is your friend mister Cradell Upon my word I don t know said Eames But I know said Lupex jumping up and standing at his full height while he knocked down the chair which had lately supported him The traitor to domestic bliss I know And wherever he is he has that false woman in his arms Would he were here And as he expressed the last wish he went through a motion with his hands and arms which seemed intended to signify that if that unfortunate young man were in the company he would pull him in pieces and double him up and pack him close and then despatch his remains off through infinite space to the Prince of Darkness Traitor he exclaimed as he finished the process False traitor Foul traitor And she too Then as he thought of this softer side of the subject he prepared himself to relapse again on to the chair Finding it on the ground he had to pick it up He did pick it up and once more flung away his head over the back of it and stretched his finger nails almost down to the carpet James said missus Roper to her son who was now in the room I think you d better stay with mister Lupex while we are at dinner Come Miss Spruce I m very sorry that you should be annoyed by this kind of thing It don t hurt me said Miss Spruce preparing to leave the room I m only an old woman Annoyed said Lupex raising himself again from his chair not perhaps altogether disposed to remain upstairs while the dinner for which it was intended that he should some day pay was being eaten below Annoyed It is a profound sorrow to me that any lady should be annoyed by my misfortunes As regards Miss Spruce I look upon her character with profound veneration You needn t mind me I m only an old woman said Miss Spruce But by heavens I do mind exclaimed Lupex and hurrying forward he seized Miss Spruce by the hand I shall always regard age as entitled But the special privileges which mister Lupex would have accorded to age were never made known to the inhabitants of missus Roper s boarding house for the door of the room was again opened at this moment and mister Cradell entered Here you are old fellow to answer for yourself said Eames Cradell who had heard something as he came in at the front door but had not heard that Lupex was in the drawing room made a slight start backwards when he saw that gentleman s face Upon my word and honour he began but he was able to carry his speech no further Lupex dropping the hand of the elderly lady whom he reverenced was upon him in an instant and Cradell was shaking beneath his grasp like an aspen leaf or rather not like an aspen leaf unless an aspen leaf when shaken is to be seen with its eyes shut its mouth open and its tongue hanging out Come I say said Eames stepping forward to his friend s assistance this won t do at all mister Lupex You ve been drinking You d better wait till to morrow morning and speak to Cradell then To morrow morning viper shouted Lupex still holding his prey but looking back at Eames over his shoulder Who the viper was had not been clearly indicated When will he restore to me my wife When will he restore to me my honour Upon on on on my It was for the moment in vain that poor mister Cradell endeavoured to asseverate his innocence and to stake his honour upon his own purity as regarded missus Lupex Lupex still held to his enemy s cravat though Eames had now got him by the arm and so far impeded his movements as to hinder him from proceeding to any graver attack Jemima Jemima Jemima shouted missus Roper Run for the police run for the police But Amelia who had more presence of mind than her mother stopped Jemima as she was making to one of the front windows Keep where you are said Amelia They ll come quiet in a minute or two And Amelia no doubt was right Calling for the police when there is a row in the house is like summoning the water engines when the soot is on fire in the kitchen chimney In such cases good management will allow the soot to burn itself out without aid from the water engines In the present instance the police were not called in and I am inclined to think that their presence would not have been advantageous to any of the party Upon my honour I know nothing about her were the first words which Cradell was able to articulate when Lupex under Eames s persuasion at last relaxed his hold Lupex turned round to Miss Spruce with a sardonic grin You hear his words this enemy to domestic bliss Ha ha man tell me whither you have conveyed my wife If you were to give me the Bank of England I don t know said Cradell And I m sure he does not know said missus Roper whose suspicions against Cradell were beginning to subside But as her suspicions subsided her respect for him decreased Such was the case also with Miss Spruce and with Amelia and with Jemima They had all thought him to be a great fool for running away with missus Lupex but now they were beginning to think him a poor creature because he had not done so Had he committed that active folly he would have been an interesting fool But now if as they all suspected he knew no more about missus Lupex than they did he would be a fool without any special interest whatever Of course he doesn t said Eames No more than I do said Amelia His very looks show him innocent said missus Roper Indeed they do said Miss Spruce Lupex turned from one to the other as they thus defended the man whom he suspected and shook his head at each assertion that was made And if he doesn t know who does he asked Haven t I seen it all for the last three months Is it reasonable to suppose that a creature such as she used to domestic comforts all her life should have gone off in this way at dinner time taking with her my property and all her jewels and that nobody should have instigated her nobody assisted her Is that a story to tell to such a man as me You may tell it to the marines mister Lupex as he made this speech was walking about the room and as he finished it he threw his pocket handkerchief with violence on to the floor I know what to do missus Roper he said I know what steps to take I shall put the affair into the hands of my lawyer to morrow morning Then he picked up his handkerchief and walked down into the dining room Of course you know nothing about it said Eames to his friend having run upstairs for the purpose of saying a word to him while he washed his hands What about Maria I don t know where she is if you mean that Of course I mean that What else should I mean And what makes you call her Maria It is wrong I admit it s wrong The word will come out you know Will come out I ll tell you what it is old fellow you ll get yourself into a mess and all for nothing That fellow will have you up before the police for stealing his things But Johnny I know all about it Of course you have not stolen them and of course there was nothing to steal But if you go on calling her Maria you ll find that he ll have a pull on you Men don t call other men s wives names for nothing Of course we ve been friends said Cradell who rather liked this view of the matter Yes you have been friends She s diddled you out of your money and that s the beginning and the end of it And now if you go on showing off your friendship you ll be done out of more money You re making an ass of yourself That s the long and the short of it And what have you made of yourself with that girl There are worse asses than I am yet Master Johnny Eames as he had no answer ready to this counter attack left the room and went downstairs Cradell soon followed him and in a few minutes they were all eating their dinner together at missus Roper s hospitable table Immediately after dinner Lupex took himself away and the conversation upstairs became general on the subject of the lady s departure If I was him I d never ask a question about her but let her go said Amelia Yes and then have all her bills following you wherever you went said Amelia s brother I d sooner have her bills than herself said Eames My belief is that she s been an ill used woman said Cradell If she had a husband that she could respect and have loved and all that sort of thing she would have been a charming woman She s every bit as bad as he is said missus Roper I can t agree with you missus Roper continued the lady s champion Perhaps I ought to understand her position better than any one here and Then that s just what you ought not to do mister Cradell said missus Roper And now the lady of the house spoke out her mind with much maternal dignity and with some feminine severity That s just what a young man like you has no business to know What s a married woman like that to you or you to her or what have you to do with understanding her position When you ve a wife of your own if ever you do have one you ll find you ll have trouble enough then without anybody else interfering with you Not but what I believe you re innocent as a lamb about missus Lupex that is as far as any harm goes But you ve got yourself into all this trouble by meddling and was like enough to get yourself choked upstairs by that man And who s to wonder when you go on pretending to be in love with a woman in that way and she old enough to be your mother What would your mamma say if she saw you at it Ha ha ha laughed Cradell It s all very well your laughing but I hate such folly If I see a young man in love with a young woman I respect him for it and then she looked at Johnny Eames I respect him for it even though he may now and then do things as he shouldn t They most of em does that But to see a young man like you mister Cradell dangling after an old married woman who doesn t know how to behave herself and all just because she lets him to do it ugh an old broomstick with a petticoat on would do just as well It makes me sick to see it and that s the truth of it I don t call it manly and it ain t manly is it Miss Spruce Of course I know nothing about it said the lady to whom the appeal was thus made But a young gentleman should keep himself to himself till the time comes for him to speak out begging your pardon all the same mister Cradell I don t see what a married woman should want with any one after her but her own husband said Amelia And perhaps not always that said John Eames It was about an hour after this when the front door bell was rung and a scream from Jemima announced to them all that some critical moment had arrived Amelia jumping up opened the door and then the rustle of a woman s dress was heard on the lower stairs Oh laws ma am you have given us sich a turn said Jemima We all thought you was run away It s missus Lupex said Amelia And in two minutes more that ill used lady was in the room Well my dears said she gaily I hope nobody has waited dinner No we didn t wait dinner said missus Roper very gravely And where s my Orson Didn t he dine at home mister Cradell will you oblige me by taking my shawl But perhaps you had better not People are so censorious ain t they Miss Spruce mister Eames shall do it and everybody knows that that will be quite safe Won t it Miss Amelia Quite I should think said Amelia And missus Lupex knew that she was not to look for an ally in that quarter on the present occasion Eames got up to take the shawl and missus Lupex went on And didn t Orson dine at home Perhaps they kept him down at the theatre But I ve been thinking all day what fun it would be when he thought his bird was flown He did dine at home said missus Roper and he didn t seem to like it There wasn t much fun I can assure you Ah wasn t there though I believe that man would like to have me tied to his button hole I came across a few friends lady friends mister Cradell though two of them had their husbands so we made a party and just went down to Hampton Court So my gentleman has gone again has he That s what I get for gadding about myself isn t it Miss Spruce missus Roper as she went to bed that night made up her mind that whatever might be the cost and trouble of doing so she would lose no further time in getting rid of her married guests CHAPTER XLII LILY S BEDSIDE Lily Dale s constitution was good and her recovery was retarded by no relapse or lingering debility but nevertheless she was forced to keep her bed for many days after the fever had left her During all this period doctor Crofts came every day It was in vain that missus Dale begged him not to do so telling him in simple words that she felt herself bound not to accept from him all this continuation of his unremunerated labours now that the absolute necessity for them was over He answered her only by little jokes or did not answer her at all but still he came daily almost always at the same hour just as the day was waning so that he could sit for a quarter of an hour in the dusk and then ride home to Guestwick in the dark At this time Bell had been admitted into her sister s room and she would always meet doctor Crofts at Lily s bedside but she never sat with him alone since the day on which he had offered her his love with half articulated words and she had declined it with words also half articulated She had seen him alone since that on the stairs or standing in the hall but she had not remained with him talking to him after her old fashion and no further word of his love had been spoken in speech either half or wholly articulate Nor had Bell spoken of what had passed to any one else Lily would probably have told both her mother and sister instantly but then no such scene as that which had taken place with Bell would have been possible with Lily In whatever way the matter might have gone with her there would certainly have been some clear tale to tell when the interview was over She would have known whether or no she loved the man or could love him and would have given him some true and intelligible answer Bell had not done so but had given him an answer which if true was not intelligible and if intelligible was not true And yet when she had gone away to think over what had passed she had been happy and satisfied and almost triumphant She had never yet asked herself whether she expected anything further from doctor Crofts nor what that something further might be and yet she was happy Lily had now become pert and saucy in her bed taking upon herself the little airs which are allowed to a convalescent invalid as compensation for previous suffering and restraint She pretended to much anxiety on the subject of her dinner and declared that she would go out on such or such a day let doctor Crofts be as imperious as he might He s an old savage after all she said to her sister one evening after he was gone and just as bad as the rest of them I do not know who the rest of them are said Bell but at any rate he s not very old You know what I mean He s just as grumpy as doctor Gruffen and thinks everybody is to do what he tells them Of course you take his part And of course you ought seeing how good he has been And of course I should to anybody but you I do like to abuse him to you Lily Lily So I do It s so hard to knock any fire out of you that when one does find the place where the flint lies one can t help hammering at it What did he mean by saying that I shouldn t get up on Sunday Of course I shall get up if I like it Not if mamma asks you not Oh but she won t unless he interferes and dictates to her Oh Bell what a tyrant he would be if he were married Would he And how submissive you would be if you were his wife It s a thousand pities that you are not in love with each other that is if you are not Lily I thought that there was a promise between us about that Ah but that was in other days Things are all altered since that promise was given all the world has been altered And as she said this the tone of her voice was changed and it had become almost sad I feel as though I ought to be allowed now to speak about anything I please You shall if it pleases you my pet You see how it is Bell I can never again have anything of my own to talk about Oh my darling do not say that But it is so Bell and why not say it Do you think I never say it to myself in the hours when I am all alone thinking over it thinking thinking thinking You must not you must not grudge to let me talk of it sometimes I will not grudge you anything only I cannot believe that it must be so always Ask yourself Bell how it would be with you But I sometimes fancy that you measure me differently from yourself Indeed I do for I know how much better you are I am not so much better as to be ever able to forget all that I know I never shall do so I have made up my mind about it clearly and with an absolute certainty Lily Lily Lily pray do not say so But I do say it And yet I have not been very mopish and melancholy have I Bell I do think I deserve some little credit and yet I declare you won t allow me the least privilege in the world What privilege would you wish me to give you To talk about doctor Crofts Lily you are a wicked wicked tyrant And Bell leaned over her and fell upon her and kissed her hiding her own face in the gloom of the evening After that it came to be an accepted understanding between them that Bell was not altogether indifferent to doctor Crofts You heard what he said my darling missus Dale said the next day as the three were in the room together after doctor Crofts was gone missus Dale was standing on one side of the bed and Bell on the other while Lily was scolding them both You can get up for an hour or two to morrow but he thinks you had better not go out of the room What would be the good of that mamma I am so tired of looking always at the same paper It is such a tiresome paper It makes one count the pattern over and over again I wonder how you ever can live here I ve got used to it you see I never can get used to that sort of thing but go on counting and counting and counting I ll tell you what I should like and I m sure it would be the best thing too And what would you like said Bell Just to get up at nine o clock to morrow and go to church as though nothing had happened Then when doctor Crofts came in the evening you would tell him I was down at the school I wouldn t quite advise that said missus Dale It would give him such a delightful start And when he found I didn t die immediately as of course I ought to do according to rule he would be so disgusted It would be very ungrateful to say the least of it said Bell No it wouldn t a bit He needn t come unless he likes it And I don t believe he comes to see me at all It s all very well mamma your looking in that way but I m sure it s true And I ll tell you what I ll do I ll pretend to be bad again otherwise the poor man will be robbed of his only happiness I suppose we must allow her to say what she likes till she gets well said missus Dale laughing It was now nearly dark and missus Dale did not see that Bell s hand had crept under the bed clothes and taken hold of that of her sister It s true mamma continued Lily and I defy her to deny it I would forgive him for keeping me in bed if he would only make her fall in love with him She has made a bargain mamma said Bell that she is to say whatever she likes till she gets well I am to say whatever I like always that was the bargain and I mean to stand to it On the following Sunday Lily did get up but did not leave her mother s bedroom There she was seated in that half dignified and half luxurious state which belongs to the first getting up of an invalid when doctor Crofts called There she had eaten her tiny bit of roast mutton and had called her mother a stingy old creature because she would not permit another morsel and there she had drunk her half glass of port wine pretending that it was very bad and twice worse than the doctor s physic and there Sunday though it was she had fully enjoyed the last hour of daylight reading that exquisite new novel which had just completed itself amidst the jarring criticisms of the youth and age of the reading public I am quite sure she was right in accepting him Bell she said putting down the book as the light was fading and beginning to praise the story It was a matter of course said Bell It always is right in the novels That s why I don t like them They are too sweet That s why I do like them because they are so sweet A sermon is not to tell you what you are but what you ought to be and a novel should tell you not what you are to get but what you d like to get If so then I d go back to the old school and have the heroine really a heroine walking all the way up from Edinburgh to London and falling among thieves or else nursing a wounded hero and describing the battle from the window We ve got tired of that or else the people who write can t do it now a days But if we are to have real life let it be real No Bell no said Lily Real life sometimes is so painful Then her sister in a moment was down on the floor at her feet kissing her hand and caressing her knees and praying that the wound might be healed On that morning Lily had succeeded in inducing her sister to tell her all that had been said by doctor Crofts All that had been said by herself also Bell had intended to tell but when she came to this part of the story her account was very lame I don t think I said anything she said But silence always gives consent He ll know that Lily had rejoined No he will not my silence didn t give any consent I m sure of that And he didn t think that it did But you didn t mean to refuse him I think I did I don t think I knew what I meant and it was safer therefore to look no than to look yes If I didn t say it I m sure I looked it But you wouldn t refuse him now asked Lily
5712_48842_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know said Bell 
none	none	It seems as though I should want years to make up my mind and he won t ask me again Bell was still at her sister s feet caressing them and praying with all her heart that that wound might be healed in due time when missus Dale came in and announced the doctor s daily visit Then I ll go said Bell Indeed you won t said Lily He s coming simply to make a morning call and nobody need run away Now doctor Crofts you need not come and stand over me with your watch for I won t let you touch my hand except to shake hands with me and then she held her hand out to him And all you ll know of my tongue you ll learn from the sound I don t care in the least for your tongue I dare say not and yet you may some of these days I can speak out if I like it can t I mamma I should think doctor Crofts knows that by this time my dear I don t know There are some things gentlemen are very slow to learn But you must sit down doctor Crofts and make yourself comfortable and polite for you must understand that you are not master here any longer I am out of bed now and your reign is over That s the gratitude of the world all through said missus Dale Who is ever grateful to a doctor He only cures you that he may triumph over some other doctor and declare as he goes by doctor Gruffen s door There had she called you in she d have been dead before now or else would have been ill for twelve months Don t you jump for joy when doctor Gruffen s patients die Of course I do out in the market place so that everybody shall see me said the doctor Lily how can you say such shocking things said her sister Then the doctor did sit down and they were all very cosy together over the fire talking about things which were not medical or only half medical in their appliance By degrees the conversation came round to missus Eames and to John Eames Two or three days since Crofts had told missus Dale of that affair at the railway station of which up to that time she had heard nothing missus Dale when she was assured that young Eames had given Crosbie a tremendous thrashing the tidings of the affair which had got themselves substantiated at Guestwick so described the nature of the encounter could not withhold some meed of applause Dear boy she said almost involuntarily Dear boy it came from the honestness of his heart And then she gave special injunctions to the doctor injunctions which were surely unnecessary that no word of the matter should be whispered before Lily I was at the manor yesterday said the doctor and the earl would talk about nothing but Master Johnny He says he s the finest fellow going Whereupon missus Dale touched him with her foot fearing that the conversation might be led away in the direction of Johnny s prowess I am so glad said Lily I always knew that they d find John out at last And Lady Julia is just as fond of him said the doctor Dear me said Lily Suppose they were to make up a match Lily how can you be so absurd Let me see what relation would he be to us He would certainly be Bernard s uncle and uncle Christopher s half brother in law Wouldn t it be odd It would rather said missus Dale I hope he ll be civil to Bernard Don t you Bell Is he to give up the Income tax Office doctor Crofts I didn t hear that that was settled yet And so they went on talking about John Eames Joking apart said Lily I am very glad that Lord De Guest has taken him by the hand Not that I think an earl is better than anybody else but because it shows that people are beginning to understand that he has got something in him I always said that they who laughed at John would see him hold up his head yet All which words sank deep into missus Dale s mind If only in some coming time her pet might be taught to love this new young hero But then would not that last heroic deed of his militate most strongly against any possibility of such love And now I may as well be going said the doctor rising from his chair At this time Bell had left the room but missus Dale was still there You need not be in such a hurry especially this evening said Lily Why especially this evening Because it will be the last Sit down again doctor Crofts I ve got a little speech to make to you I ve been preparing it all the morning and you must give me an opportunity of speaking it I ll come the day after to morrow and I ll hear it then But I choose sir that you should hear it now Am I not to be obeyed when I first get up on to my own throne Dear dear doctor Crofts how am I to thank you for all that you have done How are any of us to thank him said missus Dale I hate thanks said the doctor One kind glance of the eye is worth them all and I ve had many such in this house You have our hearts love at any rate said missus Dale God bless you all said he as he prepared to go But I haven t made my speech yet said Lily And to tell the truth mamma you must go away or I shall never be able to make it It s very improper is it not turning you out but it shall only take three minutes Then missus Dale with some little joking word left the room but as she left it her mind was hardly at ease Ought she to have gone leaving it to Lily s discretion to say what words she might think fit to doctor Crofts Hitherto she had never doubted her daughters not even their discretion and therefore it had been natural to her to go when she was bidden But as she went downstairs she had her doubts whether she was right or no doctor Crofts said Lily as soon as they were alone Sit down there close to me I want to ask you a question What was it you said to Bell when you were alone with her the other evening in the parlour The doctor sat for a moment without answering and Lily who was watching him closely could see by the light of the fire that he had been startled had almost shuddered as the question was asked him What did I say to her and he repeated her words in a very low voice I asked her if she could love me and be my wife And what answer did she make to you What answer did she make She simply refused me No no no don t believe her doctor Crofts It was not so I think it was not so Mind you I can say nothing as coming from her She has not told me her own mind But if you really love her she will be mad to refuse you I do love her Lily that at any rate is true Then go to her again I am speaking for myself now I cannot afford to lose such a brother as you would be I love you so dearly that I cannot spare you And she I think she ll learn to love you as you would wish to be loved You know her nature how silent she is and averse to talk about herself She has confessed nothing to me but this that you spoke to her and took her by surprise Are we to have another chance I know how wrong I am to ask such a question But after all is not the truth the best Another chance I know what you mean and I think she is worthy to be your wife I do indeed and if so she must be very worthy You won t tell of me will you now doctor No I won t tell of you And you ll try again Yes I ll try again God bless you my brother I hope I hope you ll be my brother Then as he put out his hand to her once more she raised her head towards him and he stooping down kissed her forehead Make mamma come to me were the last words she spoke as he went out at the door So you ve made your speech said missus Dale Yes mamma I hope it was a discreet speech I hope it was mamma But it has made me so tired and I believe I ll go to bed Do you know I don t think I should have done much good down at the school to day Then missus Dale in her anxiety to repair what injury might have been done to her daughter by over exertion omitted any further mention of the farewell speech doctor Crofts as he rode home enjoyed but little of the triumph of a successful lover It may be that she s right he said to himself and at any rate I ll ask again Nevertheless that No which Bell had spoken and had repeated still sounded in his ears harsh and conclusive There are men to whom a peal of noes rattling about their ears never takes the sound of a true denial and others to whom the word once pronounced be it whispered ever so softly comes as though it were an unchangeable verdict from the supreme judgment seat CHAPTER XLIII FIE FIE ILLUSTRATION untitled Will any reader remember the loves no not the loves that word is so decidedly ill applied as to be incapable of awakening the remembrance of any reader but the flirtations of Lady Dumbello and mister Plantagenet Palliser Those flirtations as they had been carried on at Courcy Castle were laid bare in all their enormities to the eye of the public and it must be confessed that if the eye of the public was shocked that eye must be shocked very easily But the eye of the public was shocked and people who were particular as to their morals said very strange things Lady De Courcy herself said very strange things indeed shaking her head and dropping mysterious words whereas Lady Clandidlem spoke much more openly declaring her opinion that Lady Dumbello would be off before May They both agreed that it would not be altogether bad for Lord Dumbello that he should lose his wife but shook their heads very sadly when they spoke of poor Plantagenet Palliser As to the lady s fate that lady whom they had both almost worshipped during the days at Courcy Castle they did not seem to trouble themselves about that And it must be admitted that mister Palliser had been a little imprudent imprudent that is if he knew anything about the rumours afloat seeing that soon after his visit at Courcy Castle he had gone down to Lady Hartletop s place in Shropshire at which the Dumbellos intended to spend the winter and on leaving it had expressed his intention of returning in February The Hartletop people had pressed him very much the pressure having come with peculiar force from Lord Dumbello Therefore it is reasonable to suppose that the Hartletop people had at any rate not heard of the rumour mister Plantagenet Palliser spent his Christmas with his uncle the Duke of Omnium at Gatherum Castle That is to say he reached the castle in time for dinner on Christmas eve and left it on the morning after Christmas day This was in accordance with the usual practice of his life and the tenants dependants and followers of the Omnium interest were always delighted to see this manifestation of a healthy English domestic family feeling between the duke and his nephew But the amount of intercourse on such occasions between them was generally trifling The duke would smile as he put out his right hand to his nephew and say Well Plantagenet very busy I suppose The duke was the only living being who called him Plantagenet to his face though there were some scores of men who talked of Planty Pal behind his back The duke had been the only living being so to call him Let us hope that it still was so and that there had arisen no feminine exception dangerous in its nature and improper in its circumstances Well Plantagenet said the duke on the present occasion very busy I suppose Yes indeed duke said mister Palliser When a man gets the harness on him he does not easily get quit of it The duke remembered that his nephew had made almost the same remark at his last Christmas visit By the by said the duke I want to say a word or two to you before you go Such a proposition on the duke s part was a great departure from his usual practice but the nephew of course undertook to obey his uncle s behests I ll see you before dinner to morrow said Plantagenet Ah do said the duke I ll not keep you five minutes And at six o clock on the following afternoon the two were closeted together in the duke s private room I don t suppose there is much in it began the duke but people are talking about you and Lady Dumbello Upon my word people are very kind And mister Palliser bethought himself of the fact for it certainly was a fact that people for a great many years had talked about his uncle and Lady Dumbello s mother in law Yes kind enough are they not You ve just come from Hartlebury I believe Hartlebury was the Marquis of Hartletop s seat in Shropshire Yes I have And I m going there again in February Ah I m sorry for that Not that I mean of course to interfere with your arrangements You will acknowledge that I have not often done so in any matter whatever No you have not said the nephew comforting himself with an inward assurance that no such interference on his uncle s part could have been possible But in this instance it would suit me and I really think it would suit you too that you should be as little at Hartlebury as possible You have said you would go there and of course you will go But if I were you I would not stay above a day or two mister Plantagenet Palliser received everything he had in the world from his uncle He sat in Parliament through his uncle s interest and received an allowance of ever so many thousand a year which his uncle could stop to morrow by his mere word He was his uncle s heir and the dukedom with certain entailed properties must ultimately fall to him unless his uncle should marry and have a son But by far the greater portion of the duke s property was unentailed the duke might probably live for the next twenty years or more and it was quite possible that if offended he might marry and become a father It may be said that no man could well be more dependent on another than Plantagenet Palliser was upon his uncle and it may be said also that no father or uncle ever troubled his heir with less interference Nevertheless the nephew immediately felt himself aggrieved by this allusion to his private life and resolved at once that he would not submit to such surveillance I don t know how long I shall stay said he but I cannot say that my visit will be influenced one way or the other by such a rumour as that No probably not But it may perhaps be influenced by my request And the duke as he spoke looked a little savage You wouldn t ask me to regard a report that has no foundation I am not asking about its foundation Nor do I in the least wish to interfere with your manner in life By which last observation the duke intended his nephew to understand that he was quite at liberty to take away any other gentleman s wife but that he was not at liberty to give occasion even for a surmise that he wanted to take Lord Dumbello s wife The fact is this Plantagenet I have for many years been intimate with that family I have not many intimacies and shall probably never increase them Such friends as I have I wish to keep and you will easily perceive that any such report as that which I have mentioned might make it unpleasant for me to go to Hartlebury or for the Hartlebury people to come here The duke certainly could not have spoken plainer and mister Palliser understood him thoroughly Two such alliances between the two families could not be expected to run pleasantly together and even the rumour of any such second alliance might interfere with the pleasantness of the former one That s all said the duke It s a most absurd slander said mister Palliser I dare say Those slanders always are absurd but what can we do We can t tie up people s tongues And the duke looked as though he wished to have the subject considered as finished and to be left alone But we can disregard them said the nephew indiscreetly You may I have never been able to do so And yet I believe I have not earned for myself the reputation of being subject to the voices of men You think that I am asking much of you but you should remember that hitherto I have given much and have asked nothing I expect you to oblige me in this matter Then mister Plantagenet Palliser left the room knowing that he had been threatened What the duke had said amounted to this If you go on dangling after Lady Dumbello I ll stop the seven thousand a year which I give you I ll oppose your next return at Silverbridge and I ll make a will and leave away from you Matching and The Horns a beautiful little place in Surrey the use of which had been already offered to mister Palliser in the event of his marriage all the Littlebury estate in Yorkshire and the enormous Scotch property Of my personal goods and money invested in loans shares and funds you shall never touch a shilling or the value of a shilling And if I find that I can suit myself it may be that I ll leave you plain mister Plantagenet Palliser with a little first cousin for the head of your family The full amount of this threat mister Palliser understood and as he thought of it he acknowledged to himself that he had never felt for Lady Dumbello anything like love No conversation between them had ever been warmer than that of which the reader has seen a sample Lady Dumbello had been nothing to him But now now that the matter had been put before him in this way might it not become him as a gentleman to fall in love with so very beautiful a woman whose name had already been linked with his own We all know that story of the priest who by his question in the confessional taught the ostler to grease the horses teeth I never did yet said the ostler but I ll have a try at it In this case the duke had acted the part of the priest and mister Palliser before the night was over had almost become as ready a pupil as the ostler As to the threat it would ill become him as a Palliser and a Plantagenet to regard it The duke would not marry Of all men in the world he was the least likely to spite his own face by cutting off his own nose and for the rest of it mister Palliser would take his chance Therefore he went down to Hartlebury early in February having fully determined to be very particular in his attentions to Lady Dumbello Among a houseful of people at Hartlebury he found Lord Porlock a slight sickly worn out looking man who had something about his eye of his father s hardness but nothing in his mouth of his father s ferocity So your sister is going to be married said mister Palliser Yes One has no right to be surprised at anything they do when one remembers the life their father leads them I was going to congratulate you Don t do that I met him at Courcy and rather liked him mister Palliser had barely spoken to mister Crosbie at Courcy but then in the usual course of his social life he seldom did more than barely speak to anybody Did you said Lord Porlock For the poor girl s sake I hope he s not a ruffian How any man should propose to my father to marry a daughter out of his house is more than I can understand How was my mother looking I didn t see anything amiss about her I expect that he ll murder her some day Then that conversation came to an end mister Palliser himself perceived as he looked at her he could not but perceive that a certain amount of social energy seemed to enliven Lady Dumbello when he approached her She was given to smile when addressed but her usual smile was meaningless almost leaden and never in any degree flattering to the person to whom it was accorded Very many women smile as they answer the words which are spoken to them and most who do so flatter by their smile The thing is so common that no one thinks of it The flattering pleases but means nothing The impression unconsciously taken simply conveys a feeling that the woman has made herself agreeable as it was her duty to do agreeable as far as that smile went in some very infinitesimal degree But she has thereby made her little contribution to society She will make the same contribution a hundred times in the same evening No one knows that she has flattered anybody she does not know it herself and the world calls her an agreeable woman But Lady Dumbello put no flattery into her customary smiles They were cold unmeaning accompanied by no special glance of the eye and seldom addressed to the individual They were given to the room at large and the room at large acknowledging her great pretensions accepted them as sufficient But when mister Palliser came near to her she would turn herself slightly ever so slightly on her seat and would allow her eyes to rest for a moment upon his face Then when he remarked that it had been rather cold she would smile actually upon him as she acknowledged the truth of his observation All this mister Palliser taught himself to observe having been instructed by his foolish uncle in that lesson as to the greasing of the horses teeth But nevertheless during the first week of his stay at Hartlebury he did not say a word to her more tender than his observation about the weather It is true that he was very busy He had undertaken to speak upon the address and as Parliament was now about to be opened and as his speech was to be based upon statistics he was full of figures and papers His correspondence was pressing and the day was seldom long enough for his purposes He felt that the intimacy to which he aspired was hindered by the laborious routine of his life but nevertheless he would do something before he left Hartlebury to show the special nature of his regard He would say something to her that should open to her view the secret of shall we say his heart Such was his resolve day after day And yet day after day went by and nothing was said He fancied that Lord Dumbello was somewhat less friendly in his manner than he had been that he put himself in the way and looked cross but as he declared to himself he cared very little for Lord Dumbello s looks When do you go to town he said to her one evening Probably in April We certainly shall not leave Hartlebury before that Ah yes You stay for the hunting Yes Lord Dumbello always remains here through March He may run up to town for a day or two How comfortable I must be in London on Thursday you know When Parliament meets I suppose Exactly It is such a bore but one has to do it When a man makes a business of it I suppose he must Oh dear yes it s quite imperative Then mister Palliser looked round the room and thought he saw Lord Dumbello s eye fixed upon him It was really very hard work If the truth must be told he did not know how to begin What was he to say to her How was he to commence a conversation that should end by being tender She was very handsome certainly and for him she could look interesting but for his very life he did not know how to begin to say anything special to her A liaison with such a woman as Lady Dumbello platonic innocent but nevertheless very intimate would certainly lend a grace to his life which under its present circumstances was rather dry He was told told by public rumour which had reached him through his uncle that the lady was willing She certainly looked as though she liked him but how was he to begin The art of startling the House of Commons and frightening the British public by the voluminous accuracy of his statistics he had already learned but what was he to say to a pretty woman You ll be sure to be in London in April This was on another occasion Oh yes I think so In Carlton Gardens I suppose Yes Lord Dumbello has got a lease of the house now Has he indeed Ah it s an excellent house I hope I shall be allowed to call there sometimes Certainly only I know you must be so busy Not on Saturdays and Sundays I always receive on Sundays said Lady Dumbello mister Palliser felt that there was nothing peculiarly gracious in this A permission to call when all her other acquaintances would be there was not much but still perhaps it was as much as he could expect to obtain on that occasion He looked up and saw that Lord Dumbello s eyes were again upon him and that Lord Dumbello s brow was black He began to doubt whether a country house where all the people were thrown together was the best place in the world for such manoeuvring Lady Dumbello was very handsome and he liked to look at her but he could not find any subject on which to interest her in that drawing room at Hartlebury Later in the evening he found himself saying something to her about the sugar duties and then he knew that he had better give it up He had only one day more and that was required imperatively for his speech The matter would go much easier in London and he would postpone it till then In the crowded rooms of London private conversation would be much easier and Lord Dumbello wouldn t stand over and look at him Lady Dumbello had taken his remarks about the sugar very kindly and had asked for a definition of an ad valorem duty It was a nearer approach to a real conversation than he had ever before made but the subject had been unlucky and could not in his hands be brought round to anything tender so he resolved to postpone his gallantry till the London spring should make it easy and felt as he did so that he was relieved for the time from a heavy weight Good by Lady Dumbello he said on the next evening I start early to morrow morning Good by mister Palliser As she spoke she smiled ever so sweetly but she certainly had not learned to call him Plantagenet as yet He went up to London and immediately got himself to work The accurate and voluminous speech came off with considerable credit to himself credit of that quiet enduring kind which is accorded to such men The speech was respectable dull and correct Men listened to it or sat with their hats over their eyes asleep pretending to do so and the Daily Jupiter in the morning had a leading article about it which however left the reader at its close altogether in doubt whether mister Palliser might be supposed to be a great financial pundit or no mister Palliser might become a shining light to the moneyed world and a glory to the banking interests he might be a future Chancellor of the Exchequer But then again it might turn out that in these affairs he was a mere ignis fatuus a blind guide a man to be laid aside as very respectable but of no depth Who then at the present time could judiciously risk his credit by declaring whether mister Palliser understood his subject or did not understand it We are not content in looking to our newspapers for all the information that earth and human intellect can afford but we demand from them what we might demand if a daily sheet could come to us from the world of spirits The result of course is this that the papers do pretend that they have come daily from the world of spirits but the oracles are very doubtful as were those of old Plantagenet Palliser though he was contented with this article felt as he sat in his chambers in the Albany that something else was wanting to his happiness This sort of life was all very well Ambition was a grand thing and it became him as a Palliser and a future peer to make politics his profession But might he not spare an hour or two for Amaryllis in the shade Was it not hard this life of his Since he had been told that Lady Dumbello smiled upon him he had certainly thought more about her smiles than had been good for his statistics It seemed as though a new vein in his body had been brought into use and that blood was running where blood had never run before If he had seen Lady Dumbello before Dumbello had seen her might he not have married her Ah in such case as that had she been simply Miss Grantly or Lady Griselda Grantly as the case might have been he thought he might have been able to speak to her with more ease As it was he certainly had found the task difficult down in the country though he had heard of men of his class doing the same sort of thing all his life For my own part I believe that the reputed sinners are much more numerous than the sinners As he sat there a certain mister Fothergill came in upon him mister Fothergill was a gentleman who managed most of his uncle s ordinary affairs a clever fellow who knew on which side his bread was buttered mister Fothergill was naturally anxious to stand well with the heir but to stand well with the owner was his business in life and with that business he never allowed anything to interfere On this occasion mister Fothergill was very civil complimenting his future possible patron on his very powerful speech and predicting for him political power with much more certainty than the newspapers which had or had not come from the world of spirits mister Fothergill had come in to say a word or two about some matter of business As all mister Palliser s money passed through mister Fothergill s hands and as his electioneering interests were managed by mister Fothergill mister Fothergill not unfrequently called to say a necessary word or two When this was done he said another word or two which might be necessary or not as the case might be mister Palliser said he I wonder you don t think of marrying I hope you ll excuse me mister Palliser was by no means sure that he would excuse him and sat himself suddenly upright in his chair in a manner that was intended to exhibit a first symptom of outraged dignity But singularly enough he had himself been thinking of marriage at that moment How would it have been with him had he known the beautiful Griselda before the Dumbello alliance had been arranged Would he have married her Would he have been comfortable if he had married her Of course he could not marry now seeing that he was in love with Lady Dumbello and that the lady in question unfortunately had a husband of her own but though he had been thinking of marrying he did not like to have the subject thus roughly thrust before his eyes and as it were into his very lap by his uncle s agent mister Fothergill no doubt saw the first symptom of outraged dignity for he was a clever sharp man But perhaps he did not in truth much regard it Perhaps he had received instructions which he was bound to regard above all other matters I hope you ll excuse me mister Palliser I do indeed but I say it because I am half afraid of some some some diminution of good feeling perhaps I had better call it between you and your uncle Anything of that kind would be such a monstrous pity I am not aware of any such probability This mister Palliser said with considerable dignity but when the words were spoken he bethought himself whether he had not told a fib No perhaps not I trust there is no such probability But the duke is a very determined man if he takes anything into his head and then he has so much in his power He has not me in his power mister Fothergill No no no One man does not have another in his power in this country not in that way but then you know mister Palliser it would hardly do to offend him would it I would rather not offend him as is natural Indeed I do not wish to offend any one Exactly so and least of all the duke who has the whole property in his own hands We may say the whole for he can marry to morrow if he pleases And then his life is so good I don t know a stouter man of his age anywhere I m very glad to hear it I m sure you are mister Palliser But if he were to take offence you know I should put up with it Yes exactly that s what you would do But it would be worth while to avoid it seeing how much he has in his power Has the duke sent you to me now mister Fothergill No no no nothing of the sort But he dropped words the other day which made me fancy that he was not quite quite quite at ease about you I have long known that he would be very glad indeed to see an heir born to the property The other morning I don t know whether there was anything in it but I fancied he was going to make some change in the present arrangements He did not do it and it might have been fancy Only think mister Palliser what one word of his might do If he says a word he never goes back from it Then having said so much mister Fothergill went his way mister Palliser understood the meaning of all this very well It was not the first occasion on which mister Fothergill had given him advice advice such as mister Fothergill himself had no right to give him He always received such counsel with an air of half injured dignity intending thereby to explain to mister Fothergill that he was intruding But he knew well whence the advice came and though in all such cases he had made up his mind not to follow such counsel it had generally come to pass that mister Palliser s conduct had more or less accurately conformed itself to mister Fothergill s advice A word from the duke might certainly do a great deal mister Palliser resolved that in that affair of Lady Dumbello he would follow his own devices But nevertheless it was undoubtedly true that a word from the duke might do a great deal We who are in the secret know how far mister Palliser had already progressed in his iniquitous passion before he left Hartlebury Others who were perhaps not so well informed gave him credit for a much more advanced success Lady Clandidlem in her letter to Lady De Courcy written immediately after the departure of mister Palliser declared that having heard of that gentleman s intended matutinal departure she had confidently expected to learn at the breakfast table that Lady Dumbello had flown with him From the tone of her ladyship s language it seemed as though she had been robbed of an anticipated pleasure by Lady Dumbello s prolonged sojourn in the halls of her husband s ancestors I feel however quite convinced said Lady Clandidlem that it cannot go on longer than the spring I never yet saw a man so infatuated as mister Palliser He did not leave her for one moment all the time he was here No one but Lady Hartletop would have permitted it But you know there is nothing so pleasant as good old family friendships CHAPTER XLIV VALENTINE S DAY AT ALLINGTON Lily had exacted a promise from her mother before her illness and during the period of her convalescence often referred to it reminding her mother that that promise had been made and must be kept 
5712_48842_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Lily was to be told the day on which Crosbie was to be married It had come to the knowledge of them all that the marriage was to take place in February 
5712_48842_000002_000002	train-clean-360	But this was not sufficient for Lily 
5712_48842_000002_000003	train-clean-360	She must know the day 
5712_48842_000003_000000	train-clean-360	And as the time drew nearer Lily becoming stronger the while and less subject to medical authority the marriage of Crosbie and Alexandrina was spoken of much more frequently at the Small House It was not a subject which missus Dale or Bell would have chosen for conversation but Lily would refer to it 
5712_48842_000003_000001	train-clean-360	She would begin by doing so almost in a drolling strain alluding to herself as a forlorn damsel in a play book and then she would go on to speak of his interests as a matter which was still of great moment to her 
5712_48842_000003_000002	train-clean-360	But in the course of such talking she would too often break down showing by some sad word or melancholy tone how great was the burden on her heart 
5712_48842_000003_000003	train-clean-360	missus Dale and Bell would willingly have avoided the subject but Lily would not have it avoided 
5712_48842_000003_000004	train-clean-360	For them it was a very difficult matter on which to speak in her hearing 
none	none	It was not permitted to them to say a word of abuse against Crosbie as to whom they thought that no word of condemnation could be sufficiently severe and they were forced to listen to such excuses for his conduct as Lily chose to manufacture never daring to point out how vain those excuses were Indeed in those days Lily reigned as a queen at the Small House Ill usage and illness together falling into her hands had given her such power that none of the other women were able to withstand it Nothing was said about it but it was understood by them all Jane and the cook included that Lily was for the time paramount She was a dear gracious loving brave queen and no one was anxious to rebel only that those praises of Crosbie were so very bitter in the ears of her subjects 
5712_48842_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The day was named soon enough and the tidings came down to Allington 
5712_48842_000004_000003	train-clean-360	On the fourteenth of February Crosbie was to be made a happy man 
5712_48842_000004_000004	train-clean-360	This was not known to the Dales till the twelfth and they would willingly have spared the knowledge then had it been possible to spare it 
5712_48842_000004_000005	train-clean-360	But it was not so and on that evening Lily was told 
5712_48842_000005_000000	train-clean-360	During these days Bell used to see her uncle daily 
5712_48842_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Her visits were made with the pretence of taking to him information as to Lily s health but there was perhaps at the bottom of them a feeling that as the family intended to leave the Small House at the end of March it would be well to let the squire know that there was no enmity in their hearts against him 
5712_48842_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing more had been said about their moving nothing that is from them to him 
5712_48842_000005_000003	train-clean-360	But the matter was going on and he knew it 
5712_48842_000005_000004	train-clean-360	doctor Crofts was already in treaty on their behalf for a small furnished house at Guestwick 
5712_48842_000005_000005	train-clean-360	The squire was very sad about it very sad indeed 
5712_48842_000005_000006	train-clean-360	When Hopkins spoke to him on the subject he sharply desired that faithful gardener to hold his tongue giving it to be understood that such things were not to be made matter of talk by the Allington dependants till they had been officially announced 
5712_48842_000005_000007	train-clean-360	With Bell during these visits he never alluded to the matter 
5712_48842_000005_000008	train-clean-360	She was the chief sinner in that she had refused to marry her cousin and had declined even to listen to rational counsel upon the matter 
5712_48842_000005_000009	train-clean-360	But the squire felt that he could not discuss the subject with her seeing that he had been specially informed by missus Dale that his interference would not be permitted and then he was perhaps aware that if he did discuss the subject with Bell he would not gain much by such discussion 
5712_48842_000005_000010	train-clean-360	Their conversation therefore generally fell upon Crosbie and the tone in which he was mentioned in the Great House was very different from that assumed in Lily s presence 
none	none	He ll be a wretched man said the squire when he told Bell of the day that had been fixed
5712_48842_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t want him to be wretched said Bell 
5712_48842_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 But I can hardly think that he can act as he has done without being punished 
5712_48842_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 He will be a wretched man 
5712_48842_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He gets no fortune with her and she will expect everything that fortune can give 
5712_48842_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I believe too that she is older than he is 
none	none	I cannot understand it Upon my word I cannot understand how a man can be such a knave and such a fool 
5712_48842_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Give my love to Lily 
5712_48842_000008_000006	train-clean-360	I ll see her to morrow or the next day 
5712_48842_000008_000007	train-clean-360	She s well rid of him I m sure of that though I suppose it would not do to tell her so 
5712_48842_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The morning of the fourteenth came upon them at the Small House as comes the morning of those special days which have been long considered and which are to be long remembered 
5712_48842_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It brought with it a hard bitter frost a black biting frost such a frost as breaks the water pipes and binds the ground to the hardness of granite Lily queen as she was had not yet been allowed to go back to her own chamber but occupied the larger bed in her mother s room her mother sleeping on a smaller one 
5712_48842_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Mamma she said how cold they ll be Her mother had announced to her the fact of the black frost and these were the first words she spoke 
5712_48842_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I fear their hearts will be cold also said missus Dale 
5712_48842_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She ought not to have said so 
5712_48842_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She was transgressing the acknowledged rule of the house in saying any word that could be construed as being inimical to Crosbie or his bride 
5712_48842_000011_000003	train-clean-360	But her feeling on the matter was too strong and she could not restrain herself 
5712_48842_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should their hearts be cold 
5712_48842_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Why should their hearts be cold 
5712_48842_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Oh mamma that is a terrible thing to say 
none	none	Why should their hearts be cold I hope it may not be so
5712_48842_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course you do of course we all hope it 
5712_48842_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He was not cold hearted at any rate 
5712_48842_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A man is not cold hearted because he does not know himself 
5712_48842_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Mamma I want you to wish for their happiness 
5712_48842_000015_000000	train-clean-360	missus Dale was silent for a minute or two before she answered this but then she did answer it 
5712_48842_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I think I do said she 
5712_48842_000015_000002	train-clean-360	 I think I do wish for it 
none	none	I am very sure that I do said Lily At this time Lily had her breakfast upstairs but went down into the drawing room in the course of the morning
5712_48842_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 You must be very careful in wrapping yourself as you go downstairs said Bell who stood by the tray on which she had brought up the toast and tea 
5712_48842_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 The cold is what you would call awful 
5712_48842_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I should call it jolly said Lily if I could get up and go out Do you remember lecturing me about talking slang the day that he first came 
5712_48842_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Did I my pet 
none	none	Don t you remember when I called him a swell Ah dear so he was That was the mistake and it was all my own fault as I had seen it from the first 
5712_48842_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Bell for a moment turned her face away and beat with her foot against the ground 
5712_48842_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Her anger was more difficult of restraint than was even her mother s and now not restraining it but wishing to hide it she gave it vent in this way 
5712_48842_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand Bell 
5712_48842_000023_000001	train-clean-360	I know what your foot means when it goes in that way and you shan t do it 
5712_48842_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Come here Bell and let me teach you Christianity 
5712_48842_000023_000003	train-clean-360	I m a fine sort of teacher am I not 
5712_48842_000023_000004	train-clean-360	And I did not quite mean that 
5712_48842_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish I could learn it from some one said Bell 
5712_48842_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 There are circumstances in which what we call Christianity seems to me to be hardly possible 
5712_48842_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 When your foot goes in that way it is a very unchristian foot and you ought to keep it still 
5712_48842_000025_000001	train-clean-360	It means anger against him because he discovered before it was too late that he would not be happy that is that he and I would not be happy together if we were married 
5712_48842_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t scrutinize my foot too closely Lily 
5712_48842_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But your foot must bear scrutiny and your eyes and your voice 
5712_48842_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He was very foolish to fall in love with me 
5712_48842_000027_000002	train-clean-360	And so was I very foolish to let him love me at a moment s notice without a thought as it were 
5712_48842_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I was so proud of having him that I gave myself up to him all at once without giving him a chance of thinking of it 
5712_48842_000027_000004	train-clean-360	In a week or two it was done 
5712_48842_000027_000005	train-clean-360	Who could expect that such an engagement should be lasting 
none	none	And why not That is nonsense Lily 
5712_48842_000028_000002	train-clean-360	But we will not talk about it 
none	none	Ah but I want to talk about it 
5712_48842_000029_000001	train-clean-360	It was as I have said and if so you shouldn t hate him because he did the only thing which he honestly could do when he found out his mistake 
5712_48842_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 What become engaged again within a week 
5712_48842_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 There had been a very old friendship Bell you must remember that But I was speaking of his conduct to me and not of his conduct to And then she remembered that that other lady might at this very moment possess the name which she had once been so proud to think that she would bear herself 
5712_48842_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Bell she said stopping her other speech suddenly at what o clock do people get married in London 
5712_48842_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh at all manner of hours any time before twelve 
5712_48842_000032_000001	train-clean-360	They will be fashionable and will be married late 
5712_48842_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t think she s missus Crosbie yet then 
5712_48842_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Lady Alexandrina Crosbie said Bell shuddering 
5712_48842_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes of course I forgot 
5712_48842_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I should so like to see her 
5712_48842_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I feel such an interest about her 
5712_48842_000035_000003	train-clean-360	I wonder what coloured hair she has 
5712_48842_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I suppose she is a sort of Juno of a woman very tall and handsome 
5712_48842_000035_000005	train-clean-360	I m sure she has not got a pug nose like me 
5712_48842_000035_000006	train-clean-360	Do you know what I should really like only of course it s not possible to be godmother to his first child 
none	none	Oh Lily I should 
5712_48842_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you hear me say that I know it s not possible 
5712_48842_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I m not going up to London to ask her 
5712_48842_000037_000003	train-clean-360	She ll have all manner of grandees for her godfathers and godmothers 
5712_48842_000037_000004	train-clean-360	I wonder what those grand people are really like 
5712_48842_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think there s any difference 
5712_48842_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Look at Lady Julia 
5712_48842_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she s not a grand person 
5712_48842_000039_000001	train-clean-360	It isn t merely having a title 
5712_48842_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Don t you remember that he told us that mister Palliser is about the grandest grandee of them all 
5712_48842_000039_000003	train-clean-360	I suppose people do learn to like them 
5712_48842_000039_000004	train-clean-360	He always used to say that he had been so long among people of that sort that it would be very difficult for him to divide himself off from them 
5712_48842_000039_000005	train-clean-360	I should never have done for that kind of thing should I 
none	none	There is nothing I despise so much as what you call that kind of thing Do you I don t 
5712_48842_000041_000002	train-clean-360	After all think how much work they do 
5712_48842_000041_000003	train-clean-360	He used to tell me of that 
5712_48842_000041_000004	train-clean-360	They have all the governing in their hands and get very little money for doing it 
5712_48842_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Worse luck for the country 
5712_48842_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 The country seems to do pretty well 
5712_48842_000043_000001	train-clean-360	But you re a radical Bell 
5712_48842_000043_000002	train-clean-360	My belief is you wouldn t be a lady if you could help it 
5712_48842_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I d sooner be an honest woman 
5712_48842_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 And so you are my own dear dearest honest Bell and the fairest lady that I know 
5712_48842_000045_000001	train-clean-360	If I were a man Bell you are just the girl that I should worship 
none	none	But you are not a man so it s no good
5712_48842_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 But you mustn t let your foot go astray in that way you mustn t indeed 
5712_48842_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Somebody said that whatever is is right and I declare I believe it 
5712_48842_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sometimes inclined to think that whatever is is wrong 
none	none	That s because you re a radical 
5712_48842_000049_000001	train-clean-360	I think I ll get up now Bell only it s so frightfully cold that I m afraid 
5712_48842_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 There s a beautiful fire said Bell 
none	none	Yes I see But the fire won t go all around me like the bed does I wish I could know the very moment when they re at the altar 
5712_48842_000051_000002	train-clean-360	It s only half past ten yet 
5712_48842_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t be at all surprised if it s over 
none	none	Over 
5712_48842_000053_000001	train-clean-360	What a word that is 
5712_48842_000053_000002	train-clean-360	A thing like that is over and then all the world cannot put it back again 
none	none	What if he should be unhappy after all
5712_48842_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 He must take his chance said Bell thinking within her own mind that that chance would be a very bad one 
5712_48842_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course he must take his chance 
5712_48842_000055_000001	train-clean-360	Well I ll get up now And then she took her first step out into the cold world beyond her bed 
5712_48842_000055_000002	train-clean-360	 We must all take our chance 
none	none	I have made up my mind that it will be at half past eleven 
5712_48842_000056_000000	train-clean-360	When half past eleven came she was seated in a large easy chair over the drawing room fire with a little table by her side on which a novel was lying 
5712_48842_000056_000001	train-clean-360	She had not opened her book that morning and had been sitting for some time perfectly silent with her eyes closed and her watch in her hand 
none	none	Mamma she said at last it is over now I m sure ILLUSTRATION Mamma she said at last it is over now I m sure
5712_48842_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 What is over my dear 
none	none	He has made that lady his wife 
5712_48842_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I hope God will bless them and I pray that they may be happy As she spoke these words there was an unwonted solemnity in her tone which startled missus Dale and Bell 
5712_48842_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I also will hope so said missus Dale 
5712_48842_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 And now Lily will it not be well that you should turn your mind away from the subject and endeavour to think of other things 
5712_48842_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 But I can t mamma 
5712_48842_000062_000001	train-clean-360	It is so easy to say that but people can t choose their own thoughts 
5712_48842_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 They can usually direct them as they will if they make the effort 
5712_48842_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 But I can t make the effort 
none	none	Indeed I don t know why I should 
5712_48842_000064_000002	train-clean-360	It seems natural to me to think about him and I don t suppose it can be very wrong 
5712_48842_000064_000003	train-clean-360	When you have had so deep an interest in a person you can t drop him all of a sudden Then there was again silence and after a while Lily took up her novel 
5712_48842_000064_000004	train-clean-360	She made that effort of which her mother had spoken but she made it altogether in vain 
5712_48842_000064_000005	train-clean-360	 I declare Bell she said it s the greatest rubbish I ever attempted to read 
5712_48842_000064_000006	train-clean-360	This was specially ungrateful because Bell had recommended the book 
5712_48842_000064_000007	train-clean-360	 All the books have got to be so stupid 
5712_48842_000064_000008	train-clean-360	I think I ll read Pilgrim s Progress again 
none	none	What do you say to Robinson Crusoe said Bell Or Paul and Virginia said Lily
5712_48842_000066_000001	train-clean-360	 But I believe I ll have Pilgrim s Progress 
5712_48842_000066_000002	train-clean-360	I never can understand it but I rather think that makes it nicer 
5712_48842_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate books I can t understand said Bell 
5712_48842_000067_000001	train-clean-360	 I like a book to be clear as running water so that the whole meaning may be seen at once 
none	none	The quick seeing of the meaning must depend a little on the reader must it not said missus Dale The reader mustn t be a fool of course said Bell
5712_48842_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 But then so many readers are fools said Lily 
5712_48842_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 And yet they get something out of their reading 
5712_48842_000070_000002	train-clean-360	missus Crump is always poring over the Revelations and nearly knows them by heart 
5712_48842_000070_000003	train-clean-360	I don t think she could interpret a single image but she has a hazy misty idea of the truth 
5712_48842_000070_000004	train-clean-360	That s why she likes it because it s too beautiful to be understood and that s why I like Pilgrim s Progress After which Bell offered to get the book in question 
5712_48842_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 No not now said Lily 
5712_48842_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll go on with this as you say it s so grand 
5712_48842_000071_000002	train-clean-360	The personages are always in their tantrums and go on as though they were mad 
5712_48842_000071_000003	train-clean-360	Mamma do you know where they re going for the honeymoon 
none	none	No my dear
5712_48842_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 He used to talk to me about going to the lakes And then there was another pause during which Bell observed that her mother s face became clouded with anxiety 
5712_48842_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 But I won t think of it any more continued Lily I will fix my mind to something And then she got up from her chair 
5712_48842_000073_000002	train-clean-360	 I don t think it would have been so difficult if I had not been ill 
5712_48842_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it would not my darling 
5712_48842_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 And I m going to be well again now immediately 
5712_48842_000075_000001	train-clean-360	Let me see I was told to read Carlyle s History of the French Revolution and I think I ll begin now 
5712_48842_000075_000002	train-clean-360	It was Crosbie who had told her to read the book as both Bell and missus Dale were well aware 
5712_48842_000075_000003	train-clean-360	 But I must put it off till I can get it down from the other house 
5712_48842_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Jane shall fetch it if you really want it said missus Dale 
5712_48842_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Bell shall get it when she goes up in the afternoon will you Bell 
5712_48842_000077_000001	train-clean-360	And I ll try to get on with this stuff in the meantime Then again she sat with her eyes fixed upon the pages of the book 
5712_48842_000077_000002	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you what mamma you may have some comfort in this that when to day s gone by I shan t make a fuss about any other day 
none	none	Nobody thinks that you are making a fuss Lily
5712_48842_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but I am 
5712_48842_000079_000001	train-clean-360	Isn t it odd Bell that it should take place on Valentine s day 
5712_48842_000079_000002	train-clean-360	I wonder whether it was so settled on purpose because of the day 
none	none	Oh dear I used to think so often of the letter that I should get from him on this day when he would tell me that I was his valentine 
5712_48842_000079_000004	train-clean-360	Well he s got another valen tine now So much she said with articulate voice and then she broke down bursting out into convulsive sobs and crying in her mother s arms as though she would break her heart 
5712_48842_000079_000005	train-clean-360	And yet her heart was not broken and she was still strong in that resolve which she had made that her grief should not overpower her 
none	none	As she had herself said the thing would not have been so difficult had she not been weakened by illness
5712_48842_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Lily my darling my poor ill used darling 
5712_48842_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 No mamma I won t be that And she struggled grievously to get the better of the hysterical attack which had overpowered her 
5712_48842_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 I won t be regarded as ill used not as specially ill used 
5712_48842_000081_000002	train-clean-360	But I am your darling your own darling 
5712_48842_000081_000003	train-clean-360	Only I wish you d beat me and thump me when I m such a fool instead of pitying me 
5712_48842_000081_000004	train-clean-360	It s a great mistake being soft to people when they make fools of themselves 
5712_48842_000081_000005	train-clean-360	There Bell there s your stupid book and I won t have any more of it 
5712_48842_000081_000006	train-clean-360	I believe it was that that did it And she pushed the book away from her 
5712_48842_000082_000000	train-clean-360	After this little scene she said no further word about Crosbie and his bride on that day but turned the conversation towards the prospect of their new house at Guestwick 
5712_48842_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 It will be a great comfort to be nearer doctor Crofts won t it Bell 
none	none	I don t know said Bell
5712_48842_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Because if we are ill he won t have such a terrible distance to come 
none	none	That will be a comfort for him I should think said Bell very demurely 
5712_48842_000087_000000	train-clean-360	In the evening the first volume of the French Revolution had been procured and Lily stuck to her reading with laudable perseverance till at eight her mother insisted on her going to bed queen as she was 
5712_48842_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe a bit you know that the king was such a bad man as that she said 
none	none	I do said Bell
5712_48842_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah that s because you re a radical 
5712_48842_000090_000001	train-clean-360	I never will believe that kings are so much worse than other people 
5712_48842_000090_000002	train-clean-360	As for Charles the First he was about the best man in history 
none	none	This was an old subject of dispute but Lily on the present occasion was allowed her own way as being an invalid CHAPTER XLV VALENTINE S DAY IN LONDON The fourteenth of February in London was quite as black and cold and as wintersome as it was at Allington and was perhaps somewhat more melancholy in its coldness Nevertheless Lady Alexandrina De Courcy looked as bright as bridal finery could make her when she got out of her carriage and walked into saint James s church at eleven o clock on that morning It had been finally arranged that the marriage should take place in London There were certainly many reasons which would have made a marriage from Courcy Castle more convenient The De Courcy family were all assembled at their country family residence and could therefore have been present at the ceremony without cost or trouble The castle too was warm with the warmth of life and the pleasantness of home would have lent a grace to the departure of one of the daughters of the house The retainers and servants were there and something of the rich mellowness of a noble alliance might have been felt at any rate by Crosbie at a marriage so celebrated And it must have been acknowledged even by Lady De Courcy that the house in Portman Square was very cold that a marriage from thence would be cold that there could be no hope of attaching to it any honour and glory or of making it resound with fashionable eclat in the columns of the Morning Post But then had they been married in the country the earl would have been there whereas there was no probability of his travelling up to London for the purpose of being present on such an occasion The earl was very terrible in these days and Alexandrina as she became confidential in her communications with her future husband spoke of him as of an ogre who could not by any means be avoided in all the concerns of life but whom one might shun now and again by some subtle device and careful arrangement of favourable circumstances Crosbie had more than once taken upon himself to hint that he did not specially regard the ogre seeing that for the future he could keep himself altogether apart from the malicious monster s dominions He will not come to me in our new home he had said to his love with some little touch of affection But to this view of the case Lady Alexandrina had demurred The ogre in question was not only her parent but was also a noble peer and she could not agree to any arrangement by which their future connection with the earl and with nobility in general might be endangered Her parent doubtless was an ogre and in his ogreship could make himself very terrible to those near him but then might it not be better for them to be near to an earl who was an ogre than not to be near to any earl at all She had therefore signified to Crosbie that the ogre must be endured But nevertheless it was a great thing to be rid of him on that happy occasion He would have said very dreadful things things so dreadful that there might have been a question whether the bridegroom could have borne them Since he had heard of Crosbie s accident at the railway station he had constantly talked with fiendish glee of the beating which had been administered to his son in law Lady De Courcy in taking Crosbie s part and maintaining that the match was fitting for her daughter had ventured to declare before her husband that Crosbie was a man of fashion and the earl would now ask with a loathsome grin whether the bridegroom s fashion had been improved by his little adventure at Paddington Crosbie to whom all this was not repeated would have preferred a wedding in the country But the countess and Lady Alexandrina knew better The earl had strictly interdicted any expenditure and the countess had of necessity construed this as forbidding any unnecessary expense To marry a girl without any immediate cost was a thing which nobody could understand as the countess remarked to her eldest daughter I would really spend as little as possible Lady Amelia had answered You see mamma there are circumstances about it which one doesn t wish to have talked about just at present There s the story of that girl and then that fracas at the station I really think it ought to be as quiet as possible The good sense of Lady Amelia was not to be disputed as her mother acknowledged But then if the marriage were managed in any notoriously quiet way the very notoriety of that quiet would be as dangerous as an attempt at loud glory But it won t cost as much said Amelia And thus it had been resolved that the wedding should be very quiet To this Crosbie had assented very willingly though he had not relished the manner in which the countess had explained to him her views I need not tell you Adolphus she had said how thoroughly satisfied I am with this marriage My dear girl feels that she can be happy as your wife and what more can I want I declared to her and to Amelia that I was not ambitious for their sakes and have allowed them both to please themselves I hope they have pleased themselves said Crosbie I trust so but nevertheless I don t know whether I make myself understood Quite so Lady De Courcy If Alexandrina were going to marry the eldest son of a marquis you would have a longer procession to church than will be necessary when she marries me You put it in such an odd way Adolphus It s all right so long as we understand each other I can assure you I don t want any procession at all I should be quite contented to go down with Alexandrina arm in arm like Darby and Joan and let the clerk give her away We may say that he would have been much better contented could he have been allowed to go down the street without any encumbrance on his arm But there was no possibility now for such deliverance as that Both Lady Amelia and mister Gazebee had long since discovered the bitterness of his heart and the fact of his repentance and Gazebee had ventured to suggest to his wife that his noble sister in law was preparing for herself a life of misery He ll become quiet and happy when he s used to it Lady Amelia had replied thinking perhaps of her own experiences I don t know my dear he s not a quiet man There s something in his eye which tells me that he could be very hard to a woman It has gone too far now for any change Lady Amelia had answered Well perhaps it has And I know my sister so well she would not hear of it I really think they will do very well when they become used to each other mister Gazebee who also had had his own experiences hardly dared to hope so much His home had been satisfactory to him because he had been a calculating man and having made his calculation correctly was willing to take the net result He had done so all his life with success In his house his wife was paramount as he very well knew But no effort on his wife s part had she wished to make such effort could have forced him to spend more than two thirds of his income Of this she also was aware and had trimmed her sails accordingly likening herself to him in this respect But of such wisdom and such trimmings and such adaptability what likelihood was there with mister Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina At any rate it is too late now said Lady Amelia thus concluding the conversation But nevertheless when the last moment came there was some little attempt at glory Who does not know the way in which a lately married couple s little dinner party stretches itself out from the pure simplicity of a fried sole and a leg of mutton to the attempt at clear soup the unfortunately cold dish of round balls which is handed about after the sole and the brightly red jelly and beautifully pink cream which are ordered in the last agony of ambition from the next pastrycook s shop We cannot give a dinner my dear with only cook and Sarah It has thus begun and the husband has declared that he has no such idea If Phipps and Dowdney can come here and eat a bit of mutton they are very welcome if not let them stay away And you might as well ask Phipps s sister just to have some one to go with you into the drawing room I d much rather go alone because then I can read or sleep we may say But her husband has explained that she would look friendless in this solitary state and therefore Phipps s sister has been asked Then the dinner has progressed down to those costly jellies which have been ordered in a last agony There has been a conviction on the minds of both of them that the simple leg of mutton would have been more jolly for them all Had those round balls not been carried about by a hired man had simple mutton with hot potatoes been handed to Miss Phipps by Sarah Miss Phipps would not have simpered with such unmeaning stiffness when young Dowdney spoke to her They would have been much more jolly Have a bit more mutton Phipps and where do you like it How pleasant it sounds But we all know that it is impossible My young friend had intended this but his dinner had run itself away to cold round balls and coloured forms from the pastrycook And so it was with the Crosbie marriage The bride must leave the church in a properly appointed carriage and the postboys must have wedding favours So the thing grew not into noble proportions not into proportions of true glory justifying the attempt and making good the gala A well cooked rissole brought pleasantly to you is good eating A gala marriage when everything is in keeping is excellent sport Heaven forbid that we should have no gala marriages But the small spasmodic attempt made in opposition to manifest propriety made with an inner conviction of failure that surely should be avoided in marriages in dinners and in all affairs of life There were bridesmaids and there was a breakfast Both Margaretta and Rosina came up to London for the occasion as did also a first cousin of theirs one Miss Gresham a lady whose father lived in the same county mister Gresham had married a sister of Lord De Courcy s and his services were also called into requisition He was brought up to give away the bride because the earl as the paragraph in the newspaper declared was confined at Courcy Castle by his old hereditary enemy the gout A fourth bridesmaid also was procured and thus there was a bevy though not so large a bevy as is now generally thought to be desirable There were only three or four carriages at the church but even three or four were something The weather was so frightfully cold that the light coloured silks of the ladies carried with them a show of discomfort Girls should be very young to look nice in light dresses on a frosty morning and the bridesmaids at Lady Alexandrina s wedding were not very young Lady Rosina s nose was decidedly red Lady Margaretta was very wintry and apparently very cross Miss Gresham was dull tame and insipid and the Honourable Miss O Flaherty who filled the fourth place was sulky at finding that she had been invited to take a share in so very lame a performance But the marriage was made good and Crosbie bore up against his misfortunes like a man Montgomerie Dobbs and Fowler Pratt both stood by him giving him let us hope some assurance that he was not absolutely deserted by all the world that he had not given himself up bound hand and foot to the De Courcys to be dealt with in all matters as they might please It was that feeling which had been so grievous to him and that other feeling cognate to it that if he should ultimately succeed in rebelling against the De Courcys he would find himself a solitary man Yes I shall go Fowler Pratt had said to Montgomerie Dobbs I always stick to a fellow if I can Crosbie has behaved like a blackguard and like a fool also and he knows that I think so But I don t see why I should drop him on that account I shall go as he has asked me So shall I said Montgomerie Dobbs who considered that he would be safe in doing whatever Fowler Pratt did and who remarked to himself that after all Crosbie was marrying the daughter of an earl Then after the marriage came the breakfast at which the countess presided with much noble magnificence She had not gone to church thinking no doubt that she would be better able to maintain her good humour at the feast if she did not subject herself to the chance of lumbago in the church At the foot of the table sat mister Gresham her brother in law who had undertaken to give the necessary toast and make the necessary speech The Honourable John was there saying all manner of ill natured things about his sister and new brother in law because he had been excluded from his proper position at the foot of the table But Alexandrina had declared that she would not have the matter entrusted to her brother The Honourable George would not come because the countess had not asked his wife Maria may be slow and all that sort of thing George had said but she is my wife And she had got what they haven t Love me love my dog you know So he had stayed down at Courcy very properly as I think Alexandrina had wished to go away before breakfast and Crosbie would not have cared how early an escape had been provided for him but the countess had told her daughter that if she would not wait for the breakfast there should be no breakfast at all and in fact no wedding nothing but a simple marriage Had there been a grand party that going away of the bride and bridegroom might be very well but the countess felt that on such an occasion as this nothing but the presence of the body of the sacrifice could give any reality to the festivity So Crosbie and Lady Alexandrina Crosbie heard mister Gresham s speech in which he prophesied for the young couple an amount of happiness and prosperity almost greater than is compatible with the circumstances of humanity His young friend Crosbie whose acquaintance he had been delighted to make was well known as one of the rising pillars of the State Whether his future career might be parliamentary or devoted to the permanent Civil Service of the country it would be alike great noble and prosperous As to his dear niece who was now filling that position in life which was most beautiful and glorious for a young woman she could not have done better She had preferred genius to wealth so said mister Gresham and she would find her fitting reward As to her finding her fitting reward whatever her preferences may have been there mister Gresham was no doubt quite right On that head I myself have no doubt whatever After that Crosbie returned thanks making a much better speech than nine men do out of ten on such occasions and then the thing was over No other speaking was allowed and within half an hour from that time he and his bride were in the post chaise being carried away to the Folkestone railway station for that place had been chosen as the scene of their honeymoon It had been at one time intended that the journey to Folkestone should be made simply as the first stage to Paris but Paris and all foreign travelling had been given up by degrees I don t care a bit about France we have been there so often Alexandrina said She had wished to be taken to Naples but Crosbie had made her understand at the first whispering of the word that Naples was quite out of the question He must look now in all things to money From the very first outset of his career he must save a shilling wherever a shilling could be saved To this view of life no opposition was made by the De Courcy interest Lady Amelia had explained to her sister that they ought so to do their honeymooning that it should not cost more than if they began keeping house at once Certain things must be done which no doubt were costly in their nature The bride must take with her a well dressed lady s maid The rooms at the Folkestone hotel must be large and on the first floor A carriage must be hired for her use while she remained but every shilling must be saved the spending of which would not make itself apparent to the outer world Oh deliver us from the poverty of those who with small means affect a show of wealth There is no whitening equal to that of sepulchres whited as they are whited By the proper administration of a slight bribe Crosbie secured for himself and his wife a compartment in the railway carriage to themselves And as he seated himself opposite to Alexandrina having properly tucked her up with all her bright coloured trappings he remembered that he had never in truth been alone with her before He had danced with her frequently and been left with her for a few minutes between the figures He had flirted with her in crowded drawing rooms and had once found a moment at Courcy Castle to tell her that he was willing to marry her in spite of his engagement with Lilian Dale But he had never walked with her for hours together as he had walked with Lily He had never talked to her about government and politics and books nor had she talked to him of poetry of religion and of the little duties and comforts of life He had known the Lady Alexandrina for the last six or seven years but he had never known her perhaps never would know her as he had learned to know Lily Dale within the space of two months And now that she was his wife what was he to say to her They two had commenced a partnership which was to make of them for the remaining term of their lives one body and one flesh They were to be all in all to each other But how was he to begin this all in all partnership Had the priest with his blessing done it so sufficiently that no other doing on Crosbie s own part was necessary There she was opposite to him his very actual wife bone of his bone and what was he to say to her As he settled himself on his seat taking over his own knees a part of a fine fur rug trimmed with scarlet with which he had covered her other mufflings he bethought himself how much easier it would have been to talk to Lily And Lily would have been ready with all her ears and all her mind and all her wit to enter quickly upon whatever thoughts had occurred to him In that respect Lily would have been a wife indeed a wife that would have transferred herself with quick mental activity into her husband s mental sphere Had he begun about his office Lily would have been ready for him but Alexandrina had never yet asked him a single question about his official life Had he been prepared with a plan for to morrow s happiness Lily would have taken it up eagerly but Alexandrina never cared for such trifles Are you quite comfortable he said at last Oh yes quite thank you By the by what did you do with my dressing case And that question she did ask with some energy It is under you You can have it as foot stool if you like it Oh no I should scratch it I was afraid that if Hannah had it it might be lost Then again there was silence and Crosbie again considered as to what he would next say to his wife We all know the advice given us of old as to what we should do under such circumstances and who can be so thoroughly justified in following that advice as a newly married husband So he put out his hand for hers and drew her closer to him Take care of my bonnet she said as she felt the motion of the railway carriage when he kissed her I don t think he kissed her again till he had landed her and her bonnet safely at Folkestone How often would he have kissed Lily and how pretty would her bonnet have been when she reached the end of her journey and how delightfully happy would she have looked when she scolded him for bending it But Alexandrina was quite in earnest about her bonnet by far too much in earnest for any appearance of happiness So he sat without speaking till the train came to the tunnel I do so hate tunnels said Alexandrina He had half intended to put out his hand again under some mistaken idea that the tunnel afforded him an opportunity The whole journey was one long opportunity had he desired it but his wife hated tunnels and so he drew his hand back again Lily s little fingers would have been ready for his touch He thought of this and could not help thinking of it He had The Times newspaper in his dressing bag She also had a novel with her Would she be offended if he took out the paper and read it The miles seemed to pass by very slowly and there was still another hour down to Folkestone He longed for his Times but resolved at last that he would not read unless she read first She also had remembered her novel but by nature she was more patient than he and she thought that on such a journey any reading might perhaps be almost improper So she sat tranquilly with her eyes fixed on the netting over her husband s head At last he could stand it no longer and he dashed off into a conversation intended to be most affectionate and serious Alexandrina he said and his voice was well tuned for the tender serious manner had her ears been alive to such tuning Alexandrina this is a very important step that you and I have taken to day Yes it is indeed said she I trust we shall succeed in making each other happy Yes I hope we shall If we both think seriously of it and remember that that is our chief duty we shall do so Yes I suppose we shall I only hope we shan t find the house very cold It is so new and I am so subject to colds in my head Amelia says we shall find it very cold but then she was always against our going there The house will do very well said Crosbie And Alexandrina could perceive that there was something of the master in his tone as he spoke I am only telling you what Amelia said she replied Had Lily been his bride and had he spoken to her of their future life and mutual duties how she would have kindled to the theme She would have knelt at his feet on the floor of the carriage and looking up into his face would have promised him to do her best her best her very best And with what an eagerness of inward resolution would she have determined to keep her promise He thought of all this now but he knew that he ought not to think of it Then for some quarter of an hour he did take out his newspaper and she when she saw him do so did take out her novel He took out his newspaper but he could not fix his mind upon the politics of the day Had he not made a terrible mistake Of what use to him in life would be that thing of a woman that sat opposite to him Had not a great punishment come upon him and had he not deserved the punishment In truth a great punishment had come upon him It was not only that he had married a woman incapable of understanding the higher duties of married life but that he himself would have been capable of appreciating the value of a woman who did understand them He would have been happy with Lily Dale and therefore we may surmise that his unhappiness with Lady Alexandrina would be the greater There are men who in marrying such as Lady Alexandrina De Courcy would get the article best suited to them as Mortimer Gazebee had done in marrying her sister Miss Griselda Grantly who had become Lady Dumbello though somewhat colder and somewhat cleverer than Lady Alexandrina had been of the same sort But in marrying her Lord Dumbello had got the article best suited to him if only the ill natured world would allow him to keep the article It was in this that Crosbie s failure had been so grievous that he had seen and approved the better course but had chosen for himself to walk in that which was worse During that week at Courcy Castle the week which he passed there immediately after his second visit to Allington he had deliberately made up his mind that he was more fit for the bad course than for the good one The course was now before him and he had no choice but to walk in it It was very cold when they got to Folkestone and Lady Alexandrina shivered as she stepped into the private looking carriage which had been sent to the station for her use We shall find a good fire in the parlour at the hotel said Crosbie Oh I hope so said Alexandrina and in the bedroom too The young husband felt himself to be offended but he hardly knew why He felt himself to be offended and with difficulty induced himself to go through all those little ceremonies the absence of which would have been remarked by everybody He did his work however seeing to all her shawls and wrappings speaking with good nature to Hannah and paying special attention to the dressing case What time would you like to dine he asked as he prepared to leave her alone with Hannah in the bedroom Whenever you please only I should like some tea and bread and butter presently Crosbie went into the sitting room ordered the tea and bread and butter ordered also the dinner and then stood himself up with his back to the fire in order that he might think a little of his future career He was a man who had long since resolved that his life should be a success It would seem that all men would so resolve if the matter were simply one of resolution But the majority of men as I take it make no such resolution and very many men resolve that they will be unsuccessful Crosbie however had resolved on success and had done much towards carrying out his purpose He had made a name for himself and had acquired a certain fame That however was as he acknowledged to himself departing from him He looked the matter straight in the face and told himself that his fashion must be abandoned but the office remained to him He might still rule over mister Optimist and make a subservient slave of Butterwell That must be his line in life now and to that line he would endeavour to be true As to his wife and his home he would look to them for his breakfast and perhaps his dinner He would have a comfortable arm chair and if Alexandrina should become a mother he would endeavour to love his children but above all things he would never think of Lily After that he stood and thought of her for half an hour If you please sir my lady wants to know at what time you have ordered dinner At seven Hannah My lady says she is very tired and will lie down till dinner time Very well Hannah I will go into her room when it is time to dress I hope they are making you comfortable downstairs Then Crosbie strolled out on the pier in the dusk of the cold winter evening CHAPTER XLVI JOHN EAMES AT HIS OFFICE ILLUSTRATION untitled mister Crosbie and his wife went upon their honeymoon tour to Folkestone in the middle of February and returned to London about the end of March Nothing of special moment to the interests of our story occurred during those six weeks unless the proceedings of the young married couple by the sea side may be thought to have any special interest With regard to those proceedings I can only say that Crosbie was very glad when they were brought to a close All holiday making is hard work but holiday making with nothing to do is the hardest work of all At the end of March they went into their new house and we will hope that Lady Alexandrina did not find it very cold During this time Lily s recovery from her illness was being completed She had no relapse nor did anything occur to create a new fear on her account But nevertheless doctor Crofts gave it as his opinion that it would be inexpedient to move her into a fresh house at Lady day March is not a kindly month for invalids and therefore with some regret on the part of missus Dale with much impatience on that of Bell and with considerable outspoken remonstrance from Lily herself the squire was requested to let them remain through the month of April How the squire received this request and in what way he assented to the doctor s reasoning will be told in the course of a chapter or two In the meantime John Eames had continued his career in London without much immediate satisfaction to himself or to the lady who boasted to be his heart s chosen queen Miss Amelia Roper indeed was becoming very cross and in her ill temper was playing a game that was tending to create a frightful amount of hot water in Burton Crescent She was devoting herself to a flirtation with mister Cradell not only under the immediate eyes of Johnny Eames but also under those of missus Lupex John Eames the blockhead did not like it He was above all things anxious to get rid of Amelia and her claims so anxious that on certain moody occasions he would threaten himself with diverse tragical terminations to his career in London He would enlist He would go to Australia He would blow out his brains He would have an explanation with Amelia tell her that she was a vixen and proclaim his hatred He would rush down to Allington and throw himself in despair at Lily s feet Amelia was the bugbear of his life Nevertheless when she flirted with Cradell he did not like it and was ass enough to speak to Cradell about it Of course I don t care he said only it seems to me that you are making a fool of yourself I thought you wanted to get rid of her She s nothing on earth to me only it does you know Does do what asked Cradell Why if I was to be fal lalling with that married woman you wouldn t like it That s all about it Do you mean to marry her What Amelia Yes Amelia Not if I know it Then if I were you I would leave her alone She s only making a fool of you Eames s advice may have been good and the view taken by him of Amelia s proceedings may have been correct but as regarded his own part in the affair he was not wise Miss Roper no doubt wished to make him jealous and she succeeded in the teeth of his aversion to her and of his love elsewhere He had no desire to say soft things to Miss Roper Miss Roper with all her skill could not extract a word pleasantly soft from him once a week But nevertheless soft words to her and from her in another quarter made him uneasy Such being the case must we not acknowledge that John Eames was still floundering in the ignorance of his hobbledehoyhood The Lupexes at this time still held their ground in the Crescent although repeated warnings to go had been given them missus Roper though she constantly spoke of sacrificing all that they owed her still hankered with a natural hankering after her money And as each warning was accompanied by a demand for payment and usually produced some slight subsidy on account the thing went on from week to week and at the beginning of April mister and missus Lupex were still boarders at missus Roper s house Eames had heard nothing from Allington since the time of his Christmas visit and his subsequent correspondence with Lord De Guest In his letters from his mother he was told that game came frequently from Guestwick Manor and in this way he knew that he was not forgotten by the earl But of Lily he had heard not a word except indeed the rumour which had now become general that the Dales from the Small House were about to move themselves into Guestwick When first he learned this he construed the tidings as favourable to himself thinking that Lily removed from the grandeur of Allington might possibly be more easily within his reach but latterly he had given up any such hope as that and was telling himself that his friend at the Manor had abandoned all idea of making up the marriage Three months had already elapsed since his visit Five months had passed since Crosbie had surrendered his claim Surely such a knave as Crosbie might be forgotten in five months If any steps could have been taken through the squire surely three months would have sufficed for them It was very manifest to him that there was no ground of hope for him at Allington and it would certainly be well for him to go off to Australia He would go to Australia but he would thrash Cradell first for having dared to interfere with Amelia Roper That generally was the state of his mind during the first week in April Then there came to him a letter from the earl which instantly effected a great change in all his feelings which taught him to regard Australia as a dream and almost put him into a good humour with Cradell The earl had by no means lost sight of his friend s interests at Allington and moreover those interests were now backed by an ally who in this matter must be regarded as much more powerful than the earl The squire had given in his consent to the Eames alliance The earl s letter was as follows Guestwick Manor April seven eighteen MY DEAR JOHN I told you to write to me again and you haven t done it I saw your mother the other day or else you might have been dead for anything I knew A young man always ought to write letters when he is told to do so Eames when he had got so far felt himself rather aggrieved by this rebuke knowing that he had abstained from writing to his patron simply from an unwillingness to intrude upon him with his letters By Jove I ll write to him every week of his life till he s sick of me Johnny said to himself when he found himself thus instructed as to a young man s duties And now I have got to tell you a long story and I should like it much better if you were down here so that I might save myself the trouble but you would think me ill natured if I were to keep you waiting I happened to meet mister Dale the other day and he said that he should be very glad if a certain young lady would make up her mind to listen to a certain young friend of mine So I asked him what he meant to do about the young lady s fortune and he declared himself willing to give her a hundred a year during his life and to settle four thousand pounds upon her after his death I said that I would do as much on my part by the young man but as two hundred a year with your salary would hardly give you enough to begin with I ll make mine a hundred and fifty You ll be getting up in your office soon and with five hundred a year you ought to be able to get along especially as you need not insure your life I should live somewhere near Bloomsbury Square at first because I m told you can get a house for nothing After all what s fashion worth You can bring your wife down here in the autumn and have some shooting She won t let you go to sleep under the trees I ll be bound But you must look after the young lady You will understand that no one has said a word to her about it or if they have I don t know it You ll find the squire on your side that s all Couldn t you manage to come down this Easter Tell old Buffle with my compliments that I want you I ll write to him if you like it I did know him at one time though I can t say I was ever very fond of him It stands to reason that you can t get on with Miss Lily without seeing her unless indeed you like better to write to her which always seems to me to be very poor sort of fun You d much better come down and go a wooing in the regular old fashioned way I need not tell you that Lady Julia will be delighted to see you You are a prime favourite with her since that affair at the railway station She thinks a great deal more about that than she does about the bull Now my dear fellow you know all about it and I shall take it very much amiss of you if you don t answer my letter soon Your very sincere friend DE GUEST When Eames had finished this letter sitting at his office desk his surprise and elation were so great that he hardly knew where he was or what he ought to do Could it be the truth that Lily s uncle had not only consented that the match should be made but that he had also promised to give his niece a considerable fortune For a few minutes it seemed to Johnny as though all obstacles to his happiness were removed and that there was no impediment between him and an amount of bliss of which he had hitherto hardly dared to dream Then when he considered the earl s munificence he almost cried He found that he could not compose his mind to think or even his hand to write He did not know whether it would be right in him to accept such pecuniary liberality from any living man and almost thought that he should feel himself bound to reject the earl s offer As to the squire s money that he knew he might accept All that comes in the shape of a young woman s fortune may be taken by any man He would certainly answer the earl s letter and that at once He would not leave the office till he had done so His friend should have cause to bring no further charge against him of that kind And then again he reverted to the injustice which had been done to him in the matter of letter writing as if that consideration were of moment in such a state of circumstances as was now existing But at last his thoughts brought themselves to the real question at issue Would Lily Dale accept him After all the realization of his good fortune depended altogether upon her feelings and as he remembered this his mind misgave him sorely It was filled not only with a young lover s ordinary doubts with the fear and trembling incidental to the bashfulness of hobbledehoyhood but with an idea that that affair with Crosbie would still stand in his way He did not perhaps rightly understand all that Lily had suffered but he conceived it to be probable that there had been wounds which even the last five months might not yet have cured Could it be that she would allow him to cure these wounds As he thought of this he felt almost crushed to the earth by an indomitable bashfulness and conviction of his own unworthiness What had he to offer worthy of the acceptance of such a girl as Lilian Dale I fear that the Crown did not get out of John Eames an adequate return for his salary on that day So adequate however had been the return given by him for some time past that promotion was supposed throughout the Income tax Office to be coming in his way much to the jealousy of Cradell Fisher and others his immediate compeers and cronies And the place assigned to him by rumour was one which was generally regarded as a perfect Elysium upon earth in the Civil Service world He was so rumour said to become private secretary to the First Commissioner He would be removed by such a change as this from the large uncarpeted room in which he at present sat occupying the same desk with another man to whom he had felt himself to be ignominiously bound as dogs must feel when they are coupled This room had been the bear garden of the office Twelve or fourteen men sat in it Large pewter pots were brought into it daily at one o clock giving it an air that was not aristocratic The senior of the room one mister Love who was presumed to have it under his immediate dominion was a clerk of the ancient stamp dull heavy unambitious living out on the farther side of Islington and unknown beyond the limits of his office to any of his younger brethren He was generally regarded as having given a bad tone to the room And then the clerks in this room would not unfrequently be blown up with very palpable blowings up by an official swell a certain chief clerk named Kissing much higher in standing though younger in age than the gentleman of whom we have before spoken He would hurry in out of his own neighbouring chamber with quick step and nose in the air shuffling in his office slippers looking on each occasion as though there were some cause to fear that the whole Civil Service were coming to an abrupt termination and would lay about him with hard words which some of those in the big room did not find it very easy to bear His hair was always brushed straight up his eyes were always very wide open and he usually carried a big letter book with him keeping in it a certain place with his finger This book was almost too much for his strength and he would flop it down now on this man s desk and now on that man s and in a long career of such floppings had made himself to be very much hated On the score of some old grudge he and mister Love did not speak to each other and for this reason on all occasions of fault finding the blown up young man would refer mister Kissing to his enemy I know nothing about it mister Love would say not lifting his face from his desk for a moment I shall certainly lay the matter before the Board mister Kissing would reply and would then shuffle out of the room with the big book Sometimes mister Kissing would lay the matter before the Board and then he and mister Love and two or three delinquent clerks would be summoned thither It seldom led to much The delinquent clerks would be cautioned One Commissioner would say a word in private to mister Love and another a word in private to mister Kissing Then when left alone the Commissioners would have their little jokes saying that Kissing they feared went by favour and that Love should still be lord of all But these things were done in the mild days before Sir Raffle Buffle came to the Board There had been some fun in this at first but of late John Eames had become tired of it He disliked mister Kissing and the big book out of which mister Kissing was always endeavouring to convict him of some official sin and had got tired of that joke of setting Kissing and Love by the ears together When the Assistant Secretary first suggested to him that Sir Raffle had an idea of selecting him as private secretary and when he remembered the cosy little room all carpeted with a leathern arm chair and a separate washing stand which in such case would be devoted to his use and remembered also that he would be put into receipt of an additional hundred a year and would stand in the way of still better promotion he was overjoyed But there were certain drawbacks The present private secretary who had been private secretary also to the late First Commissioner was giving up his Elysium because he could not endure the tones of Sir Raffle s voice It was understood that Sir Raffle required rather more of a private secretary in the way of obsequious attendance than was desirable and Eames almost doubted his own fitness for the place And why should he choose me he had asked the Assistant Secretary Well we have talked it over together and I think that he prefers you to any other that has been named But he was so very hard upon me about the affair at the railway station I think he has heard more about that since I think that some message has reached him from your friend Earl De Guest Oh indeed said Johnny beginning to comprehend what it was to have an earl for his friend Since his acquaintance with the nobleman had commenced he had studiously avoided all mention of the earl s name at his office and yet he received almost daily intimation that the fact was well known there and not a little considered But he is so very rough said Johnny You can put up with that said his friend the Assistant Secretary His bark is worse than his bite as you know and then a hundred a year is worth having Eames was at that moment inclined to take a gloomy view of life in general and was disposed to refuse the place should it be offered to him He had not then received the earl s letter but now as he sat with that letter open before him lying in the drawer beneath his desk so that he could still read it as he leaned back in his chair he was enabled to look at things in general through a different atmosphere In the first place Lilian Dale s husband ought to have a room to himself with a carpet and an arm chair and then that additional hundred a year would raise his income at once to the sum as to which the earl had made some sort of stipulation But could he get that leave of absence at Easter If he consented to be Sir Raffle s private secretary he would make that a part of the bargain At this moment the door of the big room was opened and mister Kissing shuffled in with very quick little steps He shuffled in and coming direct up to John s desk flopped his ledger down upon it before its owner had had time to close the drawer which contained the precious letter What have you got in that drawer mister Eames A private letter mister Kissing Oh a private letter said mister Kissing feeling strongly convinced there was a novel hidden there but not daring to express his belief I have been half the morning mister Eames looking for this letter to the Admiralty and you ve put it under S A bystander listening to mister Kissing s tone would have been led to believe that the whole Income tax Office was jeopardized by the terrible iniquity thus disclosed Somerset House pleaded Johnny Psha Somerset House Half the offices in London You d better ask mister Love said Eames It s all done under his special instructions mister Kissing looked at mister Love and mister Love looked steadfastly at his desk mister Love knows all about the indexing continued Johnny He s index master general to the department No I m not mister Eames said mister Love who rather liked John Eames and hated mister Kissing with his whole heart But I believe the indexes on the whole are very well done in this room Some people don t know how to find letters mister Eames began mister Kissing still pointing with a finger of bitter reproach to the misused S and beginning an oration which was intended for the benefit of the whole room and for the annihilation of old mister Love if you have yet to learn that the word Admiralty begins with A and not with S you have much to learn which should have been acquired before you first came into this office Somerset House is not a department Then he turned round to the room at large and repeated the last words as though they might become very useful if taken well to heart Is not a department The Treasury is a department the Home Office is a department the India Board is a department No mister Kissing it isn t said a young clerk from the other end of the room You know very well what I mean sir The India Office is a department There s no Board sir Never mind but how any gentleman who has been in the service three months not to say three years can suppose Somerset House to be a department is beyond my comprehension If you have been improperly instructed We shall know all about it another time said Eames mister Love will make a memorandum of it I shan t do anything of the kind said mister Love If you have been wrongly instructed mister Kissing began again stealing a glance at mister Love as he did so but at this moment the door was again opened and a messenger summoned Johnny to the presence of the really great man mister Eames to wait upon Sir Raffle Upon hearing this Johnny immediately started and left mister Kissing and the big book in possession of his desk How the battle was waged and how it raged in the large room we cannot stop to hear as it is necessary that we should follow our hero into the presence of Sir Raffle Buffle Ah Eames yes said Sir Raffle looking up from his desk when the young man entered just wait half a minute will you And the knight went to work at his papers as though fearing that any delay in what he was doing might be very prejudicial to the nation at large Ah Eames well yes he said again as he pushed away from him almost with a jerk the papers on which he had been writing They tell me that you know the business of this office pretty well Some of it sir said Eames Well yes some of it But you ll have to understand the whole of it if you come to me And you must be very sharp about it too You know that FitzHoward is leaving me I have heard of it sir A very excellent young man though perhaps not But we won t mind that The work is a little too much for him and he s going back into the office I believe Lord De Guest is a friend of yours isn t he Yes he is a friend of mine certainly He s been very kind to me Ah well I ve known the earl for many years for very many years and intimately at one time Perhaps you may have heard him mention my name Yes I have Sir Raffle We were intimate once but those things go off you know He s been the country mouse and I ve been the town mouse Ha ha ha You may tell him that I say so He won t mind that coming from me Oh no not at all said Eames Mind you tell him when you see him The earl is a man for whom I ve always had a great respect a very great respect I may say regard And now Eames what do you say to taking FitzHoward s place The work is hard It is fair that I should tell you that The work will no doubt be very hard I take a greater share of what s going than my predecessors have done and I don t mind telling you that I have been sent here because a man was wanted who would do that The voice of Sir Raffle as he continued became more and more harsh and Eames began to think how wise FitzHoward had been I mean to do my duty and I shall expect that my private secretary will do his But mister Eames I never forget a man Whether he be good or bad I never forget a man You don t dislike late hours I suppose Coming late to the office you mean Oh no not in the least Staying late staying late Six or seven o clock if necessary putting your shoulder to the wheel when the coach gets into the mud That s what I ve been doing all my life They ve known what I am very well They ve always kept me for the heavy roads If they paid in the Civil Service by the hour I believe I should have drawn a larger income than any man in it If you take the vacant chair in the next room you ll find it s no joke It s only fair that I should tell you that I can work as hard as any man said Eames That s right That s right Stick to that and I ll stick to you It will be a great gratification to me to have by me a friend of my old friend De Guest Tell him I say so And now you may as well get into harness at once FitzHoward is there You can go in to him and at half past four exactly I ll see you both I m very exact mind very and therefore you must be exact Then Sir Raffle looked as though he desired to be left alone Sir Raffle there s one favour I want to ask of you said Johnny And what s that I am most anxious to be absent for a fortnight or three weeks just at Easter I shall want to go in about ten days Absent for three weeks at Easter when the parliamentary work is beginning That won t do for a private secretary But it s very important Sir Raffle Out of the question Eames quite out of the question It s almost life and death to me Almost life and death Why what are you going to do With all his grandeur and national importance Sir Raffle would be very curious as to little people Well I can t exactly tell you and I m not quite sure myself Then don t talk nonsense It s impossible that I should spare my private secretary just at that time of the year I couldn t do it The service won t admit of it You re not entitled to leave at that season Private secretaries always take their leave in the autumn I should like to be absent in the autumn too but It s out of the question mister Eames Then John Eames reflected that it behoved him in such an emergency to fire off his big gun He had a great dislike to firing this big gun but as he said to himself there are occasions which make a big gun very necessary I got a letter from Lord De Guest this morning pressing me very much to go to him at Easter It s about business added Johnny If there was any difficulty he said he should write to you Write to me said Sir Raffle who did not like to be approached too familiarly in his office even by an earl Of course I shouldn t tell him to do that But Sir Raffle if I remained out there in the office and Johnny pointed towards the big room with his head I could choose April for my month And as the matter is so important to me and to the earl What can it be said Sir Raffle It s quite private said John Eames Hereupon Sir Raffle became very petulant feeling that a bargain was being made with him This young man would only consent to become his private secretary upon certain terms Well go in to FitzHoward now I can t lose all my day in this way But I shall be able to get away at Easter I don t know We shall see about it But don t stand talking there now Then John Eames went into FitzHoward s room and received that gentleman s congratulations on his appointment I hope you like being rung for like a servant every minute for he s always ringing that bell And he ll roar at you till you re deaf You must give up all dinner engagements for though there is not much to do he ll never let you go I don t think anybody ever asks him out to dinner for he likes being here till seven And you ll have to write all manner of lies about big people And sometimes when he has sent Rafferty out about his private business he ll ask you to bring him his shoes Now Rafferty was the First Commissioner s messenger It must be remembered however that this little account was given by an outgoing and discomfited private secretary A man is not asked to bring another man his shoes said Eames to himself until he shows himself fit for that sort of business Then he made within his own breast a little resolution about Sir Raffle s shoes CHAPTER XLVII THE NEW PRIVATE SECRETARY Income tax Office April eight eighteen 
5826-48845-0001	train-other-500	MY DEAR LORD DE GUEST I hardly know how to answer your letter it is so very kind more than kind And about not writing before
none	none	 I must explain that I have not liked to trouble you with letters I should have seemed to be encroaching if I had written much 
5826-48845-0002	train-other-500	Indeed it didn t come from not thinking about you And first of all about the money
none	none	 as to your offer I mean 
5826-48845-0003	train-other-500	I really feel that I do not know what I ought to say to you about it without appearing to be a simpleton The truth is I don t know what I ought to do and can only trust to you not to put me wrong I have an idea that a man ought not to accept a present of money unless from his father or somebody like that
none	none	 And the sum you mention is so very large that it makes me wish you had not named it 
5826-48845-0004	train-other-500	If you choose to be so generous would it not be better that you should leave it me in your will
none	none	 So that he might always want me to be dying said Lord De Guest as he read the letter out loud to his sister 
5826-48845-0005	train-other-500	I m sure he wouldn t want that said Lady Julia But you may live for twenty five years you know
none	none	 Say fifty said the earl And then he continued the reading of his letter But all that depends so much upon another person that it is hardly worth while talking about it Of course I am very much obliged to mister Dale 
5826-48845-0006	train-other-500	very much indeed and I think that he is behaving very handsomely to his niece But whether it will do me any good that is quite another thing However I shall certainly accept your kind invitation for Easter and find out whether I have a chance or not
5826-48845-0007	train-other-500	I must tell you that Sir Raffle Buffle has made me his private secretary by which I get a hundred a year
none	none	 He says he was a great crony of yours many years ago 
5826-48845-0008	train-other-500	and seems to like talking about you very much You will understand what all that means He has sent you ever so many messages but I don t suppose you will care to get them I am to go to him to morrow and from all I hear I shall have a hard time of it
5826-48845-0009	train-other-500	By George he will said the earl Poor fellow But I thought a private secretary never had anything to do said Lady Julia I shouldn t like to be private secretary to Sir Raffle myself But he s young and a hundred a year is a great thing
none	none	 How we all of us used to hate that man His voice sounded like a bell with a crack in it 
5826-48845-0010	train-other-500	We always used to be asking for some one to muffle the Buffle
none	none	 They call him Huffle Scuffle at his office Poor Johnny Then he finished the letter I told him that I must have leave of absence at Easter and he at first declared that it was impossible But I shall carry my point about that I would not stay away to be made private secretary to the Prime Minister and yet I almost feel that I might as well stay away for any good that I shall do 
5826-48845-0011	train-other-500	Give my kind regards to Lady Julia and tell her how very much obliged to her I am I cannot express the gratitude which I owe to you But pray believe me my dear Lord De Guest always very faithfully yours JOHN EAMES
5826-48845-0012	train-other-500	It was late before Eames had finished his letter He had been making himself ready for his exodus from the big room
none	none	 and preparing his desk and papers for his successor About half past five Cradell came up to him and suggested that they should walk home together What you here still said Eames I thought you always went at four Cradell had remained hanging about the office in order that he might walk home with the new private secretary But Eames did not desire this He had much of which he desired to think alone and would fain have been allowed to walk by himself Yes I had things to do 
5826-48845-0013	train-other-500	I say Johnny I congratulate you most heartily I do indeed Thank you old fellow
none	none	 It is such a grand thing you know A hundred a year and all at once 
5826-48845-0014	train-other-500	And then such a snug room to yourself
none	none	 and that fellow Kissing never can come near you He has been making himself such a beast all day 
5826-48845-0015	train-other-500	But Johnny I always knew you d come to something more than common I always said so There s nothing uncommon about this except that Fitz says that old Huffle Scuffle makes himself uncommon nasty Never mind what Fitz says It s all jealousy
none	none	 You ll have it all your own way if you look sharp 
5826-48845-0016	train-other-500	I think you always do have it all your own way Are you nearly ready Well not quite Don t wait for me Caudle Oh I ll wait I don t mind waiting They ll keep dinner for us if we both stay Besides what matters I d do more than that for you
5826-48845-0017	train-other-500	I have some idea of working on till eight and having a chop sent in said Johnny Besides I ve got somewhere to call by myself Then Cradell almost cried He remained silent for two or three minutes striving to master his emotion
none	none	 and at last when he did speak had hardly succeeded in doing so Oh Johnny he said I know what that means You are going to throw me over because you are getting up in the world I have always stuck to you through everything haven t I Don t make yourself a fool Caudle Well so I have And if they had made me private secretary I should have been just the same to you as ever You d have found no change in me 
5826-48845-0018	train-other-500	What a goose you are Do you say I m changed because I want to dine in the city It s all because you don t want to walk home with me as we used to do I m not such a goose but what I can see But Johnny I suppose I mustn t call you Johnny now
5826-48845-0019	train-other-500	Don t be such a con founded Then Eames got up and walked about the room
none	none	 Come along said he I don t care about staying and don t mind where I dine And he bustled away with his hat and gloves hardly giving Cradell time to catch him before he got out into the streets I tell you what it is Caudle said he all that kind of thing is disgusting 
5826-48845-0020	train-other-500	But how would you feel whimpered Cradell who had never succeeded in putting himself quite on a par with his friend even in his own estimation since that glorious victory at the railway station If he could only have thrashed Lupex as Johnny had thrashed Crosbie
5826-48845-0021	train-other-500	then indeed they might have been equal a pair of heroes But he had not done so He had never told himself that he was a coward but he considered that circumstances had been specially unkind to him
none	none	 But how would you feel he whimpered if the friend whom you liked better than anybody else in the world turned his back upon you I haven t turned my back upon you except that I can t get you to walk fast enough Come along old fellow and don t talk confounded nonsense 
5826-48845-0022	train-other-500	I hate all that kind of thing You never ought to suppose that a man will give himself airs but wait till he does I don t believe I shall remain with old Scuffles above a month or two From all that I can hear that s as much as any one can bear
5826-48845-0023	train-other-500	Then Cradell by degrees became happy and cordial and during the whole walk flattered Eames with all the flattery of which he was master And Johnny though he did profess himself to be averse to all that kind of thing was nevertheless open to flattery
none	none	 When Cradell told him that though FitzHoward could not manage the Tartar knight he might probably do so he was inclined to believe what Cradell said And as to getting him his shoes said Cradell 
5826-48845-0024	train-other-500	I don t suppose he d ever think of asking you to do such a thing unless he was in a very great hurry or something of that kind Look here Johnny said Cradell as they got into one of the streets bordering on Burton Crescent you know the last thing in the world I should like to do would be to offend you
none	none	 All right Caudle said Eames going on whereas his companion had shown a tendency towards stopping Look here now if I have vexed you about Amelia Roper I ll make you a promise never to speak to her again D Amelia Roper said Eames suddenly stopping himself 
5826-48845-0025	train-other-500	and stopping Cradell as well The exclamation was made in a deep angry voice which attracted the notice of one or two who were passing Johnny was very wrong wrong to utter any curse very wrong to ejaculate that curse against a human being
5826-48845-0026	train-other-500	and especially wrong to fulminate it against a woman a woman whom he had professed to love
none	none	 But he did do so and I cannot tell my story thoroughly without repeating the wicked word Cradell looked up at him and stared 
5826-48845-0027	train-other-500	I only meant to say said Cradell I ll do anything you like in the matter Then never mention her name to me again And as to talking to her you may talk to her till you re both blue in the face if you please Oh I didn t know
5826-48845-0028	train-other-500	You didn t seem to like it the other day I was a fool the other day a confounded fool And so I have been all my life Amelia Roper Look here Caudle
none	none	 if she makes up to you this evening as I ve no doubt she will for she seems to be playing that game constantly now 
5826-48845-0029	train-other-500	just let her have her fling Never mind me I ll amuse myself with missus Lupex or Miss Spruce But there ll be the deuce to pay with missus Lupex She s as cross as possible already whenever Amelia speaks to me
none	none	 You don t know what a jealous woman is Johnny Cradell had got upon what he considered to be his high ground 
5826-48845-0030	train-other-500	And on that he felt himself equal to any man It was no doubt true that Eames had thrashed a man and that he had not it was true also that Eames had risen to very high place in the social world having become a private secretary
5826-48845-0031	train-other-500	but for a dangerous mysterious overwhelming life enveloping intrigue was not he the acknowledged hero of such an affair He had paid very dearly both in pocket and in comfort for the blessing of missus Lupex s society
none	none	 but he hardly considered that he had paid too dearly There are certain luxuries which a man will find to be expensive but for all that they may be worth their price Nevertheless as he went up the steps of missus Roper s house he made up his mind that he would oblige his friend The intrigue might in that way become more mysterious 
5826-48845-0032	train-other-500	and more life enveloping whereas it would not become more dangerous seeing that mister Lupex could hardly find himself to be aggrieved by such a proceeding The whole number of missus Roper s boarders were assembled at dinner that day
none	none	 mister Lupex seldom joined that festive board but on this occasion he was present appearing from his voice and manner to be in high good humour Cradell had communicated to the company in the drawing room the great good fortune which had fallen upon his friend 
5826-48845-0033	train-other-500	and Johnny had thereby become the mark of a certain amount of hero worship Oh indeed said missus Roper An appy woman your mother will be when she hears it But I always said you d come down right side uppermost Handsome is as handsome does said Miss Spruce
5826-48845-0034	train-other-500	Oh mister Eames exclaimed missus Lupex with graceful enthusiasm I wish you joy from the very depth of my heart It is such an elegant appointment Accept the hand of a true and disinterested friend said Lupex
5826-48845-0035	train-other-500	And Johnny did accept the hand though it was very dirty and stained all over with paint Amelia stood apart and conveyed her congratulations by a glance or I might better say by a series of glances And now
none	none	 now will you not be mine the glances said 
5826-48845-0036	train-other-500	now that you are rolling in wealth and prosperity And then before they went downstairs she did whisper one word to him Oh I am so happy John so very happy Bother said Johnny in a tone quite loud enough to reach the lady s ear
none	none	 Then making his way round the room he gave his arm to Miss Spruce Amelia as she walked downstairs alone declared to herself that she would wring his heart 
5826-48845-0037	train-other-500	She had been employed in wringing it for some days past
none	none	 and had been astonished at her own success 
5826-48845-0038	train-other-500	It had been clear enough to her that Eames had been piqued by her overtures to Cradell and she had therefore to play out that game
none	none	 Oh mister Cradell she said as she took her seat next to him The friends I like are the friends that remain always the same 
5826-48845-0039	train-other-500	I hate your sudden rises They do so often make a man upsetting I should like to try myself all the same said Cradell
none	none	 Well I don t think it would make any difference in you I don t indeed And of course your time will come too It s that earl as has done it 
5826-48845-0040	train-other-500	he that was worried by the bull
none	none	 Since we have known an earl we have been so mighty fine 
5826-48845-0041	train-other-500	And Amelia gave her head a little toss and then smiled archly in a manner which to Cradell s eyes was really very becoming But he saw that missus Lupex was looking at him from the other side of the table and he could not quite enjoy the goods which the gods had provided for him
5826-48845-0042	train-other-500	When the ladies left the dining room Lupex and the two young men drew their chairs near the fire and each prepared for himself a moderate potation Eames made a little attempt at leaving the room but he was implored by Lupex
5826-48845-0043	train-other-500	with such earnest protestations of friendship to remain and was so weakly fearful of being charged with giving himself airs that he did as he was desired And here mister Eames is to your very good health said Lupex
none	none	 raising to his mouth a steaming goblet of gin and water 
5826-48845-0044	train-other-500	and wishing you many years to enjoy your official prosperity Thank ye said Eames I don t know much about the prosperity but I m just as much obliged Yes sir when I see a young man of your age beginning to rise in the world I know he ll go on
5826-48845-0045	train-other-500	Now look at me mister Eames mister Cradell here s your very good health and may all unkindness be drowned in the flowing bowl Look at me mister Eames I ve never risen in the world I ve never done any good in the world and never shall
5826-48845-0046	train-other-500	Oh mister Lupex don t say that Ah but I do say it
none	none	 I ve always been pulling the devil by the tail and never yet got as much as a good hold on to that 
5826-48845-0047	train-other-500	And I ll tell you why I never got a chance when I was young
none	none	 If I could have got any big fellow 
5826-48845-0048	train-other-500	a star you know to let me paint his portrait when I was your age such a one let us say as your friend Sir Raffle
none	none	 What a star said Cradell 
5826-48845-0049	train-other-500	Well I suppose he s pretty much known in the world isn t he Or Lord Derby or mister Spurgeon You know what I mean If I d got such a chance as that when I was young
none	none	 I should never have been doing jobs of scene painting at the minor theatres at so much a square yard 
5826-48845-0050	train-other-500	You ve got the chance now but I never had it Whereupon mister Lupex finished his first measure of gin and water It s a very queer thing life is continued Lupex
5826-48845-0051	train-other-500	and though he did not at once go to work boldly at the mixing of another glass of toddy he began gradually and as if by instinct to finger the things which would be necessary for that operation A very queer thing
5826-48845-0052	train-other-500	Now remember young gentlemen I m not denying that success in life will depend upon good conduct of course it does but then how often good conduct comes from success
none	none	 Should I have been what I am now do you suppose if some big fellow had taken me by the hand when I was struggling to make an artist of myself 
5826-48845-0053	train-other-500	I could have drunk claret and champagne just as well as gin and water and worn ruffles to my shirt as gracefully as many a fellow who used to be very fond of me and now won t speak to me if he meets me in the streets I never got a chance never
5826-48845-0054	train-other-500	But it s not too late yet mister Lupex said Eames Yes it is Eames yes it is And now mister Lupex had grasped the gin bottle It s too late now The game s over and the match is lost The talent is here
5826-48845-0055	train-other-500	I m as sure of that now as ever I was I ve never doubted my own ability never for a moment There are men this very day making a thousand a year off their easels
none	none	 who haven t so good and true an eye in drawing as I have 
5826-48845-0056	train-other-500	or so good a feeling in colours I could name them only I won t And why shouldn t you try again said Eames If I were to paint the finest piece that ever delighted the eye of man who would come and look at it
5826-48845-0057	train-other-500	Who would have enough belief in me to come as far as this place and see if it were true No Eames I know my own position and my own ways and I know my own weakness I couldn t do a day s work now unless I were certain of getting a certain number of shillings at the end of it
5826-48845-0058	train-other-500	That s what a man comes to when things have gone against him But I thought men got lots of money by scene painting
none	none	 I don t know what you may call lots mister Cradell I don t call it lots But I m not complaining I know who I have to thank and if ever I blow my own brains out I shan t be putting the blame on the wrong shoulders If you ll take my advice and now he turned round to Eames 
5826-48845-0059	train-other-500	you ll beware of marrying too soon in life I think a man should marry early if he marries well said Eames Don t misunderstand me continued Lupex It isn t about missus L I m speaking I ve always regarded my wife as a very fascinating woman
none	none	 Hear hear hear said Cradell thumping the table Indeed she is said Eames And when I caution you against marrying don t you misunderstand me I ve never said a word against her to any man and never will 
5826-48845-0060	train-other-500	If a man don t stand by his wife whom will he stand by I blame no one but myself But I do say this I never had a chance
none	none	 I never had a chance never had a chance 
5826-48845-0061	train-other-500	And as he repeated the words for the third time his lips were already fixed to the rim of his tumbler At this moment the door of the dining room was opened and missus Lupex put in her head Lupex she said what are you doing

Eames was standing close and whispered into her ear Changes are so pleasant sometimes Don t you think so I do CHAPTER XLVIII NEMESIS Crosbie had now settled down to the calm realities of married life and was beginning to think that the odium was dying away which for a week or two had attached itself to him partly on account of his usage of Miss Dale but more strongly in consequence of the thrashing which he had received from John Eames Not that he had in any way recovered his former tone of life or that he ever hoped to do so But he was able to go in and out of his club without embarrassment He could talk with his wonted voice and act with his wonted authority at his office He could tell his friends with some little degree of pleasure in the sound that Lady Alexandrina would be very happy to see them And he could make himself comfortable in his own chair after dinner with his slippers and his newspaper He could make himself comfortable or at any rate could tell his wife that he did so It was very dull He was obliged to acknowledge to himself when he thought over the subject that the life which he was leading was dull Though he could go into his club without annoyance nobody there ever thought of asking him to join them at dinner It was taken for granted that he was going to dine at home and in the absence of any provocation to the contrary he always did dine at home He had now been in his house for three weeks and had been asked with his wife to a few bridal dinner parties given chiefly by friends of the De Courcy family Except on such occasions he never passed an evening out of his own house and had not yet since his marriage dined once away from his wife He told himself that his good conduct in this respect was the result of his own resolution but nevertheless he felt that there was nothing else left for him to do Nobody asked him to go to the theatre Nobody begged him to drop in of an evening Men never asked him why he did not play a rubber He would generally saunter into Sebright s after he left his office and lounge about the room for half an hour talking to a few men Nobody was uncivil to him But he knew that the whole thing was changed and he resolved with some wisdom to accommodate himself to his altered circumstances Lady Alexandrina also found her new life rather dull and was sometimes inclined to be a little querulous She would tell her husband that she never got out and would declare when he offered to walk with her that she did not care for walking in the streets I don t exactly see then where you are to walk he once replied She did not tell him that she was fond of riding and that the Park was a very fitting place for such exercise but she looked it and he understood her I ll do all I can for her he said to himself but I ll not ruin myself Amelia is coming to take me for a drive she said another time Ah that ll be very nice he answered No it won t be very nice said Alexandrina Amelia is always shopping and bargaining with the tradespeople But it will be better than being kept in the house without ever stirring out They breakfasted nominally at half past nine in truth it was always nearly ten as Lady Alexandrina found it difficult to get herself out of her room At half past ten punctually he left his house for his office He usually got home by six and then spent the greatest part of the hour before dinner in the ceremony of dressing He went at least into his dressing room after speaking a few words to his wife and there remained pulling things about clipping his nails looking over any paper that came in his way and killing the time He expected his dinner punctually at seven and began to feel a little cross if he were kept waiting After dinner he drank one glass of wine in company with his wife and one other by himself during which latter ceremony he would stare at the hot coals and think of the thing he had done Then he would go upstairs and have first a cup of coffee and then a cup of tea He would read his newspaper open a book or two hide his face when he yawned and try to make believe that he liked it She had no signs or words of love for him She never sat on his knee or caressed him She never showed him that any happiness had come to her in being allowed to live close to him They thought that they loved each other each thought so but there was no love no sympathy no warmth The very atmosphere was cold so cold that no fire could remove the chill In what way would it have been different had Lily Dale sat opposite to him there as his wife instead of Lady Alexandrina He told himself frequently that either with one or with the other life would have been the same that he had made himself for a while unfit for domestic life and that he must cure himself of that unfitness But though he declared this to himself in one set of half spoken thoughts he would also declare to himself in another set that Lily would have made the whole house bright with her brightness that had he brought her home to his hearth there would have been a sun shining on him every morning and every evening But nevertheless he strove to do his duty and remembered that the excitement of official life was still open to him From eleven in the morning till five in the afternoon he could still hold a position which made it necessary that men should regard him with respect and speak to him with deference In this respect he was better off than his wife for she had no office to which she could betake herself Yes she said to Amelia it is all very nice and I don t mind the house being damp but I get so tired of being alone That must be the case with women who are married to men of business Oh I don t complain Of course I knew what I was about I suppose it won t be so very dull when everybody is up in London I don t find the season makes much difference to us after Christmas said Amelia but no doubt London is gayer in May You ll find you ll like it better next year and perhaps you ll have a baby you know Psha ejaculated Lady Alexandrina I don t want a baby and don t suppose I shall have one It s always something to do you know Lady Alexandrina though she was not of an energetic temperament could not but confess to herself that she had made a mistake She had been tempted to marry Crosbie because Crosbie was a man of fashion and now she was told that the London season would make no difference to her the London season which had hitherto always brought to her the excitement of parties if it had not given her the satisfaction of amusement She had been tempted to marry because it appeared to her that a married woman could enjoy society with less restraint than a girl who was subject to her mother or her chaperon that she would have more freedom of action as a married woman and now she was told that she must wait for a baby before she could have anything to do Courcy Castle was sometimes dull but Courcy Castle would have been better than this When Crosbie returned home after this little conversation about the baby he was told by his wife that they were to dine with the Gazebees on the next Sunday On hearing this he shook his head with vexation He knew however that he had no right to make complaint as he had been only taken to saint John s Wood once since they had come home from their marriage trip There was however one point as to which he could grumble Why on earth on Sunday ILLUSTRATION Why on earth on Sunday Because Amelia asked me for Sunday If you are asked for Sunday you cannot say you ll go on Monday It is so terrible on a Sunday afternoon At what hour She said half past five Heavens and earth What are we to do all the evening It is not kind of you Adolphus to speak in that way of my relations Come my love that s a joke as if I hadn t heard you say the same thing twenty times You ve complained of having to go up there much more bitterly than I ever did You know I like your sister and in his way Gazebee is a very good fellow but after three or four hours one begins to have had enough of him It can t be much duller than it is but Lady Alexandrina stopped herself before she finished her speech One can always read at home at any rate said Crosbie One can t always be reading However I have said you would go If you choose to refuse you must write and explain When the Sunday came the Crosbies of course did go to saint John s Wood arriving punctually at that door which he so hated at half past five One of the earliest resolutions which he made when he first contemplated the De Courcy match was altogether hostile to the Gazebees He would see but very little of them He would shake himself free of that connexion It was not with that branch of the family that he desired an alliance But now as things had gone that was the only branch of the family with which he seemed to be allied He was always hearing of the Gazebees Amelia and Alexandrina were constantly together He was now dragged there to a Sunday dinner and he knew that he should often be dragged there that he could not avoid such draggings He already owed money to Mortimer Gazebee and was aware that his affairs had been allowed to fall into that lawyer s hands in such a way that he could not take them out again His house was very thoroughly furnished and he knew that the bills had been paid but he had not paid them every shilling had been paid through Mortimer Gazebee Go with your mother and aunt De Courcy the attorney said to the lingering child after dinner and then Crosbie was left alone with his wife s brother in law This was the period of the saint John s Wood purgatory which was so dreadful to him With his sister in law he could talk remembering perhaps always that she was an earl s daughter But with Gazebee he had nothing in common And he felt that Gazebee who had once treated him with great deference had now lost all such feeling Crosbie had once been a man of fashion in the estimation of the attorney but that was all over Crosbie in the attorney s estimation was now simply the secretary of a public office a man who owed him money The two had married sisters and there was no reason why the light of the prosperous attorney should pale before that of the civil servant who was not very prosperous All this was understood thoroughly by both the men There s terrible bad news from Courcy said the attorney as soon as the boy was gone Why what s the matter Porlock has married that woman you know Nonsense He has The old lady has been obliged to tell me and she s nearly broken hearted about it But that s not the worst of it to my mind All the world knows that Porlock had gone to the mischief But he is going to bring an action against his father for some arrears of his allowance and he threatens to have everything out in court if he doesn t get his money But is there money due to him Yes there is A couple of thousand pounds or so I suppose I shall have to find it But upon my honour I don t know where it s to come from I don t indeed In one way or another I ve paid over fourteen hundred pounds for you Fourteen hundred pounds Yes indeed what with the insurance and the furniture and the bill from our house for the settlements That s not paid yet but it s the same thing A man doesn t get married for nothing I can tell you But you ve got security Oh yes I ve got security But the thing is the ready money Our house has advanced so much on the Courcy property that they don t like going any further and therefore it is that I have to do this myself They ll all have to go abroad that ll be the end of it There s been such a scene between the earl and George George lost his temper and told the earl that Porlock s marriage was his fault It has ended in George with his wife being turned out He has money of his own Yes but he won t spend it He s coming up here and we shall find him hanging about us I don t mean to give him a bed here and I advise you not to do so either You ll not get rid of him if you do I have the greatest possible dislike to him Yes he s a bad fellow So is John Porlock was the best but he s gone altogether to ruin They ve made a nice mess of it between them haven t they This was the family for whose sake Crosbie had jilted Lily Dale His single and simple ambition had been that of being an earl s son in law To achieve that it had been necessary that he should make himself a villain In achieving it he had gone through all manner of dirt and disgrace He had married a woman whom he knew he did not love He was thinking almost hourly of a girl whom he had loved whom he did love but whom he had so injured that under no circumstances could he be allowed to speak to her again The attorney there who sat opposite to him talking about his thousands of pounds with that disgusting assumed solicitude which such men put on when they know very well what they are doing had made a similar marriage But he had known what he was about He had got from his marriage all that he had expected But what had Crosbie got They re a bad set a bad set said he in his bitterness The men are said Gazebee very comfortably H m said Crosbie It was manifest to Gazebee that his friend was expressing a feeling that the women also were not all that they should be but he took no offence though some portion of the censure might thereby be supposed to attach to his own wife The countess means well said Gazebee But she s had a hard life of it a very hard life I ve heard him call her names that would frighten a coal heaver I have indeed But he ll die soon and then she ll be comfortable She has three thousand a year jointure He ll die soon and then she ll be comfortable That was one phase of married life As Crosbie s mind dwelt upon the words he remembered Lily s promise made in the fields that she would do everything for him He remembered her kisses the touch of her fingers the low silvery laughing voice the feel of her dress as she would press close to him After that he reflected whether it would not be well that he too should die so that Alexandrina might be comfortable She and her mother might be very comfortable together with plenty of money at Baden Baden The squire at Allington and missus Dale and Lady Julia De Guest had been and still were uneasy in their minds because no punishment had fallen upon Crosbie no vengeance had overtaken him in consequence of his great sin How little did they know about it Could he have been prosecuted and put into prison with hard labour for twelve months the punishment would not have been heavier He would in that case at any rate have been saved from Lady Alexandrina George and his wife are coming up to town couldn t we ask them to come to us for a week or so said his wife to him as soon as they were in the fly together going home No shouted Crosbie we will do no such thing There was not another word said on the subject nor on any other subject till they got home When they reached their house Alexandrina had a headache and went up to her room immediately Crosbie threw himself into a chair before the remains of a fire in the dining room and resolved that he would cut the whole De Courcy family altogether His wife as his wife should obey him She should obey him or else leave him and go her way by herself leaving him to go his way There was an income of twelve hundred a year Would it not be a fine thing for him if he could keep six hundred for himself and return to his old manner of life All his old comforts of course he would not have nor the old esteem and regard of men But the luxury of a club dinner he might enjoy Unembarrassed evenings might be his with liberty to him to pass them as he pleased He knew many men who were separated from their wives and who seemed to be as happy as their neighbours And then he remembered how ugly Alexandrina had been this evening wearing a great tinsel coronet full of false stones with a cold in her head which had reddened her nose There had too fallen upon her in these her married days a certain fixed dreary dowdiness She certainly was very plain So he said to himself and then he went to bed I myself am inclined to think that his punishment was sufficiently severe The next morning his wife still complained of headache so that he breakfasted alone Since that positive refusal which he had given to her proposition for inviting her brother there had not been much conversation between them My head is splitting and Sarah shall bring some tea and toast up to me if you will not mind it He did not mind it in the least and ate his breakfast by himself with more enjoyment than usually attended that meal It was clear to him that all the present satisfaction of his life must come to him from his office work There are men who find it difficult to live without some source of daily comfort and he was such a man He could hardly endure his life unless there were some page in it on which he could look with gratified eyes He had always liked his work and he now determined that he would like it better than ever But in order that he might do so it was necessary that he should have much of his own way According to the theory of his office it was incumbent on him as Secretary simply to take the orders of the Commissioners and see that they were executed and to such work as this his predecessor had strictly confined himself But he had already done more than this and had conceived the ambition of holding the Board almost under his thumb He flattered himself that he knew his own work and theirs better than they knew either and that by a little management he might be their master It is not impossible that such might have been the case had there been no fracas at the Paddington station but as we all know the dominant cock of the farmyard must be ever dominant When he shall once have had his wings so smeared with mud as to give him even the appearance of adversity no other cock will ever respect him again mister Optimist and mister Butterwell knew very well that their secretary had been cudgelled and they could not submit themselves to a secretary who had been so treated Oh by the by Crosbie said Butterwell coming into his room soon after his arrival at his office on that day of his solitary breakfast I want to say just a few words to you And Butterwell turned round and closed the door the lock of which had not previously been fastened Crosbie without much thinking immediately foretold himself the nature of the coming conversation Do you know said Butterwell beginning Sit down won t you said Crosbie seating himself as he spoke If there was to be a contest he would make the best fight he could He would show a better spirit here than he had done on the railway platform Butterwell did sit down and felt as he did so that the very motion of sitting took away some of his power He ought to have sent for Crosbie into his own room A man when he wishes to reprimand another should always have the benefit of his own atmosphere I don t want to find any fault Butterwell began I hope you have not any cause said Crosbie No no I don t say that I have But we think at the Board Stop stop Butterwell If anything unpleasant is coming it had better come from the Board I should take it in better spirit I should indeed What takes place at the Board must be official I shall not mind that in the least I should rather like it than otherwise It simply amounts to this that we think you are taking a little too much on yourself No doubt it s a fault on the right side and arises from your wishing to have the work well done And if I don t do it who will asked Crosbie The Board is very well able to get through all that appertains to it Come Crosbie you and I have known each other a great many years and it would be a pity that we should have any words I have come to you in this way because it would be disagreeable to you to have any question raised officially Optimist isn t given to being very angry but he was downright angry yesterday You had better take what I say in good part and go along a little quieter But Crosbie was not in a humour to take anything quietly He was sore all over and prone to hit out at everybody that he met I have done my duty to the best of my ability mister Butterwell he said and I believe I have done it well I believe I know my duty here as well as any one can teach me If I have done more than my share of work it is because other people have done less than theirs As he spoke there was a black cloud upon his brow and the Commissioner could perceive that the Secretary was very wrathful Oh very well said Butterwell rising from his chair I can only under such circumstances speak to the Chairman and he will tell you what he thinks at the Board I think you re foolish I do indeed As for myself I have only meant to act kindly by you After that mister Butterwell took himself off On the same afternoon Crosbie was summoned into the Board room in the usual way between two and three This was a daily occurrence as he always sat for about an hour with two out of the three Commissioners after they had fortified themselves with a biscuit and a glass of sherry On the present occasion the usual amount of business was transacted but it was done in a manner which made Crosbie feel that they did not all stand together on their usual footing The three Commissioners were all there The Chairman gave his directions in a solemn pompous voice which was by no means usual to him when he was in good humour The Major said little or nothing but there was a gleam of satisfied sarcasm in his eye Things were going wrong at the Board and he was pleased mister Butterwell was exceedingly civil in his demeanour and rather more than ordinarily brisk As soon as the regular work of the day was over mister Optimist shuffled about on his chair rising from his seat and then sitting down again He looked through a lot of papers close to his hand peering at them over his spectacles Then he selected one took off his spectacles leaned back in his chair and began his little speech mister Crosbie he said we are all very much gratified very much gratified indeed by your zeal and energy in the service Thank you sir said Crosbie I am fond of the service Exactly exactly we all feel that But we think that you if I were to say take too much upon yourself I should say perhaps more than we mean Don t say more than you mean mister Optimist Crosbie s eyes as he spoke gleamed slightly with his momentary triumph as did also those of Major Fiasco No no no said mister Optimist I would say rather less than more to so very good a public servant as yourself But you doubtless understand me I don t think I do quite sir If I have not taken too much on me what is it that I have done that I ought not to have done You have given directions in many cases for which you ought first to have received authority Here is an instance and the selected paper was at once brought out It was a matter in which the Secretary had been manifestly wrong according to written law and he could not defend it on its own merits If you wish me said he to confine myself exactly to the positive instructions of the office I will do so but I think you will find it inconvenient It will be far the best said mister Optimist Very well said mister Crosbie it shall be done And he at once determined to make himself as unpleasant to the three gentlemen in the room as he might find it within his power to do He could make himself very unpleasant but the unpleasantness would be as much to him as to them Nothing would now go right with him He could look in no direction for satisfaction He sauntered into Sebright s as he went home but he could not find words to speak to any one about the little matters of the day He went home and his wife though she was up complained still of her headache I haven t been out of the house all day she said and that has made it worse I don t know how you are to get out if you won t walk he answered Then there was no more said between them till they sat down to their meal Had the squire at Allington known all he might I think have been satisfied with the punishment which Crosbie had encountered CHAPTER XLIX PREPARATIONS FOR GOING ILLUSTRATION untitled Mamma read that letter It was missus Dale s eldest daughter who spoke to her and they were alone together in the parlour at the Small House missus Dale took the letter and read it very carefully She then put it back into its envelope and returned it to Bell It is at any rate a good letter and as I believe tells the truth I think it tells a little more than the truth mamma As you say it is a well written letter He always writes well when he is in earnest But yet Yet what my dear There is more head than heart in it If so he will suffer the less that is if you are quite resolved in the matter I am quite resolved and I do not think he will suffer much He would not I suppose have taken the trouble to write like that if he did not wish this thing I am quite sure that he does wish it most earnestly and that he will be greatly disappointed As he would be if any other scheme did not turn out to his satisfaction that is all The letter of course was from Bell s cousin Bernard and containing the strongest plea he was able to make in favour of his suit for her hand Bernard Dale was better able to press such a plea by letter than by spoken words He was a man capable of doing anything well in the doing of which a little time for consideration might be given to him but he had not in him that power of passion which will force a man to eloquence in asking for that which he desires to obtain His letter on this occasion was long and well argued If there was little in it of passionate love there was much of pleasant flattery He told Bell how advantageous to both their families their marriage would be he declared to her that his own feeling in the matter had been rendered stronger by absence he alluded without boasting to his past career of life as her best guarantee for his future conduct he explained to her that if this marriage could be arranged there need then at any rate be no further question as to his aunt removing with Lily from the Small House and then he told her that his affection for herself was the absorbing passion of his existence Had the letter been written with the view of obtaining from a third person a favourable verdict as to his suit it would have been a very good letter indeed but there was not a word in it that could stir the heart of such a girl as Bell Dale Answer him kindly missus Dale said As kindly as I know how said Bell I wish you would write the letter mamma I fear that would not do What I should say would only tempt him to try again missus Dale knew very well had known for some months past that Bernard s suit was hopeless She felt certain although the matter had not been discussed between them that whenever doctor Crofts might choose to come again and ask for her daughter s hand he would not be refused Of the two men she probably liked doctor Crofts the best but she liked them both and she could not but remember that the one in a worldly point of view would be a very poor match whereas the other would in all respects be excellent She would not on any account say a word to influence her daughter and knew moreover that no word which she could say would influence her but she could not divest herself of some regret that it should be so I know what you would wish mamma said Bell I have but one wish dearest and that is for your happiness May God preserve you from any such fate as Lily s When I tell you to write kindly to your cousin I simply mean that I think him to have deserved a kind reply by his honesty It shall be as kind as I can make it mamma but you know what the lady says in the play how hard it is to take the sting from that word no Then Bell walked out alone for a while and on her return got her desk and wrote her letter It was very firm and decisive As for that wit which should pluck the sting from such a sharp and waspish word as no I fear she had it not It will be better to make him understand that I also am in earnest she said to herself and in this frame of mind she wrote her letter Pray do not allow yourself to think that what I have said is unfriendly she added in a postscript I know how good you are and I know the great value of what I refuse but in this matter it must be my duty to tell you the simple truth It had been decided between the squire and missus Dale that the removal from the Small House to Guestwick was not to take place till the first of May When he had been made to understand that doctor Crofts had thought it injudicious that Lily should be taken out of their present house in March he had used all the eloquence of which he was master to induce missus Dale to consent to abandon her project He had told her that he had always considered that house as belonging of right to some other of the family than himself that it had always been so inhabited and that no squire of Allington had for years past taken rent for it There is no favour conferred none at all he had said but speaking nevertheless in his usual sharp ungenial tone There is a favour a great favour and great generosity missus Dale had replied And I have never been too proud to accept it but when I tell you that we think we shall be happier at Guestwick you will not refuse to let us go Lily has had a great blow in that house and Bell feels that she is running counter to your wishes on her behalf wishes that are so very kind No more need be said about that All that may come right yet if you will remain where you are But missus Dale knew that all that could never come right and persisted Indeed she would hardly have dared to tell her girls that she had yielded to the squire s entreaties It was just then at that very time that the squire was as it were in treaty with the earl about Lily s fortune and he did feel it hard that he should be opposed in such a way by his own relatives at the moment when he was behaving towards them with so much generosity But in his arguments about the house he said nothing of Lily or her future prospects They were to move on the first of May and one week of April was already past The squire had said nothing further on the matter after the interview with missus Dale to which allusion has just been made He was vexed and sore at the separation thinking that he was ill used by the feeling which was displayed by this refusal He had done his duty by them as he thought indeed more than his duty and now they told him that they were leaving him because they could no longer bear the weight of an obligation conferred by his hands But in truth he did not understand them nor did they understand him He had been hard in his manner and had occasionally domineered not feeling that his position though it gave him all the privileges of a near and a dear friend did not give him the authority of a father or a husband In that matter of Bernard s proposed marriage he had spoken as though Bell should have considered his wishes before she refused her cousin He had taken upon himself to scold missus Dale and had thereby given offence to the girls which they at the time had found it utterly impossible to forgive But they were hardly better satisfied in the matter than was he and now that the time had come though they could not bring themselves to go back from their demand almost felt that they were treating the squire with cruelty When their decision had been made while it had been making he had been stern and hard to them Since that he had been softened by Lily s misfortune and softened also by the anticipated loneliness which would come upon him when they should be gone from his side It was hard upon him that they should so treat him when he was doing his best for them all And they also felt this though they did not know the extent to which he was anxious to go in serving them When they had sat round the fire planning the scheme of their removal their hearts had been hardened against him and they had resolved to assert their independence But now when the time for action had come they felt that their grievances against him had already been in a great measure assuaged This tinged all that they did with a certain sadness but still they continued their work Who does not know how terrible are those preparations for house moving how infinite in number are the articles which must be packed how inexpressibly uncomfortable is the period of packing and how poor and tawdry is the aspect of one s belongings while they are thus in a state of dislocation Now a days people who understand the world and have money commensurate with their understanding have learned the way of shunning all these disasters and of leaving the work to the hands of persons paid for doing it The crockery is left in the cupboards the books on the shelves the wine in the bins the curtains on their poles and the family that is understanding goes for a fortnight to Brighton At the end of that time the crockery is comfortably settled in other cupboards the books on other shelves the wine in other bins the curtains are hung on other poles and all is arranged But missus Dale and her daughters understood nothing of such a method of moving as this The assistance of the village carpenter in filling certain cases that he had made was all that they knew how to obtain beyond that of their own two servants Every article had to pass through the hands of some one of the family and as they felt almost overwhelmed by the extent of the work to be done they began it much sooner than was necessary so that it became evident as they advanced in their work that they would have to pass a dreadfully dull stupid uncomfortable week at last among their boxes and cases in all the confusion of dismantled furniture At first an edict had gone forth that Lily was to do nothing She was an invalid and was to be petted and kept quiet But this edict soon fell to the ground and Lily worked harder than either her mother or her sister In truth she was hardly an invalid any longer and would not submit to an invalid s treatment She felt herself that for the present constant occupation could alone save her from the misery of looking back and she had conceived an idea that the harder that occupation was the better it would be for her While pulling down the books and folding the linen and turning out from their old hiding places the small long forgotten properties of the household she would be as gay as ever she had been in old times She would talk over her work standing with flushed cheek and laughing eyes among the dusty ruins around her till for a moment her mother would think that all was well within her But then at other moments when the reaction came it would seem as though nothing were well She could not sit quietly over the fire with quiet rational work in her hands and chat in a rational quiet way Not as yet could she do so Nevertheless it was well with her within her own bosom She had declared to herself that she would conquer her misery as she had also declared to herself during her illness that her misfortune should not kill her and she was in the way to conquer it She told herself that the world was not over for her because her sweet hopes had been frustrated The wound had been deep and very sore but the flesh of the patient had been sound and healthy and her blood pure A physician having knowledge in such cases would have declared after long watching of her symptoms that a cure was probable Her mother was the physician who watched her with the closest eyes and she though she was sometimes driven to doubt did hope with stronger hope from day to day that her child might live to remember the story of her love without abiding agony That nobody should talk to her about it that had been the one stipulation which she had seemed to make not sending forth a request to that effect among her friends in so many words but showing by certain signs that such was her stipulation A word to that effect she had spoken to her uncle as may be remembered which word had been regarded with the closest obedience She had gone out into her little world very soon after the news of Crosbie s falsehood had reached her first to church and then among the people of the village resolving to carry herself as though no crushing weight had fallen upon her The village people had understood it all listening to her and answering her without the proffer of any outspoken parley Lord bless ee said missus Crump the postmistress and missus Crump was supposed to have the sourest temper in Allington whenever I look at thee Miss Lily I thinks that surely thee is the beautifulest young ooman in all these parts And you are the crossest old woman said Lily laughing and giving her hand to the postmistress So I be said missus Crump So I be Then Lily sat down in the cottage and asked after her ailments With missus Hearn it was the same missus Hearn after that first meeting which has been already mentioned petted and caressed her but spoke no further word of her misfortune When Lily called a second time upon missus Boyce which she did boldly by herself that lady did begin one other word of commiseration My dearest Lily we have all been made so unhappy So far missus Boyce got sitting close to Lily and striving to look into her face but Lily with a slightly heightened colour turned sharp round upon one of the Boyce girls tearing missus Boyce s commiseration into the smallest shreds Minnie she said speaking quite loud almost with girlish ecstasy what do you think Tartar did yesterday I never laughed so much in my life Then she told a ludicrous story about a very ugly terrier which belonged to the squire After that even missus Boyce made no further attempt missus Dale and Bell both understood that such was to be the rule the rule even to them Lily would speak to them occasionally on the matter to one of them at a time beginning with some almost single word of melancholy resignation and then would go on till she opened her very bosom before them but no such conversation was ever begun by them But now in these busy days of the packing that topic seemed to have been banished altogether Mamma she said standing on the top rung of a house ladder from which position she was handing down glass out of a cupboard are you sure that these things are ours I think some of them belong to the house I m sure about that bowl at any rate because it was my mother s before I was married Oh dear what should I do if I were to break it Whenever I handle anything very precious I always feel inclined to throw it down and smash it Oh it was as nearly gone as possible mamma but that was your fault If you don t take care you ll be nearly gone yourself Do take hold of something Oh Bell here s the inkstand for which you ve been moaning for three years ILLUSTRATION Bell here s the inkstand I haven t been moaning for three years but who could have put it up there Catch it said Lily and she threw the bottle down on to a pile of carpets At this moment a step was heard in the hall and the squire entered through the open door of the room So you re all at work said he Yes we re at work said missus Dale almost with a tone of shame If it is to be done it is as well that it should be got over It makes me wretched enough said the squire But I didn t come to talk about that I ve brought you a note from Lady Julia De Guest and I ve had one from the earl They want us all to go there and stay the week after Easter missus Dale and the girls when this very sudden proposition was made to them all remained fixed in their places and for a moment were speechless Go and stay a week at Guestwick Manor The whole family Hitherto the intercourse between the Manor and the Small House had been confined to morning calls very far between missus Dale had never dined there and had latterly even deputed the calling to her daughters Once Bell had dined there with her uncle the squire and once Lily had gone over with her uncle Orlando Even this had been long ago before they were quite brought out and they had regarded the occasion with the solemn awe of children Now at this time of their flitting into some small mean dwelling at Guestwick they had previously settled among themselves that that affair of calling at the Manor might be allowed to drop missus Eames never called and they were descending to the level of missus Eames Perhaps we shall get game sent to us and that will be better Lily had said And now at this very moment of their descent in life they were all asked to go and stay a week at the Manor Stay a week with Lady Julia Had the Queen sent the Lord Chamberlain down to bid them all go to Windsor Castle it could hardly have startled them more at the first blow Bell had been seated on the folded carpet when her uncle had entered and now had again sat herself in the same place Lily was still standing at the top of the ladder and missus Dale was at the foot with one hand on Lily s dress The squire had told his story very abruptly but he was a man who having a story to tell knew nothing better than to tell it out abruptly letting out everything at the first moment Wants us all said missus Dale How many does the all mean Then she opened Lady Julia s note and read it not moving from her position at the foot of the ladder Do let me see mamma said Lily and then the note was handed up to her Had missus Dale well considered the matter she might probably have kept the note to herself for a while but the whole thing was so sudden that she had not considered the matter well MY DEAR missus DALE the letter ran I send this inside a note from my brother to mister Dale We particularly want you and your two girls to come to us for a week from the seventeenth of this month Considering our near connection we ought to have seen more of each other than we have done for years past and of course it has been our fault But it is never too late to amend one s ways and I hope you will receive my confession in the true spirit of affection in which it is intended and that you will show your goodness by coming to us I will do all I can to make the house pleasant to your girls for both of whom I have much real regard I should tell you that John Eames will be here for the same week My brother is very fond of him and thinks him the best young man of the day He is one of my heroes too I must confess Very sincerely yours JULIA DE GUEST Lily standing on the ladder read the letter very attentively The squire meanwhile stood below speaking a word or two to his sister in law and niece No one could see Lily s face as it was turned away towards the window and it was still averted when she spoke It is out of the question that we should go mamma that is all of us Why out of the question said the squire A whole family said missus Dale That is just what they want said the squire I should like of all things to be left alone for a week said Lily if mamma and Bell would go That wouldn t do at all said the squire Lady Julia specially wants you to be one of the party The thing had been badly managed altogether The reference in Lady Julia s note to John Eames had explained to Lily the whole scheme at once and had so opened her eyes that all the combined influence of the Dale and De Guest families could not have dragged her over to the Manor Why not do said Lily It would be out of the question a whole family going in that way but it would be very nice for Bell No it would not said Bell Don t be ungenerous about it my dear said the squire turning to Bell Lady Julia means to be kind But my darling and the squire turned again towards Lily addressing her as was his wont in these days with an affection that was almost vexatious to her but my darling why should you not go A change of scene like that will do you all the good in the world just when you are getting well Mary tell the girls that they ought to go missus Dale stood silent again reading the note and Lily came down from the ladder When she reached the floor she went directly up to her uncle and taking his hand turned him round with herself towards one of the windows so that they stood with their backs to the room Uncle she said do not be angry with me I can t go and then she put up her face to kiss him He stooped and kissed her and still held her hand He looked into her face and read it all He knew well now why she could not go or rather why she herself thought that she could not go Cannot you my darling he said No uncle It is very kind very kind but I cannot go I am not fit to go anywhere But you should get over that feeling You should make a struggle I am struggling and I shall succeed but I cannot do it all at once At any rate I could not go there You must give my love to Lady Julia and not let her think me cross Perhaps Bell will go What would be the good of Bell s going or the good of his putting himself out of the way by a visit which would of itself be so tiresome to him if the one object of the visit could not be carried out The earl and his sister had planned the invitation with the express intention of bringing Lily and Eames together It seemed that Lily was firm in her determination to resist this intention and if so it would be better that the whole thing should fall to the ground He was very vexed and yet he was not angry with her Everybody lately had opposed him in everything All his intended family arrangements had gone wrong But yet he was seldom angry respecting them He was so accustomed to be thwarted that he hardly expected success In this matter of providing Lily with a second lover he had not come forward of his own accord He had been appealed to by his neighbour the earl and had certainly answered the appeal with much generosity He had been induced to make the attempt with eagerness and a true desire for its accomplishment but in this as in all his own schemes he was met at once by opposition and failure I will leave you to talk it over among yourselves he said But Mary you had better see me before you send your answer If you will come up by and by Ralph shall take the two notes over together in the afternoon So saying he left the Small House and went back to his own solitary home Lily dear said missus Dale as soon as the front door had been closed this is meant for kindness to you for most affectionate kindness I know it mamma and you must go to Lady Julia and must tell her that I know it You must give her my love And indeed I do love her now But You won t go Lily said missus Dale beseechingly No mamma certainly I will not go Then she escaped out of the room by herself and for the next hour neither of them dared to go to her CHAPTER L missus DALE IS THANKFUL FOR A GOOD THING 
5712_48848_000004_000000	train-clean-360	On that day they dined early at the Small House as they had been in the habit of doing since the packing had commenced 
5712_48848_000004_000001	train-clean-360	And after dinner missus Dale went through the gardens up to the other house with a written note in her hand 
5712_48848_000004_000002	train-clean-360	In that note she had told Lady Julia with many protestations of gratitude that Lily was unable to go out so soon after her illness and that she herself was obliged to stay with Lily 
5712_48848_000004_000003	train-clean-360	She explained also that the business of moving was in hand and that therefore she could not herself accept the invitation 
5712_48848_000004_000004	train-clean-360	But her other daughter she said would be very happy to accompany her uncle to Guestwick Manor 
5712_48848_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Then without closing her letter she took it up to the squire in order that it might be decided whether it would or would not suit his views 
none	none	It might well be that he would not care to go to Lord De Guest s with Bell alone
5712_48848_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Leave it with me he said that is if you do not object 
none	none	Oh dear no
5712_48848_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you the plain truth at once Mary 
5712_48848_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I shall go over myself with it and see the earl 
5712_48848_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Then I will decline it or not according to what passes between me and him 
5712_48848_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I wish Lily would have gone 
none	none	Ah she could not
5712_48848_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish she could 
5712_48848_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I wish she could 
none	none	I wish she could 
5712_48848_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I wish she could As he repeated the words over and over again there was an eagerness in his voice that filled missus Dale s heart with tenderness towards him 
5712_48848_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 The truth is said missus Dale she could not go there to meet John Eames 
5712_48848_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I know said the squire I understand it 
5712_48848_000011_000001	train-clean-360	But that is just what we want her to do 
5712_48848_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Why should she not spend a week in the same house with an honest young man whom we all like 
5712_48848_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 There are reasons why she would not wish it 
none	none	Ah exactly the very reasons which should make us induce her to go there if we can 
5712_48848_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps I had better tell you all 
5712_48848_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Lord De Guest has taken him by the hand and wishes him to marry 
5712_48848_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He has promised to settle on him an income which will make him comfortable for life 
5712_48848_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That is very generous and I am delighted to hear it for John s sake 
5712_48848_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 And they have promoted him at his office 
5712_48848_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah then he will do well 
none	none	He will do very well 
5712_48848_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He is private secretary now to their head man And Mary so that she Lily should not be empty handed if this marriage can be arranged I have undertaken to settle a hundred a year on her on her and her children if she will accept him 
none	none	Now you know it all 
5712_48848_000017_000003	train-clean-360	I did not mean to tell you but it is as well that you should have the means of judging 
5712_48848_000017_000004	train-clean-360	That other man was a villain This man is honest 
5712_48848_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Would it not be well that she should learn to like him 
5712_48848_000017_000006	train-clean-360	She always did like him I thought before that other fellow came down here among us 
5712_48848_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 She has always liked him as a friend 
5712_48848_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 She will never get a better lover 
5712_48848_000020_000000	train-clean-360	missus Dale sat silent thinking over it all 
5712_48848_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Every word that the squire said was true 
5712_48848_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It would be a healing of wounds most desirable and salutary an arrangement advantageous to them all a destiny for Lily most devoutly to be desired if only it were possible 
5712_48848_000020_000003	train-clean-360	missus Dale firmly believed that if her daughter could be made to accept John Eames as her second lover in a year or two all would be well Crosbie would then be forgotten or thought of without regret and Lily would become the mistress of a happy home 
5712_48848_000020_000004	train-clean-360	But there are positions which cannot be reached though there be no physical or material objection in the way 
5712_48848_000020_000005	train-clean-360	It is the view which the mind takes of a thing which creates the sorrow that arises from it 
5712_48848_000020_000006	train-clean-360	If the heart were always malleable and the feelings could be controlled who would permit himself to be tormented by any of the reverses which affection meets 
5712_48848_000020_000007	train-clean-360	Death would create no sorrow ingratitude would lose its sting and the betrayal of love would do no injury beyond that which it might entail upon worldly circumstances 
5712_48848_000020_000008	train-clean-360	But the heart is not malleable nor will the feelings admit of such control 
5712_48848_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not possible for her said missus Dale 
5712_48848_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 I fear it is not possible 
5712_48848_000021_000002	train-clean-360	It is too soon 
5712_48848_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Six months pleaded the squire 
5712_48848_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 It will take years not months said missus Dale 
5712_48848_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 And she will lose all her youth 
none	none	Yes he has done all that by his treachery 
5712_48848_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But it is done and we cannot now go back 
5712_48848_000025_000002	train-clean-360	She loves him yet as dearly as she ever loved him 
5712_48848_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Then the squire muttered certain words below his breath ejaculations against Crosbie which were hardly voluntary but even as involuntary ejaculations were very improper 
5712_48848_000026_000001	train-clean-360	missus Dale heard them and was not offended either by their impropriety or their warmth 
5712_48848_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 But you can understand she said that she cannot bring herself to go there The squire struck the table with his fist and repeated his ejaculations 
none	none	If he could only have known how very disagreeable Lady Alexandrina was making herself his spirit might perhaps have been less vehemently disturbed 
5712_48848_000026_000004	train-clean-360	If also he could have perceived and understood the light in which an alliance with the De Courcy family was now regarded by Crosbie I think that he would have received some consolation from that consideration 
5712_48848_000026_000005	train-clean-360	Those who offend us are generally punished for the offence they give but we so frequently miss the satisfaction of knowing that we are avenged 
5712_48848_000026_000006	train-clean-360	It is arranged apparently that the injurer shall be punished but that the person injured shall not gratify his desire for vengeance 
5712_48848_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 And will you go to Guestwick yourself asked missus Dale 
5712_48848_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I will take the note said the squire and will let you know to morrow 
5712_48848_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The earl has behaved so kindly that every possible consideration is due to him 
5712_48848_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I had better tell him the whole truth and go or stay as he may wish 
5712_48848_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I don t see the good of going 
5712_48848_000028_000004	train-clean-360	What am I to do at Guestwick Manor 
5712_48848_000028_000005	train-clean-360	I did think that if we had all been there it might have cured some difficulties 
5712_48848_000029_000000	train-clean-360	missus Dale got up to leave him but she could not go without saying some word of gratitude for all that he had attempted to do for them 
5712_48848_000029_000001	train-clean-360	She well knew what he meant by the curing of difficulties He had intended to signify that had they lived together for a week at Guestwick the idea of flitting from Allington might possibly have been abandoned 
none	none	It seemed now to missus Dale as though her brother in law were heaping coals of fire on her head in return for that intention 
5712_48848_000029_000003	train-clean-360	She felt half ashamed of what she was doing almost acknowledging to herself that she should have borne with his sternness in return for the benefits he had done to her daughters Had she not feared their reproaches she would even now have given way 
5712_48848_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know what I ought to say to you for your kindness 
none	none	Say nothing either for my kindness or unkindness but stay where you are and let us live like Christians together striving to think good and not evil These were kind loving words showing in themselves a spirit of love and forbearance but they were spoken in a harsh unsympathizing voice and the speaker as he uttered them looked gloomily at the fire 
5712_48848_000031_000001	train-clean-360	In truth the squire as he spoke was half ashamed of the warmth of what he said 
5712_48848_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 At any rate I will not think evil missus Dale answered giving him her hand 
5712_48848_000032_000001	train-clean-360	After that she left him and returned home 
none	none	It was too late for her to abandon her project of moving and remain at the Small House but as she went across the garden she almost confessed to herself that she repented of what she was doing 
5712_48848_000033_000000	train-clean-360	In these days of the cold early spring the way from the lawn into the house through the drawing room window was not as yet open and it was necessary to go round by the kitchen garden on to the road and thence in by the front door or else to pass through the back door and into the house by the kitchen 
5712_48848_000033_000001	train-clean-360	This latter mode of entrance missus Dale now adopted and as she made her way into the hall Lily came upon her with very silent steps out from the parlour and arrested her progress 
5712_48848_000033_000002	train-clean-360	There was a smile upon Lily s face as she lifted up her finger as if in caution and no one looking at her would have supposed that she was herself in trouble 
5712_48848_000033_000003	train-clean-360	 Mamma she said pointing to the drawing room door and speaking almost in a whisper you must not go in there come into the parlour 
5712_48848_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Who s there 
5712_48848_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Where s Bell and missus Dale went into the parlour as she was bidden 
5712_48848_000034_000002	train-clean-360	 But who is there she repeated 
none	none	He s there
5712_48848_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is he 
5712_48848_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamma don t be a goose 
5712_48848_000037_000001	train-clean-360	doctor Crofts is there of course 
5712_48848_000037_000002	train-clean-360	He s been nearly an hour 
5712_48848_000037_000003	train-clean-360	I wonder how he is managing for there is nothing on earth to sit upon but the old lump of a carpet 
5712_48848_000037_000004	train-clean-360	The room is strewed about with crockery and Bell is such a figure 
5712_48848_000037_000005	train-clean-360	She has got on your old checked apron and when he came in she was rolling up the fire irons in brown paper 
5712_48848_000037_000006	train-clean-360	I don t suppose she was ever in such a mess before 
5712_48848_000037_000007	train-clean-360	There s one thing certain he can t kiss her hand 
5712_48848_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 It s you are the goose Lily 
5712_48848_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 But he s in there certainly unless he has gone out through the window or up the chimney 
5712_48848_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 What made you leave them 
5712_48848_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 He met me here in the passage and spoke to me ever so seriously Come in I said and see Bell packing the pokers and tongs I will go in he said but don t come with me He was ever so serious and I m sure he had been thinking of it all the way along 
5712_48848_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 And why should he not be serious 
5712_48848_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no of course he ought to be serious but are you not glad mamma 
none	none	I am so glad 
5712_48848_000043_000002	train-clean-360	We shall live alone together you and I but she will be so close to us 
none	none	My belief is that he ll stay there for ever unless somebody does something 
5712_48848_000043_000004	train-clean-360	I have been so tired of waiting and looking out for you 
5712_48848_000043_000005	train-clean-360	Perhaps he s helping her to pack the things Don t you think we might go in or would it be ill natured 
5712_48848_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Lily don t be in too great a hurry to say anything 
5712_48848_000044_000001	train-clean-360	You may be mistaken you know and there s many a slip between the cup and the lip 
5712_48848_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes mamma there is said Lily putting her hand inside her mother s arm that s true enough 
5712_48848_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my darling forgive me said the mother suddenly remembering that the use of the old proverb at the present moment had been almost cruel 
none	none	Do not mind it said Lily it does not hurt me it does me good that is to say when there is nobody by except yourself 
5712_48848_000047_000001	train-clean-360	But with God s help there shall be no slip here and she shall be happy 
none	none	It is all the difference between one thing done in a hurry and another done with much thinking 
5712_48848_000047_000003	train-clean-360	But they ll remain there for ever if we don t go in 
none	none	Come mamma you open the door 
5712_48848_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Then missus Dale did open the door giving some little premonitory notice with the handle so that the couple inside might be warned of approaching footsteps 
none	none	Crofts had not escaped either through the window or up the chimney but was seated in the middle of the room on an empty box just opposite to Bell who was seated upon the lump of carpeting 
5712_48848_000048_000002	train-clean-360	Bell still wore the checked apron as described by her sister 
5712_48848_000048_000003	train-clean-360	What might have been the state of her hands I will not pretend to say but I do not believe that her lover had found anything amiss with them 
5712_48848_000048_000004	train-clean-360	 How do you do doctor said missus Dale striving to use her accustomed voice and to look as though there were nothing of special importance in his visit 
5712_48848_000048_000005	train-clean-360	 I have just come down from the Great House 
5712_48848_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Mamma said Bell jumping up you must not call him doctor any more 
5712_48848_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Must I not 
5712_48848_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Has any one undoctored him 
5712_48848_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamma you understand said Bell 
5712_48848_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I understand said Lily going up to the doctor and giving him her cheek to kiss he is to be my brother and I mean to claim him as such from this moment 
5712_48848_000052_000001	train-clean-360	I expect him to do everything for us and not to call a moment of his time his own 
5712_48848_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Dale said the doctor Bell has consented that it shall be so if you will consent 
5712_48848_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 There is but little doubt of that said missus Dale 
5712_48848_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 We shall not be rich began the doctor 
5712_48848_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate to be rich said Bell 
5712_48848_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 I hate even to talk about it 
5712_48848_000056_000002	train-clean-360	I don t think it quite manly even to think about it and I m sure it isn t womanly 
5712_48848_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Bell was always a fanatic in praise of poverty said missus Dale 
none	none	No I m no fanatic 
5712_48848_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I m very fond of money earned 
none	none	I would like to earn some myself if I knew how
5712_48848_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Let her go out and visit the lady patients said Lily 
5712_48848_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 They do in America 
none	none	Then they all went into the parlour and sat round the fire talking as though they were already one family 
5712_48848_000060_000001	train-clean-360	The proceeding considering the nature of it that a young lady acknowledged to be of great beauty and known to be of good birth had on the occasion been asked and given in marriage was carried on after a somewhat humdrum fashion and in a manner that must be called commonplace 
none	none	How different had it been when Crosbie had made his offer 
5712_48848_000060_000003	train-clean-360	Lily for the time had been raised to a pinnacle a pinnacle which might be dangerous but which was at any rate lofty 
5712_48848_000060_000004	train-clean-360	With what a pretty speech had Crosbie been greeted 
5712_48848_000060_000005	train-clean-360	How it had been felt by all concerned that the fortunes of the Small House were in the ascendant felt indeed with some trepidation but still with much inward triumph 
5712_48848_000060_000006	train-clean-360	How great had been the occasion forcing Lily almost to lose herself in wonderment at what had occurred 
5712_48848_000060_000007	train-clean-360	There was no great occasion now and no wonderment 
5712_48848_000060_000008	train-clean-360	No one unless it was Crofts felt very triumphant 
5712_48848_000060_000009	train-clean-360	But they were all very happy and were sure that there was safety in their happiness 
5712_48848_000060_000010	train-clean-360	It was but the other day that one of them had been thrown rudely to the ground through the treachery of a lover but yet none of them feared treachery from this lover 
5712_48848_000060_000011	train-clean-360	Bell was as sure of her lot in life as though she were already being taken home to her modest house in Guestwick 
none	none	missus Dale already looked upon the man as her son and the party of four as they sat round the fire grouped themselves as though they already formed one family 
5712_48848_000061_000000	train-clean-360	But Bell was not seated next to her lover 
none	none	Lily when she had once accepted Crosbie seemed to think that she could never be too near to him 
5712_48848_000061_000002	train-clean-360	She had been in no wise ashamed of her love and had shown it constantly by some little caressing motion of her hand leaning on his arm looking into his face as though she were continually desirous of some palpable assurance of his presence 
5712_48848_000061_000003	train-clean-360	It was not so at all with Bell 
none	none	She was happy in loving and in being loved but she required no overt testimonies of affection 
5712_48848_000061_000005	train-clean-360	I do not think it would have made her unhappy if some sudden need had required that Crofts should go to India and back before they were married 
none	none	The thing was settled and that was enough for her But on the other hand when he spoke of the expediency of an immediate marriage she raised no difficulty 
5712_48848_000061_000008	train-clean-360	As her mother was about to go into a new residence it might be as well that that residence should be fitted to the wants of two persons instead of three 
5712_48848_000061_000009	train-clean-360	So they talked about chairs and tables carpets and kitchens in a most unromantic homely useful manner A considerable portion of the furniture in the house they were now about to leave belonged to the squire or to the house rather as they were in the habit of saying 
5712_48848_000061_000010	train-clean-360	The older and more solid things articles of household stuff that stand the wear of half a century had been in the Small House when they came to it 
none	none	There was therefore a question of buying new furniture for a house in Guestwick a question not devoid of importance to the possessor of so moderate an income as that owned by missus Dale 
5712_48848_000061_000012	train-clean-360	In the first month or two they were to live in lodgings and their goods were to be stored in some friendly warehouse 
5712_48848_000061_000013	train-clean-360	Under such circumstances would it not be well that Bell s marriage should be so arranged that the lodging question might not be in any degree complicated by her necessities 
5712_48848_000061_000014	train-clean-360	This was the last suggestion made by doctor Crofts induced no doubt by the great encouragement he had received 
5712_48848_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 That would be hardly possible said missus Dale 
5712_48848_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 It only wants three weeks and with the house in such a condition 
5712_48848_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 James is joking said Bell 
5712_48848_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I was not joking at all said the doctor 
none	none	Why not send for mister Boyce and carry her off at once on a pillion behind you said Lily
5712_48848_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 It s just the sort of thing for primitive people to do like you and Bell 
5712_48848_000065_000002	train-clean-360	All the same Bell I do wish you could have been married from this house 
5712_48848_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think it will make much difference said Bell 
none	none	Only if you would have waited till summer we would have had such a nice party on the lawn 
5712_48848_000067_000001	train-clean-360	It sounds so ugly being married from lodgings doesn t it mamma 
none	none	It doesn t sound at all ugly to me said Bell
5712_48848_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall always call you Dame Commonplace when you re married said Lily 
5712_48848_000070_000000	train-clean-360	Then they had tea and after tea doctor Crofts got on his horse and rode back to Guestwick 
5712_48848_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Now may I talk about him said Lily as soon as the door was closed behind his back 
5712_48848_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 No you may not 
5712_48848_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 As if I hadn t known it all along 
5712_48848_000073_000001	train-clean-360	And wasn t it hard to bear that you should have scolded me with such pertinacious austerity and that I wasn t to say a word in answer 
5712_48848_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t remember the austerity said missus Dale 
5712_48848_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor yet Lily s silence said Bell 
5712_48848_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 But it s all settled now said Lily and I m downright happy 
5712_48848_000076_000001	train-clean-360	I never felt more satisfaction never Bell 
none	none	Nor did I said her mother I may truly say that I thank God for this good thing CHAPTER LI JOHN EAMES DOES THINGS WHICH HE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE John Eames succeeded in making his bargain with Sir Raffle Buffle He accepted the private secretaryship on the plainly expressed condition that he was to have leave of absence for a fortnight towards the end of April Having arranged this he took an affectionate leave of mister Love who was really much affected at parting with him discussed valedictory pots of porter in the big room over which many wishes were expressed that he might be enabled to compass the length and breadth of old Huffle s feet uttered a last cutting joke at mister Kissing as he met that gentleman hurrying through the passages with an enormous ledger in his hands and then took his place in the comfortable arm chair which FitzHoward had been forced to relinquish Don t tell any of the fellows said Fitz but I m going to cut the concern altogether My governor wouldn t let me stop here in any other place than that of private secretary Ah your governor is a swell said Eames I don t know about that said FitzHoward Of course he has a good deal of family interest My cousin is to come in for saint Bungay at the next election and then I can do better than remain here That s a matter of course said Eames If my cousin were Member for saint Bungay I d never stand anything east of Whitehall And I don t mean said FitzHoward This room you know is all very nice but it is a bore coming into the City every day And then one doesn t like to be rung for like a servant Not that I mean to put you out of conceit with it It will do very well for me said Eames I never was very particular And so they parted Eames assuming the beautiful arm chair and the peril of being asked to carry Sir Raffle s shoes while FitzHoward took the vacant desk in the big room till such time as some member of his family should come into Parliament for the borough of saint Bungay But Eames though he drank the porter and quizzed FitzHoward and gibed at Kissing did not seat himself in his new arm chair without some serious thoughts He was aware that his career in London had not hitherto been one on which he could look back with self respect He had lived with friends whom he did not esteem he had been idle and sometimes worse than idle and he had allowed himself to be hampered by the pretended love of a woman for whom he had never felt any true affection and by whom he had been cozened out of various foolish promises which even yet were hanging over his head As he sat with Sir Raffle s notes before him he thought almost with horror of the men and women in Burton Crescent It was now about three years since he had first known Cradell and he shuddered as he remembered how very poor a creature was he whom he had chosen for his bosom friend He could not make for himself those excuses which we can make for him He could not tell himself that he had been driven by circumstances to choose a friend before he had learned to know what were the requisites for which he should look He had lived on terms of closest intimacy with this man for three years and now his eyes were opening themselves to the nature of his friend s character Cradell was in age three years his senior I won t drop him he said to himself but he is a poor creature He thought too of the Lupexes of Miss Spruce and of missus Roper and tried to imagine what Lily Dale would do if she found herself among such people It would be impossible that she should ever so find herself He might as well ask her to drink at the bar of a gin shop as to sit down in missus Roper s drawing room If destiny had in store for him such good fortune as that of calling Lily his own it was necessary that he should altogether alter his mode of life In truth his hobbledehoyhood was dropping off from him as its old skin drops from a snake Much of the feeling and something of the knowledge of manhood was coming on him and he was beginning to recognize to himself that the future manner of his life must be to him a matter of very serious concern No such thought had come near him when he first established himself in London It seems to me that in this respect the fathers and mothers of the present generation understand but little of the inward nature of the young men for whom they are so anxious They give them credit for so much that it is impossible they should have and then deny them credit for so much that they possess They expect from them when boys the discretion of men that discretion which comes from thinking but will not give them credit for any of that power of thought which alone can ultimately produce good conduct Young men are generally thoughtful more thoughtful than their seniors but the fruit of their thought is not as yet there And then so little is done for the amusement of lads who are turned loose into London at nineteen or twenty Can it be that any mother really expects her son to sit alone evening after evening in a dingy room drinking bad tea and reading good books And yet it seems that mothers do so expect the very mothers who talk about the thoughtlessness of youth O ye mothers who from year to year see your sons launched forth upon the perils of the world and who are so careful with your good advice with under flannel shirting with books of devotion and tooth powder does it never occur to you that provision should be made for amusement for dancing for parties for the excitement and comfort of women s society That excitement your sons will have and if it be not provided by you of one kind will certainly be provided by themselves of another kind If I were a mother sending lads out into the world the matter most in my mind would be this to what houses full of nicest girls could I get them admission so that they might do their flirting in good company Poor John Eames had been so placed that he had been driven to do his flirting in very bad company and he was now fully aware that it had been so It wanted but two days to his departure for Guestwick Manor and as he sat breathing a while after the manufacture of a large batch of Sir Raffle s notes he made up his mind that he would give missus Roper notice before he started that on his return to London he would be seen no more in Burton Crescent He would break his bonds altogether asunder and if there should be any penalty for such breaking he would pay it in what best manner he might be able He acknowledged to himself that he had been behaving badly to Amelia confessing indeed more sin in that respect than he had in truth committed but this at any rate was clear to him that he must put himself on a proper footing in that quarter before he could venture to speak to Lily Dale As he came to a definite conclusion on this subject the little handbell which always stood on Sir Raffle s table was sounded and Eames was called into the presence of the great man Ah said Sir Raffle leaning back in his arm chair and stretching himself after the great exertions which he had been making Ah let me see You are going out of town the day after to morrow Yes Sir Raffle the day after to morrow Ah it s a great annoyance a very great annoyance But on such occasions I never think of myself I never have done so and don t suppose I ever shall So you re going down to my old friend De Guest Eames was always angered when his new patron Sir Raffle talked of his old friendship with the earl and never gave the Commissioner any encouragement I am going down to Guestwick said he Ah yes to Guestwick Manor I don t remember that I was ever there I daresay I may have been but one forgets those things I never heard Lord De Guest speak of it Oh dear no Why should his memory be better than mine Tell him will you how very glad I shall be to renew our old intimacy I should think nothing of running down to him for a day or two in the dull time of the year say in September or October It s rather a coincidence our both being interested about you isn t it I ll be sure to tell him Mind you do He s one of our most thoroughly independent noblemen and I respect him very highly Let me see didn t I ring my bell What was it I wanted I think I rang my bell You did ring your bell Ah yes I know I am going away and I wanted my would you tell Rafferty to bring me my boots Whereupon Johnny rang the bell not the little handbell but the other bell And I shan t be here to morrow continued Sir Raffle I ll thank you to send my letters up to the square and if they should send down from the Treasury but the Chancellor would write and in that case you ll send up his letter at once by a special messenger of course Here s Rafferty said Eames determined that he would not even sully his lips with speaking of Sir Raffle s boots Oh ah yes Rafferty bring me my boots Anything else to say asked Eames No nothing else Of course you ll be careful to leave everything straight behind you Oh yes I ll leave it all straight Then Eames withdrew so that he might not be present at the interview between Sir Raffle and his boots He ll not do said Sir Raffle to himself He ll never do He s not quick enough has no go in him He s not man enough for the place I wonder why the earl has taken him by the hand in that way Soon after the little episode of the boots Eames left his office and walked home alone to Burton Crescent He felt that he had gained a victory in Sir Raffle s room but the victory there had been easy Now he had another battle on his hands in which as he believed the achievement of victory would be much more difficult Amelia Roper was a person much more to be feared than the Chief Commissioner He had one strong arrow in his quiver on which he would depend if there should come to him the necessity of giving his enemy a death wound During the last week she had been making powerful love to Cradell so as to justify the punishment of desertion from a former lover He would not throw Cradell in her teeth if he could help it but it was incumbent on him to gain a victory and if the worst should come to the worst he must use such weapons as destiny and the chance of war had given him He found missus Roper in the dining room as he entered and immediately began his work missus Roper he said I m going out of town the day after to morrow Oh yes mister Eames we know that You re going as a visitor to the noble mansion of the Earl De Guest I don t know about the mansion being very noble but I m going down into the country for a fortnight When I come back When you come back mister Eames I hope you ll find your room a deal more comfortable I know it isn t quite what it should be for a gentleman like you and I ve been thinking for some time past But missus Roper I don t mean to come back here any more It s just that that I want to say to you Not come back to the crescent No missus Roper A fellow must move sometimes you know and I m sure I ve been very constant to you for a long time But where are you going mister Eames Well I haven t just made up my mind as yet That is it will depend on what I may do on what friends of mine may say down in the country You ll not think I m quarrelling with you missus Roper It s them Lupexes as have done it said missus Roper in her deep distress No indeed missus Roper nobody has done it Yes it is and I m not going to blame you mister Eames They ve made the house unfit for any decent young gentleman like you I ve been feeling that all along but it s hard upon a lone woman like me isn t it mister Eames But missus Roper the Lupexes have had nothing to do with my going Oh yes they have I understand it all But what could I do mister Eames I ve been giving them warning every week for the last six months but the more I give them warning the more they won t go Unless I were to send for a policeman and have a row in the house But I haven t complained of the Lupexes missus Roper You wouldn t be quitting without any reason mister Eames You are not going to be married in earnest are you mister Eames Not that I know of You may tell me you may indeed I won t say a word not to anybody It hasn t been my fault about Amelia It hasn t really Who says there s been any fault I can see mister Eames Of course it didn t do for me to interfere And if you had liked her I will say I believe she d have made as good a wife as any young man ever took and she can make a few pounds go farther than most girls You can understand a mother s feelings and if there was to be anything I couldn t spoil it could I now But there isn t to be anything So I ve told her for months past I m not going to say anything to blame you but young men ought to be very particular indeed they ought Johnny did not choose to hint to the disconsolate mother that it also behoved young women to be very particular but he thought it I ve wished many a time mister Eames that she had never come here indeed I have But what s a mother to do I couldn t put her outside the door Then missus Roper raised her apron up to her eyes and began to sob I m very sorry if I ve made any mischief said Johnny It hasn t been your fault continued the poor woman from whom as her tears became uncontrollable her true feelings forced themselves and the real outpouring of her feminine nature Nor it hasn t been my fault But I knew what it would come to when I saw how she was going on and I told her so I knew you wouldn t put up with the likes of her Indeed missus Roper I ve always had a great regard for her and for you too But you weren t going to marry her I ve told her so all along and I ve begged her not to do it almost on my knees I have but she wouldn t be said by me She never would She s always been that wilful that I d sooner have her away from me than with me Though she s a good young woman in the house she is indeed mister Eames and there isn t a pair of hands in it that works so hard but it was no use my talking I don t think any harm has been done Yes there has great harm It has made the place not respectable It s the Lupexes is the worst There s Miss Spruce who has been with me for nine years ever since I ve had the house she s been telling me this morning that she means to go into the country It s all the same thing I understand it I can see it The house isn t respectable as it should be and your mamma if she were to know all would have a right to be angry with me I did mean to be respectable mister Eames I did indeed Miss Spruce will think better of it You don t know what I ve had to go through There s none of them pays not regular only she and you She s been like the Bank of England has Miss Spruce I m afraid I ve not been very regular missus Roper Oh yes you have I don t think of a pound or two more or less at the end of a quarter if I m sure to have it some day The butcher he understands one s lodgers just as well as I do if the money s really coming he ll wait but he won t wait for such as them Lupexes whose money s nowhere And there s Cradell would you believe it that fellow owes me eight and twenty pounds Eight and twenty pounds Yes mister Eames eight and twenty pounds He s a fool It s them Lupexes as have had his money I know it He don t talk of paying and going away I shall be just left with him and the Lupexes on my hands and then the bailiffs may come and sell every stick about the place I won t say nay to them Then she threw herself into the old horsehair arm chair and gave way to her womanly sorrow I think I ll go upstairs and get ready for dinner said Eames And you must go away when you come back said missus Roper Well yes I m afraid I must I meant you to have a month s warning from to day Of course I shall pay for the month I don t want to take any advantage indeed I don t But I do hope you ll leave your things You can have them whenever you like If Chumpend knows that you and Miss Spruce are both going of course he ll be down upon me for his money Chumpend was the butcher But Eames made no answer to this piteous plea Whether or no he could allow his old boots to remain in Burton Crescent for the next week or two must depend on the manner in which he might be received by Amelia Roper this evening When he came down to the drawing room there was no one there but Miss Spruce A fine day Miss Spruce said he Yes mister Eames it is a fine day for London but don t you think the country air is very nice Give me the town said Johnny wishing to say a good word for poor missus Roper if it were possible You re a young man mister Eames but I m only an old woman That makes a difference said Miss Spruce Not much said Johnny meaning to be civil You don t like to be dull any more than I do I like to be respectable mister Eames I always have been respectable mister Eames This the old woman said almost in a whisper looking anxiously to see that the door had not been opened to other listening ears I m sure missus Roper is very respectable Yes missus Roper is respectable mister Eames but there are some here that Hush sh sh And the old lady put her finger up to her lips The door opened and missus Lupex swam into the room How d ye do Miss Spruce I declare you re always first It s to get a chance of having one of the young gentlemen to yourself I believe What s the news in the city to day mister Eames In your position now of course you hear all the news Sir Raffle Buffle has got a new pair of shoes I don t know that for certain but I guess it from the time it took him to put them on Ah now you re quizzing That s always the way with you gentlemen when you get a little up in the world You don t think women are worth talking to then unless just for a joke or so I d a great deal sooner talk to you missus Lupex than I would to Sir Raffle Buffle It s all very well for you to say that But we women know what such compliments as those mean don t we Miss Spruce A woman that s been married five years as I have or I may say six doesn t expect much attention from young men And though I was young when I married young in years that is I d seen too much and gone through too much to be young in heart This she said almost in a whisper but Miss Spruce heard it and was confirmed in her belief that Burton Crescent was no longer respectable I don t know what you were then missus Lupex said Eames but you re young enough now for anything mister Eames I d sell all that remains of my youth at a cheap rate at a very cheap rate if I could only be sure of Sure of what missus Lupex The undivided affection of the one person that I loved That is all that is necessary to a woman s happiness And isn t Lupex Lupex But hush never mind I should not have allowed myself to be betrayed into an expression of feeling Here s your friend mister Cradell Do you know I sometimes wonder what you find in that man to be so fond of him Miss Spruce saw it all and heard it all and positively resolved upon moving herself to those two small rooms at Dulwich Hardly a word was exchanged between Amelia and Eames before dinner Amelia still devoted herself to Cradell and Johnny saw that that arrow if it should be needed would be a strong weapon missus Roper they found seated at her place at the dining table and Eames could perceive the traces of her tears Poor woman Few positions in life could be harder to bear than hers To be ever tugging at others for money that they could not pay to be ever tugged at for money which she could not pay to desire respectability for its own sake but to be driven to confess that it was a luxury beyond her means to put up with disreputable belongings for the sake of lucre and then not to get the lucre but be driven to feel that she was ruined by the attempt How many missus Ropers there are who from year to year sink down and fall away and no one knows whither they betake themselves One fancies that one sees them from time to time at the corners of the streets in battered bonnets and thin gowns with the tattered remnants of old shawls upon their shoulders still looking as though they had within them a faint remembrance of long distant respectability With anxious eyes they peer about as though searching in the streets for other lodgers Where do they get their daily morsels of bread and their poor cups of thin tea their cups of thin tea with perhaps a pennyworth of gin added to it if Providence be good Of this state of things missus Roper had a lively appreciation and now poor woman she feared that she was reaching it by the aid of the Lupexes On the present occasion she carved her joint of meat in silence and sent out her slices to the good guests that would leave her and to the bad guests that would remain with apathetic impartiality What was the use now of doing favour to one lodger or disfavour to another Let them take their mutton they who would pay for it and they who would not She would not have the carving of many more joints in that house if Chumpend acted up to all the threats which he had uttered to her that morning The reader may perhaps remember the little back room behind the dining parlour A description was given in some former pages of an interview which was held between Amelia and her lover It was in that room that all the interviews of missus Roper s establishment had their existence A special room for interviews is necessary in all households of a mixed nature If a man lives alone with his wife he can have his interviews where he pleases Sons and daughters even when they are grown up hardly create the necessity of an interview chamber though some such need may be felt if the daughters are marriageable and independent in their natures But when the family becomes more complicated than this if an extra young man be introduced or an aunt comes into residence or grown up children by a former wife interfere with the domestic simplicity then such accommodation becomes quite indispensable No woman would think of taking in lodgers without such a room and this room there was at missus Roper s very small and dingy but still sufficient just behind the dining parlour and opposite to the kitchen stairs Hither after dinner Amelia was summoned She had just seated herself between missus Lupex and Miss Spruce ready to do battle with the former because she would stay and with the latter because she would go when she was called out by the servant girl Miss Mealyer Miss Mealyer sh sh sh And Amelia looking round saw a large red hand beckoning to her He s down there said Jemima as soon as her young mistress had joined her and wants to see you most partic lar Which of em asked Amelia in a whisper Why mister Heames to be sure Don t you go and have anythink to say to the other one Miss Mealyer pray don t he ain t no good he ain t indeed Amelia stood still for a moment on the landing calculating whether it would be well for her to have the interview or well to decline it Her objects were two or rather her object was in its nature twofold She was naturally anxious to drive John Eames to desperation and anxious also by some slight added artifice to make sure of Cradell if Eames s desperation did not have a very speedy effect She agreed with Jemima s criticism in the main but she did not go quite so far as to think that Cradell was no good at all Let it be Eames if Eames were possible but let the other string be kept for use if Eames were not possible Poor girl in coming to this resolve she had not done so without agony She had a heart and with such power as it gave her she loved John Eames But the world had been hard to her knocking her about hither and thither unmercifully threatening as it now threatened to take from her what few good things she enjoyed When a girl is so circumstanced she cannot afford to attend to her heart She almost resolved not to see Eames on the present occasion thinking that he might be made the more desperate by such refusal and remembering also that Cradell was in the house and would know of it He s there a waiting Miss Mealyer Why don t yer come down and Jemima plucked her young mistress by the arm I am coming said Amelia And with dignified steps she descended to the interview Here she is mister Heames said the girl And then Johnny found himself alone with his lady love You have sent for me mister Eames she said giving her head a little toss and turning her face away from him I was engaged upstairs but I thought it uncivil not to come down to you as you sent for me so special Yes Miss Roper I did want to see you very particularly Oh dear she exclaimed and he understood fully that the exclamation referred to his having omitted the customary use of her Christian name I saw your mother before dinner and I told her that I am going away the day after to morrow We all know about that to the earl s of course And then there was another chuck of her head And I told her also that I had made up my mind not to come back to Burton Crescent What leave the house altogether Well yes A fellow must make a change sometimes you know And where are you going John That I don t know as yet Tell me the truth John are you going to be married Are you going to marry that young woman mister Crosbie s leavings I demand to have an answer at once Are you going to marry her He had determined very resolutely that nothing she might say should make him angry but when she thus questioned him about Crosbie s leavings he found it very difficult to keep his temper I have not come said he to speak to you about any one but ourselves That put off won t do with me sir You are not to treat any girl you may please in that sort of way oh John Then she looked at him as though she did not know whether to fly at him and cover him with kisses or to fly at him and tear his hair I know I haven t behaved quite as I should have done he began Oh John and she shook her head You mean then to tell me that you are going to marry her I mean to say nothing of the kind I only mean to say that I am going away from Burton Crescent John Eames I wonder what you think will come to you Will you answer me this have I had a promise from you a distinct promise over and over again or have I not I don t know about a distinct promise Well well I did think that you was a gentleman that would not go back from your word I did think that I did think that you would never put a young lady to the necessity of bringing forward her own letters to prove that she is not expecting more than she has a right You don t know And that after all that has been between us John Eames And again it seemed to him as though she were about to fly I tell you that I know I haven t behaved well What more can I say What more can you say Oh John to ask me such a question If you were a man you would know very well what more to say But all you private secretaries are given to deceit as the sparks fly upwards However I despise you I do indeed I despise you If you despise me we might as well shake hands and part at once I daresay that will be best One doesn t like to be despised of course but sometimes one can t help it And then he put out his hand to her And is this to be the end of all she said taking it Well yes I suppose so You say I m despised You shouldn t take up a poor girl in that way for a sharp word not when she is suffering as I am made to suffer If you only think of it think what I have been expecting And now Amelia began to cry and to look as though she were going to fall into his arms It is better to tell the truth he said isn t it But it shouldn t be the truth But it is the truth I couldn t do it I should ruin myself and you too and we should never be happy I should be happy very happy indeed At this moment the poor girl s tears were unaffected and her words were not artful For a minute or two her heart her actual heart was allowed to prevail It cannot be Amelia Will you not say good by Good by she said leaning against him as she spoke I do so hope you will be happy he said And then putting his arm round her waist he kissed her which he certainly ought not to have done When the interview was over he escaped out into the crescent and as he walked down through the squares Woburn Square and Russell Square and Bedford Square towards the heart of London he felt himself elated almost to a state of triumph He had got himself well out of his difficulties and now he would be ready for his love tale to Lily CHAPTER LII THE FIRST VISIT TO THE GUESTWICK BRIDGE ILLUSTRATION untitled When John Eames arrived at Guestwick Manor he was first welcomed by Lady Julia My dear mister Eames she said I cannot tell you how glad we are to see you After that she always called him John and treated him throughout his visit with wonderful kindness No doubt that affair of the bull had in some measure produced this feeling no doubt also she was well disposed to the man who she hoped might be accepted as a lover by Lily Dale But I am inclined to think that the fact of his having beaten Crosbie had been the most potential cause of this affection for our hero on the part of Lady Julia Ladies especially discreet old ladies such as Lady Julia De Guest are bound to entertain pacific theories and to condemn all manner of violence Lady Julia would have blamed any one who might have advised Eames to commit an assault upon Crosbie But nevertheless deeds of prowess are still dear to the female heart and a woman be she ever so old and discreet understands and appreciates the summary justice which may be done by means of a thrashing Lady Julia had she been called upon to talk of it would undoubtedly have told Eames that he had committed a fault in striking mister Crosbie but the deed had been done and Lady Julia became very fond of John Eames Vickers shall show you your room if you like to go upstairs but you ll find my brother close about the house if you choose to go out I saw him not half an hour since But John seemed to be well satisfied to sit in the arm chair over the fire and talk to his hostess so neither of them moved And now that you re a private secretary how do you like it I like the work well enough only I don t like the man Lady Julia But I shouldn t say so because he is such an intimate friend of your brother s An intimate friend of Theodore s Sir Raffle Buffle Lady Julia stiffened her back and put on a serious face not being exactly pleased at being told that the Earl De Guest had any such intimate friend At any rate he tells me so about four times a day Lady Julia And he particularly wants to come down here next September Did he tell you that too Indeed he did You can t believe what a goose he is Then his voice sounds like a cracked bell it s the most disagreeable voice you ever heard in your life And one has always to be on one s guard lest he should make one do something that is is that isn t quite the thing for a gentleman You understand what the messenger ought to do You shouldn t be too much afraid of your own dignity No I m not If Lord De Guest were to ask me to fetch him his shoes I d run to Guestwick and back for them and think nothing of it just because I know he s my friend He d have a right to send me But I m not going to do such things as that for Sir Raffle Buffle Fetch him his shoes That s what FitzHoward had to do and he didn t like it Isn t mister FitzHoward nephew to the Duchess of saint Bungay Nephew or cousin or something Dear me said Lady Julia what a horrible man And in this way John Eames and her ladyship became very intimate There was no one at dinner at the Manor that day but the earl and his sister and their single guest The earl when he came in was very warm in his welcome slapping his young friend on the back and poking jokes at him with a good humoured if not brilliant pleasantry Thrashed anybody lately John Nobody to speak of said Johnny Brought your nightcap down for your out o doors nap No but I ve got a grand stick for the bull said Johnny Ah that s no joke now I can tell you said the earl We had to sell him and it half broke my heart We don t know what had come to him but he became quite unruly after that knocked Darvell down in the straw yard It was a very bad business a very bad business indeed Come go and dress Do you remember how you came down to dinner that day I shall never forget how Crofts stared at you Come you ve only got twenty minutes and you London fellows always want an hour He s entitled to some consideration now he s a private secretary said Lady Julia Bless us all yes I forgot that Come mister Private Secretary don t stand on the grandeur of your neck tie to day as there s nobody here but ourselves You shall have an opportunity to morrow Then Johnny was handed over to the groom of the chambers and exactly in twenty minutes he re appeared in the drawing room As soon as Lady Julia had left them after dinner the earl began to explain his plan for the coming campaign I ll tell you now what I have arranged said he The squire is to be here to morrow with his eldest niece your Miss Lily s sister you know What Bell Yes with Bell if her name is Bell She s a very pretty girl too I don t know whether she s not the prettiest of the two after all That s a matter of opinion Just so Johnny and do you stick to your own They re coming here for three or four days Lady Julia did ask missus Dale and Lily I wonder whether you ll let me call her Lily Oh dear I wish I might have the power of letting you That s just the battle that you ve got to fight But the mother and the younger sister wouldn t come Lady Julia says it s all right that as a matter of course she wouldn t come when she heard you were to be here I don t quite understand it In my days the young girls were ready enough to go where they knew they d meet their lovers and I never thought any the worse of them for it It wasn t because of that said Eames That s what Lady Julia says and I always find her to be right in things of that sort And she says you ll have a better chance in going over there than you would here if she were in the same house with you If I was going to make love to a girl of course I d sooner have her close to me staying in the same house I should think it the best fun in the world And we might have had a dance and all that kind of thing But I couldn t make her come you know Oh no of course not And Lady Julia thinks that it s best as it is You must go over you know and get the mother on your side if you can I take it the truth is this you mustn t be angry with me you know for saying it You may be sure of that I suppose she was fond of that fellow Crosbie She can t be very fond of him now I should think after the way he has treated her but she ll find a difficulty in making her confession that she really likes you better than she ever liked him Of course that s what you ll want her to say I want her to say that she ll be my wife some day And when she has agreed to the some day then you ll begin to press her to agree to your day eh sir My belief is you ll bring her round Poor girl why should she break her heart when a decent fellow like you will only be too glad to make her a happy woman And in this way the earl talked to Eames till the latter almost believed that the difficulties were vanishing from out of his path Could it be possible he asked himself as he went to bed that in a fortnight s time Lily Dale should have accepted him as her future husband Then he remembered that day on which Crosbie with the two girls had called at his mother s house when in the bitterness of his heart he had sworn to himself that he would always regard Crosbie as his enemy Since then the world had gone well with him and he had no longer any very bitter feeling against Crosbie That matter had been arranged on the platform of the Paddington Station He felt that if Lily would now accept him he could almost shake hands with Crosbie The episode in his life and in Lily s would have been painful but he would learn to look back upon that without regret if Lily could be taught to believe that a kind fate had at last given her to the better of her two lovers I m afraid she won t bring herself to forget him he had said to the earl She ll only be too happy to forget him the earl had answered if you can induce her to begin the attempt Of course it is very bitter at first all the world knew about it but poor girl she is not to be wretched for ever because of that Do you go about your work with some little confidence and I doubt not but what you ll have your way You have everybody in your favour the squire her mother and all While such words as these were in his ears how could he fail to hope and to be confident While he was sitting cozily over his bedroom fire he resolved that it should be as the earl had said But when he got up on the following morning and stood shivering as he came out of his bath he could not feel the same confidence Of course I shall go to her he said to himself and make a plain story of it But I know what her answer will be She will tell me that she cannot forget him Then his feelings towards Crosbie were not so friendly as they had been on the previous evening He did not visit the Small House on that his first day It had been thought better that he should first meet the squire and Bell at Guestwick Manor so he postponed his visit to missus Dale till the next morning Go when you like said the earl There s the brown cob for you to do what you like with him while you are here I ll go and see my mother said John but I won t take the cob to day If you ll let me have him to morrow I ll ride to Allington So he walked off to Guestwick by himself He knew well every yard of the ground over which he went remembering every gate and stile and greensward from the time of his early boyhood And now as he went along through his old haunts he could not but look back and think of the thoughts which had filled his mind in his earlier wanderings As I have said before in some of these pages no walks taken by the man are so crowded with thought as those taken by the boy He had been early taught to understand that the world to him would be very hard that he had nothing to look to but his own exertions and that those exertions would not unfortunately be backed by any great cleverness of his own I do not know that anybody had told him that he was a fool but he had come to understand partly through his own modesty and partly no doubt through the somewhat obtrusive diffidence of his mother that he was less sharp than other lads It is probably true that he had come to his sharpness later in life than is the case with many young men He had not grown on the sunny side of the wall Before that situation in the Income tax Office had fallen in his way very humble modes of life had offered themselves or rather had not offered themselves for his acceptance He had endeavoured to become an usher at a commercial seminary not supposed to be in a very thriving condition but he had been luckily found deficient in his arithmetic There had been some chance of his going into the leather warehouse of Messrs Basil and Pigskin but those gentlemen had required a premium and any payment of that kind had been quite out of his mother s power A country attorney who had known the family for years had been humbly solicited the widow almost kneeling before him with tears to take Johnny by the hand and make a clerk of him but the attorney had discovered that Master Johnny Eames was not supposed to be sharp and would have none of him During those days those gawky gainless un admired days in which he had wandered about the lanes of Guestwick as his only amusement and had composed hundreds of rhymes in honour of Lily Dale which no human eye but his own had ever seen he had come to regard himself as almost a burden upon the earth Nobody seemed to want him His own mother was very anxious but her anxiety seemed to him to indicate a continual desire to get rid of him For hours upon hours he would fill his mind with castles in the air dreaming of wonderful successes in the midst of which Lily Dale always reigned as a queen He would carry on the same story in his imagination from month to month almost contenting himself with such ideal happiness Had it not been for the possession of that power what comfort could there have been to him in his life There are lads of seventeen who can find happiness in study who can busy themselves in books and be at their ease among the creations of other minds These are they who afterwards become well informed men It was not so with John Eames He had never been studious The perusal of a novel was to him in those days a slow affair and of poetry he read but little storing up accurately in his memory all that he did read But he created for himself his own romance though to the eye a most unromantic youth and he wandered through the Guestwick woods with many thoughts of which they who knew him best knew nothing All this he thought of now as with devious steps he made his way towards his old home with very devious steps for he went backwards through the woods by a narrow path which led right away from the town down to a little water course over which stood a wooden foot bridge with a rail He stood on the centre of the plank at a spot which he knew well and rubbing his hand upon the rail cleansed it for the space of a few inches of the vegetable growth produced by the spray of the water There rudely carved in the wood was still the word LILY When he cut those letters she had been almost a child I wonder whether she will come here with me and let me show it to her he said to himself Then he took out his knife and cleared the cuttings of the letters and having done so leaned upon the rail and looked down upon the running water How well things in the world had gone for him How well And yet what would it all be if Lily would not come to him How well the world had gone for him In those days when he stood there carving the girl s name everybody had seemed to regard him as a heavy burden and he had so regarded himself Now he was envied by many respected by many taken by the hand as a friend by those high in the world s esteem When he had come near the Guestwick Mansion in his old walks always however keeping at a great distance lest the grumpy old lord should be down upon him and scold him he had little dreamed that he and the grumpy old lord would ever be together on such familiar terms that he would tell to that lord more of his private thoughts than to any other living being yet it had come to that The grumpy old lord had now told him that that gift of money was to be his whether Lily Dale accepted him or no Indeed the thing s done said the grumpy lord pulling out from his pocket certain papers and you ve got to receive the dividends as they become due Then when Johnny had expostulated as indeed the circumstances had left him no alternative but to expostulate the earl had roughly bade him hold his tongue telling him that he would have to fetch Sir Raffle s boots directly he got back to London So the conversation had quickly turned itself away to Sir Raffle whom they had both ridiculed with much satisfaction If he finds his way down here in September Master Johnny or in any other month either you may fit my head with a foolscap Not remember indeed Is it not wonderful that any man should make himself so mean a fool All this was thought over again as Eames leaned upon the bridge He remembered every word and remembered many other words earlier words spoken years ago filling him with desolation as to the prospects of his life It had seemed that his friends had united in prophesying that the outlook into the world for him was hopeless and that the earning of bread must be for ever beyond his power And now his lines had fallen to him in very pleasant places and he was among those whom the world had determined to caress And yet what would it all be if Lily would not share his happiness When he had carved that name on the rail his love for Lily had been an idea It had now become a reality which might probably be full of pain If it were so if such should be the result of his wooing would not those old dreamy days have been better than these the days of his success It was one o clock by the time that he reached his mother s house and he found her and his sister in a troubled and embarrassed state Of course you know John said his mother as soon as their first embraces were over that we are going to dine at the Manor this evening But he did not know it neither the earl nor Lady Julia having said anything on the subject Of course we are going said missus Eames and it was so very kind But I ve never been out to such a house for so many years John and I do feel in such a twitter I dined there once soon after we were married but I never have been there since that It s not the earl I mind but Lady Julia said Mary Eames She s the most good natured woman in the world said Johnny Oh dear people say she is so cross That s because people don t know her If I was asked who is the kindest hearted woman I know in the world I think I should say Lady Julia De Guest I think I should Ah but then they re so fond of you said the admiring mother You saved his lordship s life under Providence That s all bosh mother You ask doctor Crofts He knows them as well as I do doctor Crofts is going to marry Bell Dale said Mary and then the conversation was turned from the subject of Lady Julia s perfections and the awe inspired by the earl Crofts going to marry Bell exclaimed Eames thinking almost with dismay of the doctor s luck in thus getting himself accepted all at once while he had been suing with the constancy almost of a Jacob Yes said Mary and they say that she has refused her cousin Bernard and that therefore the squire is taking away the house from them You know they re all coming into Guestwick Yes I know they are But I don t believe that the squire is taking away the house Why should they come then Why should they give up such a charming place as that Rent free said missus Eames I don t know why they should come away but I can t believe the squire is turning them out at any rate not for that reason The squire was prepared to advocate John s suit and therefore John was bound to do battle on the squire s behalf He is a very stern man said missus Eames and they say that since that affair of poor Lily s he has been more cross than ever with them As far as I know it was not Lily s fault Poor Lily said Mary I do pity her If I was her I should hardly know how to show my face I shouldn t indeed And why shouldn t she show her face said John in an angry tone What has she done to be ashamed of Show her face indeed I cannot understand the spite which one woman will sometimes have to another There is no spite John and it s very wrong of you to say so said Mary defending herself But it is a very unpleasant thing for a girl to be jilted All the world knows that she was engaged to him And all the world knows But he would not proceed to declare that all the world knew also that Crosbie had been well thrashed for his baseness It would not become him to mention that even before his mother and sister All the world did know it all the world that cared to know anything of the matter except Lily Dale herself Nobody had ever yet told Lily Dale of that occurrence at the Paddington Railway Station and it was well for John that her friends and his had been so discreet Oh of course you are her champion said Mary And I didn t mean to say anything unkind Indeed I didn t Of course it was a misfortune I think it was the best piece of good fortune that could have happened to her not to marry a d scoundrel like Oh John exclaimed missus Eames I beg your pardon mother But it isn t swearing to call such a man as that a d scoundrel And he particularly emphasized the naughty word thinking that thereby he would add to its import and take away from its naughtiness But we won t talk any more about him I hate the man s very name I hated him the first moment that I saw him and knew that he was a blackguard from his look And I don t believe a word about the squire having been cross to them Indeed I know he has been the reverse of cross So Bell is going to marry doctor Crofts There is no doubt on earth about that said Mary And they say that Bernard Dale is going abroad with his regiment Then John discussed with his mother his duties as private secretary and his intention of leaving missus Roper s house I suppose it isn t nice enough for you now John said his mother It never was very nice mother to tell you the truth There were people there But you mustn t think I am turning up my nose because I m getting grand I don t want to live any better than we all lived at missus Roper s but she took in persons that were not agreeable There is a mister and missus Lupex there Then he described something of their life in Burton Crescent but did not say much about Amelia Roper Amelia Roper had not made her appearance in Guestwick as he had once feared that she would do and therefore it did not need that he should at present make known to his mother that episode in his life When he got back to the Manor House he found that mister Dale and his niece had arrived They were both sitting with Lady Julia when he went into the morning room and Lord De Guest was standing over the fire talking to them Eames as he came among them felt terribly conscious of his position as though all there were aware that he had been brought down from London on purpose to make a declaration of love as indeed all of them were aware of that fact Bell though no one had told her so in direct words was as sure of it as the others Here comes the prince of matadores said the earl No my lord you re the prince I m only your first follower Though he could contrive that his words should be gay his looks were sheepish and when he gave his hand to the squire it was only by a struggle that he could bring himself to look straight into the old man s face I m very glad to see you John said the squire very glad indeed And so am I said Bell I have been so happy to hear that you have been promoted at your office and so is mamma I hope missus Dale is quite well said he and Lily The word had been pronounced but it had been done with so manifest an effort that all in the room were conscious of it and paused as Bell prepared her little answer My sister has been very ill you know with scarlatina But she has recovered with wonderful quickness and is nearly well again now She will be so glad to see you if you will go over Yes I shall certainly go over said John And now shall I show you your room Miss Dale said Lady Julia And so the party was broken up and the ice had been broken CHAPTER LIII LOQUITUR HOPKINS The squire had been told that his niece Bell had accepted doctor Crofts and he had signified a sort of acquiescence in the arrangement saying that if it were to be so he had nothing to say against doctor Crofts He spoke this in a melancholy tone of voice wearing on his face that look of subdued sorrow which was now almost habitual to him It was to missus Dale that he spoke on the subject I could have wished that it might have been otherwise he said as you are well aware I had family reasons for wishing that it might be otherwise But I have nothing to say against it doctor Crofts as her husband shall be welcome to my house missus Dale who had expected much worse than this began to thank him for his kindness and to say that she also would have preferred to see her daughter married to her cousin But in such a matter the decision should be left entirely to the girl Don t you think so I have not a word to say against her he repeated Then missus Dale left him and told her daughter that her uncle s manner of receiving the news had been for him very gracious You were his favourite but Lily will be so now said missus Dale I don t care a bit about that or rather I do care and think it will be in every way better But as I who am the naughty one will go away and as Lily who is the good one will remain with you doesn t it almost seem a pity that you should be leaving the house missus Dale thought it was almost a pity but she could not say so now You think Lily will remain she said Yes mamma I feel sure she will She was always very fond of John Eames and he is doing so well It will be of no use mamma She is fond of him very fond In a sort of a way she loves him so well that I feel sure she never mentions his name without some inward reference to her old childish thoughts and fancies If he had come before mister Crosbie it would have all been well with her But she cannot do it now Her pride would prevent her even if her heart permitted it Oh dear it s very wrong of me to say so after all that I have said before but I almost wish you were not going Uncle Christopher seems to be less hard than he used to be and as I was the sinner and as I am disposed of It is too late now my dear And we should neither of us have the courage to mention it to Lily said Bell On the following morning the squire sent for his sister in law as it was his wont to do when necessity came for any discussion on matters of business This was perfectly understood between them and such sending was not taken as indicating any lack of courtesy on the part of mister Dale Mary he said as soon as missus Dale was seated I shall do for Bell exactly what I have proposed to do for Lily I had intended more than that once of course But then it would all have gone into Bernard s pocket as it is I shall make no difference between them They shall each have a hundred a year that is when they marry You had better tell Crofts to speak to me mister Dale he doesn t expect it He does not expect a penny So much the better for him and indeed so much the better for her He won t make her the less welcome to his home because she brings some assistance to it We have never thought of it any of us The offer has come so suddenly that I don t know what I ought to say Say nothing If you choose to make me a return for it but I am only doing what I conceive to be my duty and have no right to ask for a kindness in return But what kindness can we show you mister Dale Remain in that house In saying these last words he spoke as though he were again angry as though he were again laying down the law to them as though he were telling her of a duty which was due to him and incumbent on her His voice was as stern and his face as acid as ever He said that he was asking for a kindness but surely no man ever asked for kindness in a voice so peremptory Remain in that house Then he turned himself in towards his table as though he had no more to say But missus Dale was beginning now at last to understand something of his mind and real character He could be affectionate and forbearing in his giving but when asking he could not be otherwise than stern Indeed he could not ask he could only demand We have done so much now missus Dale began to plead Well well well I did not mean to speak about that Things are unpacked easier than they are packed But however Never mind Bell is to go with me this afternoon to Guestwick Manor Let her be up here at two Grimes can bring her box round I suppose Oh yes of course And don t be talking to her about money before she starts I had rather you didn t you understand But when you see Crofts tell him to come to me Indeed he d better come at once if this thing is to go on quickly It may easily be understood that missus Dale would disobey the injunctions contained in the squire s last words It was quite out of the question that she should return to her daughters and not tell them the result of her morning s interview with their uncle A hundred a year in the doctor s modest household would make all the difference between plenty and want between modest plenty and endurable want Of course she told them giving Bell to understand that she must dissemble so far as to pretend ignorance of the affair I shall thank him at once said Bell and tell him that I did not at all expect it but am not too proud to accept it Pray don t my dear not just now I am breaking a sort of promise in telling you at all only I could not keep it to myself And he has so many things to worry him Though he says nothing about it now he has half broken his heart about you and Bernard Then too missus Dale told the girls what request the squire had just made and the manner in which he had made it The tone of his voice as he spoke brought tears into my eyes I almost wish we had not done anything But mamma said Lily what difference can it make to him You know that our presence near him was always a trouble to him He never really wanted us He liked to have Bell there when he thought that Bell would marry his pet Don t be unkind Lily I don t mean to be unkind Why shouldn t Bernard be his pet I love Bernard dearly and always thought it the best point in uncle Christopher that he was so fond of him I knew you know that it was no use Of course I knew it as I understood all about somebody else But Bernard is his pet He s fond of you all in his own way said missus Dale But is he fond of you that s the question said Lily We could have forgiven him anything done to us and have put up with any words he might have spoken to us because he regards us as children His giving a hundred a year to Bell won t make you comfortable in this house if he still domineers over you If a neighbour be neighbourly near neighbourhood is very nice But uncle Christopher has not been neighbourly He has wanted to be more than an uncle to us on condition that he might be less than a brother to you Bell and I have always felt that his regard on such terms was not worth having I almost feel that we have been wrong said missus Dale but in truth I never thought that the matter would be to him one of so much moment When Bell had gone missus Dale and Lily were not disposed to continue with much energy the occupation on which they had all been employed for some days past There had been life and excitement in the work when they had first commenced their packing but now it was grown wearisome dull and distasteful Indeed so much of it was done that but little was left to employ them except those final strappings and fastenings and that last collection of odds and ends which could not be accomplished till they were absolutely on the point of starting The squire had said that unpacking would be easier than packing and missus Dale as she wandered about among the hampers and cases began to consider whether the task of restoring all the things to their old places would be very disagreeable She said nothing of this to Lily and Lily herself whatever might be her thoughts made no such suggestion to her mother I think Hopkins will miss us more than any one else she said Hopkins will have no one to scold Just at that moment Hopkins appeared at the parlour window and signified his desire for a conference You must come round said Lily It s too cold for the window to be opened I always like to get him into the house because he feels himself a little abashed by the chairs and tables or perhaps it is the carpet that is too much for him Out on the gravel walks he is such a terrible tyrant and in the greenhouse he almost tramples upon one Hopkins when he did appear at the parlour door seemed by his manner to justify Lily s discretion He was not at all masterful in his tone or bearing and seemed to pay to the chairs and tables all the deference which they could have expected So you be going in earnest ma am he said looking down at missus Dale s feet As missus Dale did not answer him at once Lily spoke Yes Hopkins we are going in a very few days now We shall see you sometimes I hope over at Guestwick Humph said Hopkins So you be really going I didn t think it d ever come to that miss I didn t indeed and no more it oughtn t but of course it isn t for me to speak People must change their residence sometimes you know said missus Dale using the same argument by which Eames had endeavoured to excuse his departure to missus Roper Well ma am it ain t for me to say anything But this I will say I ve lived here about t squire s place man and boy jist all my life seeing I was born here as you knows missus Dale and of all the bad things I ever see come about the place this is a sight the worst Oh Hopkins The worst of all ma am the worst of all It ll just kill t squire There s ne ery doubt in the world about that It ll be the very death of t old man That s nonsense Hopkins said Lily Very well miss I don t say but what it is nonsense only you ll see There s mister Bernard he s gone away and by all accounts he never did care very much for the place They all say he s a going to the Hingies And Miss Bell is going to be married which is all proper in course why shouldn t she And why shouldn t you too Miss Lily Perhaps I shall some day Hopkins There s no day like the present Miss Lily And I do say this that the man as pitched into him would be the man for my money This which Hopkins spoke in the excitement of the moment was perfectly unintelligible to Lily and missus Dale who shuddered as she heard him said not a word to call for any explanation But continued Hopkins that s all as it may be Miss Lily and you be in the hands of Providence as is others Exactly so Hopkins But why should your mamma be all for going away She ain t going to marry no one Here s the house and there s she and there s t squire and why should she be for going away So much going away all at once can t be for any good It s just a breaking up of everything as though nothing wasn t good enough for nobody I never went away and I can t abide it Well Hopkins it s settled now said missus Dale and I m afraid it can t be unsettled Settled well Tell me this do you expect missus Dale that he s to live there all alone by hisself without any one to say a cross word to unless it be me or Dingles for Jolliffe s worse than nobody he s so mortial cross hisself Of course he can t stand it If you goes away missus Dale Mister Bernard he ll be squire in less than twelve months He ll come back from the Hingies then I suppose I don t think my brother in law will take it in that way Hopkins Ah ma am you don t know him not as I knows him all the ins and outs and crinks and crannies of him I knows him as I does the old apple trees that I ve been a handling for forty year There s a deal of bad wood about them old cankered trees and some folk say they ain t worth the ground they stand on but I know where the sap runs and when the fruit blossom shows itself I know where the fruit will be the sweetest It don t take much to kill one of them old trees but there s life in m yet if they be well handled I m sure I hope my brother s life may be long spared to him said missus Dale Then don t be taking yourself away ma am into them gashly lodgings at Guestwick I says they are gashly for the likes of a Dale It is not for me to speak ma am of course And I only came up now just to know what things you d like with you out of the greenhouse Oh nothing Hopkins thank you said missus Dale He told me to put up for you the best I could pick and I means to do it and Hopkins as he spoke indicated by a motion of his head that he was making reference to the squire We shan t have any place for them said Lily I must send a few miss just to cheer you up a bit I fear you ll be very dolesome there And the doctor he ain t got what you can call a regular garden but there is a bit of a place behind But we wouldn t rob the dear old place said Lily For the matter of that what does it signify T squire ll be that wretched he ll turn sheep in here to destroy the place or he ll have the garden ploughed You see if he don t As for the place the place is clean done for if you leave it You don t suppose he ll go and let the Small House to strangers T squire ain t one of that sort any ways Ah me exclaimed missus Dale as soon as Hopkins had taken himself off What is it mamma He s a dear old man but surely what he says cannot make you really unhappy It is so hard to know what one ought to do I did not mean to be selfish but it seems to me as though I were doing the most selfish thing in the world Nay mamma it has been anything but selfish Besides it is we that have done it not you Do you know Lily that I also have that feeling as to breaking up one s old mode of life of which Hopkins spoke I thought that I should be glad to escape from this place but now that the time has come I dread it Do you mean that you repent missus Dale did not answer her daughter at once fearing to commit herself by words which could not be retracted But at last she said Yes Lily I think I do repent I think that it has not been well done Then let it be undone said Lily The dinner party at Guestwick Manor on that day was not very bright and yet the earl had done all in his power to make his guests happy But gaiety did not come naturally to his house which as will have been seen was an abode very unlike in its nature to that of the other earl at Courcy Castle Lady De Courcy at any rate understood how to receive and entertain a house full of people though the practice of doing so might give rise to difficult questions in the privacy of her domestic relations Lady Julia did not understand it but then Lady Julia was never called upon to answer for the expense of extra servants nor was she asked about twice a week who the was to pay the wine merchant s bill As regards Lord De Guest and the Lady Julia themselves I think they had the best of it but I am bound to admit with reference to chance guests that the house was dull The people who were now gathered at the earl s table could hardly have been expected to be very sprightly when in company with each other The squire was not a man much given to general society and was unused to amuse a table full of people On the present occasion he sat next to Lady Julia and from time to time muttered a few words to her about the state of the country missus Eames was terribly afraid of everybody there and especially of the earl next to whom she sat and whom she continually called my lord showing by her voice as she did so that she was almost alarmed by the sound of her own voice mister and missus Boyce were there the parson sitting on the other side of Lady Julia and the parson s wife on the other side of the earl missus Boyce was very studious to show that she was quite at home and talked perhaps more than any one else but in doing so she bored the earl most exquisitely so that he told John Eames the next morning that she was worse than the bull The parson ate his dinner but said little or nothing between the two graces He was a heavy sensible slow man who knew himself and his own powers Uncommon good stewed beef he said as he went home why can t we have our beef stewed like that Because we don t pay our cook sixty pounds a year said missus Boyce A woman with sixteen pounds can stew beef as well as a woman with sixty said he she only wants looking after The earl himself was possessed of a sort of gaiety There was about him a lightness of spirit which often made him an agreeable companion to one single person John Eames conceived him to be the most sprightly old man of his day an old man with the fun and frolic almost of a boy But this spirit though it would show itself before John Eames was not up to the entertainment of John Eames s mother and sister together with the squire the parson and the parson s wife of Allington So that the earl was overweighted and did not shine on this occasion at his own dinner table doctor Crofts who had also been invited and who had secured the place which was now peculiarly his own next to Bell Dale was no doubt happy enough as let us hope was the young lady also but they added very little to the general hilarity of the company John Eames was seated between his own sister and the parson and did not at all enjoy his position He had a full view of the doctor s felicity as the happy pair sat opposite to him and conceived himself to be hardly treated by Lily s absence The party was certainly very dull as were all such dinners at Guestwick Manor There are houses which in their every day course are not conducted by any means in a sad or unsatisfactory manner in which life as a rule runs along merrily enough but which cannot give a dinner party or I might rather say should never allow themselves to be allured into the attempt The owners of such houses are generally themselves quite aware of the fact and dread the dinner which they resolved to give quite as much as it is dreaded by their friends They know that they prepare for their guests an evening of misery and for themselves certain long hours of purgatory which are hardly to be endured But they will do it Why that long table and all those supernumerary glasses and knives and forks if they are never to be used That argument produces all this misery that and others cognate to it On the present occasion no doubt there were excuses to be made The squire and his niece had been invited on special cause and their presence would have been well enough The doctor added in would have done no harm It was good natured too that invitation given to missus Eames and her daughter The error lay in the parson and his wife There was no necessity for their being there nor had they any ground on which to stand except the party giving ground mister and missus Boyce made the dinner party and destroyed the social circle Lady Julia knew that she had been wrong as soon as she had sent out the note Nothing was said on that evening which has any bearing on our story Nothing indeed was said which had any bearing on anything The earl s professed object had been to bring the squire and young Eames together but people are never brought together on such melancholy occasions Though they sip their port in close contiguity they are poles asunder in their minds and feelings When the Guestwick fly came for missus Eames and the parson s pony phaeton came for him and missus Boyce a great relief was felt but the misery of those who were left had gone too far to allow of any reaction on that evening The squire yawned and the earl yawned and then there was an end of it for that night CHAPTER LIV THE SECOND VISIT TO THE GUESTWICK BRIDGE Bell had declared that her sister would be very happy to see John Eames if he would go over to Allington and he had replied that of course he would go there 
5867_48852_000002_000001	train-clean-100	So much having been as it were settled he was able to speak of his visit as a matter of course at the breakfast table on the morning after the earl s dinner party I must get you to come round with me Dale and see what I am doing to the land the earl said 
5867_48852_000002_000002	train-clean-100	And then he proposed to order saddle horses 
5867_48852_000002_000003	train-clean-100	But the squire preferred walking and in this way they were disposed of soon after breakfast 
5867_48852_000003_000000	train-clean-100	John had it in his mind to get Bell to himself for half an hour and hold a conference with her but it either happened that Lady Julia was too keen in her duties as a hostess or else as was more possible Bell avoided the meeting 
5867_48852_000003_000001	train-clean-100	No opportunity for such an interview offered itself though he hung about the drawing room all the morning 
none	none	You had better wait for luncheon now Lady Julia said to him about twelve 
5867_48852_000003_000003	train-clean-100	But this he declined and taking himself away hid himself about the place for the next hour and a half 
5867_48852_000003_000004	train-clean-100	During this time he considered much whether it would be better for him to ride or walk 
5867_48852_000003_000005	train-clean-100	If she should give him any hope he could ride back triumphant as a field marshal 
5867_48852_000003_000006	train-clean-100	Then the horse would be delightful to him 
none	none	But if she should give him no hope if it should be his destiny to be rejected utterly on that morning then the horse would be terribly in the way of his sorrow Under such circumstances what could he do but roam wide about across the fields resting when he might choose to rest and running when it might suit him to run
5867_48852_000003_000009	train-clean-100	 And she is not like other girls he thought to himself 
5867_48852_000003_000010	train-clean-100	 She won t care for my boots being dirty So at last he elected to walk 
none	none	Stand up to her boldly man the earl had said to him By George what is there to be afraid of 
5867_48852_000004_000002	train-clean-100	It s my belief they ll give most to those who ask for most 
none	none	There s nothing sets em against a man like being sheepish How the earl knew so much seeing that he had not himself given signs of any success in that walk of life I am not prepared to say 
5867_48852_000004_000004	train-clean-100	But Eames took his advice as being in itself good and resolved to act upon it 
none	none	Not that any resolution will be of any use he said to himself as he walked along When the moment comes I know that I shall tremble before her and I know that she ll see it but I don t think it will make any difference in her 
5867_48852_000005_000000	train-clean-100	He had last seen her on the lawn behind the Small House just at that time when her passion for Crosbie was at the strongest 
5867_48852_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Eames had gone thither impelled by a foolish desire to declare to her his hopeless love and she had answered him by telling him that she loved mister Crosbie better than all the world besides 
5867_48852_000005_000002	train-clean-100	Of course she had done so at that time but nevertheless her manner of telling him had seemed to him to be cruel 
5867_48852_000005_000003	train-clean-100	And he also had been cruel 
5867_48852_000005_000004	train-clean-100	He had told her that he hated Crosbie calling him that man and assuring her that no earthly consideration should induce him to go into that man s house Then he had walked away moodily wishing him all manner of evil 
none	none	Was it not singular that all the evil things which he in his mind had meditated for the man had fallen upon him 
5867_48852_000005_000006	train-clean-100	Crosbie had lost his love 
5867_48852_000005_000007	train-clean-100	He had so proved himself to be a villain that his name might not be so much as mentioned 
5867_48852_000005_000008	train-clean-100	He had been ignominiously thrashed 
none	none	But what good would all this be if his image were still dear to Lily s heart I told her that I loved her then he said to himself though I had no right to do so 
5867_48852_000005_000011	train-clean-100	At any rate I have a right to tell her now 
5867_48852_000006_000000	train-clean-100	When he reached Allington he did not go in through the village and up to the front of the Small House by the cross street but turned by the church gate and passed over the squire s terrace and by the end of the Great House through the garden 
none	none	Here he encountered Hopkins Why if that b aint mister Eames said the gardener
5867_48852_000006_000002	train-clean-100	 mister John may I make so bold and Hopkins held out a very dirty hand which Eames of course took unconscious of the cause of this new affection 
none	none	I m just going to call at the Small House and I thought I d come this way To be sure this way or that way or any way who s so welcome mister John I envies you I envies you more than I envies any man If I could a got him by the scuff of the neck I d a treated him jist like any wermin I would indeed 
5867_48852_000008_000003	train-clean-100	He was wermin 
none	none	I ollays said it 
5867_48852_000008_000005	train-clean-100	I hated him ollays I did indeed mister John from the first moment when he used to be nigging away at them foutry balls knocking them in among the rhododendrons as though there weren t no flower blossoms for next year 
5867_48852_000008_000006	train-clean-100	He never looked at one as though one were a Christian did he mister John 
5867_48852_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 I wasn t very fond of him myself Hopkins 
none	none	Of course you weren t very fond of him Who was only she poor young lady She ll be better now mister John a deal better 
5867_48852_000010_000003	train-clean-100	He wasn t a wholesome lover not like you are 
5867_48852_000010_000004	train-clean-100	Tell me mister John did you give it him well when you got him 
none	none	I heard you did two black eyes and all his face one mash of gore And Hopkins who was by no means a young man stiffly put himself into a fighting attitude 
5867_48852_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Eames passed on over the little bridge which seemed to be in a state of fast decay unattended to by any friendly carpenter now that the days of its use were so nearly at an end and on into the garden lingering on the spot where he had last said farewell to Lily 
5867_48852_000011_000001	train-clean-100	He looked about as though he expected still to find her there but there was no one to be seen in the garden and no sound to be heard 
5867_48852_000011_000002	train-clean-100	As every step brought him nearer to her whom he was seeking he became more and more conscious of the hopelessness of his errand 
none	none	Him she had never loved and why should he venture to hope that she would love him now 
5867_48852_000011_000004	train-clean-100	He would have turned back had he not been aware that his promise to others required that he should persevere 
5867_48852_000011_000005	train-clean-100	He had said that he would do this thing and he would be as good as his word 
5867_48852_000011_000006	train-clean-100	But he hardly ventured to hope that he might be successful 
none	none	In this frame of mind he slowly made his way up across the lawn
5867_48852_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 My dear there is John Eames said missus Dale who had first seen him from the parlour window 
5867_48852_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t go mamma 
5867_48852_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know perhaps it will be better that I should 
5867_48852_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 No mamma no what good can it do 
5867_48852_000015_000001	train-clean-100	It can do no good 
5867_48852_000015_000002	train-clean-100	I like him as well as I can like any one 
5867_48852_000015_000003	train-clean-100	I love him dearly 
5867_48852_000015_000004	train-clean-100	But it can do no good Let him come in here and be very kind to him but do not go away and leave us 
none	none	Of course I knew he would come and I shall be very glad to see him Then missus Dale went round to the other room and admitted her visitor through the window of the drawing room
5867_48852_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 We are in terrible confusion John are we not 
5867_48852_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 And so you are really going to live in Guestwick 
5867_48852_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Well it looks like it does it not 
5867_48852_000018_000001	train-clean-100	But to tell you a secret only it must be a secret you must not mention it at Guestwick Manor even Bell does not know we have half made up our minds to unpack all our things and stay where we are 
5867_48852_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Eames was so intent on his own purpose and so fully occupied with the difficulty of the task before him that he could hardly receive missus Dale s tidings with all the interest which they deserved Unpack them all again he said 
none	none	That will be very troublesome 
5867_48852_000019_000002	train-clean-100	Is Lily with you missus Dale 
5867_48852_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes she is in the parlour 
none	none	Come and see her So he followed missus Dale through the hall and found himself in the presence of his love
5867_48852_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 How do you do John 
5867_48852_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 How do you do Lily We all know the way in which such meetings are commenced 
5867_48852_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Each longed to be tender and affectionate to the other each in a different way but neither knew how to throw any tenderness into this first greeting 
5867_48852_000021_000003	train-clean-100	 So you re staying at the Manor House said Lily 
5867_48852_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I m staying there 
5867_48852_000022_000001	train-clean-100	Your uncle and Bell came yesterday afternoon 
none	none	Have you heard about Bell said missus Dale
5867_48852_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh yes Mary told me 
5867_48852_000024_000001	train-clean-100	I m so glad of it 
5867_48852_000024_000002	train-clean-100	I always liked doctor Crofts very much 
5867_48852_000024_000003	train-clean-100	I have not congratulated her because I didn t know whether it was a secret 
5867_48852_000024_000004	train-clean-100	But Crofts was there last night and if it is a secret he didn t seem to be very careful about keeping it 
none	none	It is no secret said missus Dale
5867_48852_000025_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t know that I am fond of such secrets But as she said this she thought of Crosbie s engagement which had been told to every one and of its consequences 
5867_48852_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Is it to be soon he asked 
5867_48852_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Well yes we think so 
5867_48852_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Of course nothing is settled 
none	none	It was such fun said Lily
5867_48852_000028_000001	train-clean-100	 James who took at any rate a year or two to make his proposal wanted to be married the next day afterwards 
5867_48852_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 No Lily not quite that 
5867_48852_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Well mamma it was very nearly that 
5867_48852_000030_000001	train-clean-100	He thought it could all be done this week 
none	none	It has made us so happy John 
5867_48852_000030_000003	train-clean-100	I don t know anybody I should so much like for a brother 
none	none	I m very glad you like him very glad I hope you ll be friends always There was some little tenderness in this as John acknowledged to himself
5867_48852_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 I m sure we shall if he likes it 
5867_48852_000031_000001	train-clean-100	That is if I ever happen to see him 
5867_48852_000031_000002	train-clean-100	I ll do anything for him I can if he ever comes up to London Wouldn t it be a good thing missus Dale if he settled himself in London 
5867_48852_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 No John it would be a very bad thing 
5867_48852_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Why should he wish to rob me of my daughter 
none	none	missus Dale was speaking of her eldest daughter but the very allusion to any such robbery covered John Eames s face with a blush made him hot up to the roots of his hair and for the moment silenced him You think he would have a better career in London said Lily speaking under the influence of her superior presence of mind 
5867_48852_000035_000000	train-clean-100	She had certainly shown defective judgment in desiring her mother not to leave them alone and of this missus Dale soon felt herself aware The thing had to be done and no little precautionary measure such as this of missus Dale s enforced presence would prevent it 
5867_48852_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Of this missus Dale was well aware and she felt moreover that John was entitled to an opportunity of pleading his own cause 
none	none	It might be that such opportunity would avail him nothing but not the less should he have it of right seeing that he desired it 
5867_48852_000035_000003	train-clean-100	But yet missus Dale did not dare to get up and leave the room 
5867_48852_000035_000004	train-clean-100	Lily had asked her not to do so and at the present period of their lives all Lily s requests were sacred 
5867_48852_000035_000005	train-clean-100	They continued for some time to talk of Crofts and his marriage and when that subject was finished they discussed their own probable or as it seemed now improbable removal to Guestwick 
5867_48852_000035_000006	train-clean-100	 It s going too far mamma said Lily to say that you think we shall not go 
5867_48852_000035_000007	train-clean-100	It was only last night that you suggested it The truth is John that Hopkins came in and discoursed with the most wonderful eloquence 
5867_48852_000035_000008	train-clean-100	Nobody dared to oppose Hopkins 
5867_48852_000035_000009	train-clean-100	He made us almost cry he was so pathetic 
5867_48852_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 He has just been talking to me too said John as I came through the squire s garden 
none	none	And what has he been saying to you said missus Dale
5867_48852_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I don t know not much John however remembered well at this moment all that the gardener had said to him 
5867_48852_000038_000001	train-clean-100	Did she know of that encounter between him and Crosbie and if she did know of it in what light did she regard it 
5867_48852_000039_000000	train-clean-100	They had sat thus for an hour together and Eames was not as yet an inch nearer to his object 
none	none	He had sworn to himself that he would not leave the Small House without asking Lily to be his wife 
5867_48852_000039_000002	train-clean-100	It seemed to him as though he would be guilty of falsehood towards the earl if he did so 
5867_48852_000039_000003	train-clean-100	Lord De Guest had opened his house to him and had asked all the Dales there and had offered himself up as a sacrifice at the cruel shrine of a serious dinner party to say nothing of that easier and lighter sacrifice which he had made in a pecuniary point of view in order that this thing might be done 
5867_48852_000039_000004	train-clean-100	Under such circumstances Eames was too honest a man not to do it let the difficulties in his way be what they might 
5867_48852_000040_000000	train-clean-100	He had sat there for an hour and missus Dale still remained with her daughter 
5867_48852_000040_000001	train-clean-100	Should he get up boldly and ask Lily to put on her bonnet and come out into the garden 
none	none	As the thought struck him he rose and grasped at his hat
5867_48852_000040_000003	train-clean-100	 I am going to walk back to Guestwick said he 
none	none	It was very good of you to come so far to see us
5867_48852_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 I was always fond of walking he said 
5867_48852_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 The earl wanted me to ride but I prefer being on foot when I know the country as I do here 
5867_48852_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Have a glass of wine before you go 
5867_48852_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh dear no I think I ll go back through the squire s fields and out on the road at the white gate 
5867_48852_000044_000001	train-clean-100	The path is quite dry now 
none	none	I dare say it is said missus Dale
5867_48852_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Lily I wonder whether you would come as far as that with me As the request was made missus Dale looked at her daughter almost beseechingly 
5867_48852_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 Do pray do said he it is a beautiful day for walking 
5867_48852_000047_000000	train-clean-100	The path proposed lay right across the field into which Lily had taken Crosbie when she made her offer to let him off from his engagement 
5867_48852_000047_000001	train-clean-100	Could it be possible that she should ever walk there again with another lover 
5867_48852_000047_000002	train-clean-100	 No John she said not to day I think I am almost tired and I had rather not go out 
5867_48852_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 It would do you good said missus Dale 
5867_48852_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t want to be done good to mamma 
5867_48852_000049_000001	train-clean-100	Besides I should have to come back by myself 
5867_48852_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 I ll come back with you said Johnny 
5867_48852_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh yes and then I should have to go again with you 
5867_48852_000051_000001	train-clean-100	But John really I don t wish to walk to day Whereupon John Eames again put down his hat 
5867_48852_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Lily said he and then he stopped 
none	none	missus Dale walked away to the window turning her back upon her daughter and visitor
5867_48852_000052_000002	train-clean-100	 Lily I have come over here on purpose to speak to you 
5867_48852_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Indeed I have come down from London only that I might see you 
none	none	Have you John Yes I have 
5867_48852_000054_000001	train-clean-100	You know well all that I have got to tell you 
none	none	I loved you before he ever saw you and now that he has gone I love you better than I ever did 
5867_48852_000054_000003	train-clean-100	Dear Lily and he put out his hand to her 
none	none	No John no she answered Must it be always no Always no to that 
5867_48852_000057_000001	train-clean-100	How can it be otherwise 
none	none	You would not have me marry you while I love another
5867_48852_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 But he is gone 
none	none	He has taken another wife
5867_48852_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 I cannot change myself because he is changed 
5867_48852_000059_000001	train-clean-100	If you are kind to me you will let that be enough 
5867_48852_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 But you are so unkind to me 
5867_48852_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 No no oh I would wish to be so kind to you 
none	none	John here take my hand It is the hand of a friend who loves you and will always love you 
5867_48852_000061_000003	train-clean-100	Dear John I will do anything everything for you but that 
5867_48852_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 There is only one thing said he still holding her by the hand but with his face turned from her 
5867_48852_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Nay do not say so 
none	none	Are you worse off than I am 
5867_48852_000063_000002	train-clean-100	I could not have that one thing and I was nearer to my heart s longings than you have ever been 
5867_48852_000063_000003	train-clean-100	I cannot have that one thing but I know that there are other things and I will not allow myself to be broken hearted 
none	none	You are stronger than I am he said
5867_48852_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 Not stronger but more certain 
none	none	Make yourself as sure as I am and you too will be strong Is it not so mamma
5867_48852_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 I wish it could be otherwise I wish it could be otherwise 
none	none	If you can give him any hope Mamma
5867_48852_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 Tell me that I may come again in a year he pleaded 
5867_48852_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 I cannot tell you so 
5867_48852_000069_000001	train-clean-100	You may not come again not in this way 
5867_48852_000069_000002	train-clean-100	Do you remember what I told you before in the garden that I loved him better than all the world besides 
5867_48852_000069_000003	train-clean-100	It is still the same 
none	none	I still love him better than all the world How then can I give you any hope
5867_48852_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 But it will not be so for ever Lily 
none	none	For ever Why should he not be mine as well as hers when that for ever comes 
5867_48852_000071_000002	train-clean-100	John if you understand what it is to love you will say nothing more of it 
5867_48852_000071_000003	train-clean-100	I have spoken to you more openly about this than I have ever done to anybody even to mamma because I have wished to make you understand my feelings 
none	none	I should be disgraced in my own eyes if I admitted the love of another man after after 
5867_48852_000071_000005	train-clean-100	It is to me almost as though I had married him 
5867_48852_000071_000006	train-clean-100	I am not blaming him remember These things are different with a man 
5867_48852_000072_000000	train-clean-100	She had not dropped his hand and as she made her last speech was sitting in her old chair with her eyes fixed upon the ground 
none	none	She spoke in a low voice slowly almost with difficulty but still the words came very clearly with a clear distinct voice which caused them to be remembered with accuracy both by Eames and missus Dale To him it seemed to be impossible that he should continue his suit after such a declaration To missus Dale they were terrible words speaking of a perpetual widowhood and telling of an amount of suffering greater even than that which she had anticipated It was true that Lily had never said so much to her as she had now said to John Eames or had attempted to make so clear an exposition of her own feelings
5867_48852_000072_000005	train-clean-100	 I should be disgraced in my own eyes if I admitted the love of another man They were terrible words but very easy to be understood 
5867_48852_000072_000006	train-clean-100	missus Dale had felt from the first that Eames was coming too soon that the earl and the squire together were making an effort to cure the wound too quickly after its infliction that time should have been given to her girl to recover 
5867_48852_000072_000007	train-clean-100	But now the attempt had been made and words had been forced from Lily s lips the speaking of which would never be forgotten by herself 
5867_48852_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 I knew that it would be so said John 
none	none	Ah yes you know it because your heart understands my heart And you will not be angry with me and say naughty cruel words as you did once before 
5867_48852_000074_000002	train-clean-100	We will think of each other John and pray for each other and will always love one another 
5867_48852_000074_000003	train-clean-100	When we do meet let us be glad to see each other 
none	none	No other friend shall ever be dearer to me than you are 
5867_48852_000074_000005	train-clean-100	You are so true and honest 
5867_48852_000074_000006	train-clean-100	When you marry I will tell your wife what an infinite blessing God has given her 
5867_48852_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 You shall never do that 
none	none	Yes I will 
5867_48852_000076_000001	train-clean-100	I understand what you mean but yet I will 
5867_48852_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Good by missus Dale he said 
none	none	Good by John If it could have been otherwise with her you should have had all my best wishes in the matter 
5867_48852_000078_000002	train-clean-100	I would have loved you dearly as my son and I will love you now Then she put up her lips and kissed his face 
5867_48852_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 And so will I love you said Lily giving him her hand again 
none	none	He looked longingly into her face as though he had thought it possible that she also might kiss him then he pressed her hand to his lips and without speaking any further farewell took up his hat and left the room
5867_48852_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Poor fellow said missus Dale 
5867_48852_000081_000000	train-clean-100	 They should not have let him come said Lily 
5867_48852_000081_000001	train-clean-100	 But they don t understand 
none	none	They think that I have lost a toy and they mean to be good natured and to give me another Very shortly after that Lily went away by herself and sat alone for hours and when she joined her mother again at tea time nothing further was said of John Eames s visit 
5867_48852_000082_000000	train-clean-100	He made his way out by the front door and through the churchyard and in this way on to the field through which he had asked Lily to walk with him 
5867_48852_000082_000001	train-clean-100	He hardly began to think of what had passed till he had left the squire s house behind him 
none	none	As he made his way through the tombstones he paused and read one as though it interested him He stood a moment under the tower looking up at the clock and then pulled out his own watch as though to verify the one by the other He made unconsciously a struggle to drive away from his thoughts the facts of the late scene and for some five or ten minutes he succeeded He said to himself a word or two about Sir Raffle and his letters and laughed inwardly as he remembered the figure of Rafferty bringing in the knight s shoes 
5867_48852_000082_000004	train-clean-100	He had gone some half mile upon his way before he ventured to stand still and tell himself that he had failed in the great object of his life 
5867_48852_000083_000000	train-clean-100	Yes he had failed and he acknowledged to himself with bitter reproaches that he had failed now and for ever 
none	none	He told himself that he had obtruded upon her in her sorrow with an unmannerly love and rebuked himself as having been not only foolish but ungenerous His friend the earl had been wont in his waggish way to call him the conquering hero and had so talked him out of his common sense as to have made him almost think that he would be successful in his suit Now as he told himself that any such success must have been impossible he almost hated the earl for having brought him to this condition 
5867_48852_000083_000003	train-clean-100	A conquering hero indeed 
5867_48852_000083_000004	train-clean-100	How should he manage to sneak back among them all at the Manor House crestfallen and abject in his misery 
5867_48852_000083_000005	train-clean-100	Everybody knew the errand on which he had gone and everybody must know of his failure 
5867_48852_000083_000006	train-clean-100	How could he have been such a fool as to undertake such a task under the eyes of so many lookers on 
none	none	Was it not the case that he had so fondly expected success as to think only of his triumph in returning and not of his more probable disgrace He had allowed others to make a fool of him and had so made a fool of himself that now all hope and happiness were over for him 
5867_48852_000083_000008	train-clean-100	How could he escape at once out of the country back to London 
none	none	How could he get away without saying a word further to any one That was the thought that at first occupied his mind 
5867_48852_000084_000000	train-clean-100	He crossed the road at the end of the squire s property where the parish of Allington divides itself from that of Abbot s Guest in which the earl s house stands and made his way back along the copse which skirted the field in which they had encountered the bull into the high woods which were at the back of the park 
none	none	Ah yes it had been well for him that he had not come out on horseback 
5867_48852_000084_000002	train-clean-100	That ride home along the high road and up to the Manor House stables would under his present circumstances have been almost impossible to him As it was he did not think it possible that he should return to his place in the earl s house 
none	none	How could he pretend to maintain his ordinary demeanour under the eyes of those two old men It would be better for him to get home to his mother to send a message from thence to the Manor and then to escape back to London So thinking but with no resolution made he went on through the woods and down from the hill back towards the town till he again came to the little bridge over the brook 
5867_48852_000084_000006	train-clean-100	There he stopped and stood a while with his broad hand spread over the letters which he had cut in those early days so as to hide them from his sight 
none	none	What an ass I have been always and ever he said to himself 
5867_48852_000085_000000	train-clean-100	It was not only of his late disappointment that he was thinking but of his whole past life 
5867_48852_000085_000001	train-clean-100	He was conscious of his hobbledehoyhood of that backwardness on his part in assuming manhood which had rendered him incapable of making himself acceptable to Lily before she had fallen into the clutches of Crosbie 
none	none	As he thought of this he declared to himself that if he could meet Crosbie again he would again thrash him that he would so belabour him as to send him out of the world if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating regardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him Was it not hard that for the two of them for Lily and for him also there should be such punishment because of the insincerity of that man 
5867_48852_000085_000003	train-clean-100	When he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of an hour he took out his knife and with deep rough gashes in the wood cut out Lily s name from the rail 
5867_48852_000086_000000	train-clean-100	He had hardly finished and was still looking at the chips as they were being carried away by the stream when a gentle step came close up to him and turning round he saw that Lady Julia was on the bridge 
none	none	She was close to him and had already seen his handiwork
5867_48852_000088_000000	train-clean-100	 Has she offended you 
none	none	John she said
5867_48852_000087_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Lady Julia 
none	none	Has she offended you She has refused me and it is all over ILLUSTRATION She has refused me and it is all over It may be that she has refused you and that yet it need not be all over I am sorry that you have cut out the name John 
5867_48852_000091_000002	train-clean-100	Do you mean to cut it out from your heart 
none	none	Never 
5867_48852_000092_000001	train-clean-100	I would if I could but I never shall 
5867_48852_000093_000000	train-clean-100	 Keep to it as to a great treasure 
5867_48852_000093_000001	train-clean-100	It will be a joy to you in after years and not a sorrow 
none	none	To have loved truly even though you shall have loved in vain will be a consolation when you are as old as I am It is something to have had a heart I don t know I wish that I had none
5867_48852_000095_000000	train-clean-100	 And John I can understand her feeling now and indeed I thought all through that you were asking her too soon but the time may yet come when she will think better of your wishes 
none	none	No no never I begin to know her now
5867_48852_000097_000000	train-clean-100	 If you can be constant in your love you may win her yet 
none	none	Remember how young she is and how young you both are Come again in two years time and then when you have won her you shall tell me that I have been a good old woman to you both I shall never win her Lady Julia As he spoke these last words the tears were running down his cheeks and he was weeping openly in presence of his companion 
5867_48852_000098_000001	train-clean-100	It was well for him that she had come upon him in his sorrow 
none	none	When he once knew that she had seen his tears he could pour out to her the whole story of his grief and as he did so she led him back quietly to the house CHAPTER LV NOT VERY FIE FIE AFTER ALL It will perhaps be remembered that terrible things had been foretold as about to happen between the Hartletop and Omnium families Lady Dumbello had smiled whenever mister Plantagenet Palliser had spoken to her mister Palliser had confessed to himself that politics were not enough for him and that Love was necessary to make up the full complement of his happiness Lord Dumbello had frowned latterly when his eyes fell on the tall figure of the duke s heir and the duke himself that potentate generally so mighty in his silence the duke himself had spoken Lady De Courcy and Lady Clandidlem were both of them absolutely certain that the thing had been fully arranged I am therefore perfectly justified in stating that the world was talking about the loves the illicit loves of mister Palliser and Lady Dumbello And the talking of the world found its way down to that respectable country parsonage in which Lady Dumbello had been born and from which she had been taken away to those noble halls which she now graced by her presence The talking of the world was heard at Plumstead Episcopi where still lived Archdeacon Grantly the lady s father and was heard also at the deanery of Barchester where lived the lady s aunt and grandfather By whose ill mannered tongue the rumour was spread in these ecclesiastical regions it boots not now to tell But it may be remembered that Courcy Castle was not far from Barchester and that Lady De Courcy was not given to hide her lights under a bushel It was a terrible rumour To what mother must not such a rumour respecting her daughter be very terrible In no mother s ears could it have sounded more frightfully than it did in those of missus Grantly Lady Dumbello the daughter might be altogether worldly but missus Grantly had never been more than half worldly In one moiety of her character her habits and her desires she had been wedded to things good in themselves to religion to charity and to honest hearted uprightness It is true that the circumstances of her life had induced her to serve both God and Mammon and that therefore she had gloried greatly in the marriage of her daughter with the heir of a marquis She had revelled in the aristocratic elevation of her child though she continued to dispense books and catechisms with her own hands to the children of the labourers of Plumstead Episcopi When Griselda first became Lady Dumbello the mother feared somewhat lest her child should find herself unequal to the exigencies of her new position But the child had proved herself more than equal to them and had mounted up to a dizzy height of success which brought to the mother great glory and great fear also She delighted to think that her Griselda was great even among the daughters of marquises but she trembled as she reflected how deadly would be the fall from such a height should there ever be a fall But she had never dreamed of such a fall as this She would have said indeed she often had said to the archdeacon that Griselda s religious principles were too firmly fixed to be moved by outward worldly matters signifying it may be her conviction that that teaching of Plumstead Episcopi had so fastened her daughter into a groove that all the future teaching of Hartlebury would not suffice to undo the fastenings When she had thus boasted no such idea as that of her daughter running from her husband s house had ever come upon her but she had alluded to vices of a nature kindred to that vice to vices into which other aristocratic ladies sometimes fell who had been less firmly grooved and her boastings had amounted to this that she herself had so successfully served God and Mammon together that her child might go forth and enjoy all worldly things without risk of damage to things heavenly Then came upon her this rumour The archdeacon told her in a hoarse whisper that he had been recommended to look to it that it was current through the world that Griselda was about to leave her husband Nothing on earth shall make me believe it said missus Grantly But she sat alone in her drawing room afterwards and trembled Then came her sister missus Arabin the dean s wife over to the parsonage and in half hidden words told the same story She had heard it from missus Proudie the bishop s wife That woman is as false as the father of falsehoods said missus Grantly But she trembled the more and as she prepared her parish work could think of nothing but her child What would be all her life to come what would have been all that was past of her life if this thing should happen to her She would not believe it but yet she trembled the more as she thought of her daughter s exaltation and remembered that such things had been done in that world to which Griselda now belonged Ah would it not have been better for them if they had not raised their heads so high And she walked out alone among the tombs of the neighbouring churchyard and stood over the grave in which had been laid the body of her other daughter Could be it that the fate of that one had been the happier Very few words were spoken on the subject between her and the archdeacon and yet it seemed agreed among them that something should be done He went up to London and saw his daughter not daring however to mention such a subject Lord Dumbello was cross with him and very uncommunicative Indeed both the archdeacon and missus Grantly had found that their daughter s house was not comfortable to them and as they were sufficiently proud among their own class they had not cared to press themselves on the hospitality of their son in law But he had been able to perceive that all was not right in the house in Carlton Gardens Lord Dumbello was not gracious with his wife and there was something in the silence rather than in the speech of men which seemed to justify the report which had reached him He is there oftener than he should be said the archdeacon And I am sure of this at least that Dumbello does not like it I will write to her said missus Grantly at last I am still her mother I will write to her It may be that she does not know what people say of her And missus Grantly did write Plumstead April one hundred eighty six DEAREST GRISELDA It seems sometimes that you have been moved so far away from me that I have hardly a right to concern myself more in the affairs of your daily life and I know that it is impossible that you should refer to me for advice or sympathy as you would have done had you married some gentleman of our own standing But I am quite sure that my child does not forget her mother or fail to look back upon her mother s love and that she will allow me to speak to her if she be in trouble as I would to any other child whom I had loved and cherished I pray God that I may be wrong in supposing that such trouble is near you If I am so you will forgive me my solicitude Rumours have reached us from more than one quarter that Oh Griselda I hardly know in what words to conceal and yet to declare that which I have to write They say that you are intimate with mister Palliser the nephew of the duke and that your husband is much offended Perhaps I had better tell you all openly cautioning you not to suppose that I have believed it They say that it is thought that you are going to put yourself under mister Palliser s protection My dearest child I think you can imagine with what an agony I write these words with what terrible grief I must have been oppressed before I could have allowed myself to entertain the thoughts which have produced them Such things are said openly in Barchester and your father who has been in town and has seen you feels himself unable to tell me that my mind may be at rest I will not say to you a word as to the injury in a worldly point of view which would come to you from any rupture with your husband I believe that you can see what would be the effect of so terrible a step quite as plainly as I can show it you You would break the heart of your father and send your mother to her grave but it is not even on that that I may most insist It is this that you would offend your God by the worst sin that a woman can commit and cast yourself into a depth of infamy in which repentance before God is almost impossible and from which escape before man is not permitted I do not believe it my dearest dearest child my only living daughter I do not believe what they have said to me But as a mother I have not dared to leave the slander unnoticed If you will write to me and say that it is not so you will make me happy again even though you should rebuke me for my suspicion Believe that at all times and under all circumstances I am still your loving mother as I was in other days SUSAN GRANTLY We will now go back to mister Palliser as he sat in his chambers at the Albany thinking of his love The duke had cautioned him and the duke s agent had cautioned him and he in spite of his high feeling of independence had almost been made to tremble All his thousands a year were in the balance and perhaps everything on which depended his position before the world But nevertheless though he did tremble he resolved to persevere Statistics were becoming dry to him and love was very sweet Statistics he thought might be made as enchanting as ever if only they could be mingled with love The mere idea of loving Lady Dumbello had seemed to give a salt to his life of which he did not now know how to rob himself It is true that he had not as yet enjoyed many of the absolute blessings of love seeing that his conversations with Lady Dumbello had never been warmer than those which have been repeated in these pages but his imagination had been at work and now that Lady Dumbello was fully established at her house in Carlton Gardens he was determined to declare his passion on the first convenient opportunity It was sufficiently manifest to him that the world expected him to do so and that the world was already a little disposed to find fault with the slowness of his proceedings He had been once at Carlton Gardens since the season had commenced and the lady had favoured him with her sweetest smile But he had only been half a minute alone with her and during that half minute had only time to remark that he supposed she would now remain in London for the season Oh yes she had answered we shall not leave till July Nor could he leave till July because of the exigencies of his statistics He therefore had before him two if not three clear months in which to manoeuvre to declare his purposes and prepare for the future events of his life As he resolved on a certain morning that he would say his first tender word to Lady Dumbello that very night in the drawing room of Lady De Courcy where he knew that he should meet her a letter came to him by the post He well knew the hand and the intimation which it would contain It was from the duke s agent mister Fothergill and informed him that a certain sum of money had been placed to his credit at his banker s But the letter went further and informed him also that the duke had given his agent to understand that special instructions would be necessary before the next quarterly payment could be made mister Fothergill said nothing further but mister Palliser understood it all He felt his blood run cold round his heart but nevertheless he determined that he would not break his word to Lady De Courcy that night And Lady Dumbello received her letter also on the same morning She was being dressed as she read it and the maidens who attended her found no cause to suspect that anything in the letter had excited her ladyship Her ladyship was not often excited though she was vigilant in exacting from them their utmost cares She read her letter however very carefully and as she sat beneath the toilet implements of her maidens thought deeply of the tidings which had been brought to her She was angry with no one she was thankful to no one She felt no special love for any person concerned in the matter Her heart did not say Oh my lord and husband or Oh my lover or Oh my mother the friend of my childhood But she became aware that matter for thought had been brought before her and she did think Send my love to Lord Dumbello she said when the operations were nearly completed and tell him that I shall be so glad to see him if he will come to me while I am at breakfast Yes my lady And then the message came back His lordship would be with her ladyship certainly Gustavus she said as soon as she had seated herself discreetly in her chair I have had a letter from my mother which you had better read and she handed to him the document I do not know what I have done to deserve such suspicions from her but she lives in the country and has probably been deceived by ill natured people At any rate you must read it and tell me what I should do We may predicate from this that mister Palliser s chance of being able to shipwreck himself upon that rock was but small and that he would in spite of himself be saved from his uncle s anger Lord Dumbello took the letter and read it very slowly standing as he did so with his back to the fire He read it very slowly and his wife though she never turned her face directly upon his could perceive that he became very red that he was fluttered and put beyond himself and that his answer was not ready She was well aware that his conduct to her during the last three months had been much altered from his former usages that he had been rougher with her in his speech when alone and less courteous in his attention when in society but she had made no complaint or spoken a word to show him that she had marked the change She had known moreover the cause of his altered manner and having considered much had resolved that she would live it down She had declared to herself that she had done no deed and spoken no word that justified suspicion and therefore she would make no change in her ways or show herself to be conscious that she was suspected But now having her mother s letter in her hand she could bring him to an explanation without making him aware that she had ever thought that he had been jealous of her To her her mother s letter was a great assistance It justified a scene like this and enabled her to fight her battle after her own fashion As for eloping with any mister Palliser and giving up the position which she had won no indeed She had been fastened in her grooves too well for that Her mother in entertaining any fear on such a subject had shown herself to be ignorant of the solidity of her daughter s character Well Gustavus she said at last You must say what answer I shall make or whether I shall make any answer But he was not even yet ready to instruct her So he unfolded the letter and read it again and she poured out for herself a cup of tea It s a very serious matter said he Yes it is serious I could not but think such a letter from my mother to be serious Had it come from any one else I doubt whether I should have troubled you unless indeed it had been from any as near to you as she is to me As it is you cannot but feel that I am right Right Oh yes you are right quite right to tell me you should tell me everything D them But whom he meant to condemn he did not explain I am above all things averse to cause you trouble she said I have seen some little things of late Has he ever said anything to you Who mister Palliser Never a word He has hinted at nothing of this kind Never a word Had he done so I must have made you understand that he could not have been allowed again into my drawing room Then again he read the letter or pretended to do so Your mother means well he said Oh yes she means well She has been foolish to believe the tittle tattle that has reached her very foolish to oblige me to give you this annoyance Oh as for that I m not annoyed By Jove no Come Griselda let us have it all out other people have said this and I have been unhappy Now you know it all Have I made you unhappy Well no not you Don t be hard upon me when I tell you the whole truth Fools and brutes have whispered things that have vexed me They may whisper till the devil fetches them but they shan t annoy me again Give me a kiss my girl And he absolutely put out his arms and embraced her Write a good natured letter to your mother and ask her to come up for a week in May That ll be the best thing and then she ll understand By Jove it s twelve o clock Good by Lady Dumbello was well aware that she had triumphed and that her mother s letter had been invaluable to her But it had been used and therefore she did not read it again She ate her breakfast in quiet comfort looking over a milliner s French circular as she did so and then when the time for such an operation had fully come she got to her writing table and answered her mother s letter DEAR MAMMA she said I thought it best to show your letter at once to Lord Dumbello He said that people would be ill natured and seemed to think that the telling of such stories could not be helped As regards you he was not a bit angry but said that you and papa had better come to us for a week about the end of next month Do come We are to have rather a large dinner party on the twenty third His Royal Highness is coming and I think papa would like to meet him Have you observed that those very high bonnets have all gone out I never liked them and as I had got a hint from Paris I have been doing my best to put them down I do hope nothing will prevent your coming Your affectionate daughter G DUMBELLO Carlton Gardens Wednesday missus Grantly was aware from the moment in which she received the letter that she had wronged her daughter by her suspicions It did not occur to her to disbelieve a word that was said in the letter or an inference that was implied She had been wrong and rejoiced that it was so But nevertheless there was that in the letter which annoyed and irritated her though she could not explain to herself the cause of her annoyance She had thrown all her heart into that which she had written but in the words which her child had written not a vestige of heart was to be found In that reconciling of God and Mammon which missus Grantly had carried on so successfully in the education of her daughter the organ had not been required and had become withered if not defunct through want of use We will not go there I think said missus Grantly speaking to her husband Oh dear no certainly not If you want to go to town at all I will take rooms for you And as for his Royal Highness I have a great respect for his Royal Highness but I do not in the least desire to meet him at Dumbello s table And so that matter was settled as regarded the inhabitants of Plumstead Episcopi And whither did Lord Dumbello betake himself when he left his wife s room in so great a hurry at twelve o clock Not to the Park nor to Tattersall s nor to a Committee room of the House of Commons nor yet to the bow window of his club But he went straight to a great jeweller s in Ludgate hill and there purchased a wonderful green necklace very rare and curious heavy with green sparkling drops with three rows of shining green stones embedded in chaste gold a necklace amounting almost to a jewelled cuirass in weight and extent It had been in all the exhibitions and was very costly and magnificent While Lady Dumbello was still dressing in the evening this was brought to her with her lord s love as his token of renewed confidence and Lady Dumbello as she counted the sparkles triumphed inwardly telling herself that she had played her cards well But while she counted the sparkles produced by her full reconciliation with her lord poor Plantagenet Palliser was still trembling in his ignorance If only he could have been allowed to see missus Grantly s letter and the lady s answer and the lord s present But no such seeing was vouchsafed to him and he was carried off in his brougham to Lady De Courcy s house twittering with expectant love and trembling with expectant ruin To this conclusion he had come at any rate that if anything was to be done it should be done now He would speak a word of love and prepare his future in accordance with the acceptance it might receive Lady De Courcy s rooms were very crowded when he arrived there It was the first great crushing party of the season and all the world had been collected into Portman Square Lady De Courcy was smiling as though her lord had no teeth as though her eldest son s condition was quite happy and all things were going well with the De Courcy interests Lady Margaretta was there behind her bland without and bitter within and Lady Rosina also at some further distance reconciled to this world s vanity and finery because there was to be no dancing And the married daughters of the house were there also striving to maintain their positions on the strength of their undoubted birth but subjected to some snubbing by the lowness of their absolute circumstances Gazebee was there happy in the absolute fact of his connection with an earl and blessed with the consideration that was extended to him as an earl s son in law And Crosbie also was in the rooms was present there though he had sworn to himself that he would no longer dance attendance on the countess and that he would sever himself away from the wretchedness of the family But if he gave up them and their ways what else would then be left to him He had come therefore and now stood alone sullen in a corner telling himself that all was vanity Yes to the vain all will be vanity and to the poor of heart all will be poor Lady Dumbello was there in a small inner room seated on a couch to which she had been brought on her first arrival at the house and on which she would remain till she departed From time to time some very noble or very elevated personage would come before her and say a word and she would answer that elevated personage with another word but nobody had attempted with her the task of conversation It was understood that Lady Dumbello did not converse unless it were occasionally with mister Palliser She knew well that mister Palliser was to meet her there He had told her expressly that he should do so having inquired with much solicitude whether she intended to obey the invitation of the countess I shall probably be there she had said and now had determined that her mother s letter and her husband s conduct to her should not cause her to break her word Should mister Palliser forget himself she would know how to say a word to him as she had known how to say a word to her husband Forget himself She was very sure that mister Palliser had been making up his mind to forget himself for some months past He did come to her and stood over her looking unutterable things His unutterable things however were so looked that they did not absolutely demand notice from the lady He did not sigh like a furnace nor open his eyes upon her as though there were two suns in the firmament above her head nor did he beat his breast or tear his hair mister Palliser had been brought up in a school which delights in tranquillity and never allows its pupils to commit themselves either to the sublime or to the ridiculous He did look an unutterable thing or two but he did it with so decorous an eye that the lady who was measuring it all with great accuracy could not as yet declare that mister Palliser had forgotten himself There was room by her on the couch and once or twice at Hartlebury he had ventured so to seat himself On the present occasion however he could not do so without placing himself manifestly on her dress She would have known how to fill a larger couch even than that as she would have known also how to make room had it been her mind to do so So he stood still over her and she smiled at him Such a smile It was cold as death flattering no one saying nothing hideous in its unmeaning unreal grace Ah how I hate the smile of a woman who smiles by rote It made mister Palliser feel very uncomfortable but he did not analyze it and persevered Lady Dumbello he said and his voice was very low I have been looking forward to meeting you here Have you mister Palliser Yes I remember that you asked me whether I was coming I did Hm Lady Dumbello and he almost trenched upon the outside verge of that schooling which had taught him to avoid both the sublime and the ridiculous But he had not forgotten himself as yet and so she smiled again Lady Dumbello in this world in which we live it is so hard to get a moment in which we can speak He had thought that she would move her dress but she did not Oh I don t know she said one doesn t often want to say very much I think Ah no not often perhaps But when one does want How I do hate these crowded rooms Yet when he had been at Hartlebury he had resolved that the only ground for him would be the crowded drawing room of some large London house I wonder whether you ever desire anything beyond them Oh yes said she but I confess that I am fond of parties mister Palliser looked round and thought that he saw that he was unobserved He had made up his mind as to what he would do and he was determined to do it He had in him none of that readiness which enables some men to make love and carry off their Dulcineas at a moment s notice but he had that pluck which would have made himself disgraceful in his own eyes if he omitted to do that as to the doing of which he had made a solemn resolution He would have preferred to do it sitting but faute de mieux seeing that a seat was denied to him he would do it standing Griselda he said and it must be admitted that his tone was not bad The word sank softly into her ear like small rain upon moss and it sank into no other ear Griselda mister Palliser said she and though she made no scene though she merely glanced upon him once he could see that he was wrong May I not call you so Certainly not Shall I ask you to see if my people are there He stood a moment before her hesitating My carriage I mean As she gave the command she glanced at him again and then he obeyed her orders When he returned she had left her seat but he heard her name announced on the stairs and caught a glance of the back of her head as she made her way gracefully down through the crowd He never attempted to make love to her again utterly disappointing the hopes of Lady De Courcy missus Proudie and Lady Clandidlem As I would wish those who are interested in mister Palliser s fortunes to know the ultimate result of this adventure and as we shall not have space to return to his affairs in this little history I may perhaps be allowed to press somewhat forward and tell what Fortune did for him before the close of that London season Everybody knows that in that spring Lady Glencora MacCluskie was brought out before the world and it is equally well known that she as the only child of the late Lord of the Isles was the great heiress of the day It is true that the hereditary possession of Skye Staffa Mull Arran and Bute went with the title to the Marquis of Auldreekie together with the counties of Caithness and Ross shire But the property in Fife Aberdeen Perth and Kincardine shire comprising the greater part of those counties and the coal mines in Lanark as well as the enormous estate within the city of Glasgow were unentailed and went to the Lady Glencora She was a fair girl with bright blue eyes and short wavy flaxen hair very soft to the eye The Lady Glencora was small in stature and her happy round face lacked perhaps the highest grace of female beauty But there was ever a smile upon it at which it was very pleasant to look and the intense interest with which she would dance and talk and follow up every amusement that was offered her was very charming The horse she rode was the dearest love oh she loved him so dearly And she had a little dog that was almost as dear as the horse The friend of her youth Sabrina Scott was oh such a girl And her cousin the little Lord of the Isles the heir of the marquis was so gracious and beautiful that she was always covering him with kisses Unfortunately he was only six so that there was hardly a possibility that the properties should be brought together But Lady Glencora though she was so charming had even in this her first outset upon the world given great uneasiness to her friends and caused the Marquis of Auldreekie to be almost wild with dismay There was a terribly handsome man about town who had spent every shilling that anybody would give him who was very fond of brandy who was known but not trusted at Newmarket who was said to be deep in every vice whose father would not speak to him and with him the Lady Glencora was never tired of dancing One morning she had told her cousin the marquis with a flashing eye for the round blue eye could flash that Burgo Fitzgerald was more sinned against than sinning Ah me what was a guardian marquis anxious for the fate of the family property to do under such circumstances as that But before the end of the season the marquis and the duke were both happy men and we will hope that the Lady Glencora also was satisfied mister Plantagenet Palliser had danced with her twice and had spoken his mind He had an interview with the marquis which was pre eminently satisfactory and everything was settled Glencora no doubt told him how she had accepted that plain gold ring from Burgo Fitzgerald and how she had restored it but I doubt whether she ever told him of that wavy lock of golden hair which Burgo still keeps in his receptacle for such treasures Plantagenet said the duke with quite unaccustomed warmth in this as in all things you have shown yourself to be everything that I could desire I have told the marquis that Matching Priory with the whole estate should be given over to you at once It is the most comfortable country house I know Glencora shall have The Horns as her wedding present But the genial frank delight of mister Fothergill pleased mister Palliser the most The heir of the Pallisers had done his duty and mister Fothergill was unfeignedly a happy man CHAPTER LVI SHOWING HOW mister CROSBIE BECAME AGAIN A HAPPY MAN It has been told in the last chapter how Lady De Courcy gave a great party in London in the latter days of April and it may therefore be thought that things were going well with the De Courcys but I fear the inference would be untrue At any rate things were not going well with Lady Alexandrina for she on her mother s first arrival in town had rushed to Portman square with a long tale of her sufferings Oh mamma you would not believe it but he hardly ever speaks to me My dear there are worse faults in a man than that I am alone there all the day I never get out He never offers to get me a carriage He asked me to walk with him once last week when it was raining I saw that he waited till the rain began Only think I have not been out three evenings this month except to Amelia s and now he says he won t go there any more because a fly is so expensive You can t believe how uncomfortable the house is I thought you chose it my dear I looked at it but of course I didn t know what a house ought to be Amelia said it wasn t nice but he would have it He hates Amelia I m sure of that for he says everything he can to snub her and mister Gazebee mister Gazebee is as good as he at any rate What do you think He has given Richard warning to go You never saw him but he was a very good servant He has given him warning and he is not talking of getting another man I won t live with him without somebody to wait upon me My dearest girl do not think of such a thing as leaving him But I will think of it mamma You do not know what my life is in that house He never speaks to me never He comes home before dinner at half past six and when he has just shown himself he goes to his dressing room He is always silent at dinner time and after dinner he goes to sleep He breakfasts always at nine and goes away at half past nine though I know he does not get to his office till eleven If I want anything he says that it cannot be afforded I never thought before that he was stingy but I am sure now that he must be a miser at heart It is better so than a spendthrift Alexandrina I don t know that it is better He could not make me more unhappy than I am Unhappy is no word for it What can I do shut up in such a house as that by myself from nine o clock in the morning till six in the evening Everybody knows what he is so that nobody will come to see me I tell you fairly mamma I will not stand it If you cannot help me I will look for help elsewhere It may at any rate be said that things were not going well with that branch of the De Courcy family Nor indeed was it going well with some other branches Lord Porlock had married not having selected his partner for life from the choicest cream of the aristocratic circles and his mother while endeavouring to say a word in his favour had been so abused by the earl that she had been driven to declare that she could no longer endure such usage She had come up to London in direct opposition to his commands while he was fastened to his room by gout and had given her party in defiance of him so that people should not say when her back was turned that she had slunk away in despair I have borne it she said to Margaretta longer than any other woman in England would have done While I thought that any of you would marry Oh don t talk of that mamma said Margaretta putting a little scorn into her voice She had not been quite pleased that even her mother should intimate that all her chance was over and yet she herself had often told her mother that she had given up all thought of marrying Rosina will go to Amelia s the countess continued mister Gazebee is quite satisfied that it should be so and he will take care that she shall have enough to cover her own expenses I propose that you and I dear shall go to Baden Baden And about money mamma mister Gazebee must manage it In spite of all that your father says I know that there must be money The expense will be much less so than in our present way And what will papa do himself I cannot help it my dear No one knows what I have had to bear Another year of it would kill me His language has become worse and worse and I fear every day that he is going to strike me with his crutch Under all these circumstances it cannot be said that the De Courcy interests were prospering But Lady De Courcy when she had made up her mind to go to Baden Baden had by no means intended to take her youngest daughter with her She had endured for years and now Alexandrina was unable to endure for six months Her chief grievance moreover was this that her husband was silent The mother felt that no woman had a right to complain much of any such sorrow as that If her earl had sinned only in that way she would have been content to have remained by him till the last And yet I do not know whether Alexandrina s life was not quite as hard as that of her mother She barely exceeded the truth when she said that he never spoke to her The hours with her in her new comfortless house were very long very long and very tedious Marriage with her had by no means been the thing that she had expected At home with her mother there had always been people around her but they had not always been such as she herself would have chosen for her companions She had thought that when married she could choose and have those about her who were congenial to her but she found that none came to her Her sister who was a wiser woman than she had begun her married life with a definite idea and had carried it out but this poor creature found herself as it were stranded When once she had conceived it in her heart to feel anger against her husband and she had done so before they had been a week together there was no love to bring her back to him again She did not know that it behoved her to look pleased when he entered the room and to make him at any rate think that his presence gave her happiness She became gloomy before she reached her new house and never laid her gloom aside He would have made a struggle for some domestic comfort had any seemed to be within his reach As it was he struggled for domestic propriety believing that he might so best bolster up his present lot in life But the task became harder and harder to him and the gloom became denser and more dense He did not think of her unhappiness but of his own as she did not think of his tedium but of hers If this be domestic felicity he would say to himself as he sat in his arm chair striving to fix his attention upon a book If this be the happiness of married life she thought as she remained listless without even the pretence of a book behind her teacups In truth she would not walk with him not caring for such exercise round the pavement of a London square and he had resolutely determined that she should not run into debt for carriage hire He was not a curmudgeon with his money he was no miser But he had found that in marrying an earl s daughter he had made himself a poor man and he was resolved that he would not also be an embarrassed man When the bride heard that her mother and sister were about to escape to Baden Baden there rushed upon her a sudden hope that she might be able to accompany the flight She would not be parted from her husband or at least not so parted that the world should suppose that they had quarrelled She would simply go away and make a long visit a very long visit Two years ago a sojourn with her mother and Margaretta at Baden Baden would not have offered to her much that was attractive but now in her eyes such a life seemed to be a life in Paradise In truth the tedium of those hours in Princess Royal Crescent had been very heavy But how could she contrive that it should be so That conversation with her mother had taken place on the day preceding the party and Lady De Courcy had repeated it with dismay to Margaretta Of course he would allow her an income Margaretta had coolly said But my dear they have been married only ten weeks I don t see why people are to be made absolutely wretched because they are married Margaretta answered I don t want to persuade her to leave him but if what she says is true it must be very uncomfortable Crosbie had consented to go to the party in Portman square but had not greatly enjoyed himself on that festive occasion He had stood about moodily speaking hardly a word to any one His whole aspect of life seemed to have been altered during the last few months It was here in such spots as this that he had been used to find his glory On such occasions he had shone with peculiar light making envious the hearts of many who watched the brilliance of his career as they stood around in dull quiescence But now no one in those rooms had been more dull more silent or less courted than he and yet he was established there as the son in law of that noble house Rather slow work isn t it Gazebee had said to him having after many efforts succeeded in reaching his brother in law in a corner In answer to this Crosbie had only grunted As for myself continued Gazebee I would a deal sooner be at home with my paper and slippers It seems to me these sort of gatherings don t suit married men Crosbie had again grunted and had then escaped into another corner Crosbie and his wife went home together in a cab speechless both of them Alexandrina hated cabs but she had been plainly told that in such vehicles and in such vehicles only could she be allowed to travel On the following morning he was at the breakfast table punctually by nine but she did not make her appearance till after he had gone to his office Soon after that however she was away to her mother and her sister but she was seated grimly in her drawing room when he came in to see her on his return to his house Having said some word which might be taken for a greeting he was about to retire but she stopped him with a request that he would speak to her Certainly said he I was only going to dress It is nearly the half hour I won t keep you very long and if dinner is a few minutes late it won t signify Mamma and Margaretta are going to Baden Baden To Baden Baden are they Yes and they intend to remain there for a considerable time There was a little pause and Alexandrina found it necessary to clear her voice and to prepare herself for further speech by a little cough She was determined to make her proposition but was rather afraid of the manner in which it might be first received Has anything happened at Courcy Castle Crosbie asked No that is yes there may have been some words between papa and mamma but I don t quite know That however does not matter now Mamma is going and purposes to remain there for the rest of the year And the house in town will be given up I suppose so but that will be as papa chooses Have you any objection to my going with mamma What a question to be asked by a bride of ten weeks standing She had hardly been above a month with her husband in her new house and she was now asking permission to leave it and to leave him also for an indefinite number of months perhaps for ever But she showed no excitement as she made her request There was neither sorrow nor regret nor hope in her face She had not put on half the animation which she had once assumed in asking for the use twice a week of a carriage done up to look as though it were her own private possession Crosbie had then answered her with great sternness and she had wept when his refusal was made certain to her But there was to be no weeping now She meant to go with his permission if he would accord it and without it if he should refuse it The question of money was no doubt important but Gazebee should manage that as he managed all those things Going with them to Baden Baden said Crosbie For how long Well it would be no use unless it were for some time For how long a time do you mean Alexandrina Speak out what you really have to say For a month Oh more than that For two months or six or as long as they may stay there We could settle that afterwards when I am there During all this time she did not once look into his face though he was looking hard at her throughout You mean said he that you wish to go away from me In one sense it would be going away certainly But in the ordinary sense is it not so When you talk of going to Baden Baden for an unlimited number of months have you any idea of coming back again Back to London you mean Back to me to my house to your duties as a wife Why cannot you say at once what it is you want You wish to be separated from me I am not happy here in this house And who chose the house Did I want to come here But it is not that If you are not happy here what could you have in any other house to make you happy If you were left alone in this room for seven or eight hours at a time without a soul to come to you you would know what I mean And even after that it is not much better You never speak to me when you are here Is it my fault that nobody comes to you The fact is Alexandrina that you will not reconcile yourself to the manner of life which is suitable to my income You are wretched because you cannot have yourself driven round the Park I cannot find you a carriage and will not attempt to do so You may go to Baden Baden if you please that is if your mother is willing to take you Of course I must pay my own expenses said Alexandrina But to this he made no answer on the moment As soon as he had given his permission he had risen from his seat and was going and her last words only caught him in the doorway After all would not this be the cheapest arrangement that he could make As he went through his calculations he stood up with his elbow on the mantel piece in his dressing room He had scolded his wife because she had been unhappy with him but had he not been quite as unhappy with her Would it not be better that they should part in this quiet half unnoticed way that they should part and never again come together He was lucky in this that hitherto had come upon them no prospect of any little Crosbie to mar the advantages of such an arrangement If he gave her four hundred a year and allowed Gazebee two more towards the paying off of encumbrances he would still have six on which to enjoy himself in London Of course he could not live as he had lived in those happy days before his marriage nor independently of the cost would such a mode of life be within his reach But he might go to his club for his dinners he might smoke his cigar in luxury he would not be bound to that wooden home which in spite of all his resolutions had become almost unendurable to him So he made his calculations and found that it would be well that his bride should go He would give over his house and furniture to Gazebee allowing Gazebee to do as he would about that To be once more a bachelor in lodgings with six hundred a year to spend on himself seemed to him now such a prospect of happiness that he almost became light hearted as he dressed himself He would let her go to Baden Baden There was nothing said about it at dinner nor did he mention the subject again till the servant had left the tea things on the drawing room table You can go with your mother if you like it he then said I think it will be best she answered Perhaps it will At any rate you shall suit yourself And about money You had better leave me to speak to Gazebee about that Very well Will you have some tea And then the whole thing was finished On the next day she went after lunch to her mother s house and never came back again to Princess Royal Crescent During that morning she packed up those things which she cared to pack herself and sent her sisters there with an old family servant to bring away whatever else might be supposed to belong to her Dear dear said Amelia what trouble I had in getting these things together for them and only the other day I can t but think she s wrong to go away I don t know said Margaretta She has not been so lucky as you have in the man she has married I always felt that she would find it difficult to manage him But my dear she has not tried She has given up at once It isn t management that was wanting The fact is that when Alexandrina began she didn t make up her mind to the kind of thing she was coming to I did I knew it wasn t to be all party going and that sort of thing But I must own that Crosbie isn t the same sort of man as Mortimer I don t think I could have gone on with him You might as well have those small books put up he won t care about them And in this way Crosbie s house was dismantled She saw him no more for he made no farewell visit to the house in Portman Square A note had been brought to him at his office I am here with mamma and may as well say good by now We start on Tuesday If you wish to write you can send your letters to the housekeeper here I hope you will make yourself comfortable and that you will be well Yours affectionately A C He made no answer to it but went that day and dined at his club I haven t seen you this age said Montgomerie Dobbs No My wife is going abroad with her mother and while she is away I shall come back here again There was nothing more said to him and no one ever made any inquiry about his domestic affairs It seemed to him now as though he had no friend sufficiently intimate with him to ask him after his wife or family She was gone and in a month s time he found himself again in Mount Street beginning the world with five hundred a year not six For mister Gazebee when the reckoning came showed him that a larger income at the present moment was not possible for him The countess had for a long time refused to let Lady Alexandrina go with her on so small a pittance as four hundred and fifty and then were there not the insurances to be maintained But I think he would have consented to accept his liberty with three hundred a year so great to him was the relief CHAPTER LVII LILIAN DALE VANQUISHES HER MOTHER missus Dale had been present during the interview in which John Eames had made his prayer to her daughter but she had said little or nothing on that occasion All her wishes had been in favour of the suitor but she had not dared to express them neither had she dared to leave the room It had been hard upon him to be thus forced to declare his love in the presence of a third person but he had done it and had gone away with his answer Then when the thing was over Lily without any communion with her mother took herself off and was no more seen till the evening hours had come on in which it was natural that they should be together again missus Dale when thus alone had been able to think of nothing but this new suit for her daughter s hand If only it might be accomplished If any words from her to Lily might be efficacious to such an end And yet hitherto she had been afraid almost to utter a word She knew that it was very difficult She declared to herself over and over that he had come too soon that the attempt had been made too quickly after that other shipwreck How was it possible that the ship should put to sea again at once with all her timbers so rudely strained And yet now that the attempt had been made now that Eames had uttered his request and been sent away with an answer she felt that she must at once speak to Lily on the subject if ever she were to speak upon it She thought that she understood her child and all her feelings She recognized the violence of the shock which must be encountered before Lily could be brought to acknowledge such a change in her heart But if the thing could be done Lily would be a happy woman When once done it would be in all respects a blessing And if it were not done might not Lily s life be blank lonely and loveless to the end Yet when Lily came down in the evening with some light half joking word on her lips as was usual to her missus Dale was still afraid to venture upon her task I suppose mamma we may consider it as a settled thing that everything must be again unpacked and that the lodging scheme will be given up I don t know that my dear Oh but I do after what you said just now What geese everybody will think us I shouldn t care a bit for that if we didn t think ourselves geese or if your uncle did not think us so I believe he would think we were swans If I had ever thought he would be so much in earnest about it or that he would ever have cared about our being here I would never have voted for going But he is so strange He is affectionate when he ought to be angry and ill natured when he ought to be gentle and kind He has at any rate given us reason to feel sure of his affection For us girls I never doubted it But mamma I don t think I could face missus Boyce missus Hearn and missus Crump would be very bad and Hopkins would come down upon us terribly when he found that we had given way But missus Boyce would be worse than any of them Can t you fancy the tone of her congratulations I think I should survive missus Boyce Ah yes because we should have to go and tell her I know your cowardice of old mamma don t I And Bell wouldn t care a bit because of her lover missus Boyce will be nothing to her It is I that must bear it all Well I don t mind I ll vote for staying if you will promise to be happy here Oh mamma I ll vote for anything if you will be happy And will you be happy Yes as happy as the day is long Only I know we shall never see Bell People never do see each other when they live just at that distance It s too near for long visits and too far for short visits I ll tell you what we might make arrangements each to walk half way and meet at the corner of Lord De Guest s wood I wonder whether they d let us put up a seat there I think we might have a little house and carry sandwiches and a bottle of beer Couldn t we see something of each other in that way Thus it came to be the fixed idea of both of them that they would abandon their plan of migrating to Guestwick and on this subject they continued to talk over their tea table but on that evening missus Dale ventured to say nothing about John Eames But they did not even yet dare to commence the work of reconstructing their old home Bell must come back before they would do that and the express assent of the squire must be formally obtained missus Dale must in a degree acknowledge herself to have been wrong and ask to be forgiven for her contumacy I suppose the three of us had better go up in sackcloth and throw ashes on our foreheads as we meet Hopkins in the garden said Lily and then I know he ll heap coals of fire on our heads by sending us an early dish of peas And Dingles would bring us in a pheasant only that pheasants don t grow in May If the sackcloth doesn t take an unpleasanter shape than that I shan t mind it That s because you ve got no delicate feelings And then uncle Christopher s gratitude Ah I shall feel that But mamma we ll wait till Bell comes home She shall decide She is going away and therefore she ll be free from prejudice If uncle offers to paint the house and I know he will then I shall be humbled to the dust But yet missus Dale had said nothing on the subject which was nearest to her heart When Lily in pleasantry had accused her of cowardice her mind had instantly gone off to that other matter and she had told herself that she was a coward Why should she be afraid of offering her counsel to her own child It seemed to her as though she had neglected some duty in allowing Crosbie s conduct to have passed away without hardly a word of comment on it between herself and Lily Should she not have forced upon her daughter s conviction the fact that Crosbie had been a villain and as such should be discarded from her heart As it was Lily had spoken the simple truth when she told John Eames that she was dealing more openly with him on that affair of her engagement than she had ever dealt even with her mother Thinking of this as she sat in her own room that night before she allowed herself to rest missus Dale resolved that on the next morning she would endeavour to make Lily see as she saw and think as she thought She let breakfast pass by before she began her task and even then she did not rush at it at once Lily sat herself down to her work when the teacups were taken away and missus Dale went down to her kitchen as was her wont It was nearly eleven before she seated herself in the parlour and even then she got her work box before her and took out her needle I wonder how Bell gets on with Lady Julia said Lily Very well I m sure Lady Julia won t bite her I know and I suppose her dismay at the tall footmen has passed off by this time I don t know that they have any tall footmen Short footmen then you know what I mean all the noble belongings They must startle one at first I m sure let one determine ever so much not to be startled It s a very mean thing no doubt to be afraid of a lord merely because he is a lord yet I m sure I should be afraid at first even of Lord De Guest if I were staying in the house It s well you didn t go then Yes I think it is Bell is of a firmer mind and I dare say she ll get over it after the first day But what on earth does she do there I wonder whether they mend their stockings in such a house as that Not in public I should think In very grand houses they throw them away at once I suppose I ve often thought about it Do you believe the Prime Minister ever has his shoes sent to a cobbler Perhaps a regular shoemaker will condescend to mend a Prime Minister s shoes You do think they are mended then But who orders it Does he see himself when there s a little hole coming as I do Does an archbishop allow himself so many pairs of gloves in a year Not very strictly I should think Then I suppose it comes to this that he has a new pair whenever he wants them But what constitutes the want Does he ever say to himself that they ll do for another Sunday I remember the bishop coming here once and he had a hole at the end of his thumb I was going to be confirmed and I remember thinking that he ought to have been smarter Why didn t you offer to mend it I shouldn t have dared for all the world The conversation had commenced itself in a manner that did not promise much assistance to missus Dale s project When Lily got upon any subject she was not easily induced to leave it and when her mind had twisted itself in one direction it was difficult to untwist it She was now bent on a consideration of the smaller social habits of the high and mighty among us and was asking her mother whether she supposed that the royal children ever carried halfpence in their pockets or descended so low as fourpenny bits I suppose they have pockets like other children said Lily But her mother stopped her suddenly Lily dear I want to say something to you about John Eames Mamma I d sooner talk about the Royal Family just at present But dear you must forgive me if I persist I have thought much about it and I m sure you will not oppose me when I am doing what I think to be my duty No mamma I won t oppose you certainly Since mister Crosbie s conduct was made known to you I have mentioned his name in your hearing very seldom No mamma you have not And I have loved you so dearly for your goodness to me Do not think that I have not understood and known how generous you have been No other mother ever was so good as you have been I have known it all and thought of it every day of my life and thanked you in my heart for your trusting silence Of course I understand your feelings You think him bad and you hate him for what he has done I would not willingly hate any one Lily Ah but you do hate him If I were you I should hate him but I am not you and I love him I pray for his happiness every night and morning and for hers I have forgiven him altogether and I think that he was right When I am old enough to do so without being wrong I will go to him and tell him so I should like to hear of all his doings and all his success if it were only possible How then can you and I talk about him It is impossible You have been silent and I have been silent let us remain silent It is not about mister Crosbie that I wish to speak But I think you ought to understand that conduct such as his will be rebuked by all the world You may forgive him but you should acknowledge Mamma I don t want to acknowledge anything not about him There are things as to which a person cannot argue missus Dale felt that this present matter was one as to which she could not argue Of course mamma continued Lily I don t want to oppose you in anything but I think we had better be silent about this Of course I am thinking only of your future happiness I know you are but pray believe me that you need not be alarmed I do not mean to be unhappy Indeed I think I may say I am not unhappy of course I have been unhappy very unhappy I did think that my heart would break But that has passed away and I believe I can be as happy as my neighbours We re all of us sure to have some troubles as you used to tell us when we were children missus Dale felt that she had begun wrong and that she would have been able to make better progress had she omitted all mention of Crosbie s name She knew exactly what it was that she wished to say what were the arguments which she desired to expound before her daughter but she did not know what language to use or how she might best put her thoughts into words She paused for a while and Lily went on with her work as though the conversation was over But the conversation was not over It was about John Eames and not about mister Crosbie that I wished to speak to you Oh mamma My dear you must not hinder me in doing what I think to be a duty I heard what he said to you and what you replied and of course I cannot but have my mind full of the subject Why should you set yourself against him in so fixed a manner Because I love another man These words she spoke out loud in a steady almost dogged tone with a certain show of audacity as though aware that the declaration was unseemly but resolved that though unseemly it must be made But Lily that love from its very nature must cease or rather such love is not the same as that you felt when you thought that you were to be his wife Yes it is If she died and he came to me in five years time I would still take him I should think myself constrained to take him But she is not dead nor likely to die That makes no difference You don t understand me mamma I think I do and I want you to understand me also I know how difficult is your position I know what your feelings are but I know this also that if you could reason with yourself and bring yourself in time to receive John Eames as a dear friend I did receive him as a dear friend Why not He is a dear friend I love him heartily as you do You know what I mean Yes I do and I tell you it is impossible If you would make the attempt all this misery would soon be forgotten If once you could bring yourself to regard him as a friend who might become your husband all this would be changed and I should see you happy You are strangely anxious to be rid of me mamma Yes Lily to be rid of you in that way If I could see you put your hand in his as his promised wife I think that I should be the happiest woman in the world Mamma I cannot make you happy in that way If you really understood my feelings my doing as you propose would make you very unhappy I should commit a great sin the sin against which women should be more guarded than against any other In my heart I am married to that other man I gave myself to him and loved him and rejoiced in his love When he kissed me I kissed him again and I longed for his kisses I seemed to live only that he might caress me All that time I never felt myself to be wrong because he was all in all to me I was his own That has been changed to my great misfortune but it cannot be undone or forgotten I cannot be the girl I was before he came here There are things that will not have themselves buried and put out of sight as though they had never been I am as you are mamma widowed But you have your daughter and I have my mother If you will be contented so will I Then she got up and threw herself on her mother s neck missus Dale s argument was over now To such an appeal as that last made by Lily no rejoinder on her part was possible After that she was driven to acknowledge to herself that she must be silent Years as they rolled on might make a change but no reasoning could be of avail She embraced her daughter weeping over her whereas Lily s eyes were dry It shall be as you will missus Dale murmured Yes as I will I shall have my own way shall I not That is all I want to be a tyrant over you and make you do my bidding in everything as a well behaved mother should do But I won t be stern in my orderings If you will only be obedient I will be so gracious to you There s Hopkins again I wonder whether he has come to knock us down and trample upon us with another speech Hopkins knew very well to which window he must come as only one of the rooms was at the present time habitable He came up to the dining room and almost flattened his nose against the glass Well Hopkins said Lily here we are missus Dale had turned her face away for she knew that the tears were still on her cheek Yes miss I see you I want to speak to your mamma miss Come round said Lily anxious to spare her mother the necessity of showing herself at once It s too cold to open the window come round and I ll open the door Too cold muttered Hopkins as he went They ll find it a deal colder in lodgings at Guestwick However he went round through the kitchen and Lily met him in the hall Well Hopkins what is it Mamma has got a headache Got a headache has she I won t make her headache no worse It s my opinion that there s nothing for a headache so good as fresh air Only some people can t abear to be blowed upon not for a minute If you don t let down the lights in a greenhouse more or less every day you ll never get any plants never and it s just the same with the grapes Is I to go back and say as how I couldn t see her You can come in if you like only be quiet you know Ain t I ollays quiet miss Did anybody ever hear me rampage If you please ma am the squire s come home What home from Guestwick Has he brought Miss Bell He ain t brought none but hisself cause he come on horseback and it s my belief he s going back almost immediate But he wants you to come to him missus Dale Oh yes I ll come at once He bade me say with his kind love I don t know whether that makes any difference At any rate I ll come Hopkins And I ain t to say nothing about the headache About what said missus Dale No no no said Lily Mamma will be there at once Go and tell my uncle there s a good man and she put up her hand and backed him out of the room I don t believe she s got no headache at all said Hopkins grumbling as he returned through the back premises What lies gentlefolks do tell If I said I d a headache when I ought to be out among the things what would they say to me But a poor man mustn t never lie nor yet drink nor yet do nothing And so he went back with his message What can have brought your uncle home said missus Dale Just to look after the cattle and to see that the pigs are not all dead My wonder is that he should ever have gone away I must go up to him at once Oh yes of course And what shall I say about the house It s not about that at least I think not I don t think he ll speak about that again till you speak to him But if he does You must put your trust in Providence Declare you ve got a bad headache as I told Hopkins just now only you would throw me over by not understanding I ll walk with you down to the bridge So they went off together across the lawn But Lily was soon left alone and continued her walk waiting for her mother s return As she went round and round the gravel paths she thought of the words that she had said to her mother She had declared that she also was widowed And so it should be she said debating the matter with herself What can a heart be worth if it can be transferred hither and thither as circumstances and convenience and comfort may require When he held me here in his arms and as the thoughts ran through her brain she remembered the very spot on which they had stood oh my love she had said to him then as she returned his kisses oh my love my love my love When he held me here in his arms I told myself that it was right because he was my husband He has changed but I have not It might be that I should have ceased to love him and then I should have told him so I should have done as he did But as she came to this she shuddered thinking of the Lady Alexandrina It was very quick she said still speaking to herself very very But then men are not the same as women And she walked on eagerly hardly remembering where she was thinking over it all as she did daily remembering every little thought and word of those few eventful months in which she had learned to regard Crosbie as her husband and master She had declared that she had conquered her unhappiness but there were moments in which she was almost wild with misery Tell me to forget him she said It is the one thing which will never be forgotten At last she heard her mother s step coming down across the squire s garden and she took up her post at the bridge Stand and deliver she said as her mother put her foot upon the plank That is if you ve got anything worth delivering Is anything settled Come up to the house said missus Dale and I ll tell you all CHAPTER LVIII THE FATE OF THE SMALL HOUSE ILLUSTRATION untitled There was something in the tone of missus Dale s voice as she desired her daughter to come up to the house and declared that her budget of news should be opened there which at once silenced Lily s assumed pleasantry Her mother had been away fully two hours during which Lily had still continued her walk round the garden till at last she had become impatient for her mother s footstep Something serious must have been said between her uncle and her mother during those long two hours The interviews to which missus Dale was occasionally summoned at the Great House did not usually exceed twenty minutes and the upshot would be communicated to the girls in a turn or two round the garden but in the present instance missus Dale positively declined to speak till she was seated within the house Did he come over on purpose to see you mamma Yes my dear I believe so He wished to see you too but I asked his permission to postpone that till after I had talked to you To see me mamma About what To kiss you and bid you love him solely for that He has not a word to say to you that will vex you Then I will kiss him and love him too Yes you will when I have told you all I have promised him solemnly to give up all idea of going to Guestwick So that is over Oh oh And we may begin to unpack at once What an episode in one s life We may certainly unpack for I have pledged myself to him and he is to go into Guestwick himself and arrange about the lodgings Does Hopkins know it I should think not yet Nor missus Boyce Mamma I don t believe I shall be able to survive this next week We shall look such fools I ll tell you what we ll do it will be the only comfort I can have we ll go to work and get everything back into its place before Bell comes home so as to surprise her What in two days Why not I ll make Hopkins come and help and then he ll not be so bad I ll begin at once and go to the blankets and beds because I can undo them myself But I haven t half told you all and indeed I don t know how to make you understand what passed between us He is very unhappy about Bernard Bernard has determined to go abroad and may be away for years One can hardly blame a man for following up his profession There was no blaming He only said that it was very sad for him that in his old age he should be left alone This was before there was any talk about our remaining Indeed he seemed determined not to ask that again as a favour I could see that in his eye and I understood it from his tone He went on to speak of you and Bell saying how well he loved you both but that unfortunately his hopes regarding you had not been fulfilled Ah but he shouldn t have had hopes of that sort Listen my dear and I think that you will not feel angry with him He said that he felt his house had never been pleasant to you Then there followed words which I could not repeat even if I could remember them He said much about myself regretting that the feeling between us had not been more kindly But my heart he said has ever been kinder than my words Then I got up from where I was seated and going over to him I told him that we would remain here And what did he say I don t know what he said I know that I was crying and that he kissed me It was the first time in his life I know that he was pleased beyond measure pleased After a while he became animated and talked of doing ever so many things He promised that very painting of which you spoke Ah yes I knew it and Hopkins will be here with the peas before dinner time to morrow and Dingles with his shoulders smothered with rabbits And then missus Boyce Mamma he didn t think of missus Boyce or in very charity of heart he would still have maintained his sadness Then he did not think of her for when I left him he was not at all sad But I haven t told you half yet Dear me mamma was there more than that And I ve told it all wrong for what I ve got to tell now was said before a word was spoken about the house He brought it in just after what he said about Bernard He said that Bernard would of course be his heir Of course he will And that he should think it wrong to encumber the property with any charges for you girls Mamma did any one ever Stop Lily stop and make your heart kinder towards him if you can It is kind only I hate to be told that I m not to have a lot of money as though I had ever shown a desire for it I have never envied Bernard his man servant or his maid servant or his ox or his ass or anything that is his To tell the truth I didn t even wish it to be Bell s because I knew well that there was somebody she would like a great deal better than ever she could like Bernard I shall never get to the end of my story Yes you will mamma if you persevere The long and the short of it is this that he has given Bell three thousand pounds and has given you three thousand also But why me mamma said Lily and the colour of her cheeks became red as she spoke There should if possible be nothing more said about John Eames but whatever might or might not be the necessity of speaking at any rate let there be no mistake But why me mamma Because as he explained to me he thinks it right to do the same by each of you The money is yours at this moment to buy hair pins with if you please I had no idea that he could command so large a sum Three thousand pounds The last money he gave me was half a crown and I thought that he was so stingy I particularly wanted ten shillings I should have liked it so much better now if he had given me a nice new five pound note You d better tell him so No because then he d give me that too But with five pounds I should have the feeling that I might do what I liked with it buy a dressing case and a thing for a squirrel to run round in But nobody ever gives girls money like that so that they can enjoy it Oh Lily you ungrateful child No I deny it I m not ungrateful I m very grateful because his heart was softened and because he cried and kissed you I ll be ever so good to him But how I m to thank him for giving me three thousand pounds I cannot think It s a sort of thing altogether beyond my line of life It sounds like something that s to come to me in another world but which I don t want quite yet I am grateful but with a misty mazy sort of gratitude Can you tell me how soon I shall have a new pair of Balmoral boots because of this money If that were brought home to me I think it would enliven my gratitude The squire as he rode back to Guestwick fell again from that animation which missus Dale had described into his natural sombre mood He thought much of his past life declaring to himself the truth of those words in which he had told his sister in law that his heart had ever been kinder than his words But the world and all those nearest to him in the world had judged him always by his words rather than by his heart They had taken the appearance which he could not command or alter rather than the facts of which he had been the master Had he not been good to all his relations and yet was there one among them that cared for him I m almost sorry that they are going to stay he said to himself I know that I shall disappoint them Yet when he met Bell at the Manor House he accosted her cheerily telling her with much appearance of satisfaction that that flitting into Guestwick was not to be accomplished I am so glad said she It is long since I wished it And I do not think your mother wishes it now I am sure she does not It was all a misunderstanding from the first When some of us could not do all that you wished we thought it better Then Bell paused finding that she would get herself into a mess if she persevered We will not say any more about it said the squire The thing is over and I am very glad that it should be so pleasantly settled I was talking to doctor Crofts yesterday Were you uncle Yes and he is to come and stay with me the day before he is married We have arranged it all And we ll have the breakfast up at the Great House Only you must fix the day I should say some time in May And my dear you ll want to make yourself fine here s a little money for you You are to spend that before your marriage you know Then he shambled away and as soon as he was alone again became sad and despondent He was a man for whom we may predicate some gentle sadness and continued despondency to the end of his life s chapter We left John Eames in the custody of Lady Julia who had overtaken him in the act of erasing Lily s name from the railing which ran across the brook He had been premeditating an escape home to his mother s house in Guestwick and thence back to London without making any further appearance at the Manor House But as soon as he heard Lady Julia s step and saw her figure close upon him he knew that his retreat was cut off from him So he allowed himself to be led away quietly up to the house With Lady Julia herself he openly discussed the whole matter telling her that his hopes were over his happiness gone and his heart half broken Though he would perhaps have cared but little for her congratulations in success he could make himself more amenable to consolation and sympathy from her than from any other inmate in the earl s house I don t know what I shall say to your brother he whispered to her as they approached the side door at which she intended to enter Will you let me break it to him After that he will say a few words to you of course but you need not be afraid of him And mister Dale said Johnny Everybody has heard about it Everybody will know what a fool I have made myself She suggested that the earl should speak to the squire assured him that nobody would think him at all foolish and then left him to make his way up to his own bedroom When there he found a letter from Cradell which had been delivered in his absence but the contents of that letter may best be deferred to the next chapter They were not of a nature to give him comfort or to add to his sorrow About an hour before dinner there was a knock at his door and the earl himself when summoned made his appearance in the room He was dressed in his usual farming attire having been caught by Lady Julia on his first approach to the house and had come away direct to his young friend after having been duly trained in what he ought to say by his kind hearted sister I am not however prepared to declare that he strictly followed his sister s teaching in all that he said upon the occasion Well my boy he began so the young lady has been perverse Yes my lord That is I don t know about being perverse It is all over That s as may be Johnny As far as I know not half of them accept their lovers the first time of asking I shall not ask her again Oh yes you will You don t mean to say you are angry with her for refusing you Not in the least I have no right to be angry I am only angry with myself for being such a fool Lord De Guest I wish I had been dead before I came down here on this errand Now I think of it I know there are so many things which ought to have made me sure how it would be I don t see that at all You come down again let me see it s May now Say you come when the shooting begins in September If we can t get you leave of absence in any other way we ll make old Buffle come too Only by George I believe he d shoot us all But never mind we ll manage that You keep up your spirits till September and then we ll fight the battle in another way The squire shall get up a little party for the bride and my lady Lily must go then You shall meet her so and then we ll shoot over the squire s land We ll bring you together so you see if we don t Lord bless me Refused once My belief is that in these days a girl thinks nothing of a man till she has refused him half a dozen times I don t think Lily is at all like that Look here Johnny I have not a word to say against Miss Lily I like her very much and think her one of the nicest girls I know When she s your wife I ll love her dearly if she ll let me But she s made of the same stuff as other girls and will act in the same way Things have gone a little astray among you and they won t right themselves all in a minute She knows now what your feelings are and she ll go on thinking of it till at last you ll be in her thoughts more than that other fellow Don t tell me about her becoming an old maid because at her time of life she has been so unfortunate as to come across a false hearted man like that It may take a little time but if you ll carry on and not be down hearted you ll find it will all come right in the end Everybody doesn t get all that they want in a minute How I shall quiz you about all this when you have been two or three years married I don t think I shall ever be able to ask her again and I feel sure if I do that her answer will be the same She told me in so many words but never mind I cannot repeat her words I don t want you to repeat them nor yet to heed them beyond their worth Lily Dale is a very pretty girl clever too I believe and good I m sure but her words are not more sacred than those of other men or women What she has said to you now she means no doubt but the minds of men and women are prone to change especially when such changes are conducive to their own happiness At any rate I ll never forget your kindness Lord De Guest And there is one other thing I want to say to you Johnny A man should never allow himself to be cast down by anything not outwardly to the eyes of other men But how is he to help it His pluck should prevent him You were not afraid of a roaring bull nor yet of that man when you thrashed him at the railway station You ve pluck enough of that kind You must now show that you ve that other kind of pluck You know the story of the boy who would not cry though the wolf was gnawing him underneath his frock Most of us have some wolf to gnaw us somewhere but we are generally gnawed beneath our clothes so that the world doesn t see and it behoves us so to bear it that the world shall not suspect The man who goes about declaring himself to be miserable will be not only miserable but contemptible as well But the wolf hasn t gnawed me beneath my clothes everybody knows it Then let those who do know it learn that you are able to bear such wounds without outward complaint I tell you fairly that I cannot sympathize with a lackadaisical lover I know that I have made myself ridiculous to everybody I wish I had never come here I wish you had never seen me Don t say that my dear boy but take my advice for what it is worth And remember what it is that I say with your grief I do sympathize but not with any outward expression of it not with melancholy looks and a sad voice and an unhappy gait A man should always be able to drink his wine and seem to enjoy it If he can t he is so much less of a man than he would be otherwise not so much more as some people seem to think Now get yourself dressed my dear fellow and come down to dinner as though nothing had happened to you As soon as the earl was gone John looked at his watch and saw that it still wanted some forty minutes to dinner Fifteen minutes would suffice for him to dress and therefore there was time sufficient for him to seat himself in his arm chair and think over it all He had for a moment been very angry when his friend had told him that he could not sympathize with a lackadaisical lover It was an ill natured word He felt it to be so when he heard it and so he continued to think during the whole of the half hour that he sat in that chair But it probably did him more good than any word that the earl had ever spoken to him or any other word that he could have used Lackadaisical I m not lackadaisical he said to himself jumping up from his chair and instantly sitting down again I didn t say anything to him I didn t tell him Why did he come to me And yet though he endeavoured to abuse Lord De Guest in his thoughts he knew that Lord De Guest was right and that he was wrong He knew that he had been lackadaisical and was ashamed of himself and at once resolved that he would henceforth demean himself as though no calamity had happened to him I ve a good mind to take him at his word and drink wine till I m drunk Then he strove to get up his courage by a song If she be not fair for me What care I how But I do care What stuff it is a man writing poetry and putting into it such lies as that Everybody knows that he did care that is if he wasn t a heartless beast But nevertheless when the time came for him to go down into the drawing room he did make the effort which his friend had counselled and walked into the room with less of that hang dog look than the earl and Lady Julia had expected They were both there as was also the squire and Bell followed him in less than a minute You haven t seen Crofts to day John have you said the earl No I haven t been anywhere his way His way His ways are every way I take it I wanted him to come and dine but he seemed to think it improper to eat two dinners in the same house two days running Isn t that his theory Miss Dale I m sure I don t know Lord De Guest At any rate it isn t mine So they went to their feast and before his last chance was over John Eames found himself able to go through the pretence of enjoying his roast mutton There can I think be no doubt that in all such calamities as that which he was now suffering the agony of the misfortune is much increased by the conviction that the facts of the case are known to those round about the sufferer A most warm hearted and intensely feeling young gentleman might no doubt eat an excellent dinner after being refused by the girl of his devotions provided that he had reason to believe that none of those in whose company he ate it knew anything of his rejection But the same warm hearted and intensely feeling young gentleman would find it very difficult to go through the ceremony with any appearance of true appetite or gastronomic enjoyment if he were aware that all his convives knew all the facts of his little misfortune Generally we may suppose a man in such condition goes to his club for his dinner or seeks consolation in the shades of some adjacent Richmond or Hampton Court There he meditates on his condition in silence and does ultimately enjoy his little plate of whitebait his cutlet and his moderate pint of sherry He probably goes alone to the theatre and in his stall speculates with a somewhat bitter sarcasm on the vanity of the world Then he returns home sad indeed but with a moderated sadness and as he puffs out the smoke of his cigar at the open window with perhaps the comfort of a little brandy and water at his elbow swears to himself that By Jove he ll have another try for it Alone a man may console himself or among a crowd of unconscious mortals but it must be admitted that the position of John Eames was severe He had been invited down there to woo Lily Dale and the squire and Bell had been asked to be present at the wooing Had it all gone well nothing could have been nicer He would have been the hero of the hour and everybody would have sung for him his song of triumph But everything had not gone well and he found it very difficult to carry himself otherwise than lackadaisically On the whole however his effort was such that the earl gave him credit for his demeanour and told him when parting with him for the night that he was a fine fellow and that everything should go right with him yet And you mustn t be angry with me for speaking harshly to you he said I wasn t a bit angry Yes you were and I rather meant that you should be But you mustn t go away in dudgeon He stayed at the Manor House one day longer and then he returned to his room at the Income tax Office to the disagreeable sound of Sir Raffle s little bell and the much more disagreeable sound of Sir Raffle s big voice CHAPTER LIX JOHN EAMES BECOMES A MAN Eames when he was half way up to London in the railway carriage took out from his pocket a letter and read it During the former portion of his journey he had been thinking of other things but gradually he had resolved that it would be better for him not to think more of those other things for the present and therefore he had recourse to his letter by way of dissipating his thoughts It was from Cradell and ran as follows Income Tax Office May one hundred eighty six MY DEAR JOHN I hope the tidings which I have to give you will not make you angry and that you will not think I am untrue to the great friendship which I have for you because of that which I am now going to tell you There is no man and the word man was underscored there is no man whose regard I value so highly as I do yours and though I feel that you can have no just ground to be displeased with me after all that I have heard you say on many occasions nevertheless in matters of the heart it is very hard for one person to understand the sentiments of another and when the affections of a lady are concerned I know that quarrels will sometimes arise Eames when he had got so far as this on the first perusal of the letter knew well what was to follow Poor Caudle he said to himself he s hooked and he ll never get himself off the hook again But let that be as it may the matter has now gone too far for any alteration to be made by me nor would any mere earthly inducement suffice to change me The claims of friendship are very strong but those of love are paramount Of course I know all that has passed between you and Amelia Roper Much of this I had heard from you before but the rest she has now told me with that pure minded honesty which is the most remarkable feature in her character She has confessed that at one time she felt attached to you and that she was induced by your perseverance to allow you to regard her as your fiancy Fancy girl he probably conceived to be the vulgar English for the elegant term which he used But all that must be over between you now Amelia has promised to be mine this also was underscored and mine I intend that she shall be That you may find in the kind smiles of L D consolation for any disappointment which this may occasion you is the ardent wish of your true friend JOSEPH CRADELL P S Perhaps I had better tell you the whole missus Roper has been in some trouble about her house She is a little in arrears with her rent and some bills have not been paid As she explained that she has been brought into this by those dreadful Lupexes I have consented to take the house into my own hands and have given bills to one or two tradesmen for small amounts Of course she will take them up but it was the credit that was wanting She will carry on the house but I shall in fact be the proprietor I suppose it will not suit you now to remain here but don t you think I might make it comfortable enough for some of our fellows say half a dozen or so That is missus Roper s idea and I certainly think it is not a bad one Our first efforts must be to get rid of the Lupexes Miss Spruce goes next week In the meantime we are all taking our meals up in our own rooms so that there is nothing for the Lupexes to eat But they don t seem to mind that and still keep the sitting room and best bedroom We mean to lock them out after Tuesday and send all their boxes to the public house Poor Cradell Eames as he threw himself back upon his seat and contemplated the depth of misfortune into which his friend had fallen began to be almost in love with his own position He himself was no doubt a very miserable fellow There was only one thing in life worth living for and that he could not get He had been thinking for the last three days of throwing himself before a locomotive steam engine and was not quite sure that he would not do it yet but nevertheless his place was a place among the gods as compared to that which poor Cradell had selected for himself To be not only the husband of Amelia Roper but to have been driven to take upon himself as his bride s fortune the whole of his future mother in law s debts To find himself the owner of a very indifferent lodging house the owner as regarded all responsibility though not the owner as regarded any possible profit And then above and almost worse than all the rest to find himself saddled with the Lupexes in the beginning of his career Poor Cradell indeed Eames had not taken his things away from the lodging house before he left London and therefore determined to drive to Burton Crescent immediately on his arrival not with the intention of remaining there even for a night but that he might bid them farewell speak his congratulations to Amelia and arrange for his final settlement with missus Roper It should have been explained in the last chapter that the earl had told him before parting with him that his want of success with Lily would make no difference as regarded money John had of course expostulated saying that he did not want anything and would not under his existing circumstances accept anything but the earl was a man who knew how to have his own way and in this matter did have it Our friend therefore was a man of wealth when he returned to London and could tell missus Roper that he would send her a cheque for her little balance as soon as he reached his office He arrived in the middle of the day not timing his return at all after the usual manner of Government clerks who generally manage to reach the metropolis not more than half an hour before the moment at which they are bound to show themselves in their seats But he had come back two days before he was due and had run away from the country as though London in May to him were much pleasanter than the woods and fields But neither had London nor the woods and fields any influence on his return He had gone down that he might throw himself at the feet of Lily Dale gone down as he now confessed to himself with hopes almost triumphant and he had returned because Lily Dale would not have him at her feet I loved him him Crosbie better than all the world besides It is still the same I still love him better than all the world Those were the words which had driven him back to London and having been sent away with such words as those it was little matter to him whether he reached his office a day or two sooner or later The little room in the city even with the accompaniment of Sir Raffle s bell and Sir Raffle s voice would be now more congenial to him than Lady Julia s drawing room He would therefore present himself to Sir Raffle on that very afternoon and expel some interloper from his seat But he would first call in Burton Crescent and say farewell to the Ropers The door was opened for him by the faithful Jemima mister Heames mister Heames ho dear ho dear and the poor girl who had always taken his side in the adventures of the lodging house raised her hands on high and lamented the fate which had separated her favourite from its fortunes I suppose you knows it all Mister Johnny Mister Johnny said that he believed he did know it all and asked for the mistress of the house Yes sure enough she s at home She don t dare stir out much cause of them Lupexes Ain t this a pretty game No dinner and no nothink Them boxes is Miss Spruce s She s agoing now this minute You ll find em all upstairs in the drawen room So upstairs into the drawing room he went and there he found the mother and daughter and with them Miss Spruce tightly packed up in her bonnet and shawl Don t mother Amelia was saying what s the good of going on in that way If she chooses to go let her go But she s been with me now so many years said missus Roper sobbing and I ve always done everything for her Haven t I now Sally Spruce It struck Eames immediately that though he had been an inmate in the house for two years he had never before heard that maiden lady s Christian name Miss Spruce was the first to see Eames as he entered the room It is probable that missus Roper s pathos might have produced some answering pathos on her part had she remained unobserved but the sight of a young man brought her back to her usual state of quiescence I m only an old woman said she and here s mister Eames come back again How d ye do missus Roper how d ye do Amelia how d ye do Miss Spruce and he shook hands with them all Oh laws said missus Roper you have given me such a start Dear me mister Eames only think of your coming back in that way said Amelia Well what way should I come back You didn t hear me knock at the door that s all So Miss Spruce is really going to leave you Isn t it dreadful mister Eames Nineteen years we ve been together taking both houses together Miss Spruce we have indeed Miss Spruce at this point struggled very hard to convince John Eames that the period in question had in truth extended over only eighteen years but missus Roper was authoritative and would not permit it It s nineteen years if it s a day No one ought to know dates if I don t and there isn t one in the world understands her ways unless it s me Haven t I been up to your bedroom every night and with my own hand given you But she stopped herself and was too good a woman to declare before a young man what had been the nature of her nightly ministrations to her guest I don t think you ll be so comfortable anywhere else Miss Spruce said Eames Comfortable of course she won t said Amelia But if I was mother I wouldn t have any more words about it It isn t the money I m thinking of but the feeling of it said missus Roper The house will be so lonely like I shan t know myself that I shan t And now that things are all settled so pleasantly and that the Lupexes must go on Tuesday I ll tell you what Sally I ll pay for the cab myself and I ll start off to Dulwich by the omnibus to morrow and settle it all out of my own pocket I will indeed Come there s the cab Let me go down and send him away I ll do that said Eames It s only sixpence off the stand missus Roper called to him as he left the room But the cabman got a shilling and John as he returned found Jemima in the act of carrying Miss Spruce s boxes back to her room So much the better for poor Caudle said he to himself As he has gone into the trade it s well that he should have somebody that will pay him missus Roper followed Miss Spruce up the stairs and Johnny was left with Amelia He s written to you I know said she with her face turned a little away from him She was certainly very handsome but there was a hard cross almost sullen look about her which robbed her countenance of all its pleasantness And yet she had no intention of being sullen with him Yes said John He has told me how it s all going to be Well she said Well said he Is that all you ve got to say I ll congratulate you if you ll let me Psha congratulations I hate such humbug If you ve no feelings about it I m sure that I ve none Indeed I don t know what s the good of feelings They never did me any good Are you engaged to marry L D No I am not And you ve nothing else to say to me Nothing except my hopes for your happiness What else can I say You are engaged to marry my friend Cradell and I think it will be a happy match She turned away her face further from him and the look of it became even more sullen Could it be possible that at such a moment she still had a hope that he might come back to her Good by Amelia he said putting out his hand to her And this is to be the last of you in this house Well I don t know about that I ll come and call upon you if you ll let me when you re married Yes she said that there may be rows in the house and noise and jealousy as there have been with that wicked woman upstairs Not if I know it you won t John Eames I wish I d never seen you I wish we might have both fallen dead when we first met I didn t think ever to have cared for a man as I have cared for you It s all trash and nonsense and foolery I know that It s all very well for young ladies as can sit in drawing rooms all their lives but when a woman has her way to make in the world it s all foolery And such a hard way too to make as mine is But it won t be hard now Won t it But I think it will I wish you would try it Not that I m going to complain I never minded work and as for company I can put up with anybody The world s not to be all dancing and fiddling for the likes of me I know that well enough But and then she paused What s the but about Amelia It s like you to ask me isn t it To tell the truth he should not have asked her Never mind I m not going to have any words with you If you ve been a knave I ve been a fool and that s worse But I don t think I have been a knave I ve been both said the girl and both for nothing After that you may go I ve told you what I am and I ll leave you to name yourself I didn t think it was in me to have been such a fool It s that that frets me Never mind sir it s all over now and I wish you good by I do not think that there was the slightest reason why John should have again kissed her at parting but he did so She bore it not struggling with him but she took his caress with sullen endurance It ll be the last she said Good by John Eames Good by Amelia Try to make him a good wife and then you ll be happy She turned up her nose at this assuming a look of unutterable scorn But she said nothing further and then he left the room At the parlour door he met missus Roper and had his parting words with her I am so glad you came said she It was just that word you said that made Miss Spruce stay Her money is so ready you know And so you ve had it all out with her about Cradell She ll make him a good wife she will indeed much better than you ve been giving her credit for I don t doubt she ll be a very good wife You see mister Eames it s all over now and we understand each other don t we It made me very unhappy when she was setting her cap at you it did indeed She is my own daughter and I couldn t go against her could I But I knew it wasn t in any way suiting Laws I know the difference She s good enough for him any day of the week mister Eames That she is Saturdays or Sundays said Johnny not knowing exactly what he ought to say So she is and if he does his duty by her she won t go astray in hers by him And as for you mister Eames I am sure I ve always felt it an honour and a pleasure to have you in the house and if ever you could use a good word in sending to me any of your young men I d do by them as a mother should I would indeed I know I ve been to blame about those Lupexes but haven t I suffered for it mister Eames And it was difficult to know at first wasn t it And as to you and Amelia if you would send any of your young men to try there couldn t be anything more of that kind could there I know it hasn t all been just as it should have been that is as regards you but I should like to hear you say that you ve found me honest before you went I have tried to be honest I have indeed Eames assured her that he was convinced of her honesty and that he had never thought of impugning her character either in regard to those unfortunate people the Lupexes or in reference to other matters He did not think he said that any young men would consult him as to their lodgings but if he could be of any service to her he would Then he bade her good by and having bestowed half a sovereign on the faithful Jemima he took a long farewell of Burton Crescent Amelia had told him not to come and see her when she should be married and he had resolved that he would take her at her word So he walked off from the Crescent not exactly shaking the dust from his feet but resolving that he would know no more either of its dust or of its dirt Dirt enough he had encountered there certainly and he was now old enough to feel that the inmates of missus Roper s house had not been those among whom a resting place for his early years should judiciously have been sought But he had come out of the fire comparatively unharmed and I regret to say that he felt but little for the terrible scorchings to which his friend had been subjected and was about to subject himself He was quite content to look at the matter exactly as it was looked at by missus Roper Amelia was good enough for Joseph Cradell any day of the week Poor Cradell of whom in these pages after this notice no more will be heard I cannot but think that a hard measure of justice was meted out to him in proportion to the extent of his sins More weak and foolish than our friend and hero he had been but not to my knowledge more wicked But it is to the vain and foolish that the punishments fall and to them they fall so thickly and constantly that the thinker is driven to think that vanity and folly are of all sins those which may be the least forgiven As for Cradell I may declare that he did marry Amelia that he did with some pride take the place of master of the house at the bottom of missus Roper s table and that he did make himself responsible for all missus Roper s debts Of his future fortunes there is not space to speak in these pages Going away from the Crescent Eames had himself driven to his office which he reached just as the men were leaving it at four o clock Cradell was gone so that he did not see him on that afternoon but he had an opportunity of shaking hands with mister Love who treated him with all the smiling courtesy due to an official bigwig for a private secretary if not absolutely a big wig is semi big and entitled to a certain amount of reverence and he passed mister Kissing in the passage hurrying along as usual with a huge book under his arm mister Kissing hurried as he was stopped his shuffling feet but Eames only looked at him hardly honouring him with the acknowledgment of a nod of his head mister Kissing however was not offended he knew that the private secretary of the First Commissioner had been the guest of an earl and what more than a nod could be expected from him After that John made his way into the august presence of Sir Raffle and found that great man putting on his shoes in the presence of FitzHoward FitzHoward blushed but the shoes had not been touched by him as he took occasion afterwards to inform John Eames Sir Raffle was all smiles and civility Delighted to see you back Eames am upon my word though I and FitzHoward have got on capitally in your absence haven t we FitzHoward Oh yes drawled FitzHoward I haven t minded it for a time just while Eames has been away You re much too idle to keep at it I know but your bread will be buttered for you elsewhere so it doesn t signify My compliments to the duchess when you see her Then FitzHoward went And how s my dear old friend asked Sir Raffle as though of all men living Lord De Guest were the one for whom he had the strongest and the oldest love And yet he must have known that John Eames knew as much about it as he did himself But there are men who have the most lively gratification in calling lords and marquises their friends though they know that nobody believes a word of what they say even though they know how great is the odium they incur and how lasting is the ridicule which their vanity produces It is a gentle insanity which prevails in the outer courts of every aristocracy and as it brings with itself considerable annoyance and but a lukewarm pleasure it should not be treated with too keen a severity And how s my dear old friend Eames assured him that his dear old friend was all right that Lady Julia was all right that the dear old place was all right Sir Raffle now spoke as though the dear old place were quite well known to him Was the game doing pretty well Was there a promise of birds Sir Raffle s anxiety was quite intense and expressed with almost familiar affection And by the by Eames where are you living at present Well I m not settled I m at the Great Western Railway Hotel at this moment Capital house very only it s expensive if you stay there the whole season Johnny had no idea of remaining there beyond one night but he said nothing as to this By the by you might as well come and dine with us to morrow Lady Buffle is most anxious to know you There ll be one or two with us I did ask my friend Dumbello but there s some nonsense going on in the House and he thinks that he can t get away Johnny was more gracious than Lord Dumbello and accepted the invitation I wonder what Lady Buffle will be like he said to himself as he walked away from the office He had turned into the Great Western Hotel not as yet knowing where to look for a home and there we will leave him eating his solitary mutton chop at one of those tables which are so comfortable to the eye but which are so comfortless in reality I speak not now with reference to the excellent establishment which has been named but to the nature of such tables in general A solitary mutton chop in an hotel coffee room is not a banquet to be envied by any god and if the mutton chop be converted into soup fish little dishes big dishes and the rest the matter becomes worse and not better What comfort are you to have seated alone on that horsehair chair staring into the room and watching the waiters as they whisk about their towels No one but an Englishman has ever yet thought of subjecting himself to such a position as that But here we will leave John Eames and in doing so I must be allowed to declare that only now at this moment has he entered on his manhood Hitherto he has been a hobbledehoy a calf as it were who had carried his calfishness later into life than is common with calves but who did not perhaps on that account give promise of making a worse ox than the rest of them His life hitherto as recorded in these pages had afforded him no brilliant success had hardly qualified him for the role of hero which he has been made to play I feel that I have been in fault in giving such prominence to a hobbledehoy and that I should have told my story better had I brought mister Crosbie more conspicuously forward on my canvas He at any rate has gotten to himself a wife as a hero always should do whereas I must leave my poor friend Johnny without any matrimonial prospects It was thus that he thought of himself as he sat moping over his solitary table in the hotel coffee room He acknowledged to himself that he had not hitherto been a man but at the same time he made some resolution which I trust may assist him in commencing his manhood from this date CHAPTER LX CONCLUSION It was early in June that Lily went up to her uncle at the Great House pleading for Hopkins pleading that to Hopkins might be restored all the privileges of head gardener at the Great House There was some absurdity in this seeing that he had never really relinquished his privileges but the manner of the quarrel had been in this wise There was in those days and had been for years a vexed question between Hopkins and Jolliffe the bailiff on the matter of stable manure Hopkins had pretended to the right of taking what he required from the farmyard without asking leave of any one Jolliffe in return had hinted that if this were so Hopkins would take it all But I can t eat it Hopkins had said Jolliffe merely grunted signifying by the grunt as Hopkins thought that though a gardener couldn t eat a mountain of manure fifty feet long and fifteen high couldn t eat in the body he might convert it into things edible for his own personal use And so there had been a great feud The unfortunate squire had of course been called on to arbitrate and having postponed his decision by every contrivance possible to him had at last been driven by Jolliffe to declare that Hopkins should take nothing that was not assigned to him Hopkins when the decision was made known to him by his master bit his old lips and turned round upon his old heel speechless You ll find it s so at all other places said the squire apologetically Other places sneered Hopkins Where would he find other gardeners like himself It is hardly necessary to declare that from that moment he resolved that he would abide by no such order Jolliffe on the next morning informed the squire that the order had been broken and the squire fretted and fumed wishing that Jolliffe were well buried under the mountain in question If they all is to do as they like said Jolliffe then nobody won t care for nobody The squire understood that an order if given must be obeyed and therefore with many inner groanings of the spirit resolved that war must be waged against Hopkins On the following morning he found the old man himself wheeling a huge barrow of manure round from the yard into the kitchen garden Now on ordinary occasions Hopkins was not required to do with his own hands work of that description He had a man under him who hewed wood and carried water and wheeled barrows one man always and often two The squire knew when he saw him that he was sinning and bade him stop upon his road Hopkins he said why didn t you ask for what you wanted before you took it The old man put down the barrow on the ground looked up in his master s face spat into his hands and then again resumed his barrow Hopkins that won t do said the squire Stop where you are What won t do said Hopkins still holding the barrow from the ground but not as yet progressing Put it down Hopkins and Hopkins did put it down Don t you know that you are flatly disobeying my orders Squire I ve been here about this place going on nigh seventy years If you ve been going on a hundred and seventy it wouldn t do that there should be more than one master I m the master here and I intend to be so to the end Take that manure back into the yard Back into the yard said Hopkins very slowly Yes back into the yard What afore all their faces Yes you ve disobeyed me before all their faces Hopkins paused a moment looking away from the squire and shaking his head as though he had need of deep thought but by the aid of deep thought had come at last to a right conclusion Then he resumed the barrow and putting himself almost into a trot carried away his prize into the kitchen garden At the pace which he went it would have been beyond the squire s power to stop him nor would mister Dale have wished to come to a personal encounter with his servant But he called after the man in dire wrath that if he were not obeyed the disobedient servant should rue the consequences for ever Hopkins equal to the occasion shook his head as he trotted on deposited his load at the foot of the cucumber frames and then at once returning to his master tendered to him the key of the greenhouse Master said Hopkins speaking as best he could with his scanty breath there it is there s the key of course I don t want no warning and doesn t care about my week s wages I ll be out of the cottage afore night and as for the work us I suppose they ll let me in at once if your honour ll give em a line Now as Hopkins was well known by the squire to be the owner of three or four hundred pounds the hint about the workhouse must be allowed to have been melodramatic Don t be a fool said the squire almost gnashing his teeth I know I ve been a fool said Hopkins about that ere doong my feelings has been too much for me When a man s feelings has been too much for him he d better just take hisself off and lie in the work us till he dies And then he again tendered the key But the squire did not take the key and so Hopkins went on I s pose I d better just see to the lights and the like of that till you ve suited yourself mister Dale It ud be a pity all them grapes should go off and they as you may say all one as fit for the table It s a long way the best crop I ever see on em I ve been that careful with em that I haven t had a natural night s rest not since February There ain t nobody about this place as understands grapes nor yet anywhere nigh that could be got at My lord s head man is wery ignorant but even if he knew ever so of course he couldn t come here I suppose I d better keep the key till you re suited mister Dale Then for a fortnight there was an interregnum in the gardens terrible in the annals of Allington Hopkins lived in his cottage indeed and looked most sedulously after the grapes In looking after the grapes too he took the greenhouses under his care but he would have nothing to do with the outer gardens took no wages returning the amount sent to him back to the squire and insisted with everybody that he had been dismissed He went about with some terrible horticultural implement always in his hand with which it was said that he intended to attack Jolliffe but Jolliffe prudently kept out of his way As soon as it had been resolved by missus Dale and Lily that the flitting from the Small House at Allington was not to be accomplished Lily communicated the fact to Hopkins Miss said he when I said them few words to you and your mamma I knew that you would listen to reason This was no more than Lily had expected that Hopkins should claim the honour of having prevailed by his arguments was a matter of course Yes said Lily we ve made up our minds to stay Uncle wishes it Wishes it Laws miss it ain t only wishes And we all wishes it Why now look at the reason of the thing Here s this here house But Hopkins it s decided We re going to stay What I want to know is this can you come at once and help me to unpack What this very evening as is Yes now we want to have the things about again before they come back from Guestwick Hopkins scratched his head and hesitated not wishing to yield to any proposition that could be considered as childish but he gave way at last feeling that the work itself was a good work missus Dale also assented laughing at Lily for her folly as she did so and in this way the things were unpacked very quickly and the alliance between Lily and Hopkins became for the time very close This work of unpacking and resettling was not yet over when the battle of the manure broke out and therefore it was that Hopkins when his feelings had become altogether too much for him about the doong came at last to Lily and laying down at her feet all the weight and all the glory of his sixty odd years of life implored her to make matters straight for him It s been a killing me miss so it has to see the way they ve been a cutting that sparagus It ain t cutting at all It s just hocking it up what is fit and what isn t all together And they ve been a putting the plants in where I didn t mean em though they know d I didn t mean em I ve stood by miss and said never a word I d a died sooner But Miss Lily what my sufferings have been cause of my feelings getting the better of me about that you know miss nobody will ever tell nobody nobody nobody Then Hopkins turned away and wept Uncle said Lily creeping close up against his chair I want to ask you a great favour A great favour Well I don t think I shall refuse you anything at present It isn t to ask another earl to the house is it Another earl said Lily Yes haven t you heard Miss Bell has been here this morning insisting that I should have over Lord De Guest and his sister for the marriage It seems that there was some scheming between Bell and Lady Julia Of course you ll ask them Of course I must I ve no way out of it It ll be all very well for Bell who ll be off to Wales with her lover but what am I to do with the earl and Lady Julia when they re gone Will you come and help me In answer to this Lily of course promised that she would come and help Indeed said she I thought we were all asked up for the day And now for my favour Uncle you must forgive poor Hopkins Forgive a fiddlestick said the squire No but you must You can t think how unhappy he is How can I forgive a man who won t forgive me He goes prowling about the place doing nothing and he sends me back his wages and he looks as though he were going to murder some one and all because he wouldn t do as he was told How am I to forgive such a man as that But uncle why not It would be his forgiving me He knows very well that he may come back whenever he pleases and indeed for the matter of that he has never gone away But he is so very unhappy What can I do to make him happier Just go down to his cottage and tell him that you forgive him Then he ll argue with me No I don t think he will He is too much down in the world for arguing now Ah you don t know him as I do All the misfortunes in the world wouldn t stop that man s conceit Of course I ll go if you ask me but it seems to me that I m made to knock under to everybody I hear a great deal about other people s feelings but I don t know that mine are very much thought of He was not altogether in a happy mood and Lily almost regretted that she had persevered but she did succeed in carrying him off across the garden to the cottage and as they went together she promised him that she would think of him always always The scene with Hopkins cannot be described now as it would take too many of our few remaining pages It resulted I am afraid I must confess in nothing more triumphant to the squire than a treaty of mutual forgiveness Hopkins acknowledged with much self reproach that his feelings had been too many for him but then look at his provocation He could not keep his tongue from that matter and certainly said as much in his own defence as he did in confession of his sins The substantial triumph was altogether his for nobody again ever dared to interfere with his operations in the farmyard He showed his submission to his master mainly by consenting to receive his wages for the two weeks which he had passed in idleness Owing to this little accident Lily was not so much oppressed by Hopkins as she had expected to be in that matter of their altered plans but this salvation did not extend to missus Hearn to missus Crump or above all to missus Boyce They all of them took an interest more or less strong in the Hopkins controversy but their interest in the occupation of the Small House was much stronger and it was found useless to put missus Hearn off with the gardener s persistent refusal of his wages when she was big with inquiry whether the house was to be painted inside as well as out Ah said she I think I ll go and look at lodgings at Guestwick myself and pack up some of my beds Lily made no answer to this feeling that it was a part of that punishment which she had expected Dear dear said missus Crump to the two girls well to be sure we should a been lone without ee and mayhap we might a got worse in your place but why did ee go and fasten up all your things in them big boxes just to unfasten em all again We changed our minds missus Crump said Bell with some severity Yees I know ye changed your mindses Well it s all right for loiks o ye no doubt but if we changes our mindses we hears of it So it seems do we said Lily But never mind missus Crump Do you send us our letters up early and then we won t quarrel Oh letters Drat them for letters I wish there weren t no sich things There was a man here yesterday with his imperence I don t know where he come from down from Lun on I b leeve and this was wrong and that was wrong and everything was wrong and then he said he d have me discharged the sarvice Dear me missus Crump that wouldn t do at all Discharged the sarvice Tuppence farden a day So I told un to discharge hisself and take all the old bundles and things away upon his shoulders Letters indeed What business have they with post missusses if they cannot pay em better nor tuppence farden a day And in this way under the shelter of missus Crump s storm of wrath against the inspector who had visited her Lily and Bell escaped much that would have fallen upon their own heads but missus Boyce still remained I may here add in order that missus Crump s history may be carried on to the farthest possible point that she was not discharged the sarvice and that she still receives her twopence farthing a day from the Crown That s a bitter old lady said the inspector to the man who was driving him Yes sir they all says the same about she There ain t none of em get much change out of missus Crump Bell and Lily went together also to missus Boyce s If she makes herself very disagreeable I shall insist upon talking of your marriage said Lily I ve not the slightest objection said Bell only I don t know what there can be to say about it Marrying the doctor is such a very commonplace sort of thing Not a bit more commonplace than marrying the parson said Lily Oh yes it is Parsons marriages are often very grand affairs They come in among county people That s their luck in life Doctors never do nor lawyers I don t think lawyers ever get married in the country They re supposed to do it up in London But a country doctor s wedding is not a thing to be talked about much missus Boyce probably agreed in this view of the matter seeing that she did not choose the coming marriage as her first subject of conversation As soon as the two girls were seated she flew away immediately to the house and began to express her very great surprise her surprise and her joy also at the sudden change which had been made in their plans It is so much nicer you know said she that things should be pleasant among relatives Things always have been tolerably pleasant with us said Bell Oh yes I m sure of that I ve always said it was quite a pleasure to see you and your uncle together And when we heard about your all having to leave But we didn t have to leave missus Boyce We were going to leave because we thought mamma would be more comfortable in Guestwick and now we re not going to leave because we ve all changed our mindses as missus Crump calls it And is it true the house is going to be painted asked missus Boyce I believe it is true said Lily Inside and out It must be done some day said Bell Yes to be sure but I must say it is generous of the squire There s such a deal of wood work about your house I know I wish the Ecclesiastical Commissioners would paint ours but nobody ever does anything for the clergy I m sure I m delighted you re going to stay As I said to mister Boyce what should we ever have done without you I believe the squire had made up his mind that he would not let the place I don t think he ever has let it And if there was nobody in it it would all go to rack and ruin wouldn t it Had your mamma to pay anything for the lodgings she engaged at Guestwick Upon my word I don t know Bell can tell you better about that than I as doctor Crofts settled it I suppose doctor Crofts tells her everything And so the conversation was changed and missus Boyce was made to understand that whatever further mystery there might be it would not be unravelled on that occasion It was settled that doctor Crofts and Bell should be married about the middle of June and the squire determined to give what grace he could to the ceremony by opening his own house on the occasion Lord De Guest and Lady Julia were invited by special arrangement between her ladyship and Bell as has been before explained The colonel also with Lady Fanny came up from Torquay on the occasion this being the first visit made by the colonel to his paternal roof for many years Bernard did not accompany his father He had not yet gone abroad but there were circumstances which made him feel that he would not find himself comfortable at the wedding The service was performed by mister Boyce assisted as the County Chronicle very fully remarked by the Reverend John Joseph Jones M A late of Jesus College Cambridge and curate of saint Peter s Northgate Guestwick the fault of which little advertisement was this that as none of the readers of the paper had patience to get beyond the Reverend John Joseph Jones the fact of Bell s marriage with doctor Crofts was not disseminated as widely as might have been wished The marriage went off very nicely The squire was upon his very best behaviour and welcomed his guests as though he really enjoyed their presence there in his halls Hopkins who was quite aware that he had been triumphant decorated the old rooms with mingled flowers and greenery with an assiduous care which pleased the two girls mightily And during this work of wreathing and decking there was one little morsel of feeling displayed which may as well be told in these last lines Lily had been encouraging the old man while Bell for a moment had been absent I wish it had been for thee my darling he said I wish it had been for thee It is much better as it is Hopkins she answered solemnly Not with him though he went on not with him I wouldn t a hung a bough for him But with t other one Lily said no word further She knew that the man was expressing the wishes of all around her She said no word further and then Bell returned to them But no one at the wedding was so gay as Lily so gay so bright and so wedding like She flirted with the old earl till he declared that he would marry her himself No one seeing her that evening and knowing nothing of her immediate history would have imagined that she herself had been cruelly jilted some six or eight months ago And those who did know her could not imagine that what she then suffered had hit her so hard that no recovery seemed possible for her But though no recovery as she herself believed was possible for her though she was as a man whose right arm had been taken from him in the battle still all the world had not gone with that right arm The bullet which had maimed her sorely had not touched her life and she scorned to go about the world complaining either by word or look of the injury she had received Wives when they have lost their husbands still eat and laugh she said to herself and he is not dead like that So she resolved that she would be happy and I here declare that she not only seemed to carry out her resolution but that she did carry it out in very truth You re a dear good man and I know you ll be good to her she said to Crofts just as he was about to start with his bride I ll try at any rate he answered And I shall expect you to be good to me too Remember you have married the whole family and sir you mustn t believe a word of what that bad man says in his novels about mothers in law He has done a great deal of harm and shut half the ladies in England out of their daughters houses He shan t shut missus Dale out of mine Remember he doesn t Now good by So the bride and bridegroom went off and Lily was left to flirt with Lord De Guest Of whom else is it necessary that a word or two should be said before I allow the weary pen to fall from my hand The squire after much inward struggling on the subject had acknowledged to himself that his sister in law had not received from him that kindness which she had deserved He had acknowledged this purporting to do his best to amend his past errors and I think I may say that his efforts in that line would not be received ungraciously by missus Dale I am inclined therefore to think that life at Allington both at the Great House and at the Small would soon become pleasanter than it used to be in former days Lily soon got the Balmoral boots or at least soon learned that the power of getting them as she pleased had devolved upon her from her uncle s gift so that she talked even of buying the squirrel s cage but I am not aware that her extravagance led her as far as that Lord De Courcy we left suffering dreadfully from gout and ill temper at Courcy Castle Yes indeed To him in his latter days life did not seem to offer much that was comfortable His wife had now gone from him and declared positively to her son in law that no earthly consideration should ever induce her to go back again not if I were to starve she said By which she intended to signify that she would be firm in her resolve even though she should thereby lose her carriage and horses Poor mister Gazebee went down to Courcy and had a dreadful interview with the earl but matters were at last arranged and her ladyship remained at Baden Baden in a state of semi starvation That is to say she had but one horse to her carriage As regards Crosbie I am inclined to believe that he did again recover his power at his office He was mister Butterwell s master and the master also of mister Optimist and the major He knew his business and could do it which was more perhaps than might fairly be said of any of the other three Under such circumstances he was sure to get in his hand and lead again But elsewhere his star did not recover its ascendancy He dined at his club almost daily and there were those with whom he habitually formed some little circle But he was not the Crosbie of former days the Crosbie known in Belgravia and in saint James s Street He had taken his little vessel bravely out into the deep waters and had sailed her well while fortune stuck close to him But he had forgotten his nautical rules and success had made him idle His plummet and lead had not been used and he had kept no look out ahead Therefore the first rock he met shivered his bark to pieces His wife the Lady Alexandrina is to be seen in the one horse carriage with her mother at Baden Baden END OF THE PROJECT
