by Eve Sobol THE LONGEST JOURNEY By E M Forster PART one CAMBRIDGE I The cow is there said Ansell lighting a match and holding it out over the carpet No one spoke He waited till the end of the match fell off Then he said again She is there the cow There now You have not proved it said a voice I have proved it to myself I have proved to myself that she isn t said the voice The cow is not there Ansell frowned and lit another match She s there for me he declared I don t care whether she s there for you or not Whether I m in Cambridge or Iceland or dead the cow will be there It was philosophy They were discussing the existence of objects Do they exist only when there is some one to look at them Or have they a real existence of their own It is all very interesting but at the same time it is difficult Hence the cow She seemed to make things easier She was so familiar so solid that surely the truths that she illustrated would in time become familiar and solid also Is the cow there or not This was better than deciding between objectivity and subjectivity So at Oxford just at the same time one was asking What do our rooms look like in the vac Look here Ansell I m there in the meadow the cow s there You re there the cow s there Do you agree so far Well Well if you go the cow stops but if I go the cow goes Then what will happen if you stop and I go Several voices cried out that this was quibbling I know it is said the speaker brightly and silence descended again while they tried honestly to think the matter out Rickie on whose carpet the matches were being dropped did not like to join in the discussion It was too difficult for him He could not even quibble If he spoke he should simply make himself a fool He preferred to listen and to watch the tobacco smoke stealing out past the window seat into the tranquil October air He could see the court too and the college cat teasing the college tortoise and the kitchen men with supper trays upon their heads Hot food for one that must be for the geographical don who never came in for Hall cold food for three apparently at half a crown a head for some one he did not know hot food a la carte obviously for the ladies haunting the next staircase cold food for two at two shillings going to Ansell s rooms for himself and Ansell and as it passed under the lamp he saw that it was meringues again Then the bedmakers began to arrive chatting to each other pleasantly and he could hear Ansell s bedmaker say Oh dang when she found she had to lay Ansell s tablecloth for there was not a breath stirring The great elms were motionless and seemed still in the glory of midsummer for the darkness hid the yellow blotches on their leaves and their outlines were still rounded against the tender sky Those elms were Dryads so Rickie believed or pretended and the line between the two is subtler than we admit At all events they were lady trees and had for generations fooled the college statutes by their residence in the haunts of youth But what about the cow He returned to her with a start for this would never do He also would try to think the matter out Was she there or not The cow There or not He strained his eyes into the night Either way it was attractive If she was there other cows were there too The darkness of Europe was dotted with them and in the far East their flanks were shining in the rising sun Great herds of them stood browsing in pastures where no man came nor need ever come or plashed knee deep by the brink of impassable rivers And this moreover was the view of Ansell Yet Tilliard s view had a good deal in it One might do worse than follow Tilliard and suppose the cow not to be there unless oneself was there to see her A cowless world then stretched round him on every side Yet he had only to peep into a field and click it would at once become radiant with bovine life Suddenly he realized that this again would never do As usual he had missed the whole point and was overlaying philosophy with gross and senseless details For if the cow was not there the world and the fields were not there either And what would Ansell care about sunlit flanks or impassable streams Rickie rebuked his own groveling soul and turned his eyes away from the night which had led him to such absurd conclusions The fire was dancing and the shadow of Ansell who stood close up to it seemed to dominate the little room He was still talking or rather jerking and he was still lighting matches and dropping their ends upon the carpet Now and then he would make a motion with his feet as if he were running quickly backward upstairs and would tread on the edge of the fender so that the fire irons went flying and the buttered bun dishes crashed against each other in the hearth The other philosophers were crouched in odd shapes on the sofa and table and chairs and one who was a little bored had crawled to the piano and was timidly trying the Prelude to Rhinegold with his knee upon the soft pedal The air was heavy with good tobacco smoke and the pleasant warmth of tea and as Rickie became more sleepy the events of the day seemed to float one by one before his acquiescent eyes In the morning he had read Theocritus whom he believed to be the greatest of Greek poets he had lunched with a merry don and had tasted Zwieback biscuits then he had walked with people he liked and had walked just long enough and now his room was full of other people whom he liked and when they left he would go and have supper with Ansell whom he liked as well as any one A year ago he had known none of these joys He had crept cold and friendless and ignorant out of a great public school preparing for a silent and solitary journey and praying as a highest favour that he might be left alone Cambridge had not answered his prayer She had taken and soothed him and warmed him and had laughed at him a little saying that he must not be so tragic yet awhile for his boyhood had been but a dusty corridor that led to the spacious halls of youth In one year he had made many friends and learnt much and he might learn even more if he could but concentrate his attention on that cow The fire had died down and in the gloom the man by the piano ventured to ask what would happen if an objective cow had a subjective calf Ansell gave an angry sigh and at that moment there was a tap on the door Come in said Rickie The door opened A tall young woman stood framed in the light that fell from the passage Ladies whispered every one in great agitation Yes he said nervously limping towards the door he was rather lame Yes Please come in Can I be any good Wicked boy exclaimed the young lady advancing a gloved finger into the room Wicked wicked boy He clasped his head with his hands Agnes Oh how perfectly awful Wicked intolerable boy She turned on the electric light The philosophers were revealed with unpleasing suddenness My goodness a tea party Oh really Rickie you are too bad I say again wicked abominable intolerable boy I ll have you horsewhipped If you please she turned to the symposium which had now risen to its feet If you please he asks me and my brother for the week end We accept At the station no Rickie We drive to where his old lodgings were Trumpery Road or some such name and he s left them I m furious and before I can stop my brother he s paid off the cab and there we are stranded I ve walked walked for miles Pray can you tell me what is to be done with Rickie He must indeed be horsewhipped said Tilliard pleasantly Then he made a bolt for the door Tilliard do stop let me introduce Miss Pembroke don t all go For his friends were flying from his visitor like mists before the sun Oh Agnes I am so sorry I ve nothing to say I simply forgot you were coming and everything about you Thank you thank you And how soon will you remember to ask where Herbert is Where is he then I shall not tell you But didn t he walk with you I shall not tell Rickie It s part of your punishment You are not really sorry yet I shall punish you again later She was quite right Rickie was not as much upset as he ought to have been He was sorry that he had forgotten and that he had caused his visitors inconvenience But he did not feel profoundly degraded as a young man should who has acted discourteously to a young lady Had he acted discourteously to his bedmaker or his gyp he would have minded just as much which was not polite of him First I ll go and get food Do sit down and rest Oh let me introduce Ansell was now the sole remnant of the discussion party He still stood on the hearthrug with a burnt match in his hand Miss Pembroke s arrival had never disturbed him Let me introduce

none	none	Ansell Miss Pembroke There came an awful moment a moment when he almost regretted that he had a clever friend Ansell remained absolutely motionless moving neither hand nor head Such behaviour is so unknown that Miss Pembroke did not realize what had happened and kept her own hand stretched out longer than is maidenly Coming to supper asked Ansell in low grave tones I don t think so said Rickie helplessly Ansell departed without another word Don t mind us said Miss Pembroke pleasantly Why shouldn t you keep your engagement with your friend Herbert s finding lodgings that s why he s not here and they re sure to be able to give us some dinner What jolly rooms you ve got Oh no not a bit I say I am sorry I am sorry I am most awfully sorry What about Ansell Then he burst forth Ansell isn t a gentleman His father s a draper His uncles are farmers He s here because he s so clever just on account of his brains Now sit down He isn t a gentleman at all And he hurried off to order some dinner What a snob the boy is getting thought Agnes a good deal mollified It never struck her that those could be the words of affection that Rickie would never have spoken them about a person whom he disliked Nor did it strike her that Ansell s humble birth scarcely explained the quality of his rudeness She was willing to find life full of trivialities Six months ago and she might have minded but now she cared not what men might do unto her for she had her own splendid lover who could have knocked all these unhealthy undergraduates into a cocked hat She dared not tell Gerald a word of what had happened he might have come up from wherever he was and half killed Ansell And she determined not to tell her brother either for her nature was kindly and it pleased her to pass things over She took off her gloves and then she took off her

none	none	and began to admire them These ear rings were a freak of hers her only freak She had always wanted some and the day Gerald asked her to marry him she went to a shop and had her ears pierced In some wonderful way she knew that it was right And he had given her the rings little gold knobs copied the jeweller told them from something prehistoric and he had kissed the spots of blood on her handkerchief Herbert as usual had been shocked I can t help it she cried springing up I m not like other girls She began to pace about Rickie s room for she hated to keep quiet There was nothing much to see in it The pictures were not attractive nor did they attract her school groups Watts Sir Percival a dog running after a rabbit a man running after a maid a cheap brown Madonna in a cheap green frame in short a collection where one mediocrity was generally cancelled by another Over the door there hung a long photograph of a city with waterways which Agnes who had never been to Venice took to be Venice but which people who had been to Stockholm knew to be Stockholm Rickie s mother looking rather sweet was standing on the mantelpiece Some more pictures had just arrived from the framers and were leaning with their faces to the wall but she did not bother to turn them round On the table were dirty teacups a flat chocolate cake and Omar Khayyam with an Oswego biscuit between his pages Also a vase filled with the crimson leaves of autumn This made her smile Then she saw her host s shoes he had left them lying on the sofa Rickie was slightly deformed and so the shoes were not the same size and one of them had a thick heel to help him towards an even walk Ugh she exclaimed and removed them gingerly to the bedroom There she saw other shoes and boots and pumps a whole row of them all deformed Ugh Poor boy It is too bad Why shouldn t he be like other people This hereditary business is too awful She shut the door with a sigh Then she recalled the perfect form of Gerald his athletic walk the poise of his shoulders his arms stretched forward to receive her Gradually she was comforted I beg your pardon miss but might I ask how many to lay It was the bedmaker missus

none	none	Three I think said Agnes smiling pleasantly mister Elliot ll be back in a minute He has gone to order dinner Thank you miss Plenty of teacups to wash up But teacups is easy washing particularly mister Elliot s Why are his so easy Because no nasty corners in them to hold the dirt mister Anderson he s below has crinkly noctagons and one wouldn t believe the difference It was I bought these for mister Elliot His one thought is to save one trouble I never seed such a thoughtful gentleman The world I say will be the better for him She took the teacups into the gyp room and then returned with the tablecloth and added if he s spared I m afraid he isn t strong said Agnes Oh miss his nose I don t know what he d say if he knew I mentioned his nose but really I must speak to someone and he has neither father nor mother His nose It poured twice with blood in the Long Yes It s a thing that ought to be known I assure you that little room And in any case mister Elliot s a gentleman that can ill afford to lose it Luckily his friends were up and I always say they re more like brothers than anything else Nice for him He has no real brothers Oh mister Hornblower he is a merry gentleman and mister Tilliard too And mister Elliot himself likes his romp at times Why it s the merriest staircase in the buildings Last night the bedmaker from W said to me What are you doing to my gentlemen Here s mister Ansell come back ot with his collar flopping I said And a good thing Some bedders keep their gentlemen just so but surely miss the world being what it is the longer one is able to laugh in it the better Bedmakers have to be comic and dishonest It is expected of them In a picture of university life it is their only function So when we meet one who has the face of a lady and feelings of which a lady might be proud we pass her by Yes said Miss Pembroke and then their talk was stopped by the arrival of her brother It is too bad he exclaimed It is really too bad Now Bertie boy Bertie boy I ll have no peevishness I am not peevish Agnes but I have a full right to be Pray why did he not meet us Why did he not provide rooms And pray why did you leave me to do all the settling All the lodgings I knew are full and our bedrooms look into a mews I cannot help it And then look here It really is too bad He held up his foot like a wounded dog It was dripping with water Oho This explains the peevishness Off with it at once It ll be another of your colds I really think I had better He sat down by the fire and daintily unlaced his boot I notice a great change in university tone I can never remember swaggering three abreast along the pavement and charging inoffensive visitors into a gutter when I was an undergraduate One of the men too wore an Eton tie But the others I should say came from very queer schools if they came from any schools at all mister Pembroke was nearly twenty years older than his sister and had never been as handsome But he was not at all the person to knock into a gutter for though not in orders he had the air of being on the verge of them and his features as well as his clothes had the clerical cut In his presence conversation became pure and colourless and full of understatements and just as if he was a real clergyman neither men nor boys ever forgot that he was there He had observed this and it pleased him very much His conscience permitted him to enter the Church whenever his profession which was the scholastic should demand it No gutter in the world s as wet as this said Agnes who had peeled off her brother s sock and was now toasting it at the embers on a pair of tongs Surely you know the running water by the edge of the Trumpington road It s turned on occasionally to clear away the refuse a most primitive idea When I was up we had a joke about it and called it the Pem How complimentary You foolish girl not after me of course We called it the Pem because it is close to Pembroke College I remember He smiled a little and twiddled his toes Then he remembered the bedmaker and said My sock is now dry My sock please Your sock is sopping No you don t She twitched the tongs away from him missus Aberdeen without speaking fetched a pair of Rickie s socks and a pair of Rickie s shoes Thank you ah thank you I am sure mister Elliot would allow it Then he said in French to his sister Has there been the slightest sign of Frederick Now do call him Rickie and talk English I found him here He had forgotten about us and was very sorry Now he s gone to get some dinner and I can t think why he isn t back missus Aberdeen left them He wants pulling up sharply There is nothing original in absent mindedness True originality lies elsewhere Really the lower classes have no nous However can I wear such deformities For he had been madly trying to cram a right hand foot into a left hand shoe Don t said Agnes hastily Don t touch the poor fellow s things The sight of the smart stubby patent leather made her almost feel faint She had known Rickie for many years but it seemed so dreadful and so different now that he was a man It was her first great contact with the abnormal and unknown fibres of her being rose in revolt against it She frowned when she heard his uneven tread upon the stairs Agnes before he arrives you ought never to have left me and gone to his rooms alone A most elementary transgression Imagine the unpleasantness if you had found him with friends If Gerald Rickie by now had got into a fluster At the kitchens he had lost his head and when his turn came he had had to wait he had yielded his place to those behind saying that he didn t matter And he had wasted more precious time buying bananas though he knew that the Pembrokes were not partial to fruit Amid much tardy and chaotic hospitality the meal got under way All the spoons and forks were anyhow for missus Aberdeen s virtues were not practical The fish seemed never to have been alive the meat had no kick and the cork of the college claret slid forth silently as if ashamed of the contents Agnes was particularly pleasant But her brother could not recover himself He still remembered their desolate arrival and he could feel the waters of the Pem eating into his instep Rickie cried the lady are you aware that you haven t congratulated me on my engagement 
2060_150843_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Rickie laughed 
none	none	nervously and said Why no No more I have Say something pretty then I hope you ll be very happy he mumbled But I don t know anything about marriage Oh you awful boy Herbert isn t he just the same But you do know something about Gerald so don t be so chilly and cautious I ve just realized looking at those groups that you must have been at school together Did you come much across him Very little he answered and sounded shy He got up hastily and began to muddle with the coffee But he was in the same house Surely that s a house group He was a prefect He made his coffee on the simple system One had a brown pot into which the boiling stuff was poured Just before serving one put in a drop of cold water and the idea was that the grounds fell to the bottom Wasn t he a kind of athletic marvel Couldn t he knock any boy or master down Yes If he had wanted to said mister Pembroke who had not spoken for some time If he had wanted to echoed Rickie I do hope Agnes you ll be most awfully happy I don t know anything about the army but I should think it must be most awfully interesting mister Pembroke laughed faintly Yes Rickie The army is a most interesting profession the profession of Wellington and Marlborough and Lord Roberts a most interesting profession as you observe A profession that may mean death death rather than dishonour That s nice said Rickie speaking to himself Any profession may mean dishonour but one isn t allowed to die instead The army s different If a soldier makes a mess it s thought rather decent of him isn t it if he blows out his brains In the other professions it somehow seems cowardly I am not competent to pronounce said mister Pembroke who was not accustomed to have his schoolroom satire commented on I merely know that the army is the finest profession in the world Which reminds me Rickie have you been thinking about yours No Not at all No Now Herbert don t bother him Have another meringue But Rickie my dear boy you re twenty It s time you thought The Tripos is the beginning of life not the end In less than two years you will have got your B A What are you going to do with it I don t know You re M A aren t you asked Agnes but her brother proceeded I have seen so many promising brilliant lives wrecked simply on account of this not settling soon enough My dear boy you must think Consult your tastes if possible but think You have not a moment to lose The Bar like your father Oh I wouldn t like that at all I don t mention the Church Oh Rickie do be a clergyman said Miss Pembroke You d be simply killing in a wide awake He looked at his guests hopelessly Their kindness and competence overwhelmed him I wish I could talk to them as I talk to myself he thought I m not such an ass when I talk to myself I don t believe for instance that quite all I thought about the cow was rot Aloud he said I ve sometimes wondered about writing Writing said mister Pembroke with the tone of one who gives everything its trial Well what about writing What kind of writing I rather like he suppressed something in his throat I rather like trying to write little stories Why I made sure it was poetry said Agnes You re just the boy for poetry I had no idea you wrote Would you let me see something Then I could judge The author shook his head I don t show it to any one It isn t anything I just try because it amuses me What is it about Silly nonsense Are you ever going to show it to any one I don t think so mister Pembroke did not reply firstly because the meringue he was eating was after all Rickie s secondly because it was gluey and stuck his jaws together Agnes observed that the writing was really a very good idea there was Rickie s aunt she could push him Aunt Emily never pushes any one she says they always rebound and crush her I only had the pleasure of seeing your aunt once I should have thought her a quite uncrushable person But she would be sure to help you I couldn t show her anything She d think them even sillier than they are Always running yourself down There speaks the artist I m not modest he said anxiously I just know they re bad mister Pembroke s teeth were clear of meringue and he could refrain no longer My dear Rickie your father and mother are dead and you often say your aunt takes no interest in you Therefore your life depends on yourself Think it over carefully but settle and having once settled stick If you think that this writing is practicable and that you could make your living by it that you could if needs be support a wife then by all means write But you must work Work and drudge Begin at the bottom of the ladder and work upwards Rickie s head drooped Any metaphor silenced him He never thought of replying that art is not a ladder with a curate as it were on the first rung a rector on the second and a bishop still nearer heaven at the top He never retorted that the artist is not a bricklayer at all but a horseman whose business it is to catch Pegasus at once not to practise for him by mounting tamer colts This is hard hot and generally ungraceful work but it is not drudgery For drudgery is not art and cannot lead to it Of course I don t really think about writing he said as he poured the cold water into the coffee Even if my things ever were decent I don t think the magazines would take them and the magazines are one s only chance I read somewhere too that Marie Corelli s about the only person who makes a thing out of literature I m certain it wouldn t pay me I never mentioned the word pay said mister Pembroke uneasily You must not consider money There are ideals too I have no ideals Rickie she exclaimed Horrible boy No Agnes I have no ideals Then he got very red for it was a phrase he had caught from Ansell and he could not remember what came next The person who has no ideals she exclaimed is to be pitied I think so too said mister Pembroke sipping his coffee Life without an ideal would be like the sky without the sun Rickie looked towards the night wherein there now twinkled innumerable stars gods and heroes virgins and brides to whom the Greeks have given their names Life without an ideal repeated mister Pembroke and then stopped for his mouth was full of coffee grounds The same affliction had overtaken Agnes After a little jocose laughter they departed to their lodgings and Rickie having seen them as far as the porter s lodge hurried singing as he went to Ansell s room burst open the door and said Look here Whatever do you mean by it By what Ansell was sitting alone with a piece of paper in front of him On it was a diagram a circle inside a square inside which was again a square By being so rude You re no gentleman and I told her so He slammed him on the head with a sofa cushion I m certain one ought to be polite even to people who aren t saved Not saved was a phrase they applied just then to those whom they did not like or intimately know And I believe she is saved I never knew any one so always good tempered and kind She s been kind to me ever since I knew her I wish you d heard her trying to stop her brother you d have certainly come round Not but what he was only being nice as well But she is really nice And I thought she came into the room so beautifully Do you know oh of course you despise music but Anderson was playing Wagner and he d just got to the part where they sing Rheingold Rheingold and the sun strikes into the waters and the music which up to then has so often been in E flat Goes into D sharp I have not understood a single word partly because you talk as if your mouth was full of plums partly because I don t know whom you re talking about Miss Pembroke whom you saw I saw no one Who came in No one came in You re an ass shrieked Rickie She came in You saw her come in She and her brother have been to dinner You only think so They were not really there But they stop till Monday You only think that they are stopping But oh look here shut up The girl like an empress I saw no empress nor any girl nor have you seen them Ansell don t rag Elliot I never rag and you know it She was not really there There was a moment s silence Then Rickie exclaimed I ve got you You say or was it Tilliard no YOU say that the cow s there Well there these people are then Got you Yah Did it never strike you that phenomena may be of two kinds ONE those which have a real existence such as the cow TWO those which are the subjective product of a diseased imagination and which to our destruction we invest with the semblance of reality If this never struck you let it strike you now Rickie spoke again but received no answer He paced a little up and down the sombre roam Then he sat on the edge of the table and watched his clever friend draw within the square a circle and within the circle a square and inside that another circle and inside that another square Why will you do that No answer Are they real The inside one is the one in the middle of everything that there s never room enough to draw II A little this side of Madingley to the left of the road there is a secluded dell paved with grass and planted with fir trees It could not have been worth a visit twenty years ago for then it was only a scar of chalk and it is not worth a visit at the present day for the trees have grown too thick and choked it But when Rickie was up it chanced to be the brief season of its romance a season as brief for a chalk pit as a man its divine interval between the bareness of boyhood and the stuffiness of age Rickie had discovered it in his second term when the January snows had melted and left fiords and lagoons of clearest water between the inequalities of the floor The place looked as big as Switzerland or Norway as indeed for the moment it was and he came upon it at a time when his life too was beginning to expand Accordingly the dell became for him a kind of church a church where indeed you could do anything you liked but where anything you did would be transfigured Like the ancient Greeks he could even laugh at his holy place and leave it no less holy He chatted gaily about it and about the pleasant thoughts with which it inspired him he took his friends there he even took people whom he did not like Procul este profani exclaimed a delighted aesthete on being introduced to it But this was never to be the attitude of Rickie He did not love the vulgar herd but he knew that his own vulgarity would be greater if he forbade it ingress and that it was not by preciosity that he would attain to the intimate spirit of the dell Indeed if he had agreed with the aesthete he would possibly not have introduced him If the dell was to bear any inscription he would have liked it to be This way to Heaven painted on a sign post by the high road and he did not realize till later years that the number of visitors would not thereby have sensibly increased On the blessed Monday that the Pembrokes left he walked out here with three friends It was a day when the sky seemed enormous One cloud as large as a continent was voyaging near the sun whilst other clouds seemed anchored to the horizon too lazy or too happy to move The sky itself was of the palest blue paling to white where it approached the earth and the earth brown wet and odorous was engaged beneath it on its yearly duty of decay Rickie was open to the complexities of autumn he felt extremely tiny extremely tiny and extremely important and perhaps the combination is as fair as any that exists He hoped that all his life he would never be peevish or unkind Elliot is in a dangerous state said Ansell They had reached the dell and had stood for some time in silence each leaning against a tree It was too wet to sit down How s that asked Rickie who had not known he was in any state at all He shut up Keats whom he thought he had been reading and slipped him back into his coat pocket Scarcely ever was he without a book He s trying to like people Then he s done for said Widdrington He s dead He s trying to like Hornblower The others gave shrill agonized cries He wants to bind the college together He wants to link us to the beefy set I do like Hornblower he protested I don t try And Hornblower tries to like you That part doesn t matter But he does try to like you He tries not to despise you It is altogether a most public spirited affair Tilliard started them said Widdrington Tilliard thinks it such a pity the college should be split into sets Oh Tilliard said Ansell with much irritation But what can you expect from a person who s eternally beautiful The other night we had been discussing a long time and suddenly the light was turned on Every one else looked a sight as they ought But there was Tilliard sitting neatly on a little chair like an undersized god with not a curl crooked I should say he will get into the Foreign Office Why are most of us so ugly laughed Rickie It s merely a sign of our salvation merely another sign that the college is split The college isn t split cried Rickie who got excited on this subject with unfailing regularity The college is and has been and always will be one What you call the beefy set aren t a set at all They re just the rowing people and naturally they chiefly see each other but they re always nice to me or to any one Of course they think us rather asses but it s quite in a pleasant way That s my whole objection said Ansell What right have they to think us asses in a pleasant way Why don t they hate us What right has Hornblower to smack me on the back when I ve been rude to him Well what right have you to be rude to him Because I hate him You think it is so splendid to hate no one I tell you it is a crime You want to love every one equally and that s worse than impossible it s wrong When you denounce sets you re really trying to destroy friendship I maintain said Rickie it was a verb he clung to in the hope that it would lend stability to what followed I maintain that one can like many more people than one supposes And I maintain that you hate many more people than you pretend I hate no one he exclaimed with extraordinary vehemence and the dell re echoed that it hated no one We are obliged to believe you said Widdrington smiling a little but we are sorry about it Not even your father asked Ansell 
2060_150843_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Rickie was silent 
none	none	Not even your father The cloud above extended a great promontory across the sun It only lay there for a moment yet that was enough to summon the lurking coldness from the earth Does he hate his father said Widdrington who had not known Oh good But his father s dead He will say it doesn t count Still it s something Do you hate yours Ansell did not reply Rickie said I say I wonder whether one ought to talk like this About hating dead people Yes Did you hate your mother asked Widdrington Rickie turned crimson I don t see Hornblower s such a rotter remarked the other man whose name was James James you are diplomatic said Ansell You are trying to tide over an awkward moment You can go Widdrington was crimson too In his wish to be sprightly he had used words without thinking of their meanings Suddenly he realized that father and mother really meant father and mother people whom he had himself at home He was very uncomfortable and thought Rickie had been rather queer He too tried to revert to Hornblower but Ansell would not let him The sun came out and struck on the white ramparts of the dell Rickie looked straight at it Then he said abruptly I think I want to talk I think you do replied Ansell Shouldn t I be rather a fool if I went through Cambridge without talking It s said never to come so easy again All the people are dead too I can t see why I shouldn t tell you most things about my birth and parentage and education Talk away If you bore us we have books With this invitation Rickie began to relate his history The reader who has no book will be obliged to listen to it Some people spend their lives in a suburb and not for any urgent reason This had been the fate of Rickie He had opened his eyes to filmy heavens and taken his first walk on asphalt He had seen civilization as a row of semi detached villas and society as a state in which men do not know the men who live next door He had himself become part of the grey monotony that surrounds all cities There was no necessity for this it was only rather convenient to his father mister Elliot was a barrister In appearance he resembled his son being weakly and lame with hollow little cheeks a broad white band of forehead and stiff impoverished hair His voice which he did not transmit was very suave with a fine command of cynical intonation By altering it ever so little he could make people wince especially if they were simple or poor Nor did he transmit his eyes Their peculiar flatness as if the soul looked through dirty window panes the unkindness of them the cowardice the fear in them were to trouble the world no longer He married a girl whose voice was beautiful There was no caress in it yet all who heard it were soothed as though the world held some unexpected blessing She called to her dogs one night over invisible waters and he a tourist up on the bridge thought that is extraordinarily adequate In time he discovered that her figure face and thoughts were adequate also and as she was not impossible socially he married her I have taken a plunge he told his family The family hostile at first had not a word to say when the woman was introduced to them and his sister declared that the plunge had been taken from the opposite bank Things only went right for a little time Though beautiful without and within missus Elliot had not the gift of making her home beautiful and one day when she bought a carpet for the dining room that clashed he laughed gently said he really couldn t and departed Departure is perhaps too strong a word In missus Elliot s mouth it became My husband has to sleep more in town He often came down to see them nearly always unexpectedly and occasionally they went to see him Father s house as Rickie called it only had three rooms but these were full of books and pictures and flowers and the flowers instead of being squashed down into the vases as they were in mummy s house rose gracefully from frames of lead which lay coiled at the bottom as doubtless the sea serpent has to lie coiled at the bottom of the sea Once he was let to lift a frame out only once for he dropped some water on a creton I think he s going to have taste said mister Elliot languidly It is quite possible his wife replied She had not taken off her hat and gloves nor even pulled up her veil mister Elliot laughed and soon afterwards another lady came in and they went away Why does father always laugh asked Rickie in the evening when he and his mother were sitting in the nursery It is a way of your father s Why does he always laugh at me Am I so funny Then after a pause You have no sense of humour have you mummy missus Elliot who was raising a thread of cotton to her lips held it suspended in amazement You told him so this afternoon But I have seen you laugh He nodded wisely I have seen you laugh ever so often One day you were laughing alone all down in the sweet peas Was I Yes Were you laughing at me I was not thinking about you Cotton please a reel of No fifty white from my chest of drawers Left hand drawer Now which is your left hand The side my pocket is And if you had no pocket The side my bad foot is I meant you to say the side my heart is said missus Elliot holding up the duster between them Most of us I mean all of us can feel on one side a little watch that never stops ticking So even if you had no bad foot you would still know which is the left No fifty white please No I ll get it myself For she had remembered that the dark passage frightened him These were the outlines Rickie filled them in with the slowness and the accuracy of a child He was never told anything but he discovered for himself that his father and mother did not love each other and that his mother was lovable He discovered that mister Elliot had dubbed him Rickie because he was rickety that he took pleasure in alluding to his son s deformity and was sorry that it was not more serious than his own mister Elliot had not one scrap of genius He gathered the pictures and the books and the flower supports mechanically not in any impulse of love He passed for a cultured man because he knew how to select and he passed for an unconventional man because he did not select quite like other people In reality he never did or said or thought one single thing that had the slightest beauty or value And in time Rickie discovered this as well The boy grew up in great loneliness He worshipped his mother and she was fond of him But she was dignified and reticent and pathos like tattle was disgusting to her She was afraid of intimacy in case it led to confidences and tears and so all her life she held her son at a little distance Her kindness and unselfishness knew no limits but if he tried to be dramatic and thank her she told him not to be a little goose And so the only person he came to know at all was himself He would play Halma against himself He would conduct solitary conversations in which one part of him asked and another part answered It was an exciting game and concluded with the formula Good bye Thank you I am glad to have met you I hope before long we shall enjoy another chat And then perhaps he would sob for loneliness for he would see real people real brothers real friends doing in warm life the things he had pretended Shall I ever have a friend he demanded at the age of twelve I don t see how They walk too fast And a brother I shall never have No loss interrupted Widdrington But I shall never have one and so I quite want one even now When he was thirteen mister Elliot entered on his illness The pretty rooms in town would not do for an invalid and so he came back to his home One of the first consequences was that Rickie was sent to a public school missus Elliot did what she could but she had no hold whatever over her husband He worries me he declared He s a joke of which I have got tired Would it be possible to send him to a private tutor s No said mister Elliot who had all the money Coddling I agree that boys ought to rough it but when a boy is lame and very delicate he roughs it sufficiently if he leaves home Rickie can t play games He doesn t make friends He isn t brilliant Thinking it over I feel that as it s like this we can t ever hope to give him the ordinary education Perhaps you could think it over too No I am sure that things are best for him as they are The day school knocks quite as many corners off him as he can stand He hates it but it is good for him A public school will not be good for him It is too rough Instead of getting manly and hard he will My head please Rickie departed in a state of bewildered misery which was scarcely ever to grow clearer Each holiday he found his father more irritable and a little weaker missus Elliot was quickly growing old She had to manage the servants to hush the neighbouring children to answer the correspondence to paper and re paper the rooms and all for the sake of a man whom she did not like and who did not conceal his dislike for her One day she found Rickie tearful and said rather crossly Well what is it this time He replied Oh mummy I ve seen your wrinkles your grey hair I m unhappy Sudden tenderness overcame her and she cried My darling what does it matter Whatever does it matter now He had never known her so emotional Yet even better did he remember another incident Hearing high voices from his father s room he went upstairs in the hope that the sound of his tread might stop them missus Elliot burst open the door and seeing him exclaimed My dear If you please he s hit me She tried to laugh it off but a few hours later he saw the bruise which the stick of the invalid had raised upon his mother s hand God alone knows how far we are in the grip of our bodies He alone can judge how far the cruelty of mister Elliot was the outcome of extenuating circumstances But missus Elliot could accurately judge of its extent At last he died Rickie was now fifteen and got off a whole week s school for the funeral His mother was rather strange She was much happier she looked younger and her mourning was as unobtrusive as convention permitted All this he had expected But she seemed to be watching him and to be extremely anxious for his opinion on any subject more especially on his father Why At last he saw that she was trying to establish confidence between them But confidence cannot be established in a moment They were both shy The habit of years was upon them and they alluded to the death of mister Elliot as an irreparable loss Now that your father has gone things will be very different Shall we be poorer mother No Oh But naturally things will be very different Yes naturally For instance your poor father liked being near London but I almost think we might move Would you like that Of course mummy He looked down at the ground He was not accustomed to being consulted and it bewildered him Perhaps you might like quite a different life better He giggled It s a little difficult for me said missus Elliot pacing vigorously up and down the room and more and more did her black dress seem a mockery In some ways you ought to be consulted nearly all the money is left to you as you must hear some time or other But in other ways you re only a boy What am I to do I don t know he replied appearing more helpless and unhelpful than he really was For instance would you like me to arrange things exactly as I like Oh do he exclaimed thinking this a most brilliant suggestion The very nicest thing of all And he added in his half pedantic half pleasing way I shall be as wax in your hands mamma She smiled Very well darling You shall be And she pressed him lovingly as though she would mould him into something beautiful For the next few days great preparations were in the air She went to see his father s sister the gifted and vivacious Aunt Emily They were to live in the country somewhere right in the country with grass and trees up to the door and birds singing everywhere and a tutor For he was not to go back to school Unbelievable He was never to go back to school and the head master had written saying that he regretted the step but that possibly it was a wise one It was raw weather and missus Elliot watched over him with ceaseless tenderness It seemed as if she could not do too much to shield him and to draw him nearer to her Put on your greatcoat dearest she said to him I don t think I want it answered Rickie remembering that he was now fifteen The wind is bitter You ought to put it on But it s so heavy Do put it on dear He was not very often irritable or rude but he answered Oh I shan t catch cold I do wish you wouldn t keep on bothering He did not catch cold but while he was out his mother died She only survived her husband eleven days a coincidence which was recorded on their tombstone Such in substance was the story which Rickie told his friends as they stood together in the shelter of the dell The green bank at the entrance hid the road and the world and now as in spring they could see nothing but snow white ramparts and the evergreen foliage of the firs Only from time to time would a beech leaf flutter in from the woods above to comment on the waning year and the warmth and radiance of the sun would vanish behind a passing cloud About the greatcoat he did not tell them for he could not have spoken of it without tears III mister Ansell a provincial draper of moderate prosperity ought by rights to have been classed not with the cow but with those phenomena that are not really there But his son with pardonable illogicality excepted him He never suspected that his father might be the subjective product of a diseased imagination From his earliest years he had taken him for granted as a most undeniable and lovable fact To be born one thing and grow up another Ansell had accomplished this without weakening one of the ties that bound him to his home The rooms above the shop still seemed as comfortable the garden behind it as gracious as they had seemed fifteen years before when he would sit behind Miss Appleblossom s central throne and she like some allegorical figure would send the change and receipted bills spinning away from her in little boxwood balls At first the young man had attributed these happy relations to his own tact But in time he perceived that the tact was all on the side of his father mister Ansell was not merely a man of some education he had what no education can bring the power of detecting what is important Like many fathers he had spared no expense over his boy he had borrowed money to start him at a rapacious and fashionable private school he had sent him to tutors he had sent him to Cambridge But he knew that all this was not the important thing The important thing was freedom The boy must use his education as he chose and if he paid his father back it would certainly not be in his own coin So when Stewart said At Cambridge can I read for the Moral Science Tripos mister Ansell had only replied This philosophy do you say that it lies behind everything Yes I think so It tries to discover what is good and true Then my boy you had better read as much of it as you can And a year later I d like to take up this philosophy seriously but I don t feel justified Why not Because it brings in no return I think I m a great philosopher but then all philosophers think that though they don t dare to say so But however great I am I shan t earn money Perhaps I shan t ever be able to keep myself I shan t even get a good social position You ve only to say one word and I ll work for the Civil Service I m good enough to get in high mister Ansell liked money and social position But he knew that there is a more important thing and replied You must take up this philosophy seriously I think Another thing there are the girls There is enough money now to get Mary and Maud as good husbands as they deserve And Mary and Maud took the same view It was in this plebeian household that Rickie spent part of the Christmas vacation His own home such as it was was with the Silts needy cousins of his father s and combined to a peculiar degree the restrictions of hospitality with the discomforts of a boarding house Such pleasure as he had outside Cambridge was in the homes of his friends and it was a particular joy and honour to visit Ansell who though as free from social snobbishness as most of us will ever manage to be was rather careful when he drove up to the facade of his shop I like our new lettering he said thoughtfully The words Stewart Ansell were repeated again and again along the High Street curly gold letters that seemed to float in tanks of glazed chocolate Rather said Rickie But he wondered whether one of the bonds that kept the Ansell family united might not be their complete absence of taste a surer bond by far than the identity of it And he wondered this again when he sat at tea opposite a long row of crayons Stewart as a baby Stewart as a small boy with large feet Stewart as a larger boy with smaller feet Mary reading a book whose leaves were as thick as eiderdowns And yet again did he wonder it when he woke with a gasp in the night to find a harp in luminous paint throbbing and glowering at him from the adjacent wall Watch and pray was written on the harp and until Rickie hung a towel over it the exhortation was partially successful It was a very happy visit Miss Appleblosssom who now acted as housekeeper had met him before during her never forgotten expedition to Cambridge and her admiration of University life was as shrill and as genuine now as it had been then The girls at first were a little aggressive for on his arrival he had been tired and Maud had taken it for haughtiness and said he was looking down on them But this passed They did not fall in love with him nor he with them but a morning was spent very pleasantly in snow balling in the back garden Ansell was rather different to what he was in Cambridge but to Rickie not less attractive And there was a curious charm in the hum of the shop which swelled into a roar if one opened the partition door on a market day Listen to your money said Rickie I wish I could hear mine I wish my money was alive

none	none	Mine s dead money It s come to me through about six dead people silently Getting a little smaller and a little more respectable each time on account of the death duties It needed to get respectable Why Did your people too once keep a shop Oh not as bad as that They only swindled About a hundred years ago an Elliot did something shady and founded the fortunes of our house I never knew any one so relentless to his ancestors You make up for your soapiness towards the living You d be relentless if you d heard the Silts as I have talk about a fortune small perhaps but unsoiled by trade Of course Aunt Emily is rather different Oh goodness me I ve forgotten my aunt She lives not so far I shall have to call on her Accordingly he wrote to missus Failing and said he should like to pay his respects He told her about the Ansells and so worded the letter that she might reasonably have sent an invitation to his friend She replied that she was looking forward to their tete a tete You mustn t go round by the trains said mister Ansell It means changing at Salisbury By the road it s no great way Stewart shall drive you over Salisbury Plain and fetch you too There s too much snow said Ansell Then the girls shall take you in their sledge That I will said Maud who was not unwilling to see the inside of Cadover But Rickie went round by the trains We have all missed you said Ansell when he returned There is a general feeling that you are no nuisance and had better stop till the end of the vac This he could not do He was bound for Christmas to the Silts as a REAL guest missus Silt had written underlining the word real twice And after Christmas he must go to the Pembrokes These are no reasons The only real reason for doing a thing is because you want to do it I think the talk about engagements is cant I think perhaps it is said Rickie But he went Never had the turkey been so athletic or the plum pudding tied into its cloth so tightly Yet he knew that both these symbols of hilarity had cost money and it went to his heart when mister Silt said in a hungry voice Have you thought at all of what you want to be No Well why should you You have no need to be anything And at dessert I wonder who Cadover goes to I expect money will follow money It always does It was with a guilty feeling of relief that he left for the Pembrokes The Pembrokes lived in an adjacent suburb or rather sububurb the tract called Sawston celebrated for its public school Their style of life however was not particularly suburban Their house was small and its name was Shelthorpe but it had an air about it which suggested a certain amount of money and a certain amount of taste There were decent water colours in the drawing room Madonnas of acknowledged merit hung upon the stairs A replica of the Hermes of Praxiteles of course only the bust stood in the hall with a real palm behind it Agnes in her slap dash way was a good housekeeper and kept the pretty things well dusted It was she who insisted on the strip of brown holland that led diagonally from the front door to the door of Herbert s study boys grubby feet should not go treading on her Indian square It was she who always cleaned the picture frames and washed the bust and the leaves of the palm In short if a house could speak and sometimes it does speak more clearly than the people who live in it the house of the Pembrokes would have said I am not quite like other houses yet I am perfectly comfortable I contain works of art and a microscope and books But I do not live for any of these things or suffer them to disarrange me I live for myself and for the greater houses that shall come after me Yet in me neither the cry of money nor the cry for money shall ever be heard mister Pembroke was at the station He did better as a host than as a guest and welcomed the young man with real friendliness We were all coming but Gerald has strained his ankle slightly and wants to keep quiet as he is playing next week in a match And needless to say that explains the absence of my sister Gerald Dawes Yes he s with us I m so glad you ll meet again So am I said Rickie with extreme awkwardness Does he remember me Vividly Vivid also was Rickie s remembrance of him A splendid fellow asserted mister Pembroke I hope that Agnes is well Thank you yes she is well And I think you re looking more like other people yourself I ve been having a very good time with a friend Indeed That s right Who was that Rickie had a young man s reticence He generally spoke of a friend a person I know a place I was at When the book of life is opening our readings are secret and we are unwilling to give chapter and verse mister Pembroke who was half way through the volume and had skipped or forgotten the earlier pages could not understand Rickie s hesitation nor why with such awkwardness he should pronounce the harmless dissyllable Ansell Ansell Wasn t that the pleasant fellow who asked us to lunch No That was Anderson who keeps below You didn t see Ansell The ones who came to breakfast were Tilliard and Hornblower Of course And since then you have been with the Silts How are they Very well thank you They want to be remembered to you The Pembrokes had formerly lived near the Elliots and had shown great kindness to Rickie when his parents died They were thus rather in the position of family friends Please remember us when you write He added almost roguishly The Silts are kindness itself All the same it must be just a little dull we thought and we thought that you might like a change And of course we are delighted to have you besides That goes without saying It s very good of you said Rickie who had accepted the invitation because he felt he ought to Not a bit And you mustn t expect us to be otherwise than quiet on the holidays There is a library of a sort as you know and you will find Gerald a splendid fellow Will they be married soon Oh no whispered mister Pembroke shutting his eyes as if Rickie had made some terrible faux pas It will be a very long engagement He must make his way first I have seen such endless misery result from people marrying before they have made their way Yes That is so said Rickie despondently thinking of the Silts It s a sad unpalatable truth said mister Pembroke thinking that the despondency might be personal but one must accept it My sister and Gerald I am thankful to say have accepted it though naturally it has been a little pill Their cab lurched round the corner as he spoke and the two patients came in sight Agnes was leaning over the creosoted garden gate and behind her there stood a young man who had the figure of a Greek athlete and the face of an English one He was fair and cleanshaven and his colourless hair was cut rather short The sun was in his eyes and they like his mouth seemed scarcely more than slits in his healthy skin Just where he began to be beautiful the clothes started Round his neck went an up and down collar and a mauve and gold tie and the rest of his limbs were hidden by a grey lounge suit carefully creased in the right places Lovely Lovely cried Agnes banging on the gate Your train must have been to the minute Hullo said the athlete and vomited with the greeting a cloud of tobacco smoke It must have been imprisoned in his mouth some time for no pipe was visible Hullo returned Rickie laughing violently They shook hands Where are you going Rickie asked Agnes You aren t grubby Why don t you stop Gerald get the large wicker chair Herbert has letters but we can sit here till lunch It s like spring The garden of Shelthorpe was nearly all in front an unusual and pleasant arrangement The front gate and the servants entrance were both at the side and in the remaining space the gardener had contrived a little lawn where one could sit concealed from the road by a fence from the neighbour by a fence from the house by a tree and from the path by a bush This is the lovers bower observed Agnes sitting down on the bench Rickie stood by her till the chair arrived Are you smoking before lunch asked mister Dawes No thank you I hardly ever smoke No vices Aren t you at Cambridge now Yes What s your college Rickie told him Do you know Carruthers Rather I mean A P Carruthers who got his socker blue Rather He s secretary to the college musical society A P Carruthers Yes mister Dawes seemed offended He tapped on his teeth and remarked that the weather bad no business to be so warm in winter But it was fiendish before Christmas said Agnes He frowned and asked Do you know a man called Gerrish No Ah Do you know James Never heard of him He s my year too He got a blue for hockey his second term I know nothing about the Varsity Rickie winced at the abbreviation Varsity It was at that time the proper thing to speak of the University I haven t the time pursued mister Dawes No no said Rickie politely I had the chance of being an Undergrad myself and by Jove I m thankful I didn t Why asked Agnes for there was a pause Puts you back in your profession Men who go there first before the Army start hopelessly behind The same with the Stock Exchange or Painting I know men in both and they ve never caught up the time they lost in the Varsity unless of course you turn parson I love Cambridge said she All those glorious buildings and every one so happy and running in and out of each other s rooms all day long That might make an Undergrad happy but I beg leave to state it wouldn t me I haven t four years to throw away for the sake of being called a Varsity man and hobnobbing with Lords Rickie was prepared to find his old schoolfellow ungrammatical and bumptious but he was not prepared to find him peevish Athletes he believed were simple straightforward people cruel and brutal if you like but never petty They knocked you down and hurt you and then went on their way rejoicing For this Rickie thought there is something to be said he had escaped the sin of despising the physically strong a sin against which the physically weak must guard But here was Dawes returning again and again to the subject of the University full of transparent jealousy and petty spite nagging nagging nagging like a maiden lady who has not been invited to a tea party Rickie wondered whether after all Ansell and the extremists might not be right and bodily beauty and strength be signs of the soul s damnation He glanced at Agnes She was writing down some orderings for the tradespeople on a piece of paper Her handsome face was intent on the work The bench on which she and Gerald were sitting had no back but she sat as straight as a dart He though strong enough to sit straight did not take the trouble Why don t they talk to each other thought Rickie Gerald give this paper to the cook I can give it to the other slavey can t I She d be dressing Well there s Herbert He s busy Oh you know where the kitchen is Take it to the cook He disappeared slowly behind the tree What do you think of him she immediately asked He murmured civilly Has he changed since he was a schoolboy In a way Do tell me all about him Why won t you She might have seen a flash of horror pass over Rickie s face The horror disappeared for thank God he was now a man whom civilization protects But he and Gerald had met as it were behind the scenes before our decorous drama opens and there the elder boy had done things to him absurd things not worth chronicling separately An apple pie bed is nothing pinches kicks boxed ears twisted arms pulled hair ghosts at night inky books befouled photographs amount to very little by themselves But let them be united and continuous and you have a hell that no grown up devil can devise Between Rickie and Gerald there lay a shadow that darkens life more often than we suppose The bully and his victim never quite forget their first relations They meet in clubs and country houses and clap one another on the back but in both the memory is green of a more strenuous day when they were boys together He tried to say He was the right kind of boy and I was the wrong kind But Cambridge would not let him smooth the situation over by self belittlement If he had been the wrong kind of boy Gerald had been a worse kind He murmured We are different very and Miss Pembroke perhaps suspecting something asked no more But she kept to the subject of mister Dawes humorously depreciating her lover and discussing him without reverence Rickie laughed but felt uncomfortable When people were engaged he felt that they should be outside criticism Yet here he was criticizing He could not help it He was dragged in I hope his ankle is better Never was bad He s always fussing over something He plays next week in a match I think Herbert says I dare say he does Shall we be going Pray go if you like I shall stop at home I ve had enough of cold feet It was all very colourless and odd Gerald returned saying I can t stand your cook What s she want to ask me questions for I can t stand talking to servants I say If I speak to you well and good and it s another thing besides if she were pretty Well I hope our ugly cook will have lunch ready in a minute said Agnes We re frightfully unpunctual this morning and I daren t say anything because it was the same yesterday and if I complain again they might leave Poor Rickie must be starved Why the Silts gave me all these sandwiches and I ve never eaten them They always stuff one And you thought you d better eh said mister Dawes in case you weren t stuffed here Miss Pembroke who house kept somewhat economically looked annoyed The voice of mister Pembroke was now heard calling from the house Frederick Frederick My dear boy pardon me It was an important letter about the Church Defence otherwise Come in and see your room He was glad to quit the little lawn He had learnt too much there It was dreadful they did not love each other More dreadful even than the case of his father and mother for they until they married had got on pretty well But this man was already rude and brutal and cold he was still the school bully who twisted up the arms of little boys and ran pins into them at chapel and struck them in the stomach when they were swinging on the horizontal bar Poor Agnes why ever had she done it Ought not somebody to interfere He had forgotten his sandwiches and went back to get them Gerald and Agnes were locked in each other s arms He only looked for a moment but the sight burnt into his brain The man s grip was the stronger He had drawn the woman on to his knee was pressing her with all his strength against him Already her hands slipped off him and she whispered Don t you hurt Her face had no expression It stared at the intruder and never saw him Then her lover kissed it and immediately it shone with mysterious beauty like some star Rickie limped away without the sandwiches crimson and afraid He thought Do such things actually happen and he seemed to be looking down coloured valleys Brighter they glowed till gods of pure flame were born in them and then he was looking at pinnacles of virgin snow While mister Pembroke talked the riot of fair images increased They invaded his being and lit lamps at unsuspected shrines Their orchestra commenced in that suburban house where he had to stand aside for the maid to carry in the luncheon Music flowed past him like a river He stood at the springs of creation and heard the primeval monotony Then an obscure instrument gave out a little phrase The river continued unheeding The phrase was repeated and a listener might know it was a fragment of the Tune of tunes Nobler instruments accepted it the clarionet protected the brass encouraged and it rose to the surface to the whisper of violins In full unison was Love born flame of the flame flushing the dark river beneath him and the virgin snows above His wings were infinite his youth eternal the sun was a jewel on his finger as he passed it in benediction over the world Creation no longer monotonous acclaimed him in widening melody in brighter radiances Was Love a column of fire Was he a torrent of song Was he greater than either the touch of a man on a woman It was the merest accident that Rickie had not been disgusted But this he could not know mister Pembroke when he called the two dawdlers into lunch was aware of a hand on his arm and a voice that murmured Don t they may be happy He stared and struck the gong To its music they approached priest and high priestess Rickie can I give these sandwiches to the boot boy said the one He would love them The gong Be quick The gong Are you smoking before lunch said the other But they had got into heaven and nothing could get them out of it Others might think them surly or prosaic He knew He could remember every word they spoke He would treasure every motion every glance of either and so in time to come when the gates of heaven had shut some faint radiance some echo of wisdom might remain with him outside As a matter of fact he saw them very little during his visit He checked himself because he was unworthy What right had he to pry even in the spirit upon their bliss It was no crime to have seen them on the lawn It would be a crime to go to it again He tried to keep himself and his thoughts away not because he was ascetic but because they would not like it if they knew This behaviour of his suited them admirably And when any gracious little thing occurred to them any little thing that his sympathy had contrived and allowed they put it down to chance or to each other So the lovers fall into the background They are part of the distant sunrise and only the mountains speak to them Rickie talks to mister Pembroke amidst the unlit valleys of our over habitable world IV Sawston School had been founded by a tradesman in the seventeenth century It was then a tiny grammar school in a tiny town and the City Company who governed it had to drive half a day through the woods and heath on the occasion of their annual visit In the twentieth century they still drove but only from the railway station and found themselves not in a tiny town nor yet in a large one but amongst innumerable residences detached and semi detached which had gathered round the school For the intentions of the founder had been altered or at all events amplified instead of educating the poore of my home he now educated the upper classes of England The change had taken place not so very far back Till the nineteenth century the grammar school was still composed of day scholars from the neighbourhood Then two things happened Firstly the school s property rose in value and it became rich Secondly for no obvious reason it suddenly emitted a quantity of bishops The bishops like the stars from a Roman candle were all colours and flew in all directions some high some low some to distant colonies one into the Church of Rome But many a father traced their course in the papers many a mother wondered whether her son if properly ignited might not burn as bright many a family moved to the place where living and education were so cheap where day boys were not looked down upon and where the orthodox and the up to date were said to be combined The school doubled its numbers It built new class rooms laboratories and a gymnasium It dropped the prefix Grammar It coaxed the sons of the local tradesmen into a new foundation the Commercial School built a couple of miles away And it started boarding houses It had not the gracious antiquity of Eton or Winchester nor on the other hand had it a conscious policy like Lancing Wellington and other purely modern foundations Where tradition served it clung to them Where new departures seemed desirable they were made It aimed at producing the average Englishman and to a very great extent it succeeded Here mister Pembroke passed his happy and industrious life His technical position was that of master to a form low down on the Modern Side But his work lay elsewhere He organized If no organization existed he would create one If one did exist he would modify it An organization he would say is after all not an end in itself It must contribute to a movement When one good custom seemed likely to corrupt the school he was ready with another he believed that without innumerable customs there was no safety either for boys or men Perhaps he is right and always will be right Perhaps each of us would go to ruin if for one short hour we acted as we thought fit and attempted the service of perfect freedom The school caps with their elaborate symbolism were his his the many tinted bathing drawers that showed how far a boy could swim his the hierarchy of jerseys and blazers It was he who instituted Bounds and call and the two sorts of exercise paper and the three sorts of caning and The Sawtonian a bi terminal magazine His plump finger was in every pie The dome of his skull mild but impressive shone at every master s meeting He was generally acknowledged to be the coming man His last achievement had been the organization of the day boys They had been left too much to themselves and were weak in esprit de corps they were apt to regard home not school as the most important thing in their lives Moreover they got out of their parents hands they did their preparation any time and some times anyhow They shirked games they were out at all hours they ate what they should not they smoked they bicycled on the asphalt Now all was over Like boarders they were to be in at seven fifteen P M and were not allowed out after unless with a written order from their parent or guardian they too must work at fixed hours in the evening and before breakfast next morning from seven to eight Games were compulsory They must not go to parties in term time They must keep to bounds Of course the reform was not complete It was impossible to control the dieting though on a printed circular day parents were implored to provide simple food And it is also believed that some mothers disobeyed the rule about preparation and allowed their sons to do all the work over night and have a longer sleep in the morning But the gulf between day boys and boarders was considerably lessened and grew still narrower when the day boys too were organized into a House with house master and colours of their own Through the House said mister Pembroke one learns patriotism for the school just as through the school one learns patriotism for the country Our only course therefore is to organize the day boys into a House The headmaster agreed as he often did and the new community was formed mister Pembroke to avoid the tongues of malice had refused the post of house master for himself saying to mister Jackson who taught the sixth You keep too much in the background Here is a chance for you But this was a failure mister Jackson a scholar and a student neither felt nor conveyed any enthusiasm and when confronted with his House would say Well I don t know what we re all here for Now I should think you d better go home to your mothers He returned to his background and next term mister Pembroke was to take his place Such were the themes on which mister Pembroke discoursed to Rickie s civil ear He showed him the school and the library and the subterranean hall where the day boys might leave their coats and caps and where on festal occasions they supped He showed him mister Jackson s pretty house and whispered Were it not for his brilliant intellect it would be a case of Quickmarch He showed him the racquet court happily completed and the chapel unhappily still in need of funds Rickie was impressed but then he was impressed by everything Of course a House of day boys seemed a little shadowy after Agnes and Gerald but he imparted some reality even to that The racquet court said mister Pembroke is most gratifying We never expected to manage it this year But before the Easter holidays every boy received a subscription card and was given to understand that he must collect thirty shillings You will scarcely believe me but they nearly all responded Next term there was a dinner in the great school and all who had collected not thirty shillings but as much as a pound were invited to it for naturally one was not precise for a few shillings the response being the really valuable thing Practically the whole school had to come They must enjoy the court tremendously Ah it isn t used very much Racquets as I daresay you know is rather an expensive game Only the wealthier boys play and I m sorry to say that it is not of our wealthier boys that we are always the proudest But the point is that no public school can be called first class until it has one They are building them right and left And now you must finish the chapel Now we must complete the chapel He paused reverently and said And here is a fragment of the original building Rickie at once had a rush of sympathy He too looked with reverence at the morsel of Jacobean brickwork ruddy and beautiful amidst the machine squared stones of the modern apse The two men who had so little in common were thrilled with patriotism They rejoiced that their country was great noble and old Thank God I m English said Rickie suddenly Thank Him indeed said mister Pembroke laying a hand on his back We ve been nearly as great as the Greeks I do believe Greater I m sure than the Italians though they did get closer to beauty Greater than the French though we do take all their ideas I can t help thinking that England is immense English literature certainly mister Pembroke removed his hand He found such patriotism somewhat craven Genuine patriotism comes only from the heart It knows no parleying with reason English ladies will declare abroad that there are no fogs in London and mister Pembroke though he would not go to this was only restrained by the certainty of being found out On this occasion he remarked that the Greeks lacked spiritual insight and had a low conception of woman As to women oh there they were dreadful said Rickie leaning his hand on the chapel I realize that more and more But as to spiritual insight I don t quite like to say and I find Plato too difficult but I know men who don t and I fancy they mightn t agree with you Far be it from me to disparage Plato And for philosophy as a whole I have the greatest respect But it is the crown of a man s education not the foundation Myself I read it with the utmost profit but I have known endless trouble result from boys who attempt it too soon before they were set But if those boys had died first cried Rickie with sudden vehemence without knowing what there is to know Or isn t to know said mister Pembroke sarcastically Or what there isn t to know Exactly That s it My dear Rickie what do you mean If an old friend may be frank you are talking great rubbish And with a few well worn formulae he propped up the young man s orthodoxy The props were unnecessary Rickie had his own equilibrium Neither the Revivalism that assails a boy at about the age of fifteen nor the scepticism that meets him five years later could sway him from his allegiance to the church into which he had been born But his equilibrium was personal and the secret of it useless to others He desired that each man should find his own What does philosophy do the propper continued Does it make a man happier in life Does it make him die more peacefully I fancy that in the long run Herbert Spencer will get no further than the rest of us Ah Rickie I wish you could move among the school boys and see their healthy contempt for all they cannot touch Here he was going too far and had to add Their spiritual capacities of course are another matter Then he remembered the Greeks and said Which proves my original statement Submissive signs as of one propped appeared in Rickie s face mister Pembroke then questioned him about the men who found Plato not difficult But here he kept silence patting the school chapel gently and presently the conversation turned to topics with which they were both more competent to deal Does Agnes take much interest in the school Not as much as she did It is the result of her engagement If our naughty soldier had not carried her off she might have made an ideal schoolmaster s wife I often chaff him about it for he a little despises the intellectual professions Natural perfectly natural How can a man who faces death feel as we do towards mensa or tupto Perfectly true Absolutely true mister Pembroke remarked to himself that Frederick was improving If a man shoots straight and hits straight and speaks straight if his heart is in the right place if he has the instincts of a Christian and a gentleman then I at all events ask no better husband for my sister How could you get a better he cried Do you remember the thing in The Clouds And he quoted as well as he could from the invitation of the Dikaios Logos the description of the young Athenian perfect in body placid in mind who neglects his work at the Bar and trains all day among the woods and meadows with a garland on his head and a friend to set the pace the scent of new leaves is upon them they rejoice in the freshness of spring over their heads the plane tree whispers to the elm perhaps the most glorious invitation to the brainless life that has ever been given Yes yes said mister Pembroke who did not want a brother in law out of Aristophanes Nor had he got one for mister Dawes would not have bothered over the garland or noticed the spring and would have complained that the friend ran too slowly or too fast And as for her But he could think of no classical parallel for Agnes She slipped between examples A kindly Medea a Cleopatra with a sense of duty these suggested her a little She was not born in Greece but came overseas to it a dark intelligent princess With all her splendour there were hints of splendour still hidden hints of an older richer and more mysterious land He smiled at the idea of her being not there Ansell clever as he was had made a bad blunder She had more reality than any other woman in the world mister Pembroke looked pleased at this boyish enthusiasm He was fond of his sister though he knew her to be full of faults Yes I envy her he said She has found a worthy helpmeet for life s journey I do believe And though they chafe at the long engagement it is a blessing in disguise They learn to know each other thoroughly before contracting more intimate ties Rickie did not assent The length of the engagement seemed to him unspeakably cruel Here were two people who loved each other and they could not marry for years because they had no beastly money Not all Herbert s pious skill could make this out a blessing It was bad enough being so rich at the Silts here he was more ashamed of it than ever In a few weeks he would come of age and his money be his own What a pity things were so crookedly arranged He did not want money or at all events he did not want so much Suppose he meditated for he became much worried over this suppose I had a hundred pounds a year less than I shall have Well I should still have enough I don t want anything but food lodging clothes and now and then a railway fare I haven t any tastes I don t collect anything or play games Books are nice to have but after all there is Mudie s or if it comes to that the Free Library Oh my profession I forgot I shall have a profession Well that will leave me with more to spare than ever And he supposed away till he lost touch with the world and with what it permits and committed an unpardonable sin It happened towards the end of his visit another airless day of that mild January mister Dawes was playing against a scratch team of cads and had to go down to the ground in the morning to settle something Rickie proposed to come too Hitherto he had been no nuisance You will be frightfully bored said Agnes observing the cloud on her lover s face And Gerald walks like a maniac I had a little thought of the Museum this morning said mister Pembroke It is very strong in flint arrow heads Ah that s your line Rickie I do envy you and Herbert the way you enjoy the past I almost think I ll go with Dawes if he ll have me I can walk quite fast just to the ground and back Arrowheads are wonderful but I don t really enjoy them yet though I hope I shall in time mister Pembroke was offended but Rickie held firm In a quarter of an hour he was back at the house alone nearly crying Oh did the wretch go too fast called Miss Pembroke from her bedroom window I went too fast for him He spoke quite sharply and before he had time to say he was sorry and didn t mean exactly that the window had shut They ve quarrelled she thought Whatever about She soon heard Gerald returned in a cold stormy temper Rickie had offered him money My dear fellow don t be so cross The child s mad If it was I d forgive that But I can t stand unhealthiness Now Gerald that s where I hate you You don t know what it is to pity the weak Woman s job So you wish I d taken a hundred pounds a year from him Did you ever hear such blasted cheek Marry us he you and me a hundred pounds down and as much annual he of course to pry into all we did and we to kowtow and eat dirt pie to him If that s mister Rickety Elliot s idea of a soldier and an Englishman it isn t mine and I wish I d had a horse whip She was roaring with laughter You re babies a pair of you and you re the worst Why couldn t you let the little silly down gently There he was puffing and sniffing under my window and I thought he d insulted you Why didn t you accept Accept he thundered It would have taken the nonsense out of him for ever Why he was only talking out of a book More fool he Well don t be angry with a fool He means no harm He muddles all day with poetry and old dead people and then tries to bring it into life It s too funny for words Gerald repeated that he could not stand unhealthiness I don t call that exactly unhealthy I do And why he could give the money s worse What do you mean He became shy I hadn t meant to tell you It s not quite for a lady For like most men who are rather animal he was intellectually a prude He says he can t ever marry owing to his foot It wouldn t be fair to posterity His grandfather was crocked his father too and he s as bad He thinks that it s hereditary and may get worse next generation He s discussed it all over with other Undergrads A bright lot they must be He daren t risk having any children Hence the hundred quid She stopped laughing Oh little beast if he said all that He was encouraged to proceed Hitherto he had not talked about their school days Now he told her everything the barley sugar as he called it the pins in chapel and how one afternoon he had tied him head downward on to a tree trunk and then ran away of course only for a moment For this she scolded him well But she had a thrill of joy when she thought of the weak boy in the clutches of the strong one V Gerald died that afternoon He was broken up in the football match Rickie and mister Pembroke were on the ground when the accident took place It was no good torturing him by a drive to the hospital and he was merely carried to the little pavilion and laid upon the floor A doctor came and so did a clergyman but it seemed better to leave him for the last few minutes with Agnes who had ridden down on her bicycle It was a strange lamentable interview The girl was so accustomed to health that for a time she could not understand It must be a joke that he chose to lie there in the dust with a rug over him and his knees bent up towards his chin His arms were as she knew them and their admirable muscles showed clear and clean beneath the jersey The face too though a little flushed was uninjured it must be some curious joke Gerald what have you been doing He replied I can t see you It s too dark Oh I ll soon alter that she said in her old brisk way She opened the pavilion door The people who were standing by it moved aside She saw a deserted meadow steaming and grey and beyond it slateroofed cottages row beside row climbing a shapeless hill Towards London the sky was yellow There That s better She sat down by him again and drew his hand into her own Now we are all right aren t we Where are you This time she could not reply What is it Where am I going Wasn t the rector here said she after a silence He explained heaven and thinks that I but I couldn t tell a parson but I don t seem to have any use for any of the things there We are Christians said Agnes shyly Dear love we don t talk about these things but we believe them I think that you will get well and be as strong again as ever but in any case there is a spiritual life and we know that some day you and I I shan t do as a spirit he interrupted sighing pitifully I want you as I am and it cannot be managed The rector had to say so I want I don t want to talk I can t see you Shut that door She obeyed and crept into his arms Only this time her grasp was the stronger Her heart beat louder and louder as the sound of his grew more faint He was crying like a little frightened child and her lips were wet with his tears Bear it bravely she told him I can t he whispered It isn t to be done I can t see you and passed from her trembling with open eyes She rode home on her bicycle leaving the others to follow Some ladies who did not know what had happened bowed and smiled as she passed and she returned their salute Oh miss is it true cried the cook her face streaming with tears Agnes nodded Presumably it was true Letters had just arrived one was for Gerald from his mother Life which had given them no warning seemed to make no comment now The incident was outside nature and would surely pass away like a dream She felt slightly irritable and the grief of the servants annoyed her They sobbed Ah look at his marks Ah little he thought little he thought In the brown holland strip by the front door a heavy football boot had left its impress They had not liked Gerald but he was a man they were women he had died Their mistress ordered them to leave her For many minutes she sat at the foot of the stairs rubbing her eyes An obscure spiritual crisis was going on Should she weep like the servants Or should she bear up and trust in the consoler Time Was the death of a man so terrible after all As she invited herself to apathy there were steps on the gravel and Rickie Elliot burst in He was splashed with mud his breath was gone and his hair fell wildly over his meagre face She thought These are the people who are left alive From the bottom of her soul she hated him I came to see what you re doing he cried Resting He knelt beside her and she said Would you please go away Yes dear Agnes of course but I must see first that you mind Her breath caught Her eves moved to the treads going outwards so firmly so irretrievably He panted It s the worst thing that can ever happen to you in all your life and you ve got to mind it you ve got to mind it They ll come saying Bear up trust to time No no they re wrong Mind it Through all her misery she knew that this boy was greater than they supposed He rose to his feet and with intense conviction cried But I know I understand It s your death as well as his He s gone Agnes and his arms will never hold you again In God s name mind such a thing and don t sit fencing with your soul Don t stop being great that s the one crime he ll never forgive you She faltered Who who forgives Gerald At the sound of his name she slid forward and all her dishonesty left her She acknowledged that life s meaning had vanished Bending down she kissed the footprint How can he forgive me she sobbed Where has he gone to You could never dream such an awful thing He couldn t see me though I opened the door wide plenty of light and then he could not remember the things that should comfort him He wasn t a he wasn t ever a great reader and he couldn t remember the things The rector tried and he couldn t I came and I couldn t She could not speak for tears Rickie did not check her He let her accuse herself and fate and Herbert who had postponed their marriage She might have been a wife six months but Herbert had spoken of self control and of all life before them He let her kiss the footprints till their marks gave way to the marks of her lips She moaned He is gone where is he and then he replied quite quietly He is in heaven She begged him not to comfort her she could not bear it I did not come to comfort you I came to see that you mind He is in heaven Agnes The greatest thing is over Her hatred was lulled She murmured Dear Rickie and held up her hand to him Through her tears his meagre face showed as a seraph s who spoke the truth and forbade her to juggle with her soul Dear Rickie but for the rest of my life what am I to do Anything if you remember that the greatest thing is over I don t know you she said tremulously You have grown up in a moment You never talked to us and yet you understand it all Tell me again I can only trust you where he is He is in heaven You are sure It puzzled her that Rickie who could scarcely tell you the time without a saving clause should be so certain about immortality VI 
2060_150843_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He did not stop for the funeral 
2060_150843_000006_000001	train-clean-360	mister Pembroke thought that he had a bad effect on Agnes and prevented her from acquiescing in the tragedy as rapidly as she might have done 
2060_150843_000006_000002	train-clean-360	As he expressed it one must not court sorrow and he hinted to the young man that they desired to be alone 
2060_150843_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Rickie went back to the Silts 
2060_150843_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He was only there a few days 
none	none	As soon as term opened he returned to Cambridge for which he longed passionately The journey thither was now familiar to him and he took pleasure in each landmark 
2060_150843_000008_000003	train-clean-360	The fair valley of Tewin Water the cutting into Hitchin where the train traverses the chalk Baldock Church Royston with its promise of downs were nothing in themselves but dear as stages in the pilgrimage towards the abode of peace 
2060_150843_000008_000004	train-clean-360	On the platform he met friends 
2060_150843_000008_000005	train-clean-360	They had all had pleasant vacations it was a happy world 
2060_150843_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The atmosphere alters 
2060_150843_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Cambridge according to her custom welcomed her sons with open drains Pettycury was up so was Trinity Street and navvies peeped out of King s Parade 
2060_150843_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Here it was gas there electric light but everywhere something and always a smell 
none	none	It was also the day that the wheels fell off the station tram and Rickie who was naturally inside was among the passengers who sustained no injury but a shock and had as hearty a laugh over the mishap afterwards as any one 
2060_150843_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Tilliard fled into a hansom cursing himself for having tried to do the thing cheaply 
none	none	Hornblower also swept past yelling derisively with his luggage neatly piled above his head Let s get out and walk muttered Ansell 
2060_150843_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But Rickie was succouring a distressed female missus 
none	none	Aberdeen
2060_150843_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh missus Aberdeen I never saw you I am so glad to see you I am so very glad missus Aberdeen was cold 
2060_150843_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She did not like being spoken to outside the college and was also distrait about her basket 
none	none	Hitherto no genteel eye had even seen inside it but in the collision its little calico veil fell off and there was revealed nothing 
2060_150843_000011_000003	train-clean-360	The basket was empty and never would hold anything illegal 
none	none	All the same she was distrait and We shall meet later sir I dessy was all the greeting Rickie got from her Now what kind of a life has missus Aberdeen he exclaimed as he and Ansell pursued the Station Road Here these bedders come and make us comfortable We owe an enormous amount to them their wages are absurd and we know nothing about them Off they go to Barnwell and then their lives are hidden I just know that missus Aberdeen has a husband but that s all 
2060_150843_000012_000005	train-clean-360	She never will talk about him 
none	none	Now I do so want to fill in her life I see one half of it 
2060_150843_000012_000008	train-clean-360	What s the other half 
none	none	She may have a real jolly house in good taste with a little garden and books and pictures Or again she mayn t But in any case one ought to know 
2060_150843_000012_000012	train-clean-360	I know she d dislike it but she oughtn t to dislike 
2060_150843_000012_000013	train-clean-360	After all bedders are to blame for the present lamentable state of things just as much as gentlefolk 
2060_150843_000012_000014	train-clean-360	She ought to want me to come 
2060_150843_000012_000015	train-clean-360	She ought to introduce me to her husband 
2060_150843_000013_000000	train-clean-360	They had reached the corner of Hills Road 
none	none	Ansell spoke for the first time He said Ugh Drains Yes A spiritual cesspool Rickie laughed
2060_150843_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I expected it from your letter 
none	none	The one you never answered I answer none of your letters You are quite hopeless by now 
2060_150843_000019_000002	train-clean-360	You can go to the bad 
2060_150843_000019_000003	train-clean-360	But I refuse to accompany you 
none	none	I refuse to believe that every human being is a moving wonder of supreme interest and tragedy and beauty which was what the letter in question amounted to You ll find plenty who will believe it It s a very popular view among people who are too idle to think it saves them the trouble of detecting the beautiful from the ugly the interesting from the dull the tragic from the melodramatic You had just come from Sawston and were apparently carried away by the fact that Miss Pembroke had the usual amount of arms and legs Rickie was silent He had told his friend how he felt but not what had happened Ansell could discuss love and death admirably but somehow he would not understand lovers or a dying man and in the letter there had been scant allusion to these concrete facts Would Cambridge understand them either He watched some dons who were peeping into an excavation and throwing up their hands with humorous gestures of despair These men would lecture next week on Catiline s conspiracy on Luther on Evolution on Catullus 
2060_150843_000020_000006	train-clean-360	They dealt with so much and they had experienced so little 
2060_150843_000020_000007	train-clean-360	Was it possible he would ever come to think Cambridge narrow In his short life Rickie had known two sudden deaths and that is enough to disarrange any placid outlook on the world 
none	none	He knew once for all that we are all of us bubbles on an extremely rough sea Into this sea humanity has built as it were some little breakwaters scientific knowledge civilized restraint so that the bubbles do not break so frequently or so soon But the sea has not altered and it was only a chance that he Ansell Tilliard and missus Aberdeen had not all been killed in the tram 
2060_150843_000021_000000	train-clean-360	They waited for the other tram by the Roman Catholic Church whose florid bulk was already receding into twilight 
none	none	It is the first big building that the incoming visitor sees Oh here come the colleges cries the Protestant parent and then learns that it was built by a Papist who made a fortune out of movable eyes for dolls
2060_150843_000021_000003	train-clean-360	 Built out of doll s eyes to contain idols that at all events is the legend and the joke 
2060_150843_000021_000004	train-clean-360	It watches over the apostate city taller by many a yard than anything within and asserting however wildly that here is eternity stability and bubbles unbreakable upon a windless sea 
2060_150843_000022_000000	train-clean-360	A costly hymn tune announced five o clock and in the distance the more lovable note of saint Mary s could be heard speaking from the heart of the town 
2060_150843_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Then the tram arrived the slow stuffy tram that plies every twenty minutes between the unknown and the marketplace and took them past the desecrated grounds of Downing past Addenbrookes Hospital girt like a Venetian palace with a mantling canal past the Fitz William towering upon immense substructions like any Roman temple right up to the gates of one s own college which looked like nothing else in the world 
none	none	The porters were glad to see them but wished it had been a hansom
2060_150843_000022_000003	train-clean-360	 Our luggage explained Rickie comes in the hotel omnibus if you would kindly pay a shilling for mine Ansell turned aside to some large lighted windows the abode of a hospitable don and from other windows there floated familiar voices and the familiar mistakes in a Beethoven sonata 
none	none	The college though small was civilized and proud of its civilization 
2060_150843_000022_000005	train-clean-360	It was not sufficient glory to be a Blue there nor an additional glory to get drunk 
2060_150843_000022_000006	train-clean-360	Many a maiden lady who had read that Cambridge men were sad dogs was surprised and perhaps a little disappointed at the reasonable life which greeted her 
2060_150843_000022_000007	train-clean-360	Miss Appleblossom in particular had had a tremendous shock 
none	none	The sight of young fellows making tea and drinking water had made her wonder whether this was Cambridge College at all It is so she exclaimed afterwards It is just as I say and what s more I wouldn t have it otherwise Stewart says it s as easy as easy to get into the swim and not at all expensive The direction of the swim was determined a little by the genius of the place for places have a genius though the less we talk about it the better and a good deal by the tutors and resident fellows who treated with rare dexterity the products that came up yearly from the public schools 
2060_150843_000022_000011	train-clean-360	They taught the perky boy that he was not everything and the limp boy that he might be something 
2060_150843_000022_000012	train-clean-360	They even welcomed those boys who were neither limp nor perky but odd those boys who had never been at a public school at all and such do not find a welcome everywhere 
2060_150843_000022_000013	train-clean-360	And they did everything with ease one might almost say with nonchalance so that the boys noticed nothing and received education often for the first time in their lives 
none	none	But Rickie turned to none of these friends for just then he loved his rooms better than any person 
2060_150843_000023_000001	train-clean-360	They were all he really possessed in the world the only place he could call his own 
2060_150843_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Over the door was his name and through the paint like a grey ghost he could still read the name of his predecessor 
none	none	With a sigh of joy he entered the perishable home that was his for a couple of years 
2060_150843_000023_000004	train-clean-360	There was a beautiful fire and the kettle boiled at once 
2060_150843_000023_000005	train-clean-360	He made tea on the hearth rug and ate the biscuits which missus Aberdeen had brought for him up from Anderson s Gentlemen she said must learn to give and take He sighed again and again like one who had escaped from danger 
none	none	With his head on the fender and all his limbs relaxed he felt almost as safe as he felt once when his mother killed a ghost in the passage by carrying him through it in her arms 
2060_150843_000023_000007	train-clean-360	There was no ghost now he was frightened at reality he was frightened at the splendours and horrors of the world 
2060_150843_000024_000000	train-clean-360	A letter from Miss Pembroke was on the table 
none	none	He did not hurry to open it for she and all that she did was overwhelming 
2060_150843_000024_000002	train-clean-360	She wrote like the Sibyl her sorrowful face moved over the stars and shattered their harmonies last night he saw her with the eyes of Blake a virgin widow tall veiled consecrated with her hands stretched out against an everlasting wind 
2060_150843_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Why should she write 
2060_150843_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Her letters were not for the likes of him nor to be read in rooms like his 
2060_150843_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 We are not leaving Sawston she wrote 
none	none	I saw how selfish it was of me to risk spoiling Herbert s career I shall get used to any place Now that he is gone nothing of that sort can matter Every one has been most kind but you have comforted me most though you did not mean to I cannot think how you did it or understood so much I still think of you as a little boy with a lame leg I know you will let me say this and yet when it came to the point you knew more than people who have been all their lives with sorrow and death 
2060_150843_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Rickie burnt this letter which he ought not to have done for it was one of the few tributes Miss Pembroke ever paid to imagination 
2060_150843_000026_000001	train-clean-360	But he felt that it did not belong to him words so sincere should be for Gerald alone 
none	none	The smoke rushed up the chimney and he indulged in a vision 
2060_150843_000026_000003	train-clean-360	He saw it reach the outer air and beat against the low ceiling of clouds 
2060_150843_000026_000004	train-clean-360	The clouds were too strong for it but in them was one chink revealing one star and through this the smoke escaped into the light of stars innumerable 
none	none	Then but then the vision failed and the voice of science whispered that all smoke remains on earth in the form of smuts and is troublesome to missus Aberdeen
2060_150843_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I am jolly unpractical he mused 
none	none	And what is the point of it when real things are so wonderful

2060_150843_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And so Rickie deflected his enthusiasms

through the imagination And if the orderly people are English they add that one is the inferior method and characteristic of the South It is inferior Yet those who pursue it at all events know what they want they are not puzzling to themselves or ludicrous to others they do not take the wings of the morning and fly into the uttermost parts of the sea before walking to the registry office they cannot breed a tragedy quite like Rickie s He is of course absurdly young not twenty one and he will be engaged to be married at twenty three He has no knowledge of the world for example he thinks that if you do not want money you can give it to friends who do He believes in humanity because he knows a dozen decent people He believes in women because he has loved his mother And his friends are as young and as ignorant as himself They are full of the wine of life But they have not tasted the cup let us call it the teacup of experience which has made men of mister Pembroke s type what they are Oh that teacup To be taken at prayers at friendship at love till we are quite sane efficient quite experienced and quite useless to God or man We must drink it or we shall die But we need not drink it always Here is our problem and our salvation There comes a moment God knows when at which we can say I will experience no longer I will create I will be an experience But to do this we must be both acute and heroic For it is not easy after accepting six cups of tea to throw the seventh in the face of the hostess And to Rickie this moment has not as yet been offered Ansell at the end of his third year got a first in the Moral Science Tripos Being a scholar he kept his rooms in college and at once began to work for a Fellowship Rickie got a creditable second in the Classical Tripos Part I and retired to sallow lodgings in Mill bane carrying with him the degree of B A and a small exhibition which was quite as much as he deserved For Part II he read Greek Archaeology and got a second All this means that Ansell was much cleverer than Rickie As for the cow she was still going strong though turning a little academic as the years passed over her We are bound to get narrow sighed Rickie He and his friend were lying in a meadow during their last summer term In his incurable love for flowers he had plaited two garlands of buttercups and cow parsley and Ansell s lean Jewish face was framed in one of them Cambridge is wonderful but but it s so tiny You have no idea at least I think you have no idea how the great world looks down on it I read the letters in the papers It s a bad look out How Cambridge has lost touch with the times Was she ever intended to touch them She satisfies said Rickie mysteriously neither the professions nor the public schools nor the great thinking mass of men and women There is a general feeling that her day is over and naturally one feels pretty sick Do you still write short stories Because your English has gone to the devil You think and talk in Journalese Define a great thinking mass Rickie sat up and adjusted his floral crown Estimate the worth of a general feeling Silence And thirdly where is the great world Oh that Yes That exclaimed Ansell rising from his couch in violent excitement Where is it How do you set about finding it How long does it take to get there What does it think What does it do What does it want Oblige me with specimens of its art and literature Silence Till you do my opinions will be as follows There is no great world at all only a little earth for ever isolated from the rest of the little solar system The earth is full of tiny societies and Cambridge is one of them All the societies are narrow but some are good and some are bad just as one house is beautiful inside and another ugly Observe the metaphor of the houses I am coming back to it The good societies say I tell you to do this because I am Cambridge The bad ones say I tell you to do that because I am the great world not because I am Peckham or Billingsgate or Park Lane but because I am the great world They lie And fools like you listen to them and believe that they are a thing which does not exist and never has existed and confuse great which has no meaning whatever with good which means salvation Look at this great wreath it ll be dead tomorrow Look at that good flower it ll come up again next year Now for the other metaphor To compare the world to Cambridge is like comparing the outsides of houses with the inside of a house No intellectual effort is needed no moral result is attained You only have to say Oh what a difference and then come indoors again and exhibit your broadened mind I never shall come indoors again said Rickie That s the whole point And his voice began to quiver It s well enough for those who ll get a Fellowship but in a few weeks I shall go down In a few years it ll be as if I ve never been up It matters very much to me what the world is like I can t answer your questions about it and that s no loss to you but so much the worse for me And then you ve got a house not a metaphorical one but a house with father and sisters I haven t and never shall have There ll never again be a home for me like Cambridge I shall only look at the outside of homes According to your metaphor I shall live in the street and it matters very much to me what I find there You ll live in another house right enough said Ansell rather uneasily Only take care you pick out a decent one I can t think why you flop about so helplessly like a bit of seaweed In four years you ve taken as much root as any one Where I should say you ve been fortunate in your friends Oh that But he was not cynical or cynical in a very tender way He was thinking of the irony of friendship so strong it is and so fragile We fly together like straws in an eddy to part in the open stream Nature has no use for us she has cut her stuff differently Dutiful sons loving husbands responsible fathers these are what she wants and if we are friends it must be in our spare time Abram and Sarai were sorrowful yet their seed became as sand of the sea and distracts the politics of Europe at this moment But a few verses of poetry is all that survives of David and Jonathan I wish we were labelled said Rickie He wished that all the confidence and mutual knowledge that is born in such a place as Cambridge could be organized People went down into the world saying We know and like each other we shan t forget But they did forget for man is so made that he cannot remember long without a symbol he wished there was a society a kind of friendship office where the marriage of true minds could be registered Why labels To know each other again I have taught you pessimism splendidly He looked at his watch What time Not twelve Rickie got up Why go He stretched out his hand and caught hold of Rickie s ankle I ve got that Miss Pembroke to lunch that girl whom you say never s there Then why go All this week you have pretended Miss Pembroke awaited you Wednesday Miss Pembroke to lunch Thursday Miss Pembroke to tea Now again and you didn t even invite her To Cambridge no But the Hall man they re stopping with has so many engagements that she and her friend can often come to me I m glad to say I don t think I ever told you much but over two years ago the man she was going to marry was killed at football She nearly died of grief This visit to Cambridge is almost the first amusement she has felt up to taking Oh they go back tomorrow Give me breakfast tomorrow All right But I shall see you this evening I shall be round at your paper on Schopenhauer Lemme go Don t go he said idly It s much better for you to talk to me Lemme go Stewart It s amusing that you re so feeble You simply can t get away I wish I wanted to bully you Rickie laughed and suddenly over balanced into the grass Ansell with unusual playfulness held him prisoner They lay there for few minutes talking and ragging aimlessly Then Rickie seized his opportunity and jerked away Go go yawned the other But he was a little vexed for he was a young man with great capacity for pleasure and it pleased him that morning to be with his friend The thought of two ladies waiting lunch did not deter him stupid women why shouldn t they wait Why should they interfere with their betters With his ear on the ground he listened to Rickie s departing steps and thought He wastes a lot of time keeping engagements Why will he be pleasant to fools And then he thought Why has he turned so unhappy It isn t as it he s a philosopher or tries to solve the riddle of existence And he s got money of his own Thus thinking he fell asleep Meanwhile Rickie hurried away from him and slackened and stopped and hurried again He was due at the Union in ten minutes but he could not bring himself there He dared not meet Miss Pembroke he loved her The devil must have planned it They had started so gloriously she had been a goddess both in joy and sorrow She was a goddess still But he had dethroned the god whom once he had glorified equally Slowly slowly the image of Gerald had faded That was the first step Rickie had thought No matter He will be bright again Just now all the radiance chances to be in her And on her he had fixed his eyes He thought of her awake He entertained her willingly in dreams He found her in poetry and music and in the sunset She made him kind and strong She made him clever Through her he kept Cambridge in its proper place and lived as a citizen of the great world But one night he dreamt that she lay in his arms This displeased him He determined to think a little about Gerald instead Then the fabric collapsed It was hard on Rickie thus to meet the devil He did not deserve it for he was comparatively civilized and knew that there was nothing shameful in love But to love this woman If only it had been any one else Love in return that he could expect from no one being too ugly and too unattractive But the love he offered would not then have been vile The insult to Miss Pembroke who was consecrated and whom he had consecrated who could still see Gerald and always would see him shining on his everlasting throne this was the crime from the devil the crime that no penance would ever purge She knew nothing She never would know But the crime was registered in heaven He had been tempted to confide in Ansell But to what purpose He would say I love Miss Pembroke and Stewart would reply You ass And then I m never going to tell her You ass again After all it was not a practical question Agnes would never hear of his fall If his friend had been as he expressed it labelled if he had been a father or still better a brother one might tell him of the discreditable passion But why irritate him for no reason Thinking I am always angling for sympathy I must stop myself he hurried onward to the Union He found his guests half way up the stairs reading the advertisements of coaches for the Long Vacation He heard missus Lewin say I wonder what he ll end by doing A little overacting his part he apologized nonchalantly for his lateness It s always the same cried Agnes Last time he forgot I was coming altogether She wore a flowered muslin something indescribably liquid and cool It reminded him a little of those swift piercing streams neither blue nor green that gush out of the dolomites Her face was clear and brown like the face of a mountaineer her hair was so plentiful that it seemed banked up above it and her little toque though it answered the note of the dress was almost ludicrous poised on so much natural glory When she moved the sunlight flashed on her ear rings He led them up to the luncheon room By now he was conscious of his limitations as a host and never attempted to entertain ladies in his lodgings Moreover the Union seemed less intimate It had a faint flavour of a London club it marked the undergraduate s nearest approach to the great world Amid its waiters and serviettes one felt impersonal and able to conceal the private emotions Rickie felt that if Miss Pembroke knew one thing about him she knew everything During this visit he took her to no place that he greatly loved Sit down ladies Fall to I m sorry I was out towards Coton with a dreadful friend missus Lewin pushed up her veil She was a typical May term chaperon always pleasant always hungry and always tired Year after year she came up to Cambridge in a tight silk dress and year after year she nearly died of it Her feet hurt her limbs were cramped in a canoe black spots danced before her eyes from eating too much mayonnaise But still she came if not as a mother as an aunt if not as an aunt as a friend Still she ascended the roof of King s still she counted the balls of Clare still she was on the point of grasping the organization of the May races And who is your friend she asked His name is Ansell Well now did I see him two years ago as a bedmaker in something they did at the Foot Lights Oh how I roared You didn t see mister Ansell at the Foot Lights said Agnes smiling How do you know asked Rickie He d scarcely be so frivolous Do you remember seeing him For a moment What a memory she had And how splendidly during that moment she had behaved Isn t he marvellously clever I believe so Oh give me clever people cried missus Lewin They are kindness itself at the Hall but I assure you I am depressed at times One cannot talk bump rowing for ever I never hear about him Rickie but isn t he really your greatest friend I don t go in for greatest friends Do you mean you like us all equally All differently those of you I like Ah you ve caught it cried missus Lewin mister Elliot gave it you there well Agnes laughed and her elbows on the table regarded them both through her fingers a habit of hers Then she said Can t we see the great mister Ansell Oh let s Or would he frighten me He would frighten you said Rickie He s a trifle weird My good Rickie if you knew the deathly dullness of Sawston every one saying the proper thing at the proper time I so proper Herbert so proper Why weirdness is the one thing I long for Do arrange something I m afraid there s no opportunity Ansell goes some vast bicycle ride this afternoon this evening you re tied up at the Hall and tomorrow you go But there s breakfast tomorrow said Agnes Look here Rickie bring mister Ansell to breakfast with us at Buoys missus Lewin seconded the invitation Bad luck again said Rickie boldly I m already fixed up for breakfast I ll tell him of your very kind intention Let s have him alone murmured Agnes My dear girl I should die through the floor Oh it ll be all right about breakfast I rather think we shall get asked this evening by that shy man who has the pretty rooms in Trinity Oh very well Where is it you breakfast Rickie He faltered To Ansell s it is It seemed as if he was making some great admission So self conscious was he that he thought the two women exchanged glances Had Agnes already explored that part of him that did not belong to her Would another chance step reveal the part that did He asked them abruptly what they would like to do after lunch Anything said missus Lewin anything in the world A walk A boat Ely A drive Some objection was raised to each To tell the truth she said at last I do feel a wee bit tired and what occurs to me is this You and Agnes shall leave me here and have no more bother I shall be perfectly happy snoozling in one of these delightful drawing room chairs Do what you like and then pick me up after it Alas it s against regulations said Rickie The Union won t trust lady visitors on its premises alone But who s to know I m alone With a lot of men in the drawing room how s each to know that I m not with the others That would shock Rickie said Agnes laughing He s frightfully high principled No I m not said Rickie thinking of his recent shiftiness over breakfast Then come for a walk with me I want exercise Some connection of ours was once rector of Madingley I shall walk out and see the church missus Lewin was accordingly left in the Union This is jolly Agnes exclaimed as she strode along the somewhat depressing road that leads out of Cambridge past the observatory Do I go too fast No thank you I get stronger every year If it wasn t for the look of the thing I should be quite happy But you don t care for the look of the thing It s only ignorant people who do that surely Perhaps I care I like people who are well made and beautiful They are of some use in the world I understand why they are there I cannot understand why the ugly and crippled are there however healthy they may feel inside Don t you know how Turner spoils his pictures by introducing a man like a bolster in the foreground Well in actual life every landscape is spoilt by men of worse shapes still You sound like a bolster with the stuffing out They laughed She always blew his cobwebs away like this with a puff of humorous mountain air Just now the associations he attached to her were various she reminded him of a heroine of Meredith s but a heroine at the end of the book All had been written about her She had played her mighty part and knew that it was over He and he alone was not content and wrote for her daily a trivial and impossible sequel Last time they had talked about Gerald But that was some six months ago when things felt easier Today Gerald was the faintest blur Fortunately the conversation turned to mister Pembroke and to education Did women lose a lot by not knowing Greek A heap said Rickie roughly But modern languages Thus they got to Germany which he had visited last Easter with Ansell and thence to the German Emperor and what a to do he made and from him to our own king still Prince of Wales who had lived while an undergraduate at Madingley Hall Here it was And all the time he thought It is hard on her She has no right to be walking with me She would be ill with disgust if she knew It is hard on her to be loved They looked at the Hall and went inside the pretty little church Some Arundel prints hung upon the pillars and Agnes expressed the opinion that pictures inside a place of worship were a pity Rickie did not agree with this He said again that nothing beautiful was ever to be regretted You re cracked on beauty she whispered they were still inside the church Do hurry up and write something Something beautiful I believe you can I m going to lecture you seriously all the way home Take care that you don t waste your life They continued the conversation outside But I ve got to hate my own writing I believe that most people come to that stage not so early though What I write is too silly It can t happen For instance a stupid vulgar man is engaged to a lovely young lady He wants her to live in the towns but she only cares for woods She shocks him this way and that but gradually he tames her and makes her nearly as dull as he is One day she has a last explosion over the snobby wedding presents and flies out of the drawing room window shouting Freedom and truth Near the house is a little dell full of fir trees and she runs into it He comes there the next moment But she s gone Awfully exciting Where Oh Lord she s a Dryad cried Rickie in great disgust She s turned into a tree Rickie it s very good indeed The kind of thing has something in it Of course you get it all through Greek and Latin How upset the man must be when he sees the girl turn He doesn t see her He never guesses Such a man could never see a Dryad So you describe how she turns just before he comes up No Indeed I don t ever say that she does turn I don t use the word Dryad once I think you ought to put that part plainly Otherwise with such an original story people might miss the point Have you had any luck with it Magazines I haven t tried I know what the stuff s worth You see a year or two ago I had a great idea of getting into touch with Nature just as the Greeks were in touch and seeing England so beautiful I used to pretend that her trees and coppices and summer fields of parsley were alive It s funny enough now but it wasn t funny then for I got in such a state that I believed actually believed that Fauns lived in a certain double hedgerow near the Cog Magogs and one evening I walked a mile sooner than go through it alone Good gracious She laid her hand on his shoulder He moved to the other side of the road It s all right now I ve changed those follies for others But while I had them I began to write and even now I keep on writing though I know better I ve got quite a pile of little stories all harping on this ridiculous idea of getting into touch with Nature I wish you weren t so modest It s simply splendid as an idea Though but tell me about the Dryad who was engaged to be married What was she like I can show you the dell in which the young person disappeared We pass it on the right in a moment It does seem a pity that you don t make something of your talents It seems such a waste to write little stories and never publish them You must have enough for a book Life is so full in our days that short stories are the very thing they get read by people who d never tackle a novel For example at our Dorcas we tried to read out a long affair by Henry James Herbert saw it recommended in The Times There was no doubt it was very good but one simply couldn t remember from one week to another what had happened So now our aim is to get something that just lasts the hour I take you seriously Rickie and that is why I am so offensive You are too modest People who think they can do nothing so often do nothing I want you to plunge It thrilled him like a trumpet blast She took him seriously Could he but thank her for her divine affability But the words would stick in his throat or worse still would bring other words along with them His breath came quickly for he seldom spoke of his writing and no one not even Ansell had advised him to plunge But do you really think that I could take up literature Why not You can try Even if you fail you can try Of course we think you tremendously clever and I met one of your dons at tea and he said that your degree was not in the least a proof of your abilities he said that you knocked up and got flurried in examinations Oh her cheek flushed I wish I was a man The whole world lies before them They can do anything They aren t cooped up with servants and tea parties and twaddle But where s this dell where the Dryad disappeared We ve passed it He had meant to pass it It was too beautiful All he had read all he had hoped for all he had loved seemed to quiver in its enchanted air It was perilous He dared not enter it with such a woman How long ago She turned back I don t want to miss the dell Here it must be she added after a few moments and sprang up the green bank that hid the entrance from the road Oh what a jolly place Go right in if you want to see it said Rickie and did not offer to go with her She stood for a moment looking at the view for a few steps will increase a view in Cambridgeshire The wind blew her dress against her Then like a cataract again she vanished pure and cool into the dell The young man thought of her feelings no longer His heart throbbed louder and louder and seemed to shake him to pieces Rickie She was calling from the dell For an answer he sat down where he was on the dust bespattered margin She could call as loud as she liked The devil had done much but he should not take him to her Rickie and it came with the tones of an angel He drove his fingers into his ears and invoked the name of Gerald But there was no sign neither angry motion in the air nor hint of January mist June fields of June sky of June songs of June Grass of June beneath him grass of June over the tragedy he had deemed immortal A bird called out of the dell Rickie A bird flew into the dell Did you take me for the Dryad she asked She was sitting down with his head on her lap He had laid it there for a moment before he went out to die and she had not let him take it away I prayed you might not be a woman he whispered Darling I am very much a woman I do not vanish into groves and trees I thought you would never come Did you expect I hoped I called hoping Inside the dell it was neither June nor January The chalk walls barred out the seasons and the fir trees did not seem to feel their passage Only from time to time the odours of summer slipped in from the wood above to comment on the waxing year She bent down to touch him with her lips He started and cried passionately Never forget that your greatest thing is over I have forgotten I am too weak You shall never forget What I said to you then is greater than what I say to you now What he gave you then is greater than anything you will get from me She was frightened Again she had the sense of something abnormal Then she said What is all this nonsense and folded him in her arms VIII Ansell stood looking at his breakfast table which was laid for four instead of two His bedmaker equally peevish explained how it had happened Last night at one in the morning the porter had been awoke with a note for the kitchens and in that note mister Elliot said that all these things were to be sent to mister Ansell s The fools have sent the original order as well Here s the lemon sole for two I can t move for food The note being ambiguous the Kitchens judged best to send it all She spoke of the kitchens in a half respectful half pitying way much as one speaks of Parliament Who s to pay for it He peeped into the new dishes Kidneys entombed in an omelette hot roast chicken in watery gravy a glazed but pallid pie And who s to wash it up said the bedmaker to her help outside Ansell had disputed late last night concerning Schopenhauer and was a little cross and tired He bounced over to Tilliard who kept opposite Tilliard was eating gooseberry jam Did Elliot ask you to breakfast with me No said Tilliard mildly Well you d better come and bring every one you know So Tilliard came bearing himself a little formally for he was not very intimate with his neighbour Out of the window they called to Widdrington But he laid his hand on his stomach thus indicating it was too late Who s to pay for it repeated Ansell as a man appeared from the Buttery carrying coffee on a bright tin tray College coffee How nice remarked Tilliard who was cutting the pie But before term ends you must come and try my new machine My sister gave it me There is a bulb at the top and as the water boils He might have counter ordered the lemon sole That s Rickie all over Violently economical and then loses his head and all the things go bad Give them to the bedder while they re hot This was done She accepted them dispassionately with the air of one who lives without nourishment Tilliard continued to describe his sister s coffee machine What s that They could hear panting and rustling on the stairs It sounds like a lady said Tilliard fearfully He slipped the piece of pie back It fell into position like a brick Is it here Am I right Is it here The door opened and in came missus Lewin Oh horrors I ve made a mistake That s all right said Ansell awkwardly I wanted mister Elliot Where are they We expect mister Elliot every moment said Tilliard Don t tell me I m right cried missus Lewin and that you re the terrifying mister Ansell And with obvious relief she wrung Tilliard warmly by the hand I m Ansell said Ansell looking very uncouth and grim How stupid of me not to know it she gasped and would have gone on to I know not what but the door opened again It was Rickie Here s Miss Pembroke he said I am going to marry her There was a profound silence We oughtn t to have done things like this said Agnes turning to missus Lewin We have no right to take mister Ansell by surprise It is Rickie s fault He was that obstinate He would bring us He ought to be horsewhipped He ought indeed said Tilliard pleasantly and bolted Not till he gained his room did he realize that he had been less apt than usual As for Ansell the first thing he said was Why didn t you counter order the lemon sole In such a situation missus Lewin was of priceless value She led the way to the table observing I quite agree with Miss Pembroke I loathe surprises Never shall I forget my horror when the knife boy painted the dove s cage with the dove inside He did it as a surprise Poor Parsival nearly died His feathers were bright green Well give me the lemon soles said Rickie I like them The bedder s got them Well there you are What s there to be annoyed about And while the cage was drying we put him among the bantams They had been the greatest allies But I suppose they took him for a parrot or a hawk or something that bantams hate for while his cage was drying they picked out his feathers and PICKED and PICKED out his feathers till he was perfectly bald Hugo look said I This is the end of Parsival Let me have no more surprises He burst into tears Thus did missus Lewin create an atmosphere At first it seemed unreal but gradually they got used to it and breathed scarcely anything else throughout the meal In such an atmosphere everything seemed of small and equal value and the engagement of Rickie and Agnes like the feathers of Parsival fluttered lightly to the ground Ansell was generally silent He was no match for these two quite clever women Only once was there a hitch They had been talking gaily enough about the betrothal when Ansell suddenly interrupted with When is the marriage mister Ansell said Agnes blushing I wish you hadn t asked that That part s dreadful Not for years as far as we can see But Rickie had not seen as far He had not talked to her of this at all Last night they had spoken only of love He exclaimed Oh Agnes don t missus Lewin laughed roguishly Why this delay asked Ansell Agnes looked at Rickie who replied I must get money worse luck I thought you d got money He hesitated and then said I must get my foot on the ladder then Ansell began with On which ladder but missus Lewin using the privilege of her sex exclaimed Not another word If there s a thing I abominate it is plans My head goes whirling at once What she really abominated was questions and she saw that Ansell was turning serious To appease him she put on her clever manner and asked him about Germany How had it impressed him Were we so totally unfitted to repel invasion Was not German scholarship overestimated He replied discourteously but he did reply and if she could have stopped him thinking her triumph would have been complete When they rose to go Agnes held Ansell s hand for a moment in her own Good bye she said It was very unconventional of us to come as we did but I don t think any of us are conventional people He only replied Good bye The ladies started off Rickie lingered behind to whisper I would have it so I would have you begin square together I can t talk yet I ve loved her for years can t think what she s done it for I m going to write short stories I shall start this afternoon She declares there may be something in me As soon as he had left Tilliard burst in white with agitation and crying Did you see my awful faux pas about the horsewhip What shall I do I must call on Elliot Or had I better write Miss Pembroke will not mind said Ansell gravely She is unconventional He knelt in an arm chair and hid his face in the back It was like a bomb said Tilliard It was meant to be I do feel a fool What must she think Never mind Tilliard You ve not been as big a fool as myself At all events you told her he must be horsewhipped Tilliard hummed a little tune He hated anything nasty and there was nastiness in Ansell What did you tell her he asked Nothing What do you think of it I think Damn those women Ah yes One hates one s friends to get engaged It makes one feel so old I think that is one of the reasons The brother just above me has lately married and my sister was quite sick about it though the thing was suitable in every way Damn THESE women then said Ansell bouncing round in the chair Damn these particular women They looked and spoke like ladies Exactly Their diplomacy was ladylike Their lies were ladylike They ve caught Elliot in a most ladylike way I saw it all during the one moment we were natural Generally we were clattering after the married one whom like a fool I took for a fool But for one moment we were natural and during that moment Miss Pembroke told a lie and made Rickie believe it was the truth What did she say She said we see instead of I see Tilliard burst into laughter This jaundiced young philosopher with his kinky view of life was too much for him She said we see repeated Ansell instead of I see and she made him believe that it was the truth She caught him and makes him believe that he caught her She came to see me and makes him think that it is his idea That is what I mean when I say that she is a lady You are too subtle for me My dull eyes could only see two happy people I never said they weren t happy Then my dear Ansell why are you so cut up It s beastly when a friend marries and I grant he s rather young but I should say it s the best thing for him A decent woman and you have proved not one thing against her a decent woman will keep him up to the mark and stop him getting slack She ll make him responsible and manly for much as I like Rickie I always find him a little effeminate And really his voice grew sharper for he was irritated by Ansell s conceit and really you talk as if you were mixed up in the affair They pay a civil visit to your rooms and you see nothing but dark plots and challenges to war War cried Ansell crashing his fists together It s war then Oh what a lot of tommy rot said Tilliard Can t a man and woman get engaged My dear boy excuse me talking like this what on earth is it to do with us We re his friends and I hope we always shall be but we shan t keep his friendship by fighting We re bound to fall into the background Wife first friends some way after You may resent the order but it is ordained by nature The point is not what s ordained by nature or any other fool but what s right You are hopelessly unpractical said Tilliard turning away And let me remind you that you ve already given away your case by acknowledging that they re happy She is happy because she has conquered he is happy because he has at last hung all the world s beauty on to a single peg He was always trying to do it He used to call the peg humanity Will either of these happinesses last His can t Hers only for a time I fight this woman not only because she fights me but because I foresee the most appalling catastrophe She wants Rickie partly to replace another man whom she lost two years ago partly to make something out of him He is to write In time she will get sick of this He won t get famous She will only see how thin he is and how lame She will long for a jollier husband and I don t blame her And having made him thoroughly miserable and degraded she will bolt if she can do it like a lady Such were the opinions of Stewart Ansell IX Seven letters written in June Cambridge Dear Rickie I would rather write and you can guess what kind of letter this is when I say it is a fair copy I have been making rough drafts all the morning When I talk I get angry and also at times try to be clever two reasons why I fail to get attention paid to me This is a letter of the prudent sort If it makes you break off the engagement its work is done You are not a person who ought to marry at all You are unfitted in body that we once discussed You are also unfitted in soul you want and you need to like many people and a man of that sort ought not to marry You never were attached to that great sect who can like one person only and if you try to enter it you will find destruction I have read in books and I cannot afford to despise books they are all that I have to go by that men and women desire different things Man wants to love mankind woman wants to love one man When she has him her work is over She is the emissary of Nature and Nature s bidding has been fulfilled But man does not care a damn for Nature or at least only a very little damn He cares for a hundred things besides and the more civilized he is the more he will care for these other hundred things and demand not only a wife and children but also friends and work and spiritual freedom I believe you to be extraordinarily civilized Yours ever S A Shelthorpe nine Sawston Park Road Sawston Dear Ansell But I m in love a detail you ve forgotten I can t listen to English Essays The wretched Agnes may be an emissary of Nature but I only grinned when I read it I may be extraordinarily civilized but I don t feel so I m in love and I ve found a woman to love me and I mean to have the hundred other things as well She wants me to have them friends and work and spiritual freedom and everything You and your books miss this because your books are too sedate Read poetry not only Shelley Understand Beatrice and Clara Middleton and Brunhilde in the first scene of Gotterdammerung Understand Goethe when he says the eternal feminine leads us on and don t write another English Essay Yours ever affectionately R E Cambridge Dear Rickie What am I to say Understand Xanthippe and missus Bennet and Elsa in the question scene of Lohengrin Understand Euripides when he says the eternal feminine leads us a pretty dance I shall say nothing of the sort The allusions in this English Essay shall not be literary My personal objections to Miss Pembroke are as follows one She is not serious two She is not truthful Shelthorpe nine Sawston Park Road Sawston My Dear Stewart You couldn t know I didn t know for a moment But this letter of yours is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me yet more wonderful I don t exaggerate than the moment when Agnes promised to marry me I always knew you liked me but I never knew how much until this letter Up to now I think we have been too much like the strong heroes in books who feel so much and say so little and feel all the more for saying so little Now that s over and we shall never be that kind of an ass again We ve hit by accident upon something permanent You ve written to me I hate the woman who will be your wife and I write back Hate her Can t I love you both She will never come between us Stewart She wouldn t wish to but that s by the way because our friendship has now passed beyond intervention No third person could break it We couldn t ourselves I fancy We may quarrel and argue till one of us dies but the thing is registered I only wish dear man you could be happier For me it s as if a light was suddenly held behind the world R E Shelthorpe nine Sawston Park Road Sawston Dear missus Lewin The time goes flying but I am getting to learn my wonderful boy We speak a great deal about his work He has just finished a curious thing called Nemi about a Roman ship that is actually sunk in some lake I cannot think how he describes the things when he has never seen them If as I hope he goes to Italy next year he should turn out something really good Meanwhile we are hunting for a publisher Herbert believes that a collection of short stories is hard to get published It is after all better to write one long one But you must not think we only talk books What we say on other topics cannot so easily be repeated Oh missus Lewin he is a dear and dearer than ever now that we have him at Sawston Herbert in a quiet way has been making inquiries about those Cambridge friends of his Nothing against them but they seem to be terribly eccentric None of them are good at games and they spend all their spare time thinking and discussing They discuss what one knows and what one never will know and what one had much better not know Herbert says it is because they have not got enough to do Ever your grateful and affectionate friend Agnes Pembroke Shelthorpe nine Sawston Park Road Sawston Dear mister Silt Thank you for the congratulations which I have handed over to the delighted Rickie The congratulations were really addressed to Agnes a social blunder which mister Pembroke deftly corrects I am sorry that the rumor reached you that I was not pleased Anything pleases me that promises my sister s happiness and I have known your cousin nearly as long as you have It will be a very long engagement for he must make his way first The dear boy is not nearly as wealthy as he supposed having no tastes and hardly any expenses he used to talk as if he were a millionaire He must at least double his income before he can dream of more intimate ties This has been a bitter pill but I am glad to say that they have accepted it bravely Hoping that you and missus Silt will profit by your week at Margate I remain yours very sincerely Herbert Pembroke Cadover Wilts Dear Miss Pembroke Agnes I hear that you are going to marry my nephew I have no idea what he is like and wonder whether you would bring him that I may find out Isn t September rather a nice month You might have to go to Stone Henge but with that exception would be left unmolested I do hope you will manage the visit We met once at missus Lewin s and I have a very clear recollection of you Believe me yours sincerely Emily Failing X The rain tilted a little from the south west For the most part it fell from a grey cloud silently but now and then the tilt increased and a kind of sigh passed over the country as the drops lashed the walls trees shepherds and other motionless objects that stood in their slanting career At times the cloud would descend and visibly embrace the earth to which it had only sent messages and the earth itself would bring forth clouds clouds of a whiter breed which formed in shallow valleys and followed the courses of the streams It seemed the beginning of life Again God said Shall we divide the waters from the land or not Was not the firmament labour and glory sufficient At all events it was the beginning of life pastoral behind which imagination cannot travel Yet complicated people were getting wet not only the shepherds For instance the piano tuner was sopping So was the vicar s wife So were the lieutenant and the peevish damsels in his Battleston car Gallantry charity and art pursued their various missions perspiring and muddy while out on the slopes beyond them stood the eternal man and the eternal dog guarding eternal sheep until the world is vegetarian Inside an arbour which faced east and thus avoided the bad weather there sat a complicated person who was dry She looked at the drenched world with a pleased expression and would smile when a cloud would lay down on the village or when the rain sighed louder than usual against her solid shelter Ink paperclips and foolscap paper were on the table before her and she could also reach an umbrella a waterproof a walking stick and an electric bell Her age was between elderly and old and her forehead was wrinkled with an expression of slight but perpetual pain But the lines round her mouth indicated that she had laughed a great deal during her life just as the clean tight skin round her eyes perhaps indicated that she had not often cried She was dressed in brown silk A brown silk shawl lay most becomingly over her beautiful hair After long thought she wrote on the paper in front of her The subject of this memoir first saw the light at Wolverhampton on May the fourteenth eighteen forty two She laid down her pen and said Ugh A robin hopped in and she welcomed him A sparrow followed and she stamped her foot She watched some thick white water which was sliding like a snake down the gutter of the gravel path It had just appeared It must have escaped from a hollow in the chalk up behind The earth could absorb no longer The lady did not think of all this for she hated questions of whence and wherefore and the ways of the earth our dull stepmother bored her unspeakably But the water just the snake of water was amusing and she flung her golosh at it to dam it up Then she wrote feverishly The subject of this memoir first saw the light in the middle of the night It was twenty to eleven His pa was a parson but he was not his pa s son and never went to heaven There was the sound of a train and presently white smoke appeared rising laboriously through the heavy air It distracted her and for about a quarter of an hour she sat perfectly still doing nothing At last she pushed the spoilt paper aside took afresh piece and was beginning to write On May the fourteenth eighteen forty two when there was a crunch on the gravel and a furious voice said I am sorry for Flea Thompson I daresay I am sorry for him too said the lady her voice was languid and pleasant Who is he Flea s a liar and the next time we meet he ll be a football Off slipped a sodden ulster He hung it up angrily upon a peg the arbour provided several But who is he and why has he that disastrous name Flea Fleance All the Thompsons are named out of Shakespeare He grazes the Rings Ah I see A pet lamb Lamb Shepherd One of my Shepherds The last time I go with his sheep But not the last time he sees me I am sorry for him He dodged me today Do you mean to say she became animated that you have been out in the wet keeping the sheep of Flea Thompson I had to He blew on his fingers and took off his cap Water trickled over his unshaven cheeks His hair was so wet that it seemed worked upon his scalp in bronze Get away bad dog screamed the lady for he had given himself a shake and spattered her dress with water He was a powerful boy of twenty admirably muscular but rather too broad for his height People called him Podge until they were dissuaded Then they called him Stephen or mister Wonham Then he said You can call me Podge if you like As for Flea he began tempestuously He sat down by her and with much heavy breathing told the story Flea has a girl at Wintersbridge and I had to go with his sheep while he went to see her Two hours We agreed Half an hour to go an hour to kiss his girl and half an hour back and he had my bike Four hours Four hours and seven minutes I was on the Rings with a fool of a dog and sheep doing all they knew to get the turnips My farm is a mystery to me said the lady stroking her fingers Some day you must really take me to see it It must be like a Gilbert and Sullivan opera with a chorus of agitated employers How is it that I have escaped Why have I never been summoned to milk the cows or flay the pigs or drive the young bullocks to the pasture He looked at her with astonishingly blue eyes the only dry things he had about him He could not see into her she would have puzzled an older and clever man He may have seen round her A thing of beauty you are not But I sometimes think you are a joy for ever I beg your pardon Oh you understand right enough she exclaimed irritably and then smiled for he was conceited and did not like being told that he was not a thing of beauty Large and steady feet she continued have this disadvantage you can knock down a man but you will never knock down a woman I don t know what you mean I m not likely Oh never mind never never mind I was being funny I repent Tell me about the sheep Why did you go with them I did tell you I had to But why He had to see his girl But why His eyes shot past her again It was so obvious that the man had to see his girl For two hours though not for four hours seven minutes Did you have any lunch I don t hold with regular meals Did you have a book I don t hold with books in the open None of the older men read Did you commune with yourself or don t you hold with that Oh Lord don t ask me You distress me You rob the Pastoral of its lingering romance Is there no poetry and no thought in England Is there no one in all these downs who warbles with eager thought the Doric lay Chaps sing to themselves at times if you mean that I dream of Arcady I open my eyes Wiltshire Of Amaryllis Flea Thompson s girl Of the pensive shepherd twitching his mantle blue you in an ulster Aren t you sorry for me May I put in a pipe By all means put a pipe in In return tell me of what you were thinking for the four hours and the seven minutes He laughed shyly You do ask a man such questions Did you simply waste the time I suppose so I thought that Colonel Robert Ingersoll says you must be strenuous At the sound of this name he whisked open a little cupboard and declaring I haven t a moment to spare took out of it a pile of Clarion and other reprints adorned as to their covers with bald or bearded apostles of humanity Selecting a bald one he began at once to read occasionally exclaiming That s got them That s knocked Genesis with similar ejaculations of an aspiring mind She glanced at the pile Reran minus the style Darwin minus the modesty A comic edition of the book of Job by Excelsior Pittsburgh Pa The Beginning of Life with diagrams Angel or Ape by missus Julia P Chunk She was amused and wondered idly what was passing within his narrow but not uninteresting brain Did he suppose that he was going to find out She had tried once herself but had since subsided into a sprightly orthodoxy Why didn t he read poetry instead of wasting his time between books like these and country like that The cloud parted and the increase of light made her look up Over the valley she saw a grave sullen down and on its flanks a little brown smudge her sheep together with her shepherd Fleance Thompson returned to his duties at last A trickle of water came through the arbour roof She shrieked in dismay That s all right said her companion moving her chair but still keeping his place in his book She dried up the spot on the manuscript Then she wrote Anthony Eustace Failing the subject of this memoir was born at Wolverhampton But she wrote no more She was fidgety Another drop fell from the roof Likewise an earwig She wished she had not been so playful in flinging her golosh into the path The boy who was overthrowing religion breathed somewhat heavily as he did so Another earwig She touched the electric bell I m going in she observed It s far too wet Again the cloud parted and caused her to add Weren t you rather kind to Flea But he was deep in the book He read like a poor person with lips apart and a finger that followed the print At times he scratched his ear or ran his tongue along a straggling blonde moustache His face had after all a certain beauty at all events the colouring was regal a steady crimson from throat to forehead the sun and the winds had worked on him daily ever since he was born The face of a strong man thought the lady Let him thank his stars he isn t a silent strong man or I d turn him into the gutter Suddenly it struck her that he was like an Irish terrier He worried infinity as if it was a bone Gnashing his teeth he tried to carry the eternal subtleties by violence As a man he often bored her for he was always saying and doing the same things But as a philosopher he really was a joy for ever an inexhaustible buffoon Taking up her pen she began to caricature him She drew a rabbit warren where rabbits were at play in four dimensions Before she had introduced the principal figure she was interrupted by the footman He had come up from the house to answer the bell On seeing her he uttered a respectful cry Madam Are you here I am very sorry I looked for you everywhere mister Elliot and Miss Pembroke arrived nearly an hour ago Oh dear oh dear exclaimed missus Failing Take these papers Where s the umbrella mister Stephen will hold it over me You hurry back and apologize Are they happy Miss Pembroke inquired after you madam Have they had tea Yes madam Leighton Yes sir I believe you knew she was here all the time You didn t want to wet your pretty skin You must not call me she to the servants said missus Failing as they walked away she limping with a stick he holding a great umbrella over her I will not have it Then more pleasantly And don t tell him he lies We all lie I knew quite well they were coming by the four six train I saw it pass That reminds me Another child run over at the Roman crossing Whish bang dead Oh my foot Oh my foot my foot said missus Failing and paused to take breath Bad he asked callously Leighton with bowed head passed them with the manuscript and disappeared among the laurels The twinge of pain which had been slight passed away and they proceeded descending a green airless corridor which opened into the gravel drive Isn t it odd said missus Failing that the Greeks should be enthusiastic about laurels that Apollo should pursue any one who could possibly turn into such a frightful plant What do you make of Rickie Oh I don t know Shall I lend you his story to read He made no reply Don t you think Stephen that a person in your precarious position ought to be civil to my relatives Sorry missus Failing I meant to be civil I only hadn t anything to say She a laughed Are you a dear boy I sometimes wonder or are you a brute Again he had nothing to say Then she laughed more mischievously and said How can you be either when you are a philosopher Would you mind telling me I am so anxious to learn what happens to people when they die Don t ask ME He knew by bitter experience that she was making fun of him Oh but I do ask you Those paper books of yours are so up to date For instance what has happened to the child you say was killed on the line The rain increased The drops pattered hard on the leaves and outside the corridor men and women were struggling however stupidly with the facts of life Inside it they wrangled She teased the boy and laughed at his theories and proved that no man can be an agnostic who has a sense of humour Suddenly she stopped not through any skill of his but because she had remembered some words of Bacon The true atheist is he whose hands are cauterized by holy things She thought of her distant youth The world was not so humorous then but it had been more important For a moment she respected her companion and determined to vex him no more They left the shelter of the laurels crossed the broad drive and were inside the house at last She had got quite wet for the weather would not let her play the simple life with impunity As for him he seemed a piece of the wet Look here she cried as he hurried up to his attic don t shave He was delighted with the permission I have an idea that Miss Pembroke is of the type that pretends to be unconventional and really isn t I want to see how she takes it Don t shave In the drawing room she could hear the guests conversing in the subdued tones of those who have not been welcomed Having changed her dress and glanced at the poems of Milton she went to them with uplifted hands of apology and horror But I must have tea she announced when they had assured her that they understood Otherwise I shall start by being cross Agnes stop me Give me tea Agnes looking pleased moved to the table and served her hostess Rickie followed with a pagoda of sandwiches and little cakes I feel twenty seven years younger Rickie you are so like your father I feel it is twenty seven years ago and that he is bringing your mother to see me for the first time It is curious almost terrible to see history repeating itself The remark was not tactful I remember that visit well she continued thoughtfully I suppose it was a wonderful visit though we none of us knew it at the time We all fell in love with your mother I wish she would have fallen in love with us She couldn t bear me could she I never heard her say so Aunt Emily No she wouldn t I am sure your father said so though My dear boy don t look so shocked Your father and I hated each other He said so I said so I say so say so too Then we shall start fair Just a cocoanut cake Agnes don t you agree that it s always best to speak out Oh rather missus Failing But I m shockingly straightforward So am I said the lady I like to get down to the bedrock Hullo Slippers Slippers in the drawingroom A young man had come in silently Agnes observed with a feeling of regret that he had not shaved Rickie after a moment s hesitation remembered who it was and shook hands with him You ve grown since I saw you last He showed his teeth amiably How long was that asked missus Failing Three years wasn t it Came over from the Ansells friends How disgraceful Rickie Why don t you come and see me oftener He could not retort that she never asked him Agnes will make you come Oh let me introduce mister Wonham Miss Pembroke I am deputy hostess said Agnes May I give you some tea Thank you but I have had a little beer It is one of the shepherds said missus Failing in low tones Agnes smiled rather wildly missus Lewin had warned her that Cadover was an extraordinary place and that one must never be astonished at anything A shepherd in the drawing room No harm Still one ought to know whether it was a shepherd or not At all events he was in gentleman s clothing She was anxious not to start with a blunder and therefore did not talk to the young fellow but tried to gather what he was from the demeanour of Rickie I am sure missus Failing that you need not talk of making people come to Cadover There will be no difficulty I should say Thank you my dear Do you know who once said those exact words to me Who Rickie s mother Did she really My sister in law was a dear You will have heard Rickie s praises but now you must hear mine I never knew a woman who was so unselfish and yet had such capacities for life Does one generally exclude the other asked Rickie Unselfish people as a rule are deathly dull They have no colour They think of other people because it is easier They give money because they are too stupid or too idle to spend it properly on themselves That was the beauty of your mother she gave away but she also spent on herself or tried to The light faded out of the drawing room in spite of it being September and only half past six From her low chair Agnes could see the trees by the drive black against a blackening sky That drive was half a mile long and she was praising its gravelled surface when Rickie called in a voice of alarm I say when did our train arrive Four six I said so It arrived at four six on the time table said mister Wonham I want to know when it got to the station I tell you again it was punctual I tell you I looked at my watch I can do no more Agnes was amazed Was Rickie mad A minute ago and they were boring each other over dogs What had happened Now now Quarrelling already asked missus Failing The footman bringing a lamp lit up two angry faces He says He says He says we ran over a child So you did You ran over a child in the village at four seven by my watch Your train was late You couldn t have got to the station till four ten I don t believe it We had passed the village by four seven Agnes hadn t we passed the village It must have been an express that ran over the child Now is it likely he appealed to the practical world is it likely that the company would run a stopping train and then an express three minutes after it A child said Rickie I can t believe that the train killed a child He thought of their journey They were alone in the carriage As the train slackened speed he had caught her for a moment in his arms The rain beat on the windows but they were in heaven You ve got to believe it said the other and proceeded to rub it in His healthy irritable face drew close to Rickie s Two children were kicking and screaming on the Roman crossing Your train being late came down on them One of them was pulled off the line but the other was caught How will you get out of that And how will you get out of it cried missus Failing turning the tables on him Where s the child now What has happened to its soul You must know Agnes that this young gentleman is a philosopher Oh drop all that said mister Wonham suddenly collapsing Drop it Where On my nice carpet I hate philosophy remarked Agnes trying to turn the subject for she saw that it made Rickie unhappy So do I But I daren t say so before Stephen He despises us women No I don t said the victim swaying to and fro on the window sill whither he had retreated Yes he does He won t even trouble to answer us Stephen Podge Answer me What has happened to the child s soul He flung open the window and leant from them into the dusk They heard him mutter something about a bridge What did I tell you He won t answer my question The delightful moment was approaching when the boy would lose his temper she knew it by a certain tremor in his heels There wants a bridge he exploded A bridge instead of all this rotten talk and the level crossing It wouldn t break you to build a two arch bridge Then the child s soul as you call it well nothing would have happened to the child at all A gust of night air entered accompanied by rain The flowers in the vases rustled and the flame of the lamp shot up and smoked the glass Slightly irritated she ordered him to close the window XI Cadover was not a large house But it is the largest house with which this story has dealings and must always be thought of with respect It was built about the year eighteen hundred and favoured the architecture of ancient Rome chiefly by means of five lank pilasters which stretched from the top of it to the bottom Between the pilasters was the glass front door to the right of them the drawing room windows to the left of them the windows of the dining room above them a triangular area which the better class servants knew as a pendiment and which had in its middle a small round hole according to the usage of Palladio The classical note was also sustained by eight grey steps which led from the building down into the drive and by an attempt at a formal garden on the adjoining lawn The lawn ended in a Ha ha Ha ha who shall regard it and thence the bare land sloped down into the village The main garden walled was to the left as one faced the house while to the right was that laurel avenue leading up to missus Failing s arbour It was a comfortable but not very attractive place and to a certain type of mind its situation was not attractive either From the distance it showed as a grey box huddled against evergreens There was no mystery about it You saw it for miles Its hill had none of the beetling romance of Devonshire none of the subtle contours that prelude a cottage in Kent but profferred its burden crudely on a huge bare palm There s Cadover visitors would say How small it still looks We shall be late for lunch And the view from the windows though extensive would not have been accepted by the Royal Academy A valley containing a stream a road a railway over the valley fields of barley and wurzel divided by no pretty hedges and passing into a great and formless down this was the outlook desolate at all times and almost terrifying beneath a cloudy sky The down was called Cadbury Range Cocoa Squares if you were young and funny because high upon it one cannot say on the top there being scarcely any tops in Wiltshire because high upon it there stood a double circle of entrenchments A bank of grass enclosed a ring of turnips which enclosed a second bank of grass which enclosed more turnips and in the middle of the pattern grew one small tree British Roman Saxon Danish The competent reader will decide The Thompson family knew it to be far older than the Franco German war It was the property of Government It was full of gold and dead soldiers who had fought with the soldiers on Castle Rings and been beaten The road to Londinium having forded the stream and crossed the valley road and the railway passed up by these entrenchments The road to London lay half a mile to the right of them To complete this survey one must mention the church and the farm both of which lay over the stream in Cadford Between them they ruled the village one claiming the souls of the labourers the other their bodies If a man desired other religion or other employment he must leave The church lay up by the railway the farm was down by the water meadows The vicar a gentle charitable man scarcely realized his power and never tried to abuse it mister Wilbraham the agent was of another mould He knew his place and kept others to theirs all society seemed spread before him like a map The line between the county and the local the line between the labourer and the artisan he knew them all and strengthened them with no uncertain touch Everything with him was graduated carefully graduated civility towards his superior towards his inferiors carefully graduated incivility So for he was a thoughtful person so alone declared he could things be kept together Perhaps the Comic Muse to whom so much is now attributed had caused his estate to be left to mister Failing mister Failing was the author of some brilliant books on socialism that was why his wife married him and for twenty five years he reigned up at Cadover and tried to put his theories into practice He believed that things could be kept together by accenting the similarities not the differences of men We are all much more alike than we confess was one of his favourite speeches As a speech it sounded very well and his wife had applauded but when it resulted in hard work evenings in the reading rooms mixed parties and long unobtrusive talks with dull people she got bored In her piquant way she declared that she was not going to love her husband and succeeded He took it quietly but his brilliancy decreased His health grew worse and he knew that when he died there was no one to carry on his work He felt besides that he had done very little Toil as he would he had not a practical mind and could never dispense with mister Wilbraham For all his tact he would often stretch out the hand of brotherhood too soon or withhold it when it would have been accepted Most people misunderstood him or only understood him when he was dead In after years his reign became a golden age but he counted a few disciples in his life time a few young labourers and tenant farmers who swore tempestuously that he was not really a fool This he told himself was as much as he deserved Cadover was inherited by his widow She tried to sell it she tried to let it but she asked too much and as it was neither a pretty place nor fertile it was left on her hands With many a groan she settled down to banishment Wiltshire people she declared were the stupidest in England She told them so to their faces which made them no brighter And their county was worthy of them no distinction in it no style simply land But her wrath passed or remained only as a graceful fretfulness She made the house comfortable and abandoned the farm to mister Wilbraham With a good deal of care she selected a small circle of acquaintances and had them to stop in the summer months In the winter she would go to town and frequent the salons of the literary As her lameness increased she moved about less and at the time of her nephew s visit seldom left the place that had been forced upon her as a home Just now she was busy A prominent politician had quoted her husband The young generation asked Who is this mister Failing and the publishers wrote Now is the time She was collecting some essays and penning an introductory memoir Rickie admired his aunt but did not care for her She reminded him too much of his father She had the same affliction the same heartlessness the same habit of taking life with a laugh as if life is a pill He also felt that she had neglected him He would not have asked much as for prospects they never entered his head but she was his only near relative and a little kindness and hospitality during the lonely years would have made incalculable difference Now that he was happier and could bring her Agnes she had asked him to stop at once The sun as it rose next morning spoke to him of a new life He too had a purpose and a value in the world at last Leaning out of the window he gazed at the earth washed clean and heard through the pure air the distant noises of the farm But that day nothing was to remain divine but the weather His aunt for reasons of her own decreed that he should go for a ride with the Wonham boy They were to look at Old Sarum proceed thence to Salisbury lunch there see the sights call on a certain canon for tea and return to Cadover in the evening The arrangement suited no one He did not want to ride but to be with Agnes nor did Agnes want to be parted from him nor Stephen to go with him But the clearer the wishes of her guests became the more determined was missus Failing to disregard them She smoothed away every difficulty she converted every objection into a reason and she ordered the horses for half past nine It is a bore he grumbled as he sat in their little private sitting room breaking his finger nails upon the coachman s gaiters I can t ride I shall fall off We should have been so happy here It s just like Aunt Emily Can t you imagine her saying afterwards Lovers are absurd I made a point of keeping them apart and then everybody laughing With a pretty foretaste of the future Agnes knelt before him and did the gaiters up Who is this mister Wonham by the bye I don t know Some connection of mister Failing s I think Does he live here He used to be at school or something He seems to have grown into a tiresome person I suppose that missus Failing has adopted him I suppose so I believe that she has been quite kind I do hope she ll be kind to you this morning I hate leaving you with her Why you say she likes me Yes but that wouldn t prevent you see she doesn t mind what she says or what she repeats if it amuses her If she thought it really funny for instance to break off our engagement she d try Dear boy what a frightful remark But it would be funnier for us to see her trying Whatever could she do He kissed the hands that were still busy with the fastenings Nothing I can t see one thing We simply lie open to each other you and I There isn t one new corner in either of us that she could reveal It s only that I always have in this house the most awful feeling of insecurity Why If any one says or does a foolish thing it s always here All the family breezes have started here It s a kind of focus for aimed and aimless scandal You know when my father and mother had their special quarrel my aunt was mixed up in it I never knew how or how much but you may be sure she didn t calm things down unless she found things more entertaining calm Rickie Rickie cried the lady from the garden Your riding master s impatient We really oughtn t to talk of her like this here whispered Agnes It s a horrible habit The habit of the country Agnes Ugh this gossip Suddenly he flung his arms over her Dear dear let s beware of I don t know what of nothing at all perhaps Oh buck up yelled the irritable Stephen Which am I to shorten left stirrup or right Left shouted Agnes How many holes They hurried down On the way she said I m glad of the warning Now I m prepared Your aunt will get nothing out of me Her betrothed tried to mount with the wrong foot according to his invariable custom She also had to pick up his whip At last they started the boy showing off pretty consistently and she was left alone with her hostess Dido is quiet as a lamb said missus Failing and Stephen is a good fielder What a blessing it is to have cleared out the men What shall you and I do this heavenly morning I m game for anything Have you quite unpacked Yes Any letters to write No Then let s go to my arbour No we won t It gets the morning sun and it ll be too hot today Already she regretted clearing out the men On such a morning she would have liked to drive but her third animal had gone lame She feared too that Miss Pembroke was going to bore her However they did go to the arbour In languid tones she pointed out the various objects of interest There s the Cad which goes into the something which goes into the Avon Cadbury Rings opposite Cadchurch to the extreme left you can t see it You were there last night It is famous for the drunken parson and the railway station Then Cad Dauntsey Then Cadford that side of the stream connected with Cadover this Observe the fertility of the Wiltshire mind A terrible lot of Cads said Agnes brightly missus Failing divided her guests into those who made this joke and those who did not The latter class was very small The vicar of Cadford not the nice drunkard declares the name is really Chadford and he worried on till I put up a window to saint Chad in our church His Cambridge wife pronounces it Hyadford I could smack them both How do you like Podge Ah you jump I meant you to How do you like Podge Wonham Very nice said Agnes laughing Nice He is a hero There was a long interval of silence Each lady looked without much interest at the view missus Failing s attitude towards Nature was severely aesthetic an attitude more sterile than the severely practical She applied the test of beauty to shadow and odour and sound they never filled her with reverence or excitement she never knew them as a resistless trinity that may intoxicate the worshipper with joy If she liked a ploughed field it was only as a spot of colour not also as a hint of the endless strength of the earth And today she could approve of one cloud but object to its fellow As for Miss Pembroke she was not approving or objecting at all A hero she queried when the interval had passed Her voice was indifferent as if she had been thinking of other things A hero Yes Didn t you notice how heroic he was I don t think I did Not at dinner Ah Agnes always look out for heroism at dinner It is their great time They live up to the stiffness of their shirt fronts Do you mean to say that you never noticed how he set down Rickie Oh that about poetry said Agnes laughing Rickie would not mind it for a moment But why do you single out that as heroic To snub people to set them down to be rude to them to make them feel small Surely that s the lifework of a hero I shouldn t have said that And as a matter of fact mister Wonham was wrong over the poetry I made Rickie look it up afterwards But of course A hero always is wrong To me she persisted rather gently a hero has always been a strong wonderful being who champions Ah wait till you are the dragon I have been a dragon most of my life I think A dragon that wants nothing but a peaceful cave Then in comes the strong wonderful delightful being and gains a princess by piercing my hide No seriously my dear Agnes the chief characteristics of a hero are infinite disregard for the feelings of others plus general inability to understand them But surely mister Wonham Yes aren t we being unkind to the poor boy Ought we to go on talking Agnes waited remembering the warnings of Rickie and thinking that anything she said might perhaps be repeated Though even if he was here he wouldn t understand what we are saying Wouldn t understand missus Failing gave the least flicker of an eye towards her companion Did you take him for clever I don t think I took him for anything She smiled I have been thinking of other things and another boy But do think for a moment of Stephen I will describe how he spent yesterday He rose at eight From eight to eleven he sang The song was called Father s boots will soon fit Willie He stopped once to say to the footman She ll never finish her book She idles She being I At eleven he went out and stood in the rain till four but had the luck to see a child run over at the level crossing By half past four he had knocked the bottom out of Christianity Agnes looked bewildered Aren t you impressed I was I told him that he was on no account to unsettle the vicar Open that cupboard one of those sixpenny books tells Podge that he s made of hard little black things another that he s made of brown things larger and squashy There seems a discrepancy but anything is better for a thoughtful youth than to be made in the Garden of Eden Let us eliminate the poetic at whatever cost to the probable When for a moment she spoke more gravely Here he is at twenty with nothing to hold on by I don t know what s to be done I suppose it s my fault But I ve never had any bother over the Church of England have you Of course I go with my Church said Miss Pembroke who hated this style of conversation I don t know I m sure I think you should consult a man Would Rickie help me Rickie would do anything he can And missus Failing noted the half official way in which she vouched for her lover But of course Rickie is a little complicated I doubt whether mister Wonham would understand him He wants doesn t he some one who s a little more assertive and more accustomed to boys Some one more like my brother Agnes she seized her by the arm Do you suppose that mister Pembroke would undertake my Podge She shook her head His time is so filled up He gets a boarding house next term Besides after all I don t know what Herbert would do Morality He would teach him morality The Thirty Nine Articles may come of themselves but if you have no morals you come to grief Morality is all I demand from mister Herbert Pembroke He shall be excused the use of the globes You know of course that Stephen s expelled from a public school He stole The school was not a public one and the expulsion or rather request for removal had taken place when Stephen was fourteen A violent spasm of dishonesty such as often heralds the approach of manhood had overcome him He stole everything especially what was difficult to steal and hid the plunder beneath a loose plank in the passage He was betrayed by the inclusion of a ham This was the crisis of his career His benefactress was just then rather bored with him He had stopped being a pretty boy and she rather doubted whether she would see him through But she was so raged with the letters of the schoolmaster and so delighted with those of the criminal that she had him back and gave him a prize No said Agnes I didn t know I should be happy to speak to Herbert but as I said his time will be very full But I know he has friends who make a speciality of weakly or or unusual boys My dear I ve tried it Stephen kicked the weakly boys and robbed apples with the unusual ones He was expelled again Agnes began to find missus Failing rather tiresome Wherever you trod on her she seemed to slip away from beneath your feet Agnes liked to know where she was and where other people were as well She said My brother thinks a great deal of home life I daresay he d think that mister Wonham is best where he is with you You have been so kind to him You she paused have been to him both father and mother I m too hot was missus Failing s reply It seemed that Miss Pembroke had at last touched a topic on which she was reticent She rang the electric bell it was only to tell the footman to take the reprints to mister Wonham s room and then murmuring something about work proceeded herself to the house missus Failing said Agnes who had not expected such a speedy end to their chat Call me Aunt Emily My dear Aunt Emily what did you think of that story Rickie sent you It is bad said missus Failing But But But Then she escaped having told the truth and yet leaving a pleasurable impression behind her XII The excursion to Salisbury was but a poor business in fact Rickie never got there They were not out of the drive before mister Wonham began doing acrobatics He showed Rickie how very quickly he could turn round in his saddle and sit with his face to Aeneas s tail I see said Rickie coldly and became almost cross when they arrived in this condition at the gate behind the house for he had to open it and was afraid of falling As usual he anchored just beyond the fastenings and then had to turn Dido who seemed as long as a battleship To his relief a man came forward and murmuring Worst gate in the parish pushed it wide and held it respectfully Thank you cried Rickie many thanks But Stephen who was riding into the world back first said majestically No no it doesn t count You needn t think it does You make it worse by touching your hat Four hours and seven minutes You ll see me again The man answered nothing Eh but I ll hurt him he chanted as he swung into position That was Flea Eh but he s forgotten my fists eh but I ll hurt him Why ventured Rickie Last night over cigarettes he had been bored to death by the story of Flea The boy had a little reminded him of Gerald the Gerald of history not the Gerald of romance He was more genial but there was the same brutality the same peevish insistence on the pound of flesh Hurt him till he learns Learns what Learns of course retorted Stephen Neither of them was very civil They did not dislike each other but they each wanted to be somewhere else exactly the situation that missus Failing had expected He behaved badly said Rickie because he is poorer than we are and more ignorant Less money has been spent on teaching him to behave Well I ll teach him for nothing Perhaps his fists are stronger than yours They aren t I looked After this conversation flagged Rickie glanced back at Cadover and thought of the insipid day that lay before him Generally he was attracted by fresh people and Stephen was almost fresh they had been to him symbols of the unknown and all that they did was interesting But now he cared for the unknown no longer He knew mister Wilbraham passed them in his dog cart and lifted his hat to his employer s nephew Stephen he ignored he could not find him on the map Good morning said Rickie What a lovely morning I say called the other another child dead mister Wilbraham who had seemed inclined to chat whipped up his horse and left them There goes an out and outer said Stephen and then as if introducing an entirely new subject Don t you think Flea Thompson treated me disgracefully I suppose he did But I m scarcely the person to sympathize The allusion fell flat and he had to explain it I should have done the same myself promised to be away two hours and stopped four Stopped oh oh I understand You being in love you mean He smiled and nodded Oh I ve no objection to Flea loving He says he can t help it But as long as my fists are stronger he s got to keep it in line In line A man like that when he s got a girl thinks the rest can go to the devil He goes cutting his work and breaking his word Wilbraham ought to sack him I promise you when I ve a girl I ll keep her in line and if she turns nasty I ll get another Rickie smiled and said no more But he was sorry that any one should start life with such a creed all the more sorry because the creed caricatured his own He too believed that life should be in a line a line of enormous length full of countless interests and countless figures all well beloved But woman was not to be kept to this line Rather did she advance it continually like some triumphant general making each unit still more interesting still more lovable than it had been before He loved Agnes not only for herself but because she was lighting up the human world But he could scarcely explain this to an inexperienced animal nor did he make the attempt For a long time they proceeded in silence The hill behind Cadover was in harvest and the horses moved regretfully between the sheaves Stephen had picked a grass leaf and was blowing catcalls upon it He blew very well and this morning all his soul went into the wail For he was ill He was tortured with the feeling that he could not get away and do do something instead of being civil to this anaemic prig Four hours in the rain was better than this he had not wanted to fidget in the rain But now the air was like wine and the stubble was smelling of wet and over his head white clouds trundled more slowly and more seldom through broadening tracts of blue There never had been such a morning and he shut up his eyes and called to it And whenever he called Rickie shut up his eyes and winced At last the blade broke We don t go quick do we he remarked and looked on the weedy track for another I wish you wouldn t let me keep you If you were alone you would be galloping or something of that sort I was told I must go your pace he said mournfully And you promised Miss Pembroke not to hurry Well I ll disobey But he could not rise above a gentle trot and even that nearly jerked him out of the saddle Sit like this said Stephen Can t you see like this Rickie lurched forward and broke his thumb nail on the horse s neck It bled a little and had to be bound up Thank you awfully kind no tighter please I m simply spoiling your day I can t think how a man can help riding You ve only to leave it to the horse so so just as you leave it to water in swimming Rickie left it to Dido who stopped immediately I said LEAVE it His voice rose irritably I didn t say die Of course she stops if you die First you sit her as if you re Sandow exercising and then you sit like a corpse Can t you tell her you re alive That s all she wants In trying to convey the information Rickie dropped his whip Stephen picked it up and rammed it into the belt of his own Norfolk jacket He was scarcely a fashionable horseman He was not even graceful But he rode as a living man though Rickie was too much bored to notice it Not a muscle in him was idle not a muscle working hard When he returned from the gallop his limbs were still unsatisfied and his manners still irritable He did not know that he was ill he knew nothing about himself at all Like a howdah in the Zoo he grumbled Mother Failing will buy elephants And he proceeded to criticize his benefactress Rickie keenly alive to bad taste tried to stop him and gained instead a criticism of religion Stephen overthrew the Mosaic cosmogony He pointed out the discrepancies in the Gospels He levelled his wit against the most beautiful spire in the world now rising against the southern sky Between whiles he went for a gallop After a time Rickie stopped listening and simply went his way For Dido was a perfect mount and as indifferent to the motions of Aeneas as if she was strolling in the Elysian fields He had had a bad night and the strong air made him sleepy The wind blew from the Plain Cadover and its valley had disappeared and though they had not climbed much and could not see far there was a sense of infinite space The fields were enormous like fields on the Continent and the brilliant sun showed up their colours well The green of the turnips the gold of the harvest and the brown of the newly turned clods were each contrasted with morsels of grey down But the general effect was pale or rather silvery for Wiltshire is not a county of heavy tints Beneath these colours lurked the unconquerable chalk and wherever the soil was poor it emerged The grassy track so gay with scabious and bedstraw was snow white at the bottom of its ruts A dazzling amphitheatre gleamed in the flank of a distant hill cut for some Olympian audience And here and there whatever the surface crop the earth broke into little embankments little ditches little mounds there had been no lack of drama to solace the gods In Cadover the perilous house Agnes had already parted from missus Failing His thoughts returned to her Was she the soul of truth in safety Was her purity vexed by the lies and selfishness Would she elude the caprice which had he vaguely knew caused suffering before Ah the frailty of joy Ah the myriads of longings that pass without fruition and the turf grows over them Better men women as noble they had died up here and their dust had been mingled but only their dust These are morbid thoughts but who dare contradict them There is much good luck in the world but it is luck We are none of us safe We are children playing or quarreling on the line and some of us have Rickie s temperament or his experiences and admit it So he mused that anxious little speck and all the land seemed to comment on his fears and on his love Their path lay upward over a great bald skull half grass half stubble It seemed each moment there would be a splendid view The view never came for none of the inclines were sharp enough and they moved over the skull for many minutes scarcely shifting a landmark or altering the blue fringe of the distance The spire of Salisbury did alter but very slightly rising and falling like the mercury in a thermometer At the most it would be half hidden at the least the tip would show behind the swelling barrier of earth They passed two elder trees a great event The bare patch said Stephen was owing to the gallows Rickie nodded He had lost all sense of incident In this great solitude more solitary than any Alpine range he and Agnes were floating alone and for ever between the shapeless earth and the shapeless clouds An immense silence seemed to move towards them A lark stopped singing and they were glad of it They were approaching the Throne of God The silence touched them the earth and all danger dissolved but ere they quite vanished Rickie heard himself saying Is it exactly what we intended Yes said a man s voice it s the old plan They were in another valley Its sides were thick with trees Down it ran another stream and another road it too sheltered a string of villages But all was richer larger and more beautiful the valley of the Avon below Amesbury I ve been asleep said Rickie in awestruck tones Never said the other facetiously Pleasant dreams Perhaps I m really tired of apologizing to you How long have you been holding me on All in the day s work He gave him back the reins Where s that round hill Gone where the good niggers go I want a drink This is Nature s joke in Wiltshire her one joke You toil on windy slopes and feel very primeval You are miles from your fellows and lo a little valley full of elms and cottages Before Rickie had waked up to it they had stopped by a thatched public house and Stephen was yelling like a maniac for beer There was no occasion to yell He was not very thirsty and they were quite ready to serve him Nor need he have drunk in the saddle with the air of a warrior who carries important dispatches and has not the time to dismount A real soldier bound on a similar errand rode up to the inn and Stephen feared that he would yell louder and was hostile But they made friends and treated each other and slanged the proprietor and ragged the pretty girls while Rickie as each wave of vulgarity burst over him sunk his head lower and lower and wished that the earth would swallow him up He was only used to Cambridge and to a very small corner of that He and his friends there believed in free speech But they spoke freely about generalities They were scientific and philosophic They would have shrunk from the empirical freedom that results from a little beer That was what annoyed him as he rode down the new valley with two chattering companions He was more skilled than they were in the principles of human existence but he was not so indecently familiar with the examples A sordid village scandal such as Stephen described as a huge joke sprang from certain defects in human nature with which he was theoretically acquainted But the example He blushed at it like a maiden lady in spite of its having a parallel in a beautiful idyll of Theocritus Was experience going to be such a splendid thing after all Were the outside of houses so very beautiful That s spicy the soldier was saying Got any more like that I se got a pome said Stephen and drew a piece of paper from his pocket The valley had broadened Old Sarum rose before them ugly and majestic Write this yourself he asked chuckling Rather said Stephen lowering his head and kissing Aeneas between the ears But who s old Em ly Rickie winced and frowned Now you re asking Old Em ly she limps And as I am so tired said Rickie Why should he stand it any longer He would go home to the woman he loved Do you mind if I give up Salisbury But we ve seen nothing cried Stephen I shouldn t enjoy anything I am so absurdly tired Left turn then all in the day s work He bit at his moustache angrily Good gracious me man of course I m going back alone I m not going to spoil your day How could you think it of me Stephen gave a loud sigh of relief If you do want to go home here s your whip Don t fall off Say to her you wanted it or there might be ructions Certainly Thank you for your kind care of me Old Em ly she limps And as Soon he was out of earshot Soon they were lost to view Soon they were out of his thoughts He forgot the coarseness and the drinking and the ingratitude A few months ago he would not have forgotten so quickly and he might also have detected something else But a lover is dogmatic To him the world shall be beautiful and pure When it is not he ignores it He s not tired said Stephen to the soldier he wants his girl And they winked at each other and cracked jokes over the eternal comedy of love They asked each other if they d let a girl spoil a morning s ride They both exhibited a profound cynicism Stephen who was quite without ballast described the household at Cadover he should say that Rickie would find Miss Pembroke kissing the footman I say the footman s kissing old Em ly Jolly day said Stephen His voice was suddenly constrained He was not sure whether he liked the soldier after all nor whether he had been wise in showing him his compositions Old Em ly she limps And as All right Thomas That ll do Old Em ly I wish you d dry up like a good fellow This is the lady s horse you know hang it after all In deed Don t you see when a fellow s on a horse he can t let another fellow kind of don t you know The man did know There s sense in that he said approvingly Peace was restored and they would have reached Salisbury if they had not had some more beer It unloosed the soldier s fancies and again he spoke of old Em ly and recited the poem with Aristophanic variations Jolly day repeated Stephen with a straightening of the eyebrows and a quick glance at the other s body He then warned him against the variations In consequence he was accused of being a member of the Y M C A His blood boiled at this He refuted the charge and became great friends with the soldier for the third time Any objection to Saucy mister and missus Tackleton Rather not The soldier sang Saucy mister and missus Tackleton It is really a work for two voices most of the sauciness disappearing when taken as a solo Nor is missus Tackleton s name Em lv I call it a jolly rotten song said Stephen crossly I won t stand being got at P r aps y like therold song Lishen Of all the gulls that arsshmart There s none line pretty Em ly For she s the darling of merart Now that s wrong He rode up close to the singer Shright Tisn t It s as my mother taught me I don t care I ll not alter from mother s way Stephen was baffled Then he said How does your mother make it rhyme Wot Squat You re an ass and I m not Poems want rhymes Alley comes next line He said alley was welcome to come if it liked It can t You want Sally Sally alley Em ly alley doesn t do Emily femily cried the soldier with an inspiration that was not his when sober My mother taught me femily For she s the darling of merart And she lives in my femily Well you d best be careful Thomas and your mother too Your mother s no better than she should be said Thomas vaguely Do you think I haven t heard that before retorted the boy The other concluded he might now say anything So he might the name of old Emily excepted Stephen cared little about his benefactress s honour but a great deal about his own He had made missus Failing into a test For the moment he would die for her as a knight would die for a glove He is not to be distinguished from a hero Old Sarum was passed They approached the most beautiful spire in the world Lord another of these large churches said the soldier Unfriendly to Gothic he lifted both hands to his nose and declared that old Em ly was buried there He lay in the mud His horse trotted back towards Amesbury Stephen had twisted him out of the saddle I ve done him he yelled though no one was there to hear He rose up in his stirrups and shouted with joy He flung his arms round Aeneas s neck The elderly horse understood capered and bolted It was a centaur that dashed into Salisbury and scattered the people In the stable he would not dismount I ve done him he yelled to the ostlers apathetic men Stretching upwards he clung to a beam Aeneas moved on and he was left hanging Greatly did he incommode them by his exercises He pulled up he circled he kicked the other customers At last he fell to the earth deliciously fatigued His body worried him no longer He went like the baby he was to buy a white linen hat There were soldiers about and he thought it would disguise him Then he had a little lunch to steady the beer This day had turned out admirably All the money that should have fed Rickie he could spend on himself Instead of toiling over the Cathedral and seeing the stuffed penguins he could stop the whole thing in the cattle market There he met and made some friends He watched the cheap jacks and saw how necessary it was to have a confident manner He spoke confidently himself about lambs and people listened He spoke confidently about pigs and they roared with laughter He must learn more about pigs He witnessed a performance not too namby pamby of Punch and Judy Hullo Podge cried a naughty little girl He tried to catch her and failed She was one of the Cadford children For Salisbury on market day though it is not picturesque is certainly representative and you read the names of half the Wiltshire villages upon the carriers carts He found in Penny Farthing Street the cart from Wintersbridge It would not start for several hours but the passengers always used it as a club and sat in it every now and then during the day No less than three ladies were these now staring at the shafts One of them was Flea Thompson s girl He asked her quite politely why her lover had broken faith with him in the rain She was silent He warned her of approaching vengeance She was still silent but another woman hoped that a gentleman would not be hard on a poor person Something in this annoyed him it wasn t a question of gentility and poverty it was a question of two men He determined to go back by Cadbury Rings where the shepherd would now be He did But this part must be treated lightly He rode up to the culprit with the air of a Saint George spoke a few stern words from the saddle tethered his steed to a hurdle and took off his coat Are you ready he asked Yes sir said Flea and flung him on his back That s not fair he protested The other did not reply but flung him on his head How on earth did you learn that By trying often said Flea Stephen sat on the ground picking mud out of his forehead I meant it to be fists he said gloomily I know sir It s jolly smart though and and I beg your pardon all round It cost him a great deal to say this but he was sure that it was the right thing to say He must acknowledge the better man Whereas most people if they provoke a fight and are flung say You cannot rob me of my moral victory There was nothing further to be done He mounted again not exactly depressed but feeling that this delightful world is extraordinarily unreliable He had never expected to fling the soldier or to be flung by Flea One nips or is nipped he thought and never knows beforehand I should not be surprised if many people had more in them than I suppose while others were just the other way round I haven t seen that sort of thing in Ingersoll but it s quite important Then his thoughts turned to a curious incident of long ago when he had been nipped as a little boy He was trespassing in those woods when he met in a narrow glade a flock of sheep They had neither dog nor shepherd and advanced towards him silently He was accustomed to sheep but had never happened to meet them in a wood before and disliked it He retired slowly at first then fast and the flock in a dense mass pressed after him His terror increased He turned and screamed at their long white faces and still they came on all stuck together like some horrible jell If once he got into them Bellowing and screeching he rushed into the undergrowth tore himself all over and reached home in convulsions mister Failing his only grown up friend was sympathetic but quite stupid Pan ovium custos he sympathetic as he pulled out the thorns Why not Pan ovium custos Stephen learnt the meaning of the phrase at school A pan of eggs for custard He still remembered how the other boys looked as he peeped at them between his legs awaiting the descending cane So he returned full of pleasant disconnected thoughts He had had a rare good time He liked every one even that poor little Elliot and yet no one mattered They were all out On the landing he saw the housemaid He felt skittish and irresistible Should he slip his arm round her waist Perhaps better not she might box his ears And he wanted to smoke on the roof before dinner So he only said Please will you stop the boy blacking my brown boots and she with downcast eyes answered Yes sir I will indeed His room was in the pediment Classical architecture like all things in this world that attempt serenity is bound to have its lapses into the undignified and Cadover lapsed hopelessly when it came to Stephen s room It gave him one round window to see through which he must lie upon his stomach one trapdoor opening upon the leads three iron girders three beams six buttresses no circling unless you count the walls no walls unless you count the ceiling and in its embarrassment presented him with the gurgly cistern that supplied the bath water Here he lived absolutely happy and unaware that missus Failing had poked him up here on purpose to prevent him from growing too bumptious Here he worked and sang and practised on the ocharoon Here in the crannies he had constructed shelves and cupboards and useless little drawers He had only one picture the Demeter of Onidos and she hung straight from the roof like a joint of meat Once she was in the drawing room but missus Failing had got tired of her and decreed her removal and this degradation Now she faced the sunrise and when the moon rose its light also fell on her and trembled like light upon the sea For she was never still and if the draught increased she would twist on her string and would sway and tap upon the rafters until Stephen woke up and said what he thought of her Want your nose he would murmur Don t you wish you may get it Then he drew the clothes over his ears while above him in the wind and the darkness the goddess continued her motions Today as he entered he trod on the pile of sixpenny reprints Leighton had brought them up He looked at the portraits in their covers and began to think that these people were not everything What a fate to look like Colonel Ingersoll or to marry missus Julia P Chunk The Demeter turned towards him as he bathed and in the cold water he sang They aren t beautiful they aren t modest I d just as soon follow an old stone goddess and sprang upward through the skylight on to the roof Years ago when a nurse was washing him he had slipped from her soapy hands and got up here She implored him to remember that he was a little gentleman but he forgot the fact if it was a fact and not even the butler could get him down mister Failing who was sitting alone in the garden too ill to read heard a shout Am I an acroterium He looked up and saw a naked child poised on the summit of Cadover Yes he replied but they are unfashionable Go in and the vision had remained with him as something peculiarly gracious He felt that nonsense and beauty have close connections closer connections than Art will allow and that both would remain when his own heaviness and his own ugliness had perished missus Failing found in his remains a sentence that puzzled her I see the respectable mansion I see the smug fortress of culture The doors are shut The windows are shut But on the roof the children go dancing for ever Stephen was a child no longer He never stood on the pediment now except for a bet He never or scarcely ever poured water down the chimneys When he caught the cat he seldom dropped her into the housekeeper s bedroom But still when the weather was fair he liked to come up after bathing and get dry in the sun Today he brought with him a towel a pipe of tobacco and Rickie s story He must get it done some time and he was tired of the six penny reprints The sloping gable was warm and he lay back on it with closed eyes gasping for pleasure Starlings criticized him snots fell on his clean body and over him a little cloud was tinged with the colours of evening Good good he whispered Good oh good and opened the manuscript reluctantly What a production Who was this girl Where did she go to Why so much talk about trees I take it he wrote it when feeling bad he murmured and let it fall into the gutter It fell face downwards and on the back he saw a neat little resume in Miss Pembroke s handwriting intended for such as him Allegory Man modern civilization in bad sense Girl getting into touch with Nature In touch with Nature The girl was a tree He lit his pipe and gazed at the radiant earth The foreground was hidden but there was the village with its elms and the Roman Road and Cadbury Rings There too were those woods and little beech copses crowning a waste of down Not to mention the air or the sun or water Good oh good In touch with Nature What cant would the books think of next His eyes closed He was sleepy Good oh good Sighing into his pipe he fell asleep XIII Glad as Agnes was when her lover returned for lunch she was at the same time rather dismayed she knew that missus Failing would not like her plans altered And her dismay was justified Their hostess was a little stiff and asked whether Stephen had been obnoxious Indeed he hasn t He spent the whole time looking after me From which I conclude he was more obnoxious than usual Rickie praised him diligently But his candid nature showed everything through His aunt soon saw that they had not got on She had expected this almost planned it Nevertheless she resented it and her resentment was to fall on him The storm gathered slowly and many other things went to swell it Weakly people if they are not careful hate one another and when the weakness is hereditary the temptation increases Elliots had never got on among themselves They talked of The Family but they always turned outwards to the health and beauty that lie so promiscuously about the world Rickie s father had turned for a time at all events to his mother Rickie himself was turning to Agnes And missus Failing now was irritable and unfair to the nephew who was lame like her horrible brother and like herself She thought him invertebrate and conventional She was envious of his happiness She did not trouble to understand his art She longed to shatter him but knowing as she did that the human thunderbolt often rebounds and strikes the wielder she held her hand Agnes watched the approaching clouds Rickie had warned her now she began to warn him As the visit wore away she urged him to be pleasant to his aunt and so convert it into a success He replied Why need it be a success a reply in the manner of Ansell She laughed Oh that s so like you men all theory What about your great theory of hating no one As soon as it comes in useful you drop it I don t hate Aunt Emily Honestly But certainly I don t want to be near her or think about her Don t you think there are two great things in life that we ought to aim at truth and kindness Let s have both if we can but let s be sure of having one or the other My aunt gives up both for the sake of being funny And Stephen Wonham pursued Agnes There s another person you hate or don t think about if you prefer it put like that The truth is I m changing I m beginning to see that the world has many people in it who don t matter I had time for them once Not now There was only one gate to the kingdom of heaven now Agnes surprised him by saying But the Wonham boy is evidently a part of your aunt s life She laughs at him but she is fond of him What s that to do with it You ought to be pleasant to him on account of it Why on earth She flushed a little I m old fashioned One ought to consider one s hostess and fall in with her life After we leave it s another thing But while we take her hospitality I think it s our duty Her good sense triumphed Henceforth he tried to fall in with Aunt Emily s life Aunt Emily watched him trying The storm broke as storms sometimes do on Sunday Sunday church was a function at Cadover though a strange one The pompous landau rolled up to the house at a quarter to eleven Then missus Failing said Why am I being hurried and after an interval descended the steps in her ordinary clothes She regarded the church as a sort of sitting room and refused even to wear a bonnet there The village was shocked but at the same time a little proud it would point out the carriage to strangers and gossip about the pale smiling lady who sat in it always alone always late her hair always draped in an expensive shawl This Sunday though late as usual she was not alone Miss Pembroke en grande toilette sat by her side Rickie looking plain and devout perched opposite And Stephen actually came too murmuring that it would be the Benedicite which he had never minded There was also the Litany which drove him into the air again much to missus Failing s delight She enjoyed this sort of thing It amused her when her Protege left the pew looking bored athletic and dishevelled and groping most obviously for his pipe She liked to keep a thoroughbred pagan to shock people He s gone to worship Nature she whispered Rickie did not look up Don t you think he s charming He made no reply Charming whispered Agnes over his head During the sermon she analysed her guests Miss Pembroke undistinguished unimaginative tolerable Rickie intolerable And how pedantic she mused He smells of the University library If he was stupid in the right way he would be a don She looked round the tiny church at the whitewashed pillars the humble pavement the window full of magenta saints There was the vicar s wife And missus Wilbraham s bonnet Ugh The rest of the congregation were poor women with flat hopeless faces she saw them Sunday after Sunday but did not know their names diversified with a few reluctant plough boys and the vile little school children row upon row Ugh what a hole thought missus Failing whose Christianity was the type best described as cathedral What a hole for a cultured woman I don t think it has blunted my sensations though I still see its squalor as clearly as ever And my nephew pretends he is worshipping Pah the hypocrite Above her the vicar spoke of the danger of hurrying from one dissipation to another She treasured his words and continued I cannot stand smugness It is the one the unpardonable sin Fresh air The fresh air that has made Stephen Wonham fresh and companionable and strong Even if it kills I will let in the fresh air Thus reasoned missus Failing in the facile vein of Ibsenism She imagined herself to be a cold eyed Scandinavian heroine Really she was an English old lady who did not mind giving other people a chill provided it was not infectious Agnes on the way back noted that her hostess was a little snappish But one is so hungry after morning service and either so hot or so cold that he would be a saint indeed who becomes a saint at once missus Failing after asserting vindictively that it was impossible to make a living out of literature was courteously left alone Roast beef and moselle might yet work miracles and Agnes still hoped for the introductions the introductions to certain editors and publishers on which her whole diplomacy was bent Rickie would not push himself It was his besetting sin Well for him that he would have a wife and a loving wife who knew the value of enterprise Unfortunately lunch was a quarter of an hour late and during that quarter of an hour the aunt and the nephew quarrelled She had been inveighing against the morning service and he quietly and deliberately replied If organized religion is anything and it is something to me it will not be wrecked by a harmonium and a dull sermon missus Failing frowned I envy you It is a great thing to have no sense of beauty I think I have a sense of beauty which leads me astray if I am not careful But this is a great relief to me I thought the present day young man was an agnostic Isn t agnosticism all the thing at Cambridge Nothing is the thing at Cambridge If a few men are agnostic there it is for some grave reason not because they are irritated with the way the parson says his vowels Agnes intervened Well I side with Aunt Emily I believe in ritual Don t my dear side with me He will only say you have no sense of religion either Excuse me said Rickie perhaps he too was a little hungry I never suggested such a thing I never would suggest such a thing Why cannot you understand my position I almost feel it is that you won t I try to understand your position night and day dear what you mean what you like why you came to Cadover and why you stop here when my presence is so obviously unpleasing to you Luncheon is served said Leighton but he said it too late They discussed the beef and the moselle in silence The air was heavy and ominous Even the Wonham boy was affected by it shivered at times choked once and hastened anew into the sun He could not understand clever people Agnes in a brief anxious interview advised the culprit to take a solitary walk She would stop near Aunt Emily and pave the way for an apology Don t worry too much It doesn t really matter I suppose not dear But it seems a pity considering we are so near the end of our visit Rudeness and Grossness matter and I ve shown both and already I m sorry and I hope she ll let me apologize But from the selfish point of view it doesn t matter a straw She s no more to us than the Wonham boy or the boot boy Which way will you walk I think to that entrenchment Look at it They were sitting on the steps He stretched out his hand to Cadsbury Rings and then let it rest for a moment on her shoulder You re changing me he said gently God bless you for it He enjoyed his walk Cadford was a charming village and for a time he hung over the bridge by the mill So clear was the stream that it seemed not water at all but some invisible quintessence in which the happy minnows and the weeds were vibrating And he paused again at the Roman crossing and thought for a moment of the unknown child The line curved suddenly certainly it was dangerous Then he lifted his eyes to the down The entrenchment showed like the rim of a saucer and over its narrow line peeped the summit of the central tree It looked interesting He hurried forward with the wind behind him The Rings were curious rather than impressive Neither embankment was over twelve feet high and the grass on them had not the exquisite green of Old Sarum but was grey and wiry But Nature if she arranges anything had arranged that from them at all events there should be a view The whole system of the country lay spread before Rickie and he gained an idea of it that he never got in his elaborate ride He saw how all the water converges at Salisbury how Salisbury lies in a shallow basin just at the change of the soil He saw to the north the Plain and the stream of the Cad flowing down from it with a tributary that broke out suddenly as the chalk streams do one village had clustered round the source and clothed itself with trees He saw Old Sarum and hints of the Avon valley and the land above Stone Henge And behind him he saw the great wood beginning unobtrusively as if the down too needed shaving and into it the road to London slipped covering the bushes with white dust Chalk made the dust white chalk made the water clear chalk made the clean rolling outlines of the land and favoured the grass and the distant coronals of trees Here is the heart of our island the Chilterns the North Downs the South Downs radiate hence The fibres of England unite in Wiltshire and did we condescend to worship her here we should erect our national shrine People at that time were trying to think imperially Rickie wondered how they did it for he could not imagine a place larger than England And other people talked of Italy the spiritual fatherland of us all Perhaps Italy would prove marvellous But at present he conceived it as something exotic to be admired and reverenced but not to be loved like these unostentatious fields He drew out a book it was natural for him to read when he was happy and to read out loud and for a little time his voice disturbed the silence of that glorious afternoon The book was Shelley and it opened at a passage that he had cherished greatly two years before and marked as very good I never was attached to that great sect Whose doctrine is that each one should select Out of the world a mistress or a friend And all the rest though fair and wise commend To cold oblivion though it is the code Of modern morals and the beaten road Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread Who travel to their home among the dead By the broad highway of the world and so With one sad friend perhaps a jealous foe The dreariest and the longest journey go It was very good fine poetry and in a sense true Yet he was surprised that he had ever selected it so vehemently This afternoon it seemed a little inhuman Half a mile off two lovers were keeping company where all the villagers could see them They cared for no one else they felt only the pressure of each other and so progressed silent and oblivious across the land He felt them to be nearer the truth than Shelley Even if they suffered or quarrelled they would have been nearer the truth He wondered whether they were Henry Adams and Jessica Thompson both of this parish whose banns had been asked for the second time in the church this morning Why could he not marry on fifteen shillings a week And be looked at them with respect and wished that he was not a cumbersome gentleman Presently he saw something less pleasant his aunt s pony carriage It had crossed the railway and was advancing up the Roman road along by the straw sacks His impulse was to retreat but someone waved to him It was Agnes She waved continually as much as to say Wait for us missus Failing herself raised the whip in a nonchalant way Stephen Wonham was following on foot some way behind He put the Shelley back into his pocket and waited for them When the carriage stopped by some hurdles he went down from the embankment and helped them to dismount He felt rather nervous His aunt gave him one of her disquieting smiles but said pleasantly enough Aren t the Rings a little immense Agnes and I came here because we wanted an antidote to the morning service Pang said the church bell suddenly pang pang It sounded petty and ludicrous They all laughed Rickie blushed and Agnes with a glance that said apologize darted away to the entrenchment as though unable to restrain her curiosity The pony won t move said missus Failing Leave him for Stephen to tie up Will you walk me to the tree in the middle Booh I m tired Give me your arm unless you re tired as well No I came out partly in the hope of helping you How sweet of you She contrasted his blatant unselfishness with the hardness of Stephen Stephen never came out to help you But if you got hold of him he was some good He didn t wobble and bend at the critical moment Her fancy compared Rickie to the cracked church bell sending forth its message of Pang pang to the countryside and Stephen to the young pagans who were said to lie under this field guarding their pagan gold This place is full of ghosties she remarked have you seen any yet I ve kept on the outer rim so far Let s go to the tree in the centre Here s the path The bank of grass where he had sat was broken by a gap through which chariots had entered and farm carts entered now The track following the ancient track led straight through turnips to a similar gap in the second circle and thence continued through more turnips to the central tree Pang said the bell as they paused at the entrance You needn t unharness shouted missus Failing for Stephen was approaching the carriage Yes I will he retorted You will will you she murmured with a smile I wish your brother wasn t quite so uppish Let s get on Doesn t that church distract you It s so faint here said Rickie And it sounded fainter inside though the earthwork was neither thick nor tall and the view though not hidden was greatly diminished He was reminded for a minute of that chalk pit near Madingley whose ramparts excluded the familiar world Agnes was here as she had once been there She stood on the farther barrier waiting to receive them when they had traversed the heart of the camp Admire my mangel wurzels said missus Failing They are said to grow so splendidly on account of the dead soldiers Isn t it a sweet thought Need I say it is your brother s Wonham s he suggested It was the second time that she had made the little slip She nodded and he asked her what kind of ghosties haunted this curious field The D was her prompt reply He leans against the tree in the middle especially on Sunday afternoons and all the worshippers rise through the turnips and dance round him Oh these were decent people he replied looking downwards soldiers and shepherds They have no ghosts They worshipped Mars or Pan Erda perhaps not the devil Pang went the church and was silent for the afternoon service had begun They entered the second entrenchment which was in height breadth and composition similar to the first and excluded still more of the view His aunt continued friendly Agnes stood watching them Soldiers may seem decent in the past she continued but wait till they turn into Tommies from Bulford Camp who rob the chickens I don t mind Bulford Camp said Rickie looking though in vain for signs of its snowy tents The men there are the sons of the men here and have come back to the old country War s horrible yet one loves all continuity And no one could mind a shepherd Indeed What about your brother a shepherd if ever there was Look how he bores you Don t be so sentimental But oh you mean Your brother Stephen He glanced at her nervously He had never known her so queer before Perhaps it was some literary allusion that he had not caught but her face did not at that moment suggest literature In the differential tones that one uses to an old and infirm person he said Stephen Wonham isn t my brother Aunt Emily My dear you re that precise One can t say half brother every time They approached the central tree How you do puzzle me he said dropping her arm and beginning to laugh How could I have a half brother She made no answer Then a horror leapt straight at him and he beat it back and said I will not be frightened The tree in the centre revolved the tree disappeared and he saw a room the room where his father had lived in town Gently he told himself gently Still laughing he said I with a brother younger it s not possible The horror leapt again and he exclaimed It s a foul lie My dear my dear It s a foul lie He wasn t I won t stand My dear before you say several noble things remember that it s worse for him than for you worse for your brother for your half brother for your younger brother But he heard her no longer He was gazing at the past which he had praised so recently which gaped ever wider like an unhallowed grave Turn where he would it encircled him It took visible form it was this double entrenchment of the Rings His mouth went cold and he knew that he was going to faint among the dead He started running missed the exit stumbled on the inner barrier fell into darkness Get his head down said a voice Get the blood back into him That s all he wants Leave him to me Elliot the blood was returning Elliot wake up He woke up The earth he had dreaded lay close to his eyes and seemed beautiful He saw the structure of the clods A tiny beetle swung on the grass blade On his own neck a human hand pressed guiding the blood back to his brain There broke from him a cry not of horror but of acceptance For one short moment he understood Stephen he began and then he heard his own name called Rickie Rickie Agnes hurried from her post on the margin and as if understanding also caught him to her breast Stephen offered to help them further but finding that he made things worse he stepped aside to let them pass and then sauntered inwards The whole field with concentric circles was visible and the broad leaves of the turnips rustled in the gathering wind Miss Pembroke and Elliot were moving towards the Cadover entrance missus Failing stood watching in her turn on the opposite bank He was not an inquisitive boy but as he leant against the tree he wondered what it was all about and whether he would ever know XIV On the way back at that very level crossing where he had paused on his upward route Rickie stopped suddenly and told the girl why he had fainted Hitherto she had asked him in vain His tone had gone from him and he told her harshly and brutally so that she started away with a horrified cry Then his manner altered and he exclaimed Will you mind Are you going to mind Of course I mind she whispered She turned from him and saw up on the sky line two figures that seemed to be of enormous size They re watching us They stand on the edge watching us This country s so open you you can t they watch us wherever we go Of course you mind They heard the rumble of the train and she pulled herself together Come dearest we shall be run over next We re saying things that have no sense But on the way back he repeated They can still see us They can see every inch of this road They watch us for ever And when they arrived at the steps there sure enough were still the two figures gazing from the outer circle of the Rings She made him go to his room at once he was almost hysterical Leighton brought out some tea for her and she sat drinking it on the little terrace Of course she minded Again she was menaced by the abnormal All had seemed so fair and so simple so in accordance with her ideas and then like a corpse this horror rose up to the surface She saw the two figures descend and pause while one of them harnessed the pony she saw them drive downward and knew that before long she must face them and the world She glanced at her engagement ring When the carriage drove up missus Failing dismounted but did not speak It was Stephen who inquired after Rickie She scarcely knowing the sound of her own voice replied that he was a little tired Go and put up the pony said missus Failing rather sharply Agnes give me some tea It is rather strong said Agnes as the carriage drove off and left them alone Then she noticed that missus Failing herself was agitated Her lips were trembling and she saw the boy depart with manifest relief Do you know she said hurriedly as if talking against time Do you know what upset Rickie I do indeed know Has he told any one else I believe not Agnes have I been a fool You have been very unkind said the girl and her eyes filled with tears For a moment missus Failing was annoyed Unkind I do not see that at all I believe in looking facts in the face Rickie must know his ghosts some time Why not this afternoon She rose with quiet dignity but her tears came faster That is not so You told him to hurt him I cannot think what you did it for I suppose because he was rude to you after church It is a mean cowardly revenge What what if it s a lie Then missus Failing it is sickening of you There is no other word Sickening I am sorry a nobody like myself to speak like this How COULD you oh how could you demean yourself Why not even a poor person Her indignation was fine and genuine But her tears fell no longer Nothing menaced her if they were not really brothers It is not a lie my clear sit down I will swear so much solemnly It is not a lie but Agnes waited we can call it a lie if we choose I am not so childish You have said it and we must all suffer You have had your fun I conclude you did it for fun You cannot go back He She pointed towards the stables and could not finish her sentence I have not been a fool twice Agnes did not understand My dense lady can t you follow I have not told Stephen one single word neither before nor now There was a long silence Indeed missus Failing was in an awkward position Rickie had irritated her and in her desire to shock him she had imperilled her own peace She had felt so unconventional upon the hillside when she loosed the horror against him but now it was darting at her as well Suppose the scandal came out Stephen who was absolutely without delicacy would tell it to the people as soon as tell them the time His paganism would be too assertive it might even be in bad taste After all she had a prominent position in the neighbourhood she was talked about respected looked up to After all she was growing old And therefore though she had no true regard for Rickie nor for Agnes nor for Stephen nor for Stephen s parents in whose tragedy she had assisted yet she did feel that if the scandal revived it would disturb the harmony of Cadover and therefore tried to retrace her steps It is easy to say shocking things it is so different to be connected with anything shocking Life and death were not involved but comfort and discomfort were The silence was broken by the sound of feet on the gravel Agnes said hastily Is that really true that he knows nothing You Rickie and I are the only people alive that know He realizes what he is with a precision that is sometimes alarming Who he is he doesn t know and doesn t care I suppose he would know when I m dead There are papers Aunt Emily before he comes may I say to you I m sorry I was so rude missus Failing had not disliked her courage My dear you may We re all off our hinges this Sunday Sit down by me again Agnes obeyed and they awaited the arrival of Stephen They were clever enough to understand each other The thing must be hushed up The matron must repair the consequences of her petulance The girl must hide the stain in her future husband s family Why not Who was injured What does a grown up man want with a grown brother Rickie upstairs how grateful he would be to them for saving him Stephen Yes I m tired of you Go and bathe in the sea All right And the whole thing was settled She liked no fuss and so did he He sat down on the step to tighten his bootlaces Then he would be ready missus Failing laid two or three sovereigns on the step above him Agnes tried to make conversation and said with averted eyes that the sea was a long way off The sea s downhill That s all I know about it He swept up the money with a word of pleasure he was kept like a baby in such things Then he started off but slowly for he meant to walk till the morning He will be gone days said missus Failing The comedy is finished Let us come in She went to her room The storm that she had raised had shattered her Yet because it was stilled for a moment she resumed her old emancipated manner and spoke of it as a comedy As for Miss Pembroke she pretended to be emancipated no longer People like Stephen Wonham were social thunderbolts to be shunned at all costs or at almost all costs Her joy was now unfeigned and she hurried upstairs to impart it to Rickie I don t think we are rewarded if we do right but we are punished if we lie It s the fashion to laugh at poetic justice but I do believe in half of it Cast bitter bread upon the waters and after many days it really will come back to you These were the words of mister Failing They were also the opinions of Stewart Ansell another unpractical person Rickie was trying to write to him when she entered with the good news Dear we re saved He doesn t know and he never is to know I can t tell you how glad I am All the time we saw them standing together up there she wasn t telling him at all She was keeping him out of the way in case you let it out Oh I like her She may be unwise but she is nice really She said I ve been a fool but I haven t been a fool twice You must forgive her Rickie I ve forgiven her and she me for at first I was so angry with her Oh my darling boy I am so glad He was shivering all over and could not reply At last he said Why hasn t she told him Because she has come to her senses But she can t behave to people like that She must tell him Because he must be told such a real thing Such a real thing the girl echoed screwing up her forehead But but you don t mean you re glad about it His head bowed over the letter My God no But it s a real thing She must tell him I nearly told him myself up there when he made me look at the ground but you happened to prevent me How Providence had watched over them She won t tell him I know that much Then Agnes darling he drew her to the table we must talk together a little If she won t then we ought to WE tell him cried the girl white with horror Tell him now when everything has been comfortably arranged You see darling he took hold of her hand what one must do is to think the thing out and settle what s right I m still all trembling and stupid I see it mixed up with other things I want you to help me It seems to me that here and there in life we meet with a person or incident that is symbolical It s nothing in itself yet for the moment it stands for some eternal principle We accept it at whatever costs and we have accepted life But if we are frightened and reject it the moment so to speak passes the symbol is never offered again Is this nonsense Once before a symbol was offered to me I shall not tell you how but I did accept it and cherished it through much anxiety and repulsion and in the end I am rewarded There will be no reward this time I think from such a man the son of such a man But I want to do what is right Because doing right is its own reward said Agnes anxiously I do not think that I have seen few examples of it Doing right is simply doing right I think that all you say is wonderfully clever but since you ask me it IS nonsense dear Rickie absolutely Thank you he said humbly and began to stroke her hand But all my disgust my indignation with my father my love for He broke off he could not bear to mention the name of his mother I was trying to say I oughtn t to follow these impulses too much There are others things Truth Our duty to acknowledge each man accurately however vile he is And apart from ideals here she had won the battle and leaving ideals aside I couldn t meet him and keep silent It isn t in me I should blurt it out But you won t meet him she cried It s all been arranged We ve sent him to the sea Isn t it splendid He s gone My own boy won t be fantastic will he Then she fought the fantasy on its own ground And bye the bye what you call the symbolic moment is over You had it up by the Rings You tried to tell him I interrupted you It s not your fault You did all you could She thought this excellent logic and was surprised that he looked so gloomy So he s gone to the sea For the present that does settle it Has Aunt Emily talked about him yet No Ask her tomorrow if you wish to know Ask her kindly It would be so dreadful if you did not part friends and What s that It was Stephen calling up from the drive He had come back Agnes threw out her hand in despair Elliot the voice called They were facing each other silent and motionless Then Rickie advanced to the window The girl darted in front of him He thought he had never seen her so beautiful She was stopping his advance quite frankly with widespread arms Elliot He moved forward into what He pretended to himself he would rather see his brother before he answered that it was easier to acknowledge him thus But at the back of his soul he knew that the woman had conquered and that he was moving forward to acknowledge her If he calls me again he thought Elliot Well if he calls me once again I will answer him vile as he is He did not call again Stephen had really come back for some tobacco but as he passed under the windows he thought of the poor fellow who had been nipped nothing serious said missus Failing and determined to shout good bye to him And once or twice as he followed the river into the darkness he wondered what it was like to be so weak not to ride not to swim not to care for anything but books and a girl They embraced passionately The danger had brought them very near to each other They both needed a home to confront the menacing tumultuous world And what weary years of work of waiting lay between them and that home Still holding her fast he said I was writing to Ansell when you came in Do you owe him a letter No He paused I was writing to tell him about this He would help us He always picks out the important point Darling I don t like to say anything and I know that mister Ansell would keep a secret but haven t we picked out the important point for ourselves He released her and tore the letter up XV The sense of purity is a puzzling and at times a fearful thing It seems so noble and it starts as one with morality But it is a dangerous guide and can lead us away not only from what is gracious but also from what is good Agnes in this tangle had followed it blindly partly because she was a woman and it meant more to her than it can ever mean to a man partly because though dangerous it is also obvious and makes no demand upon the intellect She could not feel that Stephen had full human rights He was illicit abnormal worse than a man diseased And Rickie remembering whose son he was gradually adopted her opinion He too came to be glad that his brother had passed from him untried that the symbolic moment had been rejected Stephen was the fruit of sin therefore he was sinful He too became a sexual snob And now he must hear the unsavoury details That evening they sat in the walled garden Agues according to arrangement left him alone with his aunt He asked her and was not answered You are shocked she said in a hard mocking voice It is very nice of you to be shocked and I do not wish to grieve you further We will not allude to it again Let us all go on just as we are The comedy is finished He could not tolerate this His nerves were shattered and all that was good in him revolted as well To the horror of Agnes who was within earshot he replied You used to puzzle me Aunt Emily but I understand you at last You have forgotten what other people are like Continual selfishness leads to that I am sure of it I see now how you look at the world Nice of me to be shocked I want to go tomorrow if I may Certainly dear The morning trains are the best And so the disastrous visit ended As he walked back to the house he met a certain poor woman whose child Stephen had rescued at the level crossing and who had decided after some delay that she must thank the kind gentleman in person He has got some brute courage thought Rickie and it was decent of him not to boast about it But he had labelled the boy as Bad and it was convenient to revert to his good qualities as seldom as possible He preferred to brood over his coarseness his caddish ingratitude his irreligion Out of these he constructed a repulsive figure forgetting how slovenly his own perceptions had been during the past week how dogmatic and intolerant his attitude to all that was not Love During the packing he was obliged to go up to the attic to find the Dryad manuscript which had never been returned Leighton came too and for about half an hour they hunted in the flickering light of a candle It was a strange ghostly place and Rickie was quite startled when a picture swung towards him and he saw the Demeter of Cnidus shimmering and grey Leighton suggested the roof mister Stephen sometimes left things on the roof So they climbed out of the skylight the night was perfectly still and continued the search among the gables Enormous stars hung overhead and the roof was bounded by chasms impenetrable and black It doesn t matter said Rickie suddenly convinced of the futility of all that he did Oh let us look properly said Leighton a kindly pliable man who had tried to shirk coming but who was genuinely sympathetic now that he had come They were rewarded the manuscript lay in a gutter charred and smudged The rest of the year was spent by Rickie partly in bed he had a curious breakdown partly in the attempt to get his little stories published He had written eight or nine and hoped they would make up a book and that the book might be called Pan Pipes He was very energetic over this he liked to work for some imperceptible bloom had passed from the world and he no longer found such acute pleasure in people missus Failing s old publishers to whom the book was submitted replied that greatly as they found themselves interested they did not see their way to making an offer at present They were very polite and singled out for special praise Andante Pastorale which Rickie had thought too sentimental but which Agnes had persuaded him to include The stories were sent to another publisher who considered them for six weeks and then returned them A fragment of red cotton Placed by Agnes between the leaves had not shifted its position Can t you try something longer Rickie she said I believe we re on the wrong track Try an out and out love story My notion just now he replied is to leave the passions on the fringe She nodded and tapped for the waiter they had met in a London restaurant I can t soar I can only indicate That s where the musicians have the pull for music has wings and when she says Tristan and he says Isolde you are on the heights at once What do people mean when they call love music artificial I know what they mean though I can t exactly explain Or couldn t you make your stories more obvious I don t see any harm in that Uncle Willie floundered hopelessly He doesn t read much and he got muddled I had to explain and then he was delighted Of course to write down to the public would be quite another thing and horrible You have certain ideas and you must express them But couldn t you express them more clearly You see He got no further than you see The soul and the body The soul s what matters said Agnes and tapped for the waiter again He looked at her admiringly but felt that she was not a perfect critic Perhaps she was too perfect to be a critic Actual life might seem to her so real that she could not detect the union of shadow and adamant that men call poetry He would even go further and acknowledge that she was not as clever as himself and he was stupid enough She did not like discussing anything or reading solid books and she was a little angry with such women as did It pleased him to make these concessions for they touched nothing in her that he valued He looked round the restaurant which was in Soho and decided that she was incomparable At half past two I call on the editor of the Holborn He s got a stray story to look at and he s written about it Oh Rickie Rickie Why didn t you put on a boiled shirt He laughed and teased her The soul s what matters We literary people don t care about dress Well you ought to care And I believe you do Can t you change Too far He had rooms in South Kensington And I ve forgot my card case There s for you She shook her head Naughty naughty boy Whatever will you do Send in my name or ask for a bit of paper and write it Hullo that s Tilliard Tilliard blushed partly on account of the faux pas he had made last June partly on account of the restaurant He explained how he came to be pigging in Soho it was so frightfully convenient and so frightfully cheap Just why Rickie brings me said Miss Pembroke And I suppose you re here to study life said Tilliard sitting down I don t know said Rickie gazing round at the waiters and the guests Doesn t one want to see a good deal of life for writing There s life of a sort in Soho Un peu de faisan s il vows plait Agnes also grabbed at the waiter and paid She always did the paying Rickie muddled with his purse I m cramming pursued Tilliard and so naturally I come into contact with very little at present But later on I hope to see things He blushed a little for he was talking for Rickie s edification It is most frightfully important not to get a narrow or academic outlook don t you think A person like Ansell who goes from Cambridge home home Cambridge it must tell on him in time But mister Ansell is a philosopher A very kinky one said Tilliard abruptly Not my idea of a philosopher How goes his dissertation He never answers my letters replied Rickie He never would I ve heard nothing since June It s a pity he sends in this year There are so many good people in He d have afar better chance if he waited So I said but he wouldn t wait He s so keen about this particular subject What is it asked Agnes About things being real wasn t it Tilliard That s near enough Well good luck to him said the girl And good luck to you mister Tilliard Later on I hope we ll meet again They parted Tilliard liked her though he did not feel that she was quite in his couche sociale His sister for instance would never have been lured into a Soho restaurant except for the experience of the thing Tilliard s couche sociale permitted experiences Provided his heart did not go out to the poor and the unorthodox he might stare at them as much as he liked It was seeing life Agnes put her lover safely into an omnibus at Cambridge Circus She shouted after him that his tie was rising over his collar but he did not hear her For a moment she felt depressed and pictured quite accurately the effect that his appearance would have on the editor The editor was a tall neat man of forty slow of speech slow of soul and extraordinarily kind He and Rickie sat over a fire with an enormous table behind them whereon stood many books waiting to be reviewed I m sorry he said and paused Rickie smiled feebly Your story does not convince He tapped it I have read it with very great pleasure It convinces in parts but it does not convince as a whole and stories don t you think ought to convince as a whole They ought indeed said Rickie and plunged into self depreciation But the editor checked him No no Please don t talk like that I can t bear to hear any one talk against imagination There are countless openings for imagination for the mysterious for the supernatural for all the things you are trying to do and which I hope you will succeed in doing I m not OBJECTING to imagination on the contrary I d advise you to cultivate it to accent it Write a really good ghost story and we d take it at once Or he suggested it as an alternative to imagination or you might get inside life It s worth doing Life echoed Rickie anxiously He looked round the pleasant room as if life might be fluttering there like an imprisoned bird Then he looked at the editor perhaps he was sitting inside life at this very moment See life mister Elliot and then send us another story He held out his hand I am sorry I have to say No thank you it s so much nicer to say Yes please He laid his hand on the young man s sleeve and added Well the interview s not been so alarming after all has it I don t think that either of us is a very alarming person was not Rickie s reply It was what he thought out afterwards in the omnibus His reply was Ow delivered with a slight giggle As he rumbled westward his face was drawn and his eyes moved quickly to the right and left as if he would discover something in the squalid fashionable streets some bird on the wing some radiant archway the face of some god beneath a beaver hat He loved he was loved he had seen death and other things but the heart of all things was hidden There was a password and he could not learn it nor could the kind editor of the Holborn teach him He sighed and then sighed more piteously For had he not known the password once known it and forgotten it already But at this point his fortunes become intimately connected with those of mister Pembroke PART two SAWSTON XVI In three years mister Pembroke had done much to solidify the day boys at Sawston School If they were not solid they were at all events curdling and his activities might reasonably turn elsewhere He had served the school for many years and it was really time he should be entrusted with a boarding house The headmaster an impulsive man who darted about like a minnow and gave his mother a great deal of trouble agreed with him and also agreed with missus Jackson when she said that mister Jackson had served the school for many years and that it was really time he should be entrusted with a boarding house Consequently when Dunwood House fell vacant the headmaster found himself in rather a difficult position Dunwood House was the largest and most lucrative of the boarding houses It stood almost opposite the school buildings Originally it had been a villa residence a red brick villa covered with creepers and crowned with terracotta dragons mister Annison founder of its glory had lived here and had had one or two boys to live with him Times changed The fame of the bishops blazed brighter the school increased the one or two boys became a dozen and an addition was made to Dunwood House that more than doubled its size A huge new building replete with every convenience was stuck on to its right flank Dormitories cubicles studies a preparation room a dining room parquet floors hot air pipes no expense was spared and the twelve boys roamed over it like princes Baize doors communicated on every floor with mister Annison s part and he an anxious gentleman would stroll backwards and forwards a little depressed at the hygienic splendours and conscious of some vanished intimacy Somehow he had known his boys better when they had all muddled together as one family and algebras lay strewn upon the drawing room chairs As the house filled his interest in it decreased When he retired which he did the same summer that Rickie left Cambridge it had already passed the summit of excellence and was beginning to decline Its numbers were still satisfactory and for a little time it would subsist on its past reputation But that mysterious asset the tone had lowered and it was therefore of great importance that mister Annison s successor should be a first class man mister Coates who came next in seniority was passed over and rightly The choice lay between mister Pembroke and mister Jackson the one an organizer the other a humanist mister Jackson was master of the Sixth and with the exception of the headmaster who was too busy to impart knowledge the only first class intellect in the school But he could not or rather would not keep order He told his form that if it chose to listen to him it would learn if it didn t it wouldn t One half listened The other half made paper frogs and bored holes in the raised map of Italy with their penknives When the penknives gritted he punished them with undue severity and then forgot to make them show the punishments up Yet out of this chaos two facts emerged Half the boys got scholarships at the University and some of them including several of the paper frog sort remained friends with him throughout their lives Moreover he was rich and had a competent wife His claim to Dunwood House was stronger than one would have supposed The qualifications of mister Pembroke have already been indicated They prevailed but under conditions If things went wrong he must promise to resign In the first place said the headmaster you are doing so splendidly with the day boys Your attitude towards the parents is magnificent I don t know how to replace you there Whereas of course the parents of a boarder Of course said mister Pembroke The parent of a boarder who only had to remove his son if he was discontented with the school was naturally in a more independent position than the parent who had brought all his goods and chattels to Sawston and was renting a house there Now the parents of boarders this is my second point practically demand that the house master should have a wife A most unreasonable demand said mister Pembroke To my mind also a bright motherly matron is quite sufficient But that is what they demand And that is why do you see we HAVE to regard your appointment as experimental Possibly Miss Pembroke will be able to help you Or I don t know whether if ever He left the sentence unfinished Two days later mister Pembroke proposed to missus Orr He had always intended to marry when he could afford it and once he had been in love violently in love but had laid the passion aside and told it to wait till a more convenient season This was of course the proper thing to do and prudence should have been rewarded But when after the lapse of fifteen years he went as it were to his spiritual larder and took down Love from the top shelf to offer him to missus Orr he was rather dismayed Something had happened Perhaps the god had flown perhaps he had been eaten by the rats At all events he was not there mister Pembroke was conscientious and romantic and knew that marriage without love is intolerable On the other hand he could not admit that love had vanished from him To admit this would argue that he had deteriorated Whereas he knew for a fact that he had improved year by year Each year be grew more moral more efficient more learned more genial So how could he fail to be more loving He did not speak to himself as follows because he never spoke to himself but the following notions moved in the recesses of his mind It is not the fire of youth But I am not sure that I approve of the fire of youth Look at my sister Once she has suffered twice she has been most imprudent and put me to great inconvenience besides for if she was stopping with me she would have done the housekeeping I rather suspect that it is a nobler riper emotion that I am laying at the feet of missus Orr It never took him long to get muddled or to reverse cause and effect In a short time he believed that he had been pining for years and only waiting for this good fortune to ask the lady to share it with him missus Orr was quiet clever kindly capable and amusing and they were old acquaintances Altogether it was not surprising that he should ask her to be his wife nor very surprising that she should refuse But she refused with a violence that alarmed them both He left her house declaring that he had been insulted and she as soon as he left passed from disgust into tears He was much annoyed There was a certain Miss Herriton who though far inferior to missus Orr would have done instead of her But now it was impossible He could not go offering himself about Sawston Having engaged a matron who had the reputation for being bright and motherly he moved into Dunwood House and opened the Michaelmas term Everything went wrong The cook left the boys had a disease called roseola Agnes who was still drunk with her engagement was of no assistance but kept flying up to London to push Rickie s fortunes and to crown everything the matron was too bright and not motherly enough she neglected the little boys and was overattentive to the big ones She left abruptly and the voice of missus Jackson arose prophesying disaster Should he avert it by taking orders Parents do not demand that a house master should be a clergyman yet it reassures them when he is And he would have to take orders some time if he hoped for a school of his own His religious convictions were ready to hand but he spent several uncomfortable days hunting up his religious enthusiasms It was not unlike his attempt to marry missus Orr But his piety was more genuine and this time he never came to the point His sense of decency forbade him hurrying into a Church that he reverenced Moreover he thought of another solution Agnes must marry Rickie in the Christmas holidays and they must come both of them to Sawston she as housekeeper he as assistant master The girl was a good worker when once she was settled down and as for Rickie he could easily be fitted in somewhere in the school He was not a good classic but good enough to take the Lower Fifth He was no athlete but boys might profitably note that he was a perfect gentleman all the same He had no experience but he would gain it He had no decision but he could simulate it Above all thought mister Pembroke it will be something regular for him to do Of course this was not above all Dunwood House held that position But mister Pembroke soon came to think that it was and believed that he was planning for Rickie just as he had believed he was pining for missus Orr Agnes when she got back from the lunch in Soho was told of the plan She refused to give any opinion until she had seen her lover A telegram was sent to him and next morning he arrived He was very susceptible to the weather and perhaps it was unfortunate that the morning was foggy His train had been stopped outside Sawston Station and there he had sat for half an hour listening to the unreal noises that came from the line and watching the shadowy figures that worked there The gas was alight in the great drawing room and in its depressing rays he and Agnes greeted each other and discussed the most momentous question of their lives They wanted to be married there was no doubt of that They wanted it both of them dreadfully But should they marry on these terms I d never thought of such a thing you see When the scholastic agencies sent me circulars after the Tripos I tore them up at once There are the holidays said Agnes You would have three months in the year to yourself and you could do your writing then But who ll read what I ve written and he told her about the editor of the Holborn She became extremely grave At the bottom of her heart she had always mistrusted the little stories and now people who knew agreed with her How could Rickie or any one make a living by pretending that Greek gods were alive or that young ladies could vanish into trees A sparkling society tale full of verve and pathos would have been another thing and the editor might have been convinced by it But what does he mean Rickie was saying What does he mean by life I know what he means but I can t exactly explain You ought to see life Rickie I think he s right there And mister Tilliard was right when he said one oughtn t to be academic He stood in the twilight that fell from the window she in the twilight of the gas I wonder what Ansell would say he murmured Oh poor mister Ansell He was somewhat surprised Why was Ansell poor It was the first time the epithet had been applied to him But to change the conversation said Agnes If we did marry we might get to Italy at Easter and escape this horrible fog Yes Perhaps there Perhaps life would be there He thought of Renan who declares that on the Acropolis at Athens beauty and wisdom do exist really exist as external powers He did not aspire to beauty or wisdom but he prayed to be delivered from the shadow of unreality that had begun to darken the world For it was as if some power had pronounced against him as if by some heedless action he had offended an Olympian god Like many another he wondered whether the god might be appeased by work hard uncongenial work Perhaps he had not worked hard enough or had enjoyed his work too much and for that reason the shadow was falling And above all a schoolmaster has wonderful opportunities for doing good one mustn t forget that To do good For what other reason are we here Let us give up our refined sensations and our comforts and our art if thereby we can make other people happier and better The woman he loved had urged him to do good With a vehemence that surprised her he exclaimed I ll do it Think it over she cautioned though she was greatly pleased No I think over things too much The room grew brighter A boy s laughter floated in and it seemed to him that people were as important and vivid as they had been six months before Then he was at Cambridge idling in the parsley meadows and weaving perishable garlands out of flowers Now he was at Sawston preparing to work a beneficent machine No man works for nothing and Rickie trusted that to him also benefits might accrue that his wound might heal as he laboured and his eyes recapture the Holy Grail XVII In practical matters mister Pembroke was often a generous man He offered Rickie a good salary and insisted on paying Agnes as well And as he housed them for nothing and as Rickie would also have a salary from the school the money question disappeared if not forever at all events for the present I can work you in he said Leave all that to me and in a few days you shall hear from the headmaster He shall create a vacancy And once in we stand or fall together I am resolved on that Rickie did not like the idea of being worked in but he was determined to raise no difficulties It is so easy to be refined and high minded when we have nothing to do But the active useful man cannot be equally particular Rickie s programme involved a change in values as well as a change of occupation Adopt a frankly intellectual attitude mister Pembroke continued I do not advise you at present even to profess any interest in athletics or organization When the headmaster writes he will probably ask whether you are an all round man Boldly say no A bold no is at times the best Take your stand upon classics and general culture Classics A second in the Tripos General culture A smattering of English Literature and less than a smattering of French That is how we begin Then we get you a little post say that of librarian And so on until you are indispensable Rickie laughed the headmaster wrote the reply was satisfactory and in due course the new life began Sawston was already familiar to him But he knew it as an amateur and under an official gaze it grouped itself afresh The school a bland Gothic building now showed as a fortress of learning whose outworks were the boarding houses Those straggling roads were full of the houses of the parents of the day boys These shops were in bounds those out How often had he passed Dunwood House He had once confused it with its rival Cedar View Now he was to live there perhaps for many years On the left of the entrance a large saffron drawing room full of cosy corners and dumpy chairs here the parents would be received On the right of the entrance a study which he shared with Herbert here the boys would be caned he hoped not often In the hall a framed certificate praising the drains the bust of Hermes and a carved teak monkey holding out a salver Some of the furniture had come from Shelthorpe some had been bought from mister Annison some of it was new But throughout he recognized a certain decision of arrangement Nothing in the house was accidental or there merely for its own sake He contrasted it with his room at Cambridge which had been a jumble of things that he loved dearly and of things that he did not love at all Now these also had come to Dunwood House and had been distributed where each was seemly Sir Percival to the drawing room the photograph of Stockholm to the passage his chair his inkpot and the portrait of his mother to the study And then he contrasted it with the Ansells house to which their resolute ill taste had given unity He was extremely sensitive to the inside of a house holding it an organism that expressed the thoughts conscious and subconscious of its inmates He was equally sensitive to places He would compare Cambridge with Sawston and either with a third type of existence to which for want of a better name he gave the name of Wiltshire It must not be thought that he is going to waste his time These contrasts and comparisons never took him long and he never indulged in them until the serious business of the day was over And as time passed he never indulged in them at all The school returned at the end of January before he had been settled in a week His health had improved but not greatly and he was nervous at the prospect of confronting the assembled house All day long cabs had been driving up full of boys in bowler hats too big for them and Agnes had been superintending the numbering of the said hats and the placing of them in cupboards since they would not be wanted till the end of the term Each boy had or should have had a bag so that he need not unpack his box till the morrow One boy had only a brown paper parcel tied with hairy string and Rickie heard the firm pleasant voice say But you ll bring a bag next term and the submissive Yes missus Elliot of the reply In the passage he ran against the head boy who was alarmingly like an undergraduate They looked at each other suspiciously and parted Two minutes later he ran into another boy and then into another and began to wonder whether they were doing it on purpose and if so whether he ought to mind As the day wore on the noises grew louder trampings of feet breakdowns jolly little squawks and the cubicles were assigned and the bags unpacked and the bathing arrangements posted up and Herbert kept on saying All this is informal all this is informal We shall meet the house at eight fifteen And so at eight ten Rickie put on his cap and gown hitherto symbols of pupilage now to be symbols of dignity the very cap and gown that Widdrington had so recently hung upon the college fountain Herbert similarly attired was waiting for him in their private dining room where also sat Agnes ravenously devouring scrambled eggs But you ll wear your hoods she cried Herbert considered and them said she was quite right He fetched his white silk Rickie the fragment of rabbit s wool that marks the degree of B A Thus attired they proceeded through the baize door They were a little late and the boys who were marshalled in the preparation room were getting uproarious One forgetting how far his voice carried shouted Cave Here comes the Whelk And another young devil yelled The Whelk s brought a pet with him You mustn t mind said Herbert kindly We masters make a point of never minding nicknames unless of course they are applied openly in which case a thousand lines is not too much Rickie assented and they entered the preparation room just as the prefects had established order Here Herbert took his seat on a high legged chair while Rickie like a queen consort sat near him on a chair with somewhat shorter legs Each chair had a desk attached to it and Herbert flung up the lid of his and then looked round the preparation room with a quick frown as if the contents had surprised him So impressed was Rickie that he peeped sideways but could only see a little blotting paper in the desk Then he noticed that the boys were impressed too Their chatter ceased They attended The room was almost full The prefects instead of lolling disdainfully in the back row were ranged like councillors beneath the central throne This was an innovation of mister Pembroke s Carruthers the head boy sat in the middle with his arm round Lloyd It was Lloyd who had made the matron too bright he nearly lost his colours in consequence These two were grown up Beside them sat Tewson a saintly child in the spectacles who had risen to this height by reason of his immense learning He like the others was a school prefect The house prefects an inferior brand were beyond and behind came the indistinguishable many The faces all looked alike as yet except the face of one boy who was inclined to cry School said mister Pembroke slowly closing the lid of the desk school is the world in miniature Then he paused as a man well may who has made such a remark It is not however the intention of this work to quote an opening address Rickie at all events refused to be critical Herbert s experience was far greater than his and he must take his tone from him Nor could any one criticize the exhortations to be patriotic athletic learned and religious that flowed like a four part fugue from mister Pembroke s mouth He was a practised speaker that is to say he held his audience s attention He told them that this term the second of his reign was THE term for Dunwood House that it behooved every boy to labour during it for his house s honour and through the house for the honour of the school Taking a wider range he spoke of England or rather of Great Britain and of her continental foes Portraits of empire builders hung on the wall and he pointed to them He quoted imperial poets He showed how patriotism had broadened since the days of Shakespeare who for all his genius could only write of his country as This fortress built by nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war This hazy breed of men this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea And it seemed that only a short ladder lay between the preparation room and the Anglo Saxon hegemony of the globe Then he paused and in the silence came sob sob sob from a little boy who was regretting a villa in Guildford and his mother s half acre of garden The proceeding terminated with the broader patriotism of the school anthem recently composed by the organist Words and tune were still a matter for taste and it was mister Pembroke and he only because he had the music who gave the right intonation to Perish each laggard Let it not be said That Sawston such within her walls hath bred Come come he said pleasantly as they ended with harmonies in the style of Richard Strauss This will never do We must grapple with the anthem this term you re as tuneful as as day boys Hearty laughter and then the whole house filed past them and shook hands But how did it impress you Herbert asked as soon as they were back in their own part Agnes had provided them with a tray of food the meals were still anyhow and she had to fly at once to see after the boys I liked the look of them I meant rather how did the house impress you as a house I don t think I thought said Rickie rather nervously It is not easy to catch the spirit of a thing at once I only saw a roomful of boys My dear Rickie don t be so diffident You are perfectly right You only did see a roomful of boys As yet there s nothing else to see The house like the school lacks tradition Look at Winchester Look at the traditional rivalry between Eton and Harrow Tradition is of incalculable importance if a school is to have any status Why should Sawston be without Yes Tradition is of incalculable value And I envy those schools that have a natural connection with the past Of course Sawston has a past though not of the kind that you quite want The sons of poor tradesmen went to it at first So wouldn t its traditions be more likely to linger in the Commercial School he concluded nervously You have a great deal to learn a very great deal Listen to me Why has Sawston no traditions His round rather foolish face assumed the expression of a conspirator Bending over the mutton he whispered I can tell you why Owing to the day boys How can traditions flourish in such soil Picture the day boy s life at home for meals at home for preparation at home for sleep running home with every fancied wrong There are day boys in your class and mark my words they will give you ten times as much trouble as the boarders late slovenly stopping away at the slightest pretext And then the letters from the parents Why has my boy not been moved this term Why has my boy been moved this term I am a dissenter and do not wish my boy to subscribe to the school mission Can you let my boy off early to water the garden Remember that I have been a day boy house master and tried to infuse some esprit de corps into them It is practically impossible They come as units and units they remain Worse They infect the boarders Their pestilential critical discontented attitude is spreading over the school If I had my own way He stopped somewhat abruptly Was that why you laughed at their singing Not at all Not at all It is not my habit to set one section of the school against the other After a little they went the rounds The boys were in bed now Good night called Herbert standing in the corridor of the cubicles and from behind each of the green curtains came the sound of a voice replying Good night sir Good night he observed into each dormitory Then he went to the switch in the passage and plunged the whole house into darkness Rickie lingered behind him strangely impressed In the morning those boys had been scattered over England leading their own lives Now for three months they must change everything see new faces accept new ideals They like himself must enter a beneficent machine and learn the value of esprit de corps Good luck attend them good luck and a happy release For his heart would have them not in these cubicles and dormitories but each in his own dear home amongst faces and things that he knew Next morning after chapel he made the acquaintance of his class Towards that he felt very differently Esprit de corps was not expected of it It was simply two dozen boys who were gathered together for the purpose of learning Latin His duties and difficulties would not lie here He was not required to provide it with an atmosphere The scheme of work was already mapped out and he started gaily upon familiar words Pan ovium custos tua si tibi Maenala curae Adsis O Tegaee favens Do you think that beautiful he asked and received the honest answer No sir I don t think I do He met Herbert in high spirits in the quadrangle during the interval But Herbert thought his enthusiasm rather amateurish and cautioned him You must take care they don t get out of hand I approve of a lively teacher but discipline must be established first I felt myself a learner not a teacher If I m wrong over a point or don t know I mean to tell them at once Herbert shook his head It s different if I was really a scholar But I can t pose as one can I I know much more than the boys but I know very little Surely the honest thing is to be myself to them Let them accept or refuse me as that That s the only attitude we shall any of us profit by in the end mister Pembroke was silent Then he observed There is as you say a higher attitude and a lower attitude Yet here as so often cannot we find a golden mean between them What s that said a dreamy voice They turned and saw a tall spectacled man who greeted the newcomer kindly and took hold of his arm What s that about the golden mean mister Jackson mister Elliot mister Elliot mister Jackson said Herbert who did not seem quite pleased Rickie have you a moment to spare me But the humanist spoke to the young man about the golden mean and the pinchbeck mean adding You know the Greeks aren t broad church clergymen They really aren t in spite of much conflicting evidence Boys will regard Sophocles as a kind of enlightened bishop and something tells me that they are wrong mister Jackson is a classical enthusiast said Herbert He makes the past live I want to talk to you about the humdrum present And I am warning him against the humdrum past That s another point mister Elliot Impress on your class that many Greeks and most Romans were frightfully stupid and if they disbelieve you read Ctesiphon with them or Valerius Flaccus Whatever is that noise It comes from your class room I think snapped the other master So it does Ah yes I expect they are putting your little Tewson into the waste paper basket I always lock my class room in the interval Yes and carry the key in my pocket Ah But mister Elliot I am a cousin of Widdrington s He wrote to me about you I am so glad Will you first of all come to supper next Sunday I am afraid put in Herbert that we poor housemasters must deny ourselves festivities in term time But mayn t he come once just once May my dear Jackson My brother in law is not a baby He decides for himself Rickie naturally refused As soon as they were out of hearing Herbert said This is a little unfortunate Who is mister Widdrington I knew him at Cambridge Let me explain how we stand he continued after a pause Jackson is the worst of the reactionaries here while I why should I conceal it have thrown in my lot with the party of progress You will see how we suffer from him at the masters meetings He has no talent for organization and yet he is always inflicting his ideas on others It was like his impertinence to dictate to you what authors you should read and meanwhile the sixth form room like a bear garden and a school prefect being put into the waste paper basket My good Rickie there s nothing to smile at How is the school to go on with a man like that It would be a case of quick march if it was not for his brilliant intellect That s why I say it s a little unfortunate You will have very little in common you and he Rickie did not answer He was very fond of Widdrington who was a quaint sensitive person And he could not help being attracted by mister Jackson whose welcome contrasted pleasantly with the official breeziness of his other colleagues He wondered too whether it is so very reactionary to contemplate the antique It is true that I vote Conservative pursued mister Pembroke apparently confronting some objector But why Because the Conservatives rather than the Liberals stand for progress One must not be misled by catch words Didn t you want to ask me something Ah yes You found a boy in your form called Varden Varden Yes there is Drop on him heavily He has broken the statutes of the school He is attending as a day boy The statutes provide that a boy must reside with his parents or guardians He does neither It must be stopped You must tell the headmaster Where does the boy live At a certain missus Orr s who has no connection with the school of any kind It must be stopped He must either enter a boarding house or go But why should I tell said Rickie He remembered the boy an unattractive person with protruding ears It is the business of his house master House master exactly Here we come back again Who is now the day boys house master Jackson once again as if anything was Jackson s business I handed the house back last term in a most flourishing condition It has already gone to rack and ruin for the second time To return to Varden I have unearthed a put up job missus Jackson and missus Orr are friends Do you see It all works round I see It does or might The headmaster will never sanction it when it s put to him plainly But why should I put it said Rickie twisting the ribbons of his gown round his fingers Because you re the boy s form master Is that a reason Of course it is I only wondered whether He did not like to say that he wondered whether he need do it his first morning By some means or other you must find out of course you know already but you must find out from the boy I know I have it Where s his health certificate He had forgotten it Just like them Well when he brings it it will be signed by missus Orr and you must look at it and say Orr Orr missus Orr or something to that effect and then the whole thing will come naturally out The bell rang and they went in for the hour of school that concluded the morning Varden brought his health certificate a pompous document asserting that he had not suffered from roseola or kindred ailments in the holidays and for a long time Rickie sat with it before him spread open upon his desk He did not quite like the job It suggested intrigue and he had come to Sawston not to intrigue but to labour Doubtless Herbert was right and mister Jackson and missus Orr were wrong But why could they not have it out among themselves Then he thought I am a coward and that s why I m raising these objections called the boy up to him and it did all come out naturally more or less Hitherto Varden had lived with his mother but she had left Sawston at Christmas and now he would live with missus Orr mister Jackson sir said it would be all right Yes yes said Rickie quite so He remembered Herbert s dictum Masters must present a united front If they do not the deluge He sent the boy back to his seat and after school took the compromising health certificate to the headmaster The headmaster was at that time easily excited by a breach of the constitution Parents or guardians he reputed parents or guardians and flew with those words on his lips to mister Jackson To say that Rickie was a cat s paw is to put it too strongly Herbert was strictly honourable and never pushed him into an illegal or really dangerous position but there is no doubt that on this and on many other occasions he had to do things that he would not otherwise have done There was always some diplomatic corner that had to be turned always something that he had to say or not to say As the term wore on he lost his independence almost without knowing it He had much to learn about boys and he learnt not by direct observation for which he believed he was unfitted but by sedulous imitation of the more experienced masters Originally he had intended to be friends with his pupils and mister Pembroke commended the intention highly but you cannot be friends either with boy or man unless you give yourself away in the process and mister Pembroke did not commend this He for personal intercourse substituted the safer personal influence and gave his junior hints on the setting of kindly traps in which the boy does give himself away and reveals his shy delicate thoughts while the master intact commends or corrects them Originally Rickie had meant to help boys in the anxieties that they undergo when changing into men at Cambridge he had numbered this among life s duties But here is a subject in which we must inevitably speak as one human being to another not as one who has authority or the shadow of authority and for this reason the elder school master could suggest nothing but a few formulae Formulae like kindly traps were not in Rickie s line so he abandoned these subjects altogether and confined himself to working hard at what was easy In the house he did as Herbert did and referred all doubtful subjects to him In his form oddly enough he became a martinet It is so much simpler to be severe He grasped the school regulations and insisted on prompt obedience to them He adopted the doctrine of collective responsibility When one boy was late he punished the whole form I can t help it he would say as if he was a power of nature As a teacher he was rather dull He curbed his own enthusiasms finding that they distracted his attention and that while he throbbed to the music of Virgil the boys in the back row were getting unruly But on the whole he liked his form work he knew why he was there and Herbert did not overshadow him so completely What was amiss with Herbert He had known that something was amiss and had entered into partnership with open eyes The man was kind and unselfish more than that he was truly charitable and it was a real pleasure to him to give pleasure to others Certainly he might talk too much about it afterwards but it was the doing not the talking that he really valued and benefactors of this sort are not too common He was moreover diligent and conscientious his heart was in his work and his adherence to the Church of England no mere matter of form He was capable of affection he was usually courteous and tolerant Then what was amiss Why in spite of all these qualities should Rickie feel that there was something wrong with him nay that he was wrong as a whole and that if the Spirit of Humanity should ever hold a judgment he would assuredly be classed among the goats The answer at first sight appeared a graceless one it was that Herbert was stupid Not stupid in the ordinary sense he had a business like brain and acquired knowledge easily but stupid in the important sense his whole life was coloured by a contempt of the intellect That he had a tolerable intellect of his own was not the point it is in what we value not in what we have that the test of us resides Now Rickie s intellect was not remarkable He came to his worthier results rather by imagination and instinct than by logic An argument confused him and he could with difficulty follow it even on paper But he saw in this no reason for satisfaction and tried to make such use of his brain as he could just as a weak athlete might lovingly exercise his body Like a weak athlete too he loved to watch the exploits or rather the efforts of others their efforts not so much to acquire knowledge as to dispel a little of the darkness by which we and all our acquisitions are surrounded Cambridge had taught him this and he knew if for no other reason that his time there had not been in vain And Herbert s contempt for such efforts revolted him He saw that for all his fine talk about a spiritual life he had but one test for things success success for the body in this life or for the soul in the life to come And for this reason Humanity and perhaps such other tribunals as there may be would assuredly reject him

2060_150855_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Suddenly he tightened his pressure and said Darling why don t you still wear ear rings 
none	none	Ear rings She laughed
2060_150855_000004_000002	train-clean-360	 My taste has improved perhaps 
2060_150855_000005_000000	train-clean-360	So after all they never mentioned Gerald s name 
none	none	But he hoped it was still dear to her 
2060_150855_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He did not want her to forget the greatest moment in her life 
none	none	His love desired not ownership but confidence and to a love so pure it does not seem terrible to come second 
2060_150855_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He valued emotion not for itself but because it is the only final path to intimacy 
2060_150855_000006_000001	train-clean-360	She ever robust and practical always discouraged him She was not cold she would willingly embrace him 
none	none	But she hated being upset and would laugh or thrust him off when his voice grew serious In this she reminded him of his mother 
2060_150855_000006_000003	train-clean-360	But his mother he had never concealed it from himself had glories to which his wife would never attain glories that had unfolded against a life of horror a life even more horrible than he had guessed 
2060_150855_000006_000004	train-clean-360	He thought of her often during these earlier months 
none	none	Did she bless his union so different to her own 
2060_150855_000006_000006	train-clean-360	Did she love his wife 
2060_150855_000006_000007	train-clean-360	He tried to speak of her to Agnes but again she was reluctant 
none	none	And perhaps it was this aversion to acknowledge the dead whose images alone have immortality that made her own image somewhat transient so that when he left her no mystic influence remained and only by an effort could he realize that God had united them forever 
2060_150855_000007_000000	train-clean-360	They conversed and differed healthily upon other topics 
2060_150855_000007_000001	train-clean-360	A rifle corps was to be formed she hoped that the boys would have proper uniforms instead of shooting in their old clothes as mister Jackson had suggested There was Tewson could nothing be done about him 
2060_150855_000007_000002	train-clean-360	He would slink away from the other prefects and go with boys of his own age 
none	none	There was Lloyd he would not learn the school anthem saying that it hurt his throat And above all there was Varden who to Rickie s bewilderment was now a member of Dunwood House
2060_150855_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 He had to go somewhere said Agnes 
none	none	Lucky for his mother that we had a vacancy Yes but when I meet missus Orr I can t help feeling ashamed
2060_150855_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh missus Orr 
2060_150855_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Who cares for her 
2060_150855_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Her teeth are drawn 
none	none	If she chooses to insinuate that we planned it let her Hers was rank dishonesty She attempted to set up a boarding house 
2060_150855_000011_000000	train-clean-360	missus Orr who was quite rich had attempted no such thing 
2060_150855_000011_000001	train-clean-360	She had taken the boy out of charity and without a thought of being unconstitutional But in had come this officious Limpet and upset the headmaster and she was scolded and missus Varden was scolded and mister Jackson was scolded and the boy was scolded and placed with mister Pembroke whom she revered less than any man in the world 
2060_150855_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Naturally enough she considered it a further attempt of the authorities to snub the day boys for whose advantage the school had been founded 
none	none	She and missus Jackson discussed the subject at their tea parties and the latter lady was sure that no good no good of any kind would come to Dunwood House from such ill gotten plunder
2060_150855_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 We say Let them talk persisted Rickie but I never did like letting people talk 
2060_150855_000012_000001	train-clean-360	We are right and they are wrong but I wish the thing could have been done more quietly 
2060_150855_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The headmaster does get so excited 
2060_150855_000012_000003	train-clean-360	He has given a gang of foolish people their opportunity 
none	none	I don t like being branded as the day boy s foe when I think how much I would have given to be a day boy myself 
2060_150855_000012_000005	train-clean-360	My father found me a nuisance and put me through the mill and I can never forget it particularly the evenings 
none	none	There s very little bullying here said Agnes There was very little bullying at my school There was simply the atmosphere of unkindness which no discipline can dispel 
2060_150855_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It s not what people do to you but what they mean that hurts 
none	none	I don t understand
2060_150855_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Physical pain doesn t hurt at least not what I call hurt if a man hits you by accident or play 
2060_150855_000016_000001	train-clean-360	But just a little tap when you know it comes from hatred is too terrible 
2060_150855_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Boys do hate each other I remember it and see it again 
2060_150855_000016_000003	train-clean-360	They can make strong isolated friendships but of general good fellowship they haven t a notion 
none	none	All I know is there s very little bullying here
2060_150855_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 You see the notion of good fellowship develops late you can just see its beginning here among the prefects up at Cambridge it flourishes amazingly 
2060_150855_000018_000001	train-clean-360	That s why I pity people who don t go up to Cambridge not because a University is smart but because those are the magic years and with luck you see up there what you couldn t see before and mayn t ever see again 
none	none	Aren t these the magic years the lady demanded 
2060_150855_000020_000000	train-clean-360	He laughed and hit at her 
2060_150855_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I m getting somewhat involved 
2060_150855_000020_000002	train-clean-360	But hear me O Agnes for I am practical 
none	none	I approve of our public schools 
2060_150855_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Long may they flourish 
2060_150855_000020_000005	train-clean-360	But I do not approve of the boarding house system 
none	none	It isn t an inevitable adjunct Good gracious me she shrieked
2060_150855_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Have you gone mad 
2060_150855_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Silence madam 
2060_150855_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Don t betray me to Herbert or I ll give us the sack But seriously what is the good of throwing boys so much together Isn t it building their lives on a wrong basis 
none	none	They don t understand each other 
2060_150855_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I wish they did but they don t 
none	none	They don t realize that human beings are simply marvellous 
2060_150855_000022_000005	train-clean-360	When they do the whole of life changes and you get the true thing 
2060_150855_000022_000006	train-clean-360	But don t pretend you ve got it before you have 
2060_150855_000022_000007	train-clean-360	Patriotism and esprit de corps are all very well but masters a little forget that they must grow from sentiment 
2060_150855_000022_000008	train-clean-360	They cannot create one 
2060_150855_000022_000009	train-clean-360	Cannot cannot cannot 
2060_150855_000022_000010	train-clean-360	I never cared a straw for England until I cared for Englishmen and boys can t love the school when they hate each other 
none	none	Ladies and gentlemen I will now conclude my address And most of it is copied out of mister Ansell The truth is he was suddenly ashamed He had been carried away on the flood of his old emotions Cambridge and all that it meant had stood before him passionately clear and beside it stood his mother and the sweet family life which nurses up a boy until he can salute his equals He was ashamed for he remembered his new resolution to work without criticizing to throw himself vigorously into the machine not to mind if he was pinched now and then by the elaborate wheels mister Ansell cried his wife laughing somewhat shrilly
2060_150855_000024_000002	train-clean-360	 Aha 
none	none	Now I understand 
2060_150855_000024_000004	train-clean-360	It s just the kind of thing poor mister Ansell would say 
2060_150855_000024_000005	train-clean-360	Well I m brutal 
none	none	I believe it does Varden good to have his ears pulled now and then and I don t care whether they pull them in play or not 
2060_150855_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Boys ought to rough it or they never grow up into men and your mother would have agreed with me 
none	none	Oh yes and you re all wrong about patriotism 
2060_150855_000024_000009	train-clean-360	It can can create a sentiment 
none	none	She was unusually precise and had followed his thoughts with an attention that was also unusual 
2060_150855_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He wondered whether she was not right and regretted that she proceeded to say My dear boy you mustn t talk these heresies inside Dunwood House 
none	none	You sound just like one of that reactionary Jackson set who want to fling the school back a hundred years and have nothing but day boys all dressed anyhow
2060_150855_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 The Jackson set have their points 
none	none	You d better join it
2060_150855_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 The Dunwood House set has its points For Rickie suffered from the Primal Curse which is not as the Authorized Version suggests the knowledge of good and evil but the knowledge of good and evil 
none	none	Then stick to the Dunwood House set I do and shall Again he was ashamed 
2060_150855_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Why would he see the other side of things 
2060_150855_000030_000002	train-clean-360	He rebuked his soul not unsuccessfully and then they returned to the subject of Varden 
none	none	I m certain he suffers said he for she would do nothing but laugh Each boy who passes pulls his ears very funny no doubt but every day they stick out more and get redder and this afternoon when he didn t know he was being watched he was holding his head and moaning 
2060_150855_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I hate the look about his eyes 
2060_150855_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate the whole boy 
none	none	Nasty weedy thing Well I m a nasty weedy thing if it comes to that
2060_150855_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 No you aren t she cried kissing him 
none	none	But he led her back to the subject 
2060_150855_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Could nothing be suggested 
2060_150855_000034_000003	train-clean-360	He drew up some new rules alterations in the times of going to bed and so on the effect of which would be to provide fewer opportunities for the pulling of Varden s ears 
none	none	The rules were submitted to Herbert who sympathized with weakliness more than did his sister and gave them his careful consideration But unfortunately they collided with other rules and on a closer examination he found that they also ran contrary to the fundamentals on which the government of Dunwood House was based 
2060_150855_000034_000006	train-clean-360	So nothing was done 
none	none	Agnes was rather pleased and took to teasing her husband about Varden 
2060_150855_000034_000008	train-clean-360	At last he asked her to stop 
2060_150855_000034_000009	train-clean-360	He felt uneasy about the boy almost superstitious 
none	none	His first morning s work had brought sixty pounds a year to their hotel XIX They did not get to Italy at Easter Herbert had the offer of some private pupils and needed Rickie s help It seemed unreasonable to leave England when money was to be made in it so they went to Ilfracombe instead They spent three weeks among the natural advantages and unnatural disadvantages of that resort It was out of the season and they encamped in a huge hotel which took them at a reduction By a disastrous chance the Jacksons were down there too and a good deal of constrained civility had to pass between the two families Constrained it was not in mister Jackson s case At all times he was ready to talk and as long as they kept off the school it was pleasant enough But he was very indiscreet and feminine tact had often to intervene Go away dear ladies he would then observe You think you see life because you see the chasms in it Yet all the chasms are full of female skeletons The ladies smiled anxiously To Rickie he was friendly and even intimate They had long talks on the deserted Capstone while their wives sat reading in the Winter Garden and mister Pembroke kept an eye upon the tutored youths Once I had tutored youths said mister Jackson but I lost them all by letting them paddle with my nieces It is so impossible to remember what is proper And sooner or later their talk gravitated towards his central passion the Fragments of Sophocles Some day never said Herbert he would edit them At present they were merely in his blood With the zeal of a scholar and the imagination of a poet he reconstructed lost dramas Niobe Phaedra Philoctetes against Troy whose names but for an accident would have thrilled the world Is it worth it he cried Had we better be planting potatoes And then We had but this is the second best Agnes did not approve of these colloquies mister Jackson was not a buffoon but he behaved like one which is what matters and from the Winter Garden she could see people laughing at him and at her husband who got excited too She hinted once or twice but no notice was taken and at last she said rather sharply Now you re not to Rickie I won t have it He s a type that suits me He knows people I know or would like to have known He was a friend of Tony Failing s It is so hard to realize that a man connected with one was great Uncle Tony seems to have been He loved poetry and music and pictures and everything tempted him to live in a kind of cultured paradise with the door shut upon squalor But to have more decent people in the world he sacrificed everything to that He would have smashed the whole beauty shop if it would help him I really couldn t go as far as that I don t think one need go as far pictures might have to be smashed but not music or poetry surely they help and Jackson doesn t think so either Well I won t have it and that s enough She laughed for her voice had a little been that of the professional scold You see we must hang together He s in the reactionary camp He doesn t know it He doesn t know that he is in any camp at all His wife is which comes to the same Still it s the holidays He and mister Jackson had drifted apart in the term chiefly owing to the affair of Varden We were to have the holidays to ourselves you know And following some line of thought he continued He cheers one up He does believe in poetry Smart sentimental books do seem absolutely absurd to him and gods and fairies far nearer to reality He tries to express all modern life in the terms of Greek mythology because the Greeks looked very straight at things and Demeter or Aphrodite are thinner veils than The survival of the fittest or A marriage has been arranged and other draperies of modern journalese And do you know what that means It means that poetry not prose lies at the core No I can tell you what it means balder dash His mouth fell She was sweeping away the cobwebs with a vengeance I hope you re wrong he replied for those are the lines on which I ve been writing however badly for the last two years But you write stories not poems He looked at his watch Lessons again One never has a moment s peace Poor Rickie You shall have a real holiday in the summer And she called after him to say Remember dear about mister Jackson Don t go talking so much to him Rather arbitrary Her tone had been a little arbitrary of late But what did it matter mister Jackson was not a friend and he must risk the chance of offending Widdrington After the lesson he wrote to Ansell whom he had not seen since June asking him to come down to Ilfracombe if only for a day On reading the letter over its tone displeased him It was quite pathetic it sounded like a cry from prison I can t send him such nonsense he thought and wrote again But phrase it as he would the letter always suggested that he was unhappy What s wrong he wondered I could write anything I wanted to him once So he scrawled Come on a post card But even this seemed too serious The post card followed the letters and Agnes found them all in the waste paper basket Then she said I ve been thinking oughtn t you to ask mister Ansell over A breath of sea air would do the poor thing good There was no difficulty now He wrote at once My dear Stewart We both so much wish you could come over But the invitation was refused A little uneasy he wrote again using the dialect of their past intimacy The effect of this letter was not pathetic but jaunty and he felt a keen regret as soon as it slipped into the box It was a relief to receive no reply He brooded a good deal over this painful yet intangible episode Was the pain all of his own creating or had it been produced by something external And he got the answer that brooding always gives it was both He was morbid and had been so since his visit to Cadover quicker to register discomfort than joy But none the less Ansell was definitely brutal and Agnes definitely jealous Brutality he could understand alien as it was to himself Jealousy equally alien was a harder matter Let husband and wife be as sun and moon or as moon and sun Shall they therefore not give greeting to the stars He was willing to grant that the love that inspired her might be higher than his own Yet did it not exclude them both from much that is gracious That dream of his when he rode on the Wiltshire expanses a curious dream the lark silent the earth dissolving And he awoke from it into a valley full of men She was jealous in many ways sometimes in an open humorous fashion sometimes more subtly never content till we had extended our patronage and if possible our pity She began to patronize and pity Ansell and most sincerely trusted that he would get his fellowship Otherwise what was the poor fellow to do Ridiculous as it may seem she was even jealous of Nature One day her husband escaped from Ilfracombe to Morthoe and came back ecstatic over its fangs of slate piercing an oily sea Sounds like an hippopotamus she said peevishly And when they returned to Sawston through the Virgilian counties she disliked him looking out of the windows for all the world as if Nature was some dangerous woman He resumed his duties with a feeling that he had never left them Again he confronted the assembled house This term was again the term school still the world in miniature The music of the four part fugue entered into him more deeply and he began to hum its little phrases The same routine the same diplomacies the same old sense of only half knowing boys or men he returned to it all and all that changed was the cloud of unreality which ever brooded a little more densely than before He spoke to his wife about this he spoke to her about everything and she was alarmed and wanted him to see a doctor But he explained that it was nothing of any practical importance nothing that interfered with his work or his appetite nothing more than a feeling that the cow was not really there She laughed and how is the cow today soon passed into a domestic joke XX Ansell was in his favourite haunt the reading room of the British Museum In that book encircled space he always could find peace He loved to see the volumes rising tier above tier into the misty dome He loved the chairs that glide so noiselessly and the radiating desks and the central area where the catalogue shelves curve round the superintendent s throne There he knew that his life was not ignoble It was worth while to grow old and dusty seeking for truth though truth is unattainable restating questions that have been stated at the beginning of the world Failure would await him but not disillusionment It was worth while reading books and writing a book or two which few would read and no one perhaps endorse He was not a hero and he knew it His father and sister by their steady goodness had made this life possible But all the same it was not the life of a spoilt child In the next chair to him sat Widdrington engaged in his historical research His desk was edged with enormous volumes and every few moments an assistant brought him more They rose like a wall against Ansell Towards the end of the morning a gap was made and through it they held the following conversation I ve been stopping with my cousin at Sawston M m It was quite exciting The air rang with battle About two thirds of the masters have lost their heads and are trying to produce a gimcrack copy of Eton Last term you know with a great deal of puffing and blowing they fixed the numbers of the school This term they want to create a new boarding house They are very welcome But the more boarding houses they create the less room they leave for day boys The local mothers are frantic and so is my queer cousin I never knew him so excited over sub Hellenic things There was an indignation meeting at his house He is supposed to look after the day boys interests but no one thought he would least of all the people who gave him the post The speeches were most eloquent They argued that the school was founded for day boys and that it s intolerable to handicap them One poor lady cried Here s my Harold in the school and my Toddie coming on As likely as not I shall be told there is no vacancy for him Then what am I to do If I go what s to become of Harold and if I stop what s to become of Toddie I must say I was touched Family life is more real than national life at least I ve ordered all these books to prove it is and I fancy that the bust of Euripides agreed with me and was sorry for the hot faced mothers Jackson will do what he can He didn t quite like to state the naked truth which is that boardinghouses pay He explained it to me afterwards they are the only future open to a stupid master It s easy enough to be a beak when you re young and athletic and can offer the latest University smattering The difficulty is to keep your place when you get old and stiff and younger smatterers are pushing up behind you Crawl into a boarding house and you re safe A master s life is frightfully tragic Jackson s fairly right himself because he has got a first class intellect But I met a poor brute who was hired as an athlete He has missed his shot at a boarding house and there s nothing in the world for him to do but to trundle down the hill Ansell yawned I saw Rickie too Once I dined there Another yawn My cousin thinks missus Elliot one of the most horrible women he has ever seen He calls her Medusa in Arcady She s so pleasant too But certainly it was a very stony meal What kind of stoniness No one stopped talking for a moment That s the real kind said Ansell moodily The only kind Well I he continued am inclined to compare her to an electric light Click she s on Click she s off No waste No flicker I wish she d fuse She ll never fuse unless anything was to happen at the main What do you mean by the main said Ansell who always pursued a metaphor relentlessly Widdrington did not know what he meant and suggested that Ansell should visit Sawston to see whether one could know It is no good me going I should not find missus Elliot she has no real existence Rickie has I very much doubt it I had two letters from Ilfracombe last April and I very much doubt that the man who wrote them can exist Bending downwards he began to adorn the manuscript of his dissertation with a square and inside that a circle and inside that another square It was his second dissertation the first had failed I think he exists he is so unhappy Ansell nodded How did you know he was unhappy Because he was always talking After a pause he added What clever young men we are Aren t we I expect we shall get asked in marriage soon I say Widdrington shall we Accept Of course It is not young manly to say no I meant shall we ever do a more tremendous thing fuse missus Elliot No said Widdrington promptly We shall never do that in all our lives He added I think you might go down to Sawston though I have already refused or ignored three invitations So I gathered What s the good of it said Ansell through his teeth I will not put up with little things I would rather be rude than to listen to twaddle from a man I ve known You might go down to Sawston just for a night to see him I saw him last month at least so Tilliard informs me He says that we all three lunched together that Rickie paid and that the conversation was most interesting Well I contend that he does exist and that if you go oh I can t be clever any longer You really must go man I m certain he s miserable and lonely Dunwood House reeks of commerce and snobbery and all the things he hated most He doesn t do anything He doesn t make any friends He is so odd too In this day boy row that has just started he s gone for my cousin Would you believe it Quite spitefully It made quite a difficulty when I wanted to dine It isn t like him either the sentiments or the behaviour I m sure he s not himself Pembroke used to look after the day boys and so he can t very well take the lead against them and perhaps Rickie s doing his dirty work and has overdone it as decent people generally do He s even altering to talk to Yet he s not been married a year Pembroke and that wife simply run him I don t see why they should and no more do you and that s why I want you to go to Sawston if only for one night Ansell shook his head and looked up at the dome as other men look at the sky In it the great arc lamps sputtered and flared for the month was again November Then he lowered his eyes from the cold violet radiance to the books No Widdrington no We don t go to see people because they are happy or unhappy We go when we can talk to them I cannot talk to Rickie therefore I will not waste my time at Sawston I think you re right said Widdrington softly But we are bloodless brutes I wonder whether If we were different people something might be done to save him That is the curse of being a little intellectual You and our sort have always seen too clearly We stand aside and meanwhile he turns into stone Two philosophic youths repining in the British Museum What have we done What shall we ever do Just drift and criticize while people who know what they want snatch it away from us and laugh Perhaps you are that sort I m not When the moment comes I shall hit out like any ploughboy Don t believe those lies about intellectual people They re only written to soothe the majority Do you suppose with the world as it is that it s an easy matter to keep quiet Do you suppose that I didn t want to rescue him from that ghastly woman Action Nothing s easier than action as fools testify But I want to act rightly The superintendent is looking at us I must get back to my work You think this all nonsense said Ansell detaining him Please remember that if I do act you are bound to help me Widdrington looked a little grave He was no anarchist A few plaintive cries against missus Elliot were all that he prepared to emit There s no mystery continued Ansell I haven t the shadow of a plan in my head I know not only Rickie but the whole of his history you remember the day near Madingley Nothing in either helps me I m just watching But what for For the Spirit of Life Widdrington was surprised It was a phrase unknown to their philosophy They had trespassed into poetry You can t fight Medusa with anything else If you ask me what the Spirit of Life is or to what it is attached I can t tell you I only tell you watch for it Myself I ve found it in books Some people find it out of doors or in each other Never mind It s the same spirit and I trust myself to know it anywhere and to use it rightly But at this point the superintendent sent a message Widdrington then suggested a stroll in the galleries It was foggy they needed fresh air He loved and admired his friend but today he could not grasp him The world as Ansell saw it seemed such a fantastic place governed by brand new laws What more could one do than to see Rickie as often as possible to invite his confidence to offer him spiritual support And missus Elliot what power could fuse a respectable woman Ansell consented to the stroll but as usual only breathed depression The comfort of books deserted him among those marble goddesses and gods The eye of an artist finds pleasure in texture and poise but he could only think of the vanished incense and deserted temples beside an unfurrowed sea Let us go he said I do not like carved stones You are too particular said Widdrington You are always expecting to meet living people One never does I am content with the Parthenon frieze And he moved along a few yards of it while Ansell followed conscious only of its pathos There s Tilliard he observed Shall we kill him Please said Widdrington and as he spoke Tilliard joined them He brought them news That morning he had heard from Rickie missus Elliot was expecting a child A child said Ansell suddenly bewildered Oh I forgot interposed Widdrington My cousin did tell me You forgot Well after all I forgot that it might be We are indeed young men He leant against the pedestal of Ilissus and remembered their talk about the Spirit of Life In his ignorance of what a child means he wondered whether the opportunity he sought lay here I am very glad said Tilliard not without intention A child will draw them even closer together I like to see young people wrapped up in their child I suppose I must be getting back to my dissertation said Ansell He left the Parthenon to pass by the monuments of our more reticent beliefs the temple of the Ephesian Artemis the statue of the Cnidian Demeter Honest he knew that here were powers he could not cope with nor as yet understand XXI The mists that had gathered round Rickie seemed to be breaking He had found light neither in work for which he was unfitted nor in a woman who had ceased to respect him and whom he was ceasing to love Though he called himself fickle and took all the blame of their marriage on his own shoulders there remained in Agnes certain terrible faults of heart and head and no self reproach would diminish them The glamour of wedlock had faded indeed he saw now that it had faded even before wedlock and that during the final months he had shut his eyes and pretended it was still there But now the mists were breaking That November the supreme event approached He saw it with Nature s eyes It dawned on him as on Ansell that personal love and marriage only cover one side of the shield and that on the other is graven the epic of birth In the midst of lessons he would grow dreamy as one who spies a new symbol for the universe a fresh circle within the square Within the square shall be a circle within the circle another square until the visual eye is baffled Here is meaning of a kind His mother had forgotten herself in him He would forget himself in his son He was at his duties when the news arrived taking preparation Boys are marvellous creatures Perhaps they will sink below the brutes perhaps they will attain to a woman s tenderness Though they despised Rickie and had suffered under Agnes s meanness their one thought this term was to be gentle and to give no trouble Rickie one moment His face grew ashen He followed Herbert into the passage closing the door of the preparation room behind him Oh is she safe he whispered Yes yes said Herbert but there sounded in his answer a sombre hostile note Our boy Girl a girl dear Rickie a little daughter She she is in many ways a healthy child She will live oh yes A flash of horror passed over his face He hurried into the preparation room lifted the lid of his desk glanced mechanically at the boys and came out again missus Lewin appeared through the door that led into their own part of the house Both going on well she cried but her voice also was grave exasperated What is it he gasped It s something you daren t tell me Only this stuttered Herbert You mustn t mind when you see she s lame missus Lewin disappeared Lame but not as lame as I am Oh my dear boy worse Don t oh be a man in this Come away from the preparation room Remember she ll live in many ways healthy only just this one defect The horror of that week never passed away from him To the end of his life he remembered the excuses the consolations that the child would live suffered very little if at all would walk with crutches would certainly live God was more merciful A window was opened too wide on a draughty day after a short painless illness his daughter died But the lesson he had learnt so glibly at Cambridge should be heeded now no child should ever be born to him again XXII That same term there took place at Dunwood House another event With their private tragedy it seemed to have no connection but in time Rickie perceived it as a bitter comment Its developments were unforeseen and lasting It was perhaps the most terrible thing he had to bear Varden had now been a boarder for ten months His health had broken in the previous term partly it is to be feared as the result of the indifferent food and during the summer holidays he was attacked by a series of agonizing earaches His mother a feeble person wished to keep him at home but Herbert dissuaded her Soon after the death of the child there arose at Dunwood House one of those waves of hostility of which no boy knows the origin nor any master can calculate the course Varden had never been popular there was no reason why he should be but he had never been seriously bullied hitherto One evening nearly the whole house set on him The prefects absented themselves the bigger boys stood round and the lesser boys to whom power was delegated flung him down and rubbed his face under the desks and wrenched at his ears The noise penetrated the baize doors and Herbert swept through and punished the whole house including Varden whom it would not do to leave out The poor man was horrified He approved of a little healthy roughness but this was pure brutalization What had come over his boys Were they not gentlemen s sons He would not admit that if you herd together human beings before they can understand each other the great god Pan is angry and will in the end evade your regulations and drive them mad That night the victim was screaming with pain and the doctor next day spoke of an operation The suspense lasted a whole week Comment was made in the local papers and the reputation not only of the house but of the school was imperilled If only I had known repeated Herbert if only I had known I would have arranged it all differently He should have had a cubicle The boy did not die but he left Sawston never to return The day before his departure Rickie sat with him some time and tried to talk in a way that was not pedantic In his own sorrow which he could share with no one least of all with his wife he was still alive to the sorrows of others He still fought against apathy though he was losing the battle Don t lose heart he told him The world isn t all going to be like this There are temptations and trials of course but nothing at all of the kind you have had here But school is the world in miniature is it not sir asked the boy hoping to please one master by echoing what had been told him by another He was always on the lookout for sympathy it was one of the things that had contributed to his downfall I never noticed that myself I was unhappy at school and in the world people can be very happy Varden sighed and rolled about his eyes Are the fellows sorry for what they did to me he asked in an affected voice I am sure I forgive them from the bottom of my heart We ought to forgive our enemies oughtn t we sir But they aren t your enemies If you meet in five years time you may find each other splendid fellows The boy would not admit this He had been reading some revivalistic literature We ought to forgive our enemies he repeated and however wicked they are we ought not to wish them evil When I was ill and death seemed nearest I had many kind letters on this subject Rickie knew about these many kind letters Varden had induced the silly nurse to write to people people of all sorts people that he scarcely knew or did not know at all detailing his misfortune and asking for spiritual aid and sympathy I am sorry for them he pursued I would not like to be like them Rickie sighed He saw that a year at Dunwood House had produced a sanctimonious prig Don t think about them Varden Think about anything beautiful say music You like music Be happy It s your duty You can t be good until you ve had a little happiness Then perhaps you will think less about forgiving people and more about loving them I love them already sir And Rickie in desperation asked if he might look at the many kind letters Permission was gladly given A neat bundle was produced and for about twenty minutes the master perused it while the invalid kept watch on his face Rooks cawed out in the playing fields and close under the window there was the sound of delightful good tempered laughter A boy is no devil whatever boys may be The letters were chilly productions somewhat clerical in tone by whomsoever written Varden because he was ill at the time had been taken seriously The writers declared that his illness was fulfilling some mysterious purpose suffering engendered spiritual growth he was showing signs of this already They consented to pray for him some majestically others shyly But they all consented with one exception who worded his refusal as follows Dear A C Varden I ought to say that I never remember seeing you I am sorry that you are ill and hope you are wrong about it Why did you not write before for I could have helped you then When they pulled your ear you ought to have gone like this here was a rough sketch I could not undertake praying but would think of you instead if that would do I am twenty two in April built rather heavy ordinary broad face with eyes et cetera I write all this because you have mixed me with some one else for I am not married and do not want to be I cannot think of you always but will promise a quarter of an hour daily say seven point zero seven point fifteen A M and might come to see you when you are better that is if you are a kid and you read like one I have been otter hunting Yours sincerely Stephen Wonham XXIII Riekie went straight from Varden to his wife who lay on the sofa in her bedroom There was now a wide gulf between them She like the world she had created for him was unreal Agnes darling he began stroking her hand such an awkward little thing has happened What is it dear Just wait till I ve added up this hook She had got over the tragedy she got over everything When she was at leisure he told her Hitherto they had seldom mentioned Stephen He was classed among the unprofitable dead She was more sympathetic than he expected Dear Rickie she murmured with averted eyes How tiresome for you I wish that Varden had stopped with missus Orr Well he leaves us for good tomorrow Yes yes And I made him answer the letter and apologize They had never met It was some confusion with a man in the Church Army living at a place called Codford I asked the nurse It is all explained There the matter ends I suppose so if matters ever end If by ill luck the person does call I will just see him and say that the boy has gone You or I I have got over all nonsense by this time He s absolutely nothing to me now He took up the tradesman s book and played with it idly On its crimson cover was stamped a grotesque sheep How stale and stupid their life had become Don t talk like that though she said uneasily Think how disastrous it would be if you made a slip in speaking to him Would it It would have been disastrous once But I expect as a matter of fact that Aunt Emily has made the slip already His wife was displeased You need not talk in that cynical way I credit Aunt Emily with better feeling When I was there she did mention the matter but only once She and I and all who have any sense of decency know better than to make slips or to think of making them Agnes kept up what she called the family connection She had been once alone to Cadover and also corresponded with missus Failing She had never told Rickie anything about her visit nor had he ever asked her But from this moment the whole subject was reopened Most certainly he knows nothing she continued Why he does not even realize that Varden lives in our house We are perfectly safe unless Aunt Emily were to die Perhaps then but we are perfectly safe for the present When she did mention the matter what did she say We had a long talk said Agnes quietly She told me nothing new nothing new about the past I mean But we had a long talk about the present I think and her voice grew displeased again that you have been both wrong and foolish in refusing to make up your quarrel with Aunt Emily Wrong and wise I should say It isn t to be expected that she so much older and so sensitive can make the first step But I know she d he glad to see you As far as I can remember that final scene in the garden I accused her of forgetting what other people were like She ll never pardon me for saying that Agnes was silent To her the phrase was meaningless Yet Rickie was correct missus Failing had resented it more than anything At all events she suggested you might go and see her No dear Thank you no She is after all She was going to say your father s sister but the expression was scarcely a happy one and she turned it into She is after all growing old and lonely So are we all he cried with a lapse of tone that was now characteristic in him She oughtn t to be so isolated from her proper relatives There was a moment s silence Still playing with the book he remarked You forget she s got her favourite nephew A bright red flush spread over her cheeks What is the matter with you this afternoon she asked I should think you d better go for a walk Before I go tell me what is the matter with you He also flushed Why do you want me to make it up with my aunt Because it s right and proper So Or because she is old I don t understand she retorted But her eyes dropped His sudden suspicion was true she was legacy hunting Agnes dear Agnes he began with passing tenderness how can you think of such things You behave like a poor person We don t want any money from Aunt Emily or from any one else It isn t virtue that makes me say it we are not tempted in that way we have as much as we want already For the present she answered still looking aside There isn t any future he cried in a gust of despair Rickie what do you mean What did he mean He meant that the relations between them were fixed that there would never be an influx of interest nor even of passion To the end of life they would go on beating time and this was enough for her She was content with the daily round the common task performed indifferently But he had dreamt of another helpmate and of other things We don t want money why we don t even spend any on travelling I ve invested all my salary and more As far as human foresight goes we shall never want money And his thoughts went out to the tiny grave You spoke of right and proper but the right and proper thing for my aunt to do is to leave every penny she s got to Stephen Her lip quivered and for one moment he thought that she was going to cry What am I to do with you she said You talk like a person in poetry I ll put it in prose He s lived with her for twenty years and he ought to be paid for it Poor Agnes Indeed what was she to do The first moment she set foot in Cadover she had thought Oh here is money We must try and get it Being a lady she never mentioned the thought to her husband but she concluded that it would occur to him too And now though it had occurred to him at last he would not even write his aunt a little note He was to try her yet further While they argued this point he flashed out with I ought to have told him that day when he called up to our room There s where I went wrong first Rickie In those days I was sentimental I minded For two pins I d write to him this afternoon Why shouldn t he know he s my brother What s all this ridiculous mystery She became incoherent But WHY not A reason why he shouldn t know A reason why he SHOULD know she retorted I never heard such rubbish Give me a reason why he should know Because the lie we acted has ruined our lives She looked in bewilderment at the well appointed room It s been like a poison we won t acknowledge How many times have you thought of my brother I ve thought of him every day not in love don t misunderstand only as a medicine I shirked Down in what they call the subconscious self he has been hurting me His voice broke Oh my darling we acted a lie then and this letter reminds us of it and gives us one more chance I have to say we lied I should be lying again if I took quite all the blame Let us ask God s forgiveness together Then let us write as coldly as you please to Stephen and tell him he is my father s son Her reply need not be quoted It was the last time he attempted intimacy And the remainder of their conversation though long and stormy is also best forgotten Thus the first effect of Varden s letter was to make them quarrel They had not openly disagreed before In the evening he kissed her and said How absurd I was to get angry about things that happened last year I will certainly not write to the person She returned the kiss But he knew that they had destroyed the habit of reverence and would quarrel again On his rounds he looked in at Varden and asked nonchalantly for the letter He carried it off to his room It was unwise of him for his nerves were already unstrung and the man he had tried to bury was stirring ominously In the silence he examined the handwriting till he felt that a living creature was with him whereas he because his child had died was dead He perceived more clearly the cruelty of Nature to whom our refinement and piety are but as bubbles hurrying downwards on the turbid waters They break and the stream continues His father as a final insult had brought into the world a man unlike all the rest of them a man dowered with coarse kindliness and rustic strength a kind of cynical ploughboy against whom their own misery and weakness might stand more vividly relieved Born an Elliot born a gentleman So the vile phrase ran But here was an Elliot whose badness was not even gentlemanly For that Stephen was bad inherently he never doubted for a moment and he would have children he not Rickie would contribute to the stream he through his remote posterity might mingled with the unknown sea Thus musing he lay down to sleep feeling diseased in body and soul It was no wonder that the night was the most terrible he had ever known He revisited Cambridge and his name was a grey ghost over the door Then there recurred the voice of a gentle shadowy woman missus Aberdeen It doesn t seem hardly right Those had been her words her only complaint against the mysteries of change and death She bowed her head and laboured to make her gentlemen comfortable She was labouring still As he lay in bed he asked God to grant him her wisdom that he might keep sorrow within due bounds that he might abstain from extreme hatred and envy of Stephen It was seldom that he prayed so definitely or ventured to obtrude his private wishes Religion was to him a service a mystic communion with good not a means of getting what he wanted on the earth But tonight through suffering he was humbled and became like missus Aberdeen Hour after hour he awaited sleep and tried to endure the faces that frothed in the gloom his aunt s his father s and worst of all the triumphant face of his brother Once he struck at it and awoke having hurt his hand on the wall Then he prayed hysterically for pardon and rest Yet again did he awake and from a more mysterious dream He heard his mother crying She was crying quite distinctly in the darkened room He whispered Never mind my darling never mind and a voice echoed Never mind come away let them die out let them die out He lit a candle and the room was empty Then hurrying to the window he saw above mean houses the frosty glories of Orion Henceforward he deteriorates Let those who censure him suggest what he should do He has lost the work that he loved his friends and his child He remained conscientious and decent but the spiritual part of him proceeded towards ruin XXIV The coming months though full of degradation and anxiety were to bring him nothing so terrible as that night It was the crisis of this agony He was an outcast and a failure But he was not again forced to contemplate these facts so clearly Varden left in the morning carrying the fatal letter with him The whole house was relieved The good angel was with the boys again or else as Herbert preferred to think they had learnt a lesson and were more humane in consequence At all events the disastrous term concluded quietly In the Christmas holidays the two masters made an abortive attempt to visit Italy and at Easter there was talk of a cruise in the Aegean Herbert actually went and enjoyed Athens and Delphi The Elliots paid a few visits together in England They returned to Sawston about ten days before school opened to find that Widdrington was again stopping with the Jacksons Intercourse was painful for the two families were scarcely on speaking terms nor did the triumphant scaffoldings of the new boarding house make things easier The party of progress had carried the day Widdrington was by nature touchy but on this occasion he refused to take offence and often dropped in to see them His manner was friendly but critical They agreed he was a nuisance Then Agnes left very abruptly to see missus Failing and while she was away Rickie had a little stealthy intercourse Her absence convenient as it was puzzled him missus Silt half goose half stormy petrel had recently paid a flying visit to Cadover and thence had flown without an invitation to Sawston Generally she was not a welcome guest On this occasion Agnes had welcomed her and so Rickie thought had made her promise not to tell him something that she knew The ladies had talked mysteriously mister Silt would be one with you there said missus Silt Could there be any connection between the two visits Agnes s letters told him nothing they never did She was too clumsy or too cautious to express herself on paper A drive to Stonehenge an anthem in the Cathedral Aunt Emily s love And when he met her at Waterloo he learnt nothing if there was anything to learn from her face How did you enjoy yourself Thoroughly Were you and she alone Sometimes Sometimes other people Will Uncle Tony s Essays be published Here she was more communicative The book was at last in proof Aunt Emily had written a charming introduction but she was so idle she never finished things off They got into an omnibus for the Army and Navy Stores she wanted to do some shopping before going down to Sawston Did you read any of the Essays Every one Delightful Couldn t put them down Now and then he spoilt them by statistics but you should read his descriptions of Nature He agrees with you says the hills and trees are alive Aunt Emily called you his spiritual heir which I thought nice of her We both so lamented that you have stopped writing She quoted fragments of the Essays as they went up in the Stores lift What else did you talk about I ve told you all my news Now for yours Let s have tea first They sat down in the corridor amid ladies in every stage of fatigue haggard ladies scarlet ladies ladies with parcels that twisted from every finger like joints of meat Gentlemen were scarcer but all were of the sub fashionable type to which Rickie himself now belonged I haven t done anything he said feebly Ate read been rude to tradespeople talked to Widdrington Herbert arrived this morning He has brought a most beautiful photograph of the Parthenon mister Widdrington Yes What did you talk about She might have heard every word It was only the feeling of pleasure that he wished to conceal Even when we love people we desire to keep some corner secret from them however small it is a human right it is personality She began to cross question him but they were interrupted A young lady at an adjacent table suddenly rose and cried Yes it is you I thought so from your walk It was Maud Ansell Oh do come and join us he cried Let me introduce my wife Maud bowed quite stiffly but Agnes taking it for ill breeding was not offended Then I will come she continued in shrill pleasant tones adroitly poising her tea things on either hand and transferring them to the Elliots table Why haven t you ever come to us pray I think you didn t ask me You weren t to be asked She sprawled forward with a wagging finger But her eyes had the honesty of her brother s Don t you remember the day you left us Father said Now mister Elliot Or did he call you Elliot How one does forget Anyhow father said you weren t to wait for an invitation and you said No I won t Ours is a fair sized house she turned somewhat haughtily to Agnes and the second spare room on account of a harp that hangs on the wall is always reserved for Stewart s friends How is mister Ansell your brother Maud s face fell Hadn t you heard she said in awe struck tones No He hasn t got his fellowship It s the second time he s failed That means he will never get one He will never be a don nor live in Cambridge and that as we had hoped Oh poor poor fellow said missus Elliot with a remorse that was sincere though her congratulations would not have been I am so very sorry But Maud turned to Rickie mister Elliot you might know Tell me What is wrong with Stewart s philosophy What ought he to put in or to alter so as to succeed Agnes who knew better than this smiled I don t know said Rickie sadly They were none of them so clever after all Hegel she continued vindictively They say he s read too much Hegel But they never tell him what to read instead Their own stuffy books I suppose Look here no that s the Windsor After a little groping she produced a copy of Mind and handed it round as if it was a geological specimen Inside that there s a paragraph written about something Stewart s written about before and there it says he s read too much Hegel and it seems now that that s been the trouble all along Her voice trembled I call it most unfair and the fellowship s gone to a man who has counted the petals on an anemone Rickie had no inclination to smile I wish Stewart had tried Oxford instead I don t wish it You say that she continued hotly and then you never come to see him though you knew you were not to wait for an invitation If it comes to that Miss Ansell retorted Rickie in the laughing tones that one adopts on such occasions Stewart won t come to me though he has had an invitation Yes chimed in Agnes we ask mister Ansell again and again and he will have none of us Maud looked at her with a flashing eye My brother is a very peculiar person and we ladies can t understand him But I know one thing and that s that he has a reason all round for what he does Look here I must be getting on Waiter Wai ai aiter Bill please Separately of course Call the Army and Navy cheap I know better How does the drapery department compare said Agnes sweetly The girl gave a sharp choking sound gathered up her parcels and left them Rickie was too much disgusted with his wife to speak Appalling person she gasped It was naughty of me but I couldn t help it What a dreadful fate for a clever man To fail in life completely and then to be thrown back on a family like that Maud is a snob and a Philistine But in her case something emerges She glanced at him but proceeded in her suavest tones Do let us make one great united attempt to get mister Ansell to Sawston No What a changeable friend you are When we were engaged you were always talking about him Would you finish your tea and then we will buy the linoleum for the cubicles But she returned to the subject again not only on that day but throughout the term Could nothing be done for poor mister Ansell It seemed that she could not rest until all that he had once held dear was humiliated In this she strayed outside her nature she was unpractical And those who stray outside their nature invite disaster Rickie goaded by her wrote to his friend again The letter was in all ways unlike his old self Ansell did not answer it But he did write to mister Jackson with whom he was not acquainted Dear mister Jackson I understand from Widdrington that you have a large house I would like to tell you how convenient it would be for me to come and stop in it June suits me best Yours truly Stewart Ansell To which mister Jackson replied that not only in June but during the whole year his house was at the disposal of mister Ansell and of any one who resembled him But Agnes continued her life cheerfully beating time She too knew that her marriage was a failure and in her spare moments regretted it She wished that her husband was handsomer more successful more dictatorial But she would think No no one mustn t grumble It can t be helped Ansell was wrong in sup posing she might ever leave Rickie Spiritual apathy prevented her Nor would she ever be tempted by a jollier man Here criticism would willingly alter its tone For Agnes also has her tragedy She belonged to the type not necessarily an elevated one that loves once and once only Her love for Gerald had not been a noble passion no imagination transfigured it But such as it was it sprang to embrace him and he carried it away with him when he died Les amours gui suivrent sont moins involuntaires by an effort of the will she had warmed herself for Rickie She is not conscious of her tragedy and therefore only the gods need weep at it But it is fair to remember that hitherto she moves as one from whom the inner life has been withdrawn XXV I am afraid said Agnes unfolding a letter that she had received in the morning that things go far from satisfactorily at Cadover The three were alone at supper It was the June of Rickie s second year at Sawston Indeed said Herbert who took a friendly interest In what way Do you remember us talking of Stephen Stephen Wonham who by an odd coincidence Yes Who wrote last year to that miserable failure Varden I do It is about him I did not like the tone of his letter Agnes had made her first move She waited for her husband to reply to it But he though full of a painful curiosity would not speak She moved again I don t think Herbert that Aunt Emily much as I like her is the kind of person to bring a young man up At all events the results have been disastrous this time What has happened A tangle of things She lowered her voice Drink Dear Really Was missus Failing fond of him She used to be She let him live at Cadover ever since he was a little boy Naturally that cannot continue Rickie never spoke And now he has taken to be violent and rude she went on In short a beggar on horseback Who is he Has he got relatives She has always been both father and mother to him Now it must all come to an end I blame her and she blames herself for not being severe enough He has grown up without fixed principles He has always followed his inclinations and one knows the result of that Herbert assented To me missus Failing s course is perfectly plain She has a certain responsibility She must pay the youth s passage to one of the colonies start him handsomely in some business and then break off all communications How funny It is exactly what she is going to do I shall then consider that she has behaved in a thoroughly honourable manner He held out his plate for gooseberries His letter to Varden was neither helpful nor sympathetic and if written at all it ought to have been both I am not in the least surprised to learn that he has turned out badly When you write next would you tell her how sorry I am Indeed I will Two years ago when she was already a little anxious she did so wish you could undertake him I could not alter a grown man But in his heart he thought he could and smiled at his sister amiably Terrible isn t it he remarked to Rickie Rickie who was trying not to mind anything assented And an onlooker would have supposed them a dispassionate trio who were sorry both for missus Failing and for the beggar who would bestride her horses backs no longer A new topic was introduced by the arrival of the evening post Herbert took up all the letters as he often did Jackson he exclaimed What does the fellow want He read and his tone was mollified Dear mister Pembroke Could you missus Elliot and mister Elliot come to supper with us on Saturday next I should not merely be pleased I should be grateful My wife is writing formally to missus Elliot Here Agnes take your letter but I venture to write as well and to add my more uncouth entreaties An olive branch It is time But ridiculous person does he think that we can leave the House deserted and all go out pleasuring in term time Rickie a letter for you Mine s the formal invitation said Agnes How very odd mister Ansell will be there Surely we asked him here Did you know he knew the Jacksons This makes refusal very difficult said Herbert who was anxious to accept At all events Rickie ought to go I do not want to go said Rickie slowly opening his own letter As Agnes says Ansell has refused to come to us I cannot put myself out for him Who s yours from she demanded missus Silt replied Herbert who had seen the handwriting I trust she does not want to pay us a visit this term with the examinations impending and all the machinery at full pressure Though Rickie you will have to accept the Jacksons invitation I cannot possibly go I have been too rude with Widdrington we always meet here I ll stop with the boys His voice caught suddenly He had opened missus Silt s letter The Silts are not ill I hope No But I say he looked at his wife I do think this is going too far Really Agnes What has happened It is going too far he repeated He was nerving himself for another battle I cannot stand this sort of thing There are limits He laid the letter down It was Herbert who picked it up and read Aunt Emily has just written to us We are so glad that her troubles are over in spite of the expense It never does to live apart from one s own relatives so much as she has done up to now He goes next Saturday to Canada What you told her about him just turned the scale She has asked us No it s too much he interrupted What I told her told her about him no I will have it out at last Agnes Yes said his wife raising her eyes from missus Jackson s formal invitation It s you it s you I never mentioned him to her Why I ve never seen her or written to her since I accuse you Then Herbert overbore him and he collapsed He was asked what he meant Why was he so excited Of what did he accuse his wife Each time he spoke more feebly and before long the brother and sister were laughing at him He felt bewildered like a boy who knows that he is right but cannot put his case correctly He repeated I ve never mentioned him to her It s a libel Never in my life And they cried My dear Rickie what an absurd fuss Then his brain cleared His eye fell on the letter that his wife had received from his aunt and he reopened the battle Agnes give me that letter if you please missus Jackson s My aunt s She put her hand on it and looked at him doubtfully She saw that she had failed to bully him My aunt s letter he repeated rising to his feet and bending over the table towards her Why dear Yes why indeed echoed Herbert He too had bullied Rickie but from a purer motive he had tried to stamp out a dissension between husband and wife It was not the first time he had intervened The letter For this reason it will show me what you have done I believe you have ruined Stephen You have worked at it for two years You have put words into my mouth to turn the scale against him He goes to Canada and all the world thinks it is owing to me As I said before I advise you to stop smiling you have gone a little too far They were all on their feet now standing round the little table Agnes said nothing but the fingers of her delicate hand tightened upon the letter When her husband snatched at it she resisted and with the effect of a harlequinade everything went on the floor lamb mint sauce gooseberries lemonade whisky At once they were swamped in domesticities She rang the bell for the servant cries arose dusters were brought broken crockery a wedding present picked up from the carpet while he stood wrathfully at the window regarding the obscured sun s decline I MUST see her letter he repeated when the agitation was over He was too angry to be diverted from his purpose Only slight emotions are thwarted by an interlude of farce I ve had enough of this quarrelling she retorted You know that the Silts are inaccurate I think you might have given me the benefit of the doubt If you will know have you forgotten that ride you took with him I he was again bewildered The ride where I dreamt The ride where you turned back because you could not listen to a disgraceful poem I don t understand The poem was Aunt Emily He read it to you and a stray soldier Afterwards you told me You said Really it is shocking his ingratitude She ought to know about it She does know and I should be glad of an apology He had said something of the sort in a fit of irritation missus Silt was right he had helped to turn the scale Whatever I said you knew what I meant You knew I d sooner cut my tongue out than have it used against him Even then He sighed Had he ruined his brother A curious tenderness came over him and passed when he remembered his own dead child We have ruined him then Have you any objection to we We have disinherited him I decide against you interposed Herbert I have now heard both sides of this deplorable affair You are talking most criminal nonsense Disinherit Sentimental twaddle It s been clear to me from the first that missus Failing has been imposed upon by the Wonham man a person with no legal claim on her and any one who exposes him performs a public duty And gets money Money He was always uneasy at the word Who mentioned money Just understand me Herbert and of what it is that I accuse my wife Tears came into his eyes It is not that I like the Wonham man or think that he isn t a drunkard and worse He s too awful in every way But he ought to have my aunt s money because he s lived all his life with her and is her nephew as much as I am You see my father went wrong He stopped amazed at himself How easy it had been to say He was withering up the power to care about this stupid secret had died When Herbert understood his first thought was for Dunwood House Why have I never been told was his first remark We settled to tell no one said Agnes Rickie in his anxiety to prove me a liar has broken his promise I ought to have been told said Herbert his anger increasing Had I known I could have averted this deplorable scene Let me conclude it said Rickie again collapsing and leaving the dining room His impulse was to go straight to Cadover and make a business like statement of the position to Stephen Then the man would be armed and perhaps fight the two women successfully But he resisted the impulse Why should he help one power of evil against another Let them go intertwined to destruction To enrich his brother would be as bad as enriching himself If their aunt s money ever did come to him he would refuse to accept it That was the easiest and most dignified course He troubled himself no longer with justice or pity and the next day he asked his wife s pardon for his behaviour In the dining room the conversation continued Agnes without much difficulty gained her brother as an ally She acknowledged that she had been wrong in not telling him and he then declared that she had been right on every other point She slurred a little over the incident of her treachery for Herbert was sometimes clearsighted over details though easily muddled in a general survey missus Failing had had plenty of direct causes of complaint and she dwelt on these She dealt too on the very handsome way in which the young man though he knew nothing had never asked to know was being treated by his aunt Handsome is the word said Herbert I hope not indulgently He does not deserve indulgence And she knew that he like herself could remember money and that it lent an acknowledged halo to her cause It is not a savoury subject he continued with sudden stiffness I understand why Rickie is so hysterical My impulse he laid his hand on her shoulder is to abandon it at once But if I am to be of any use to you I must hear it all There are moments when we must look facts in the face She did not shrink from the subject as much as he thought as much as she herself could have wished Two years before it had filled her with a physical loathing But by now she had accustomed herself to it I am afraid Bertie boy there is nothing else to bear I have tried to find out again and again but Aunt Emily will not tell me I suppose it is natural She wants to shield the Elliot name She only told us in a fit of temper then we all agreed to keep it to ourselves then Rickie again mismanaged her and ever since she has refused to let us know any details A most unsatisfactory position So I feel She sat down again with a sigh missus Failing had been a great trial to her orderly mind She is an odd woman She is always laughing She actually finds it amusing that we know no more They are an odd family They are indeed Herbert with unusual sweetness bent down and kissed her She thanked him Their tenderness soon passed They exchanged it with averted eyes It embarrassed them There are moments for all of us when we seem obliged to speak in a new unprofitable tongue One might fancy a seraph vexed with our normal language who touches the pious to blasphemy the blasphemous to piety The seraph passes and we proceed unaltered conscious however that we have not been ourselves and that we may fail in this function yet again So Agnes and Herbert as they proceeded to discuss the Jackson s supper party had an uneasy memory of spiritual deserts spiritual streams XXVI Poor mister Ansell was actually sitting in the garden of Dunwood House It was Sunday morning The air was full of roasting beef The sound of a manly hymn taken very fast floated over the road from the school chapel He frowned for he was reading a book the Essays of Anthony Eustace Failing He was here on account of this book at least so he told himself It had just been published and the Jacksons were sure that mister Elliot would have a copy For a book one may go anywhere It would not have been logical to enter Dunwood House for the purpose of seeing Rickie when Rickie had not come to supper yesterday to see him He was at Sawston to assure himself of his friend s grave With quiet eyes he had intended to view the sods with unfaltering fingers to inscribe the epitaph Love remained But in high matters he was practical He knew that it would be useless to reveal it Morning said a voice behind him He saw no reason to reply to this superfluous statement and went on with his reading Morning said the voice again As for the Essays the thought was somewhat old fashioned and he picked many holes in it nor was he anything but bored by the prospect of the brotherhood of man However mister Failing stuck to his guns such as they were and fired from them several good remarks Very notable was his distinction between coarseness and vulgarity coarseness revealing something vulgarity concealing something and his avowed preference for coarseness Vulgarity to him had been the primal curse the shoddy reticence that prevents man opening his heart to man the power that makes against equality From it sprang all the things that he hated class shibboleths ladies lidies the game laws the Conservative party all the things that accent the divergencies rather than the similarities in human nature Whereas coarseness But at this point Herbert Pembroke had scrawled with a blue pencil Childish One reads no further Morning repeated the voice Ansell read further for here was the book of a man who had tried however unsuccessfully to practice what he preached missus Failing in her Introduction described with delicate irony his difficulties as a landlord but she did not record the love in which his name was held Nor could her irony touch him when he cried Attain the practical through the unpractical There is no other road Ansell was inclined to think that the unpractical is its own reward but he respected those who attempted to journey beyond it We must all of us go over the mountains There is certainly no other road Nice morning said the voice It was not a nice morning so Ansell felt bound to speak He answered No Why A clod of earth immediately struck him on the back He turned round indignantly for he hated physical rudeness A square man of ruddy aspect was pacing the gravel path his hands deep in his pockets He was very angry Then he saw that the clod of earth nourished a blue lobelia and that a wound of corresponding size appeared on the pie shaped bed He was not so angry I expect they will mind it he reflected Last night at the Jacksons Agnes had displayed a brisk pity that made him wish to wring her neck Maude had not exaggerated mister Pembroke had patronized through a sorrowful voice and large round eyes Till he met these people he had never been told that his career was a failure Apparently it was They would never have been civil to him if it had been a success if they or theirs had anything to fear from him In many ways Ansell was a conceited man but he was never proud of being right He had foreseen Rickie s catastrophe from the first but derived from this no consolation In many ways he was pedantic but his pedantry lay close to the vineyards of life far closer than that fetich Experience of the innumerable tea cups He had a great many facts to learn and before he died he learnt a suitable quantity But he never forgot that the holiness of the heart s imagination can alone classify these facts can alone decide which is an exception which an example How unpractical it all is That was his comment on Dunwood House How unbusiness like They live together without love They work without conviction They seek money without requiring it They die and nothing will have happened either for themselves or for others It is a comment that the academic mind will often make when first confronted with the world But he was becoming illogical The clod of earth had disturbed him Brushing the dirt off his back he returned to the book What a curious affair was the essay on Gaps Solitude star crowned pacing the fields of England has a dialogue with Seclusion He poor little man lives in the choicest scenery among rocks forests emerald lawns azure lakes To keep people out he has built round his domain a high wall on which is graven his motto Procul este profani But he cannot enjoy himself His only pleasure is in mocking the absent Profane They are in his mind night and day Their blemishes and stupidities form the subject of his great poem In the Heart of Nature Then Solitude tells him that so it always will be until he makes a gap in the wall and permits his seclusion to be the sport of circumstance He obeys The Profane invade him but for short intervals they wander elsewhere and during those intervals the heart of Nature is revealed to him This dialogue had really been suggested to mister Failing by a talk with his brother in law It also touched Ansell He looked at the man who had thrown the clod and was now pacing with obvious youth and impudence upon the lawn Shall I improve my soul at his expense he thought I suppose I had better In friendly tones he remarked Were you waiting for mister Pembroke No said the young man Why Ansell after a moment s admiration flung the Essays at him They hit him in the back The next moment he lay on his own back in the lobelia pie But it hurts he gasped in the tones of a puzzled civilization What you do hurts For the young man was nicking him over the shins with the rim of the book cover Little brute ee ow Then say Pax Something revolted in Ansell Why should he say Pax Freeing his hand he caught the little brute under the chin and was again knocked into the lobelias by a blow on the mouth Say Pax he repeated pressing the philosopher s skull into the mould and he added with an anxiety that was somehow not offensive I do advise you You d really better Ansell swallowed a little blood He tried to move and he could not He looked carefully into the young man s eyes and into the palm of his right hand which at present swung unclenched and he said Pax Shake hands said the other helping him up There was nothing Ansell loathed so much as the hearty Britisher but he shook hands and they stared at each other awkwardly With civil murmurs they picked the little blue flowers off each other s clothes Ansell was trying to remember why they had quarrelled and the young man was wondering why he had not guarded his chin properly In the distance a hymn swung off Fight the good Fight with All thy Might They would be across from the chapel soon Your book sir Thank you sir yes Why cried the young man why it s What We Want At least the binding s exactly the same It s called Essays said Ansell Then that s it missus Failing you see she wouldn t call it that because three W s you see in a row she said are vulgar and sound like Tolstoy if you ve heard of him Ansell confessed to an acquaintance and then said Do you think What We Want vulgar He was not at all interested but he desired to escape from the atmosphere of pugilistic courtesy more painful to him than blows themselves It IS the same book said the other same title same binding He weighed it like a brick in his muddy hands Open it to see if the inside corresponds said Ansell swallowing a laugh and a little more blood with it With a liberal allowance of thumb marks he turned the pages over and read the rural silence that is not a poet s luxury but a practical need for all men Yes it is the same book Smiling pleasantly over the discovery he handed it back to the owner And is it true I beg your pardon Is it true that rural silence is a practical need Don t ask me Have you ever tried it What Rural silence A field with no noise in it I suppose you mean I don t understand Ansell smiled but a slight fire in the man s eye checked him After all this was a person who could knock one down Moreover there was no reason why he should be teased He had it in him to retort No Why He was not stupid in essentials He was irritable in Ansell s eyes a frequent sign of grace Sitting down on the upturned seat he remarked I like the book in many ways I don t think What We Want would have been a vulgar title But I don t intend to spoil myself on the chance of mending the world which is what the creed amounts to Nor am I keen on rural silences Curse he said thoughtfully sucking at an empty pipe Tobacco Please Rickie s is invariably filthy Who says I know Rickie Well you know his aunt It s a possible link Be gentle with Rickie Don t knock him down if he doesn t think it s a nice morning The other was silent Do you know him well Kind of He was not inclined to talk The wish to smoke was very violent in him and Ansell noticed how he gazed at the wreaths that ascended from bowl and stem and how when the stem was in his mouth he bit it He gave the idea of an animal with just enough soul to contemplate its own bliss United with refinement such a type was common in Greece It is not common today and Ansell was surprised to find it in a friend of Rickie s Rickie if he could even kind of know such a creature must be stirring in his grave Do you know his wife too Oh yes In a way I know Agnes But thank you for this tobacco Last night I nearly died I have no money Take the whole pouch do After a moment s hesitation he did Fight the good had scarcely ended so quickly had their intimacy grown I suppose you re a friend of Rickie s Ansell was tempted to reply I don t know him at all But it seemed no moment for the severer truths so he said I knew him well at Cambridge but I have seen very little of him since Is it true that his baby was lame I believe so His teeth closed on his pipe Chapel was over The organist was prancing through the voluntary and the first ripple of boys had already reached Dunwood House In a few minutes the masters would be here too and Ansell who was becoming interested hurried the conversation forward Have you come far From Wiltshire Do you know Wiltshire And for the first time there came into his face the shadow of a sentiment the passing tribute to some mystery It s a good country I live in one of the finest valleys out of Salisbury Plain I mean I lived Have you been dismissed from Cadover without a penny in your pocket He was alarmed at this Such knowledge seemed simply diabolical Ansell explained that if his boots were chalky if his clothes had obviously been slept in if he knew missus Failing if he knew Wiltshire and if he could buy no tobacco then the deduction was possible You do just attend he murmured The house was filling with boys and Ansell saw to his regret the head of Agnes over the thuyia hedge that separated the small front garden from the side lawn where he was sitting After a few minutes it was followed by the heads of Rickie and mister Pembroke All the heads were turned the other way But they would find his card in the hall and if the man had left any message they would find that too What are you he demanded Who are you your name I don t care about that But it interests me to class people and up to now I have failed with you I He stopped Ansell reflected that there are worse answers I really don t know what I am Used to think I was something special but strikes me now I feel much like other chaps Used to look down on the labourers Used to take for granted I was a gentleman but really I don t know where I do belong One belongs to the place one sleeps in and to the people one eats with As often as not I sleep out of doors and eat by myself so that doesn t get you any further A silence akin to poetry invaded Ansell Was it only a pose to like this man or was he really wonderful He was not romantic for Romance is a figure with outstretched hands yearning for the unattainable Certain figures of the Greeks to whom we continually return suggested him a little One expected nothing of him no purity of phrase nor swift edged thought Yet the conviction grew that he had been back somewhere back to some table of the gods spread in a field where there is no noise and that he belonged for ever to the guests with whom he had eaten Meanwhile he was simple and frank and what he could tell he would tell to any one He had not the suburban reticence Ansell asked him Why did missus Failing turn you out of Cadover I should like to hear that too Because she was tired of me Because again I couldn t keep quiet over the farm hands I ask you is it right He became incoherent Ansell caught And they grow old they don t play games it ends they can t play An illustration emerged Take a kitten if you fool about with her she goes on playing well into a cat But missus Failing minded no mice being caught Mice said the young man blankly What I was going to say is that some one was jealous of my being at Cadover I ll mention no names but I fancy it was missus Silt I m sorry for her if it was Anyhow she set missus Failing against me It came on the top of other things and out I went What did missus Silt whose name I don t mention say He looked guilty I don t know Easy enough to find something to say The point is that she said something You know mister I don t know your name mine s Wonham but I m more grateful than I can put it over this tobacco I mean you ought to know there is another side to this quarrel It s wrong but it s there Ansell told him not to be uneasy he lad already guessed that there might be another side But he could not make out why mister Wonham should have come straight from the aunt to the nephew They were now sitting on the upturned seat What We Want a good deal shattered lay between them On account of above mentioned reasons there was a row I don t know you can guess the style of thing She wanted to treat me to the colonies and had up the parson to talk soft sawder and make out that a boundless continent was the place for a lad like me I said I can t run up to the Rings without getting tired nor gallop a horse out of this view without tiring it so what is the point of a boundless continent Then I saw that she was frightened of me and bluffed a bit more and in the end I was nipped She caught me just like her when I had nothing on but flannels and was coming into the house having licked the Cadchurch team She stood up in the doorway between those stone pilasters and said No Never again and behind her was Wilbraham whom I tried to turn out and the gardener and poor old Leighton who hates being hurt She said There s a hundred pounds for you at the London bank and as much more in December Go I said Keep your money and tell me whose son I am I didn t care really I only said it on the off chance of hurting her Sure enough she caught on to the doorhandle being lame and said I can t I promised I don t really want to and Wilbraham did stare Then she s very queer she burst out laughing and went for the packet after all and we heard her laugh through the window as she got it She rolled it at me down the steps and she says A leaf out of the eternal comedy for you Stephen or something of that sort I opened it as I walked down the drive she laughing always and catching on to the handle of the front door Of course it wasn t comic at all But down in the village there were both cricket teams already a little tight and the mad plumber shouting Rights of Man They knew I was turned out We did have a row and kept it up too They daren t touch Wilbraham s windows but there isn t much glass left up at Cadover When you start it s worth going on but in the end I had to cut They subscribed a bob here and a bob there and these are Flea Thompson s Sundays I sent a line to Leighton not to forward my own things I don t fancy them They aren t really mine He did not mention his great symbolic act performed it is to be feared when he was rather drunk and the friendly policeman was looking the other way He had cast all his flannels into the little millpond and then waded himself through the dark cold water to the new clothes on the other side Some one had flung his pipe and his packet after him The packet had fallen short For this reason it was wet when he handed it to Ansell and ink that had been dry for twenty three years had begun to run again I wondered if you re right about the hundred pounds said Ansell gravely It is pleasant to be proud but it is unpleasant to die in the night through not having any tobacco But I m not proud Look how I ve taken your pouch The hundred pounds was well can t you see yourself it was quite different It was so to speak inconvenient for me to take the hundred pounds Or look again how I took a shilling from a boy who earns nine bob a week Proves pretty conclusively I m not proud Ansell saw it was useless to argue He perceived beneath the slatternly use of words the man buttoned up in them just as his body was buttoned up in a shoddy suit and he wondered more than ever that such a man should know the Elliots He looked at the face which was frank proud and beautiful if truth is beauty Of mercy or tact such a face knew little It might be coarse but it had in it nothing vulgar or wantonly cruel May I read these papers he said Of course Oh yes didn t I say I m Rickie s half brother come here to tell him the news He doesn t know There it is put shortly for you I was saying though that I bolted in the dark slept in the rifle butts above Salisbury the sheds where they keep the cardboard men you know never locked up as they ought to be I turned the whole place upside down to teach them Here is your packet again said Ansell Thank you How interesting He rose from the seat and turned towards Dunwood House He looked at the bow windows the cheap picturesque gables the terracotta dragons clawing a dirty sky He listened to the clink of plates and to the voice of mister Pembroke taking one of his innumerable roll calls He looked at the bed of lobelias How interesting What else was there to say One must be the son of some one remarked Stephen And that was all he had to say To him those names on the moistened paper were mere antiquities He was neither proud of them nor ashamed A man must have parents or he cannot enter the delightful world A man if he has a brother may reasonably visit him for they may have interests in common He continued his narrative how in the night he had heard the clocks how at daybreak instead of entering the city he had struck eastward to save money while Ansell still looked at the house and found that all his imagination and knowledge could lead him no farther than this how interesting And what do you think of that for a holy horror For a what said Ansell his thoughts far away This man I am telling you about who gave me a lift towards Andover who said I was a blot on God s earth One o clock struck It was strange that neither of them had had any summons from the house He said I ought to be ashamed of myself He said I ll not be the means of bringing shame to an honest gentleman and lady I told him not to be a fool I said I knew what I was about Rickie and Agnes are properly educated which leads people to look at things straight and not go screaming about blots A man like me with just a little reading at odd hours I ve got so far and Rickie has been through Cambridge And missus Elliot Oh she won t mind and I told the man so but he kept on saying I ll not be the means of bringing shame to an honest gentleman and lady until I got out of his rotten cart His eye watched the man a Nonconformist driving away over God s earth I caught the train by running I got to Waterloo at Here the parlour maid fluttered towards them Would mister Wonham come in missus Elliot would be glad to see him now missus Elliot cried Ansell Not mister Elliot It s all the same said Stephen and moved towards the house You see I only left my name They don t know why I ve come Perhaps mister Elliot sees me meanwhile The parlour maid looked blank mister Elliot had not said so He had been with missus Elliot and mister Pembroke in the study Now the gentlemen had gone upstairs All right I can wait After all Rickie was treating him as he had treated Rickie as one in the grave to whom it is futile to make any loving motion Gone upstairs to brush his hair for dinner The irony of the situation appealed to him strongly It reminded him of the Greek Drama where the actors know so little and the spectators so much But by the bye he called after Stephen I think I ought to tell you don t What is it Don t Then he was silent He had been tempted to explain everything to tell the fellow how things stood that he must avoid this if he wanted to attain that that he must break the news to Rickie gently that he must have at least one battle royal with Agnes But it was contrary to his own spirit to coach people he held the human soul to be a very delicate thing which can receive eternal damage from a little patronage Stephen must go into the house simply as himself for thus alone would he remain there I ought to knock my pipe out Was that it By no means Go in your pipe and you He hesitated torn between propriety and desire Then he followed the parlour maid into the house smoking As he entered the dinner bell rang and there was the sound of rushing feet which died away into shuffling and silence Through the window of the boys dining hall came the colourless voice of Rickie Benedictus benedicat Ansell prepared himself to witness the second act of the drama forgetting that all this world and not part of it is a stage XXVII The parlour maid took mister Wonham to the study He had been in the drawing room before but had got bored and so had strolled out into the garden Now he was in better spirits as a man ought to be who has knocked down a man As he passed through the hall he sparred at the teak monkey and hung his cap on the bust of Hermes And he greeted missus Elliot with a pleasant clap of laughter Oh I ve come with the most tremendous news he cried She bowed but did not shake hands which rather surprised him But he never troubled over details He seldom watched people and never thought that they were watching him Nor could he guess how much it meant to her that he should enter her presence smoking Had she not said once at Cadover Oh please smoke I love the smell of a pipe Would you sit down Exactly there please She placed him at a large table opposite an inkpot and a pad of blotting paper Will you tell your tremendous news to me My brother and my husband are giving the boys their dinner Ah said Stephen who had had neither time nor money for breakfast in London I told them not to wait for me So he came to the point at once He trusted this handsome woman His strength and his youth called to hers expecting no prudish response It s very odd It is that I m Rickie s brother I ve just found out I ve come to tell you all Yes He felt in his pocket for the papers Half brother I ought to have said Yes I m illegitimate Legally speaking that is I ve been turned out of Cadover I haven t a penny I There is no occasion to inflict the details Her face which had been an even brown began to flush slowly in the centre of the cheeks The colour spread till all that he saw of her was suffused and she turned away He thought he had shocked her and so did she Neither knew that the body can be insincere and express not the emotions we feel but those that we should like to feel In reality she was quite calm and her dislike of him had nothing emotional in it as yet You see he began He was determined to tell the fidgety story for the sooner it was over the sooner they would have something to eat Delicacy he lacked and his sympathies were limited But such as they were they rang true he put no decorous phantom between him and his desires I do see I have seen for two years She sat down at the head of the table where there was another ink pot Into this she dipped a pen I have seen everything mister Wonham who you are how you have behaved at Cadover how you must have treated missus Failing yesterday and now her voice became very grave I see why you have come here penniless Before you speak we know what you will say His mouth fell open and he laughed so merrily that it might have given her a warning But she was thinking how to follow up her first success And I thought I was bringing tremendous news he cried I only twisted it out of missus Failing last night And Rickie knows too We have known for two years But come by the bye if you ve known for two years how is it you didn t The laugh died out of his eyes You aren t ashamed he asked half rising from his chair You aren t like the man towards Andover Please please sit down said Agnes in the even tones she used when speaking to the servants let us not discuss side issues I am a horribly direct person mister Wonham I go always straight to the point She opened a chequebook I am afraid I shall shock you For how much He was not attending There is the paper we suggest you shall sign She pushed towards him a pseudo legal document just composed by Herbert In consideration of the sum of I agree to perpetual silence to restrain from libellous never to molest the said Frederick Elliot by intruding His brain was not quick He read the document over twice and he could still say But what s that cheque for It is my husband s He signed for you as soon as we heard you were here We guessed you had come to be silenced Here is his signature But he has left the filling in for me For how much I will cross it shall I You will just have started a banking account if I understand missus Failing rightly It is not quite accurate to say you are penniless I heard from her just before you returned from your cricket She allows you two hundred a year I think But this additional sum shall I date the cheque Saturday or for tomorrow At last he found words Knocking his pipe out on the table he said slowly Here s a very bad mistake It is quite possible retorted Agnes She was glad she had taken the offensive instead of waiting till he began his blackmailing as had been the advice of Rickie Aunt Emily had said that very spring One s only hope with Stephen is to start bullying first Here he was quite bewildered smearing the pipe ashes with his thumb He asked to read the document again A stamp and all he remarked They had anticipated that his claim would exceed two pounds I see All right It takes a fool a minute Never mind I ve made a bad mistake You refuse she exclaimed for he was standing at the door Then do your worst We defy you That s all right missus Elliot he said roughly I don t want a scene with you nor yet with your husband We ll say no more about it It s all right I mean no harm But your signature then You must sign you He pushed past her and said as he reached for his cap There that s all right It s my mistake I m sorry He spoke like a farmer who has failed to sell a sheep His manner was utterly prosaic and up to the last she thought he had not understood her But it s money we offer you she informed him and then darted back to the study believing for one terrible moment that he had picked up the blank cheque When she returned to the hall he had gone He was walking down the road rather quickly At the corner he cleared his throat spat into the gutter and disappeared There s an odd finish she thought She was puzzled and determined to recast the interview a little when she related it to Rickie She had not succeeded for the paper was still unsigned But she had so cowed Stephen that he would probably rest content with his two hundred a year and never come troubling them again Clever management for one knew him to be rapacious she had heard tales of him lending to the poor and exacting repayment to the uttermost farthing He had also stolen at school Moderately triumphant she hurried into the side garden she had just remembered Ansell she not Rickie had received his card Oh mister Ansell she exclaimed awaking him from some day dream Haven t either Rickie or Herbert been out to you Now do come into dinner to show you aren t offended You will find all of us assembled in the boys dining hall To her annoyance he accepted That is if the Jacksons are not expecting you The Jacksons did not matter If he might brush his clothes and bathe his lip he would like to come Oh what has happened to you And oh my pretty lobelias He replied A momentary contact with reality and she who did not look for sense in his remarks hurried away to the dining hall to announce him The dining hall was not unlike the preparation room There was the same parquet floor and dado of shiny pitchpine On its walls also were imperial portraits and over the harmonium to which they sang the evening hymns was spread the Union Jack Sunday dinner the most pompous meal of the week was in progress Her brother sat at the head of the high table her husband at the head of the second To each he gave a reassuring nod and went to her own seat which was among the junior boys The beef was being carried out she stopped it mister Ansell is coming she called Herbert there is more room by you sit up straight boys The boys sat up straight and a respectful hush spread over the room Here he is called Rickie cheerfully taking his cue from his wife Oh this is splendid Ansell came in I m so glad you managed this I couldn t leave these wretches last night The boys tittered suitably The atmosphere seemed normal Even Herbert though longing to hear what had happened to the blackmailer gave adequate greeting to their guest Come in mister Ansell come here Take us as you find us I understood said Stewart that I should find you all missus Elliot told me I should On that understanding I came It was at once evident that something had gone wrong Ansell looked round the room carefully Then clearing his throat and ruffling his hair he began I cannot see the man with whom I have talked intimately for an hour in your garden The worst of it was they were all so far from him and from each other each at the end of a tableful of inquisitive boys The two masters looked at Agnes for information for her reassuring nod had not told them much She looked hopelessly back I cannot see this man repeated Ansell who remained by the harmonium in the midst of astonished waitresses Is he to be given no lunch Herbert broke the silence by fresh greetings Rickie knew that the contest was lost and that his friend had sided with the enemy It was the kind of thing he would do One must face the catastrophe quietly and with dignity Perhaps Ansell would have turned on his heel and left behind him only vague suspicions if missus Elliot had not tried to talk him down Man she cried what man Oh I know terrible bore Did he get hold of you thus committing their first blunder and causing Ansell to say to Rickie Have you seen your brother I have not Have you been told he was here Rickie s answer was inaudible Have you been told you have a brother Let us continue this conversation later Continue it My dear man how can we until you know what I m talking about You must think me mad but I tell you solemnly that you have a brother of whom you ve never heard and that he was in this house ten minutes ago He paused impressively Your wife has happened to see him first Being neither serious nor truthful she is keeping you apart telling him some lie and not telling you a word There was a murmur of alarm One of the prefects rose and Ansell set his back to the wall quite ready for a battle For two years he had waited for his opportunity He would hit out at missus Elliot like any ploughboy now that it had come Rickie said There is a slight misunderstanding I like my wife have known what there is to know for two years a dignified rebuff but their second blunder Exactly said Agnes Now I think mister Ansell had better go Go exploded Ansell I ve everything to say yet I beg your pardon missus Elliot I am concerned with you no longer This man he turned to the avenue of faces this man who teaches you has a brother He has known of him two years and been ashamed He has oh oh how it fits together Rickie it s you not missus Silt who must have sent tales of him to your aunt It s you who ve turned him out of Cadover It s you who ve ordered him to be ruined today Now Herbert arose Out of my sight sir But have it from me first that Rickie and his aunt have both behaved most generously No no Agnes I ll not be interrupted Garbled versions must not get about If the Wonham man is not satisfied now he must be insatiable He cannot levy blackmail on us for ever Sir I give you two minutes then you will be expelled by force Two minutes sang Ansell I can say a great deal in that He put one foot on a chair and held his arms over the quivering room He seemed transfigured into a Hebrew prophet passionate for satire and the truth Oh keep quiet for two minutes he cried and I ll tell you something you ll be glad to hear You re a little afraid Stephen may come back Don t be afraid I bring good news You ll never see him nor any one like him again I must speak very plainly for you are all three fools I don t want you to say afterwards Poor mister Ansell tried to be clever Generally I don t mind but I should mind today Please listen Stephen is a bully he drinks he knocks one down but he would sooner die than take money from people he did not love Perhaps he will die for he has nothing but a few pence that the poor gave him and some tobacco which to my eternal glory he accepted from me Please listen again Why did he come here Because he thought you would love him and was ready to love you But I tell you don t be afraid He would sooner die now than say you were his brother Please listen again Now Stewart don t go on like that said Rickie bitterly It s easy enough to preach when you are an outsider You would be more charitable if such a thing had happened to yourself Easy enough to be unconventional when you haven t suffered and know nothing of the facts You love anything out of the way anything queer that doesn t often happen and so you get excited over this It s useless my dear man you have hurt me but you will never upset me As soon as you stop this ridiculous scene we will finish our dinner Spread this scandal add to it I m too old to mind such nonsense I cannot help my father s disgrace on the one hand nor on the other will I have anything to do with his blackguard of a son So the secret was given to the world Agnes might colour at his speech Herbert might calculate the effect of it on the entries for Dunwood House but he cared for none of these things Thank God he was withered up at last Please listen again resumed Ansell Please correct two slight mistakes firstly Stephen is one of the greatest people I have ever met secondly he s not your father s son He s the son of your mother It was Rickie not Ansell who was carried from the hall and it was Herbert who pronounced the blessing Benedicto benedicatur A profound stillness succeeded the storm and the boys slipping away from their meal told the news to the rest of the school or put it in the letters they were writing home XXVIII The soul has her own currency She mints her spiritual coinage and stamps it with the image of some beloved face With it she pays her debts with it she reckons saying This man has worth this man is worthless And in time she forgets its origin it seems to her to be a thing unalterable divine But the soul can also have her bankruptcies Perhaps she will be the richer in the end In her agony she learns to reckon clearly Fair as the coin may have been it was not accurate and though she knew it not there were treasures that it could not buy The face however beloved was mortal and as liable as the soul herself to err We do but shift responsibility by making a standard of the dead There is indeed another coinage that bears on it not man s image but God s It is incorruptible and the soul may trust it safely it will serve her beyond the stars But it cannot give us friends or the embrace of a lover or the touch of children for with our fellow mortals it has no concern It cannot even give the joys we call trivial fine weather the pleasures of meat and drink bathing and the hot sand afterwards running dreamless sleep Have we learnt the true discipline of a bankruptcy if we turn to such coinage as this Will it really profit us so much if we save our souls and lose the whole world PART three WILTSHIRE XXIX Robert there is no occasion to mention his surname he was a young farmer of some education who tried to coax the aged soil of Wiltshire scientifically came to Cadover on business and fell in love with missus Elliot She was there on her bridal visit and he an obscure nobody was received by missus Failing into the house and treated as her social equal He was good looking in a bucolic way and people sometimes mistook him for a gentleman until they saw his hands He discovered this and one of the slow gentle jokes he played on society was to talk upon some cultured subject with his hands behind his back and then suddenly reveal them Do you go in for boating the lady would ask and then he explained that those particular weals are made by the handles of the plough Upon which she became extremely interested but found an early opportunity of talking to some one else He played this joke on missus Elliot the first evening not knowing that she observed him as he entered the room He walked heavily lifting his feet as if the carpet was furrowed and he had no evening clothes Every one tried to put him at his ease but she rather suspected that he was there already and envied him They were introduced and spoke of Byron who was still fashionable Out came his hands the only rough hands in the drawing room the only hands that had ever worked She was filled with some strange approval and liked him After dinner they met again to speak not of Byron but of manure The other people were so clever and so amusing that it relieved her to listen to a man who told her three times not to buy artificial manure ready made but if she would use it to make it herself at the last moment Because the ammonia evaporated Here were two packets of powder Did they smell No Mix them together and pour some coffee An appalling smell at once burst forth and every one began to cough and cry This was good for the earth when she felt sour for he knew when the earth was ill He knew too when she was hungry he spoke of her tantrums the strange unscientific element in her that will baffle the scientist to the end of time Study away missus Elliot he told her read all the books you can get hold of but when it comes to the point stroll out with a pipe in your mouth and do a bit of guessing As he talked the earth became a living being or rather a being with a living skin and manure no longer dirty stuff but a symbol of regeneration and of the birth of life from life So it goes on for ever she cried excitedly He replied Not for ever In time the fire at the centre will cool and nothing can go on then He advanced into love with open eyes slowly heavily just as he had advanced across the drawing room carpet But this time the bride did not observe his tread She was listening to her husband and trying not to be so stupid When he was close to her so close that it was difficult not to take her in his arms he spoke to mister Failing and was at once turned out of Cadover I m sorry said mister Failing as he walked down the drive with his hand on his guest s shoulder I had no notion you were that sort Any one who behaves like that has to stop at the farm Any one Any one He sighed heavily not for any personal grievance but because he saw how unruly how barbaric is the soul of man After all this man was more civilized than most Are you angry with me sir He called him sir not because he was richer or cleverer or smarter not because he had helped to educate him and had lent him money but for a reason more profound for the reason that there are gradations in heaven I did think you that a man like you wouldn t risk making people unhappy My sister in law I don t say this to stop you loving her something else must do that my sister in law as far as I know doesn t care for you one little bit If you had said anything if she had guessed that a chance person was in this fearful state you would simply have opened hell A woman of her sort would have lost all I knew that mister Failing removed his hand He was displeased But something here said Robert incoherently This here He struck himself heavily on the heart This here doing something so unusual makes it not matter what she loses I After a silence he asked Have I quite followed you sir in that business of the brotherhood of man How do you mean I thought love was to bring it about Love of another man s wife Sensual love You have understood nothing nothing Then he was ashamed and cried I understand nothing myself For he remembered that sensual and spiritual are not easy words to use that there are perhaps not two Aphrodites but one Aphrodite with a Janus face I only understand that you must try to forget her I will not try Promise me just this then not to do anything crooked I m straight No boasting but I couldn t do a crooked thing No not if I tried And so appallingly straight was he in after years that mister Failing wished that he had phrased the promise differently Robert simply waited He told himself that it was hopeless but something deeper than himself declared that there was hope He gave up drink and kept himself in all ways clean for he wanted to be worthy of her when the time came Women seemed fond of him and caused him to reflect with pleasure They do run after me There must be something in me Good I d be done for if there wasn t For six years he turned up the earth of Wiltshire and read books for the sake of his mind and talked to gentlemen for the sake of their patois and each year he rode to Cadover to take off his hat to missus Elliot and perhaps to speak to her about the crops mister Failing was generally present and it struck neither man that those dull little visits were so many words out of which a lonely woman might build sentences Then Robert went to London on business He chanced to see mister Elliot with a strange lady The time had come He became diplomatic and called at mister Elliot s rooms to find things out For if missus Elliot was happier than he could ever make her he would withdraw and love her in renunciation But if he could make her happier he would love her in fulfilment mister Elliot admitted him as a friend of his brother in law s and felt very broad minded as he did so Robert however was a success The youngish men there found him interesting and liked to shock him with tales of naughty London and naughtier Paris They spoke of experience and sensations and seeing life and when a smile ploughed over his face concluded that his prudery was vanquished He saw that they were much less vicious than they supposed one boy had obviously read his sensations in a book But he could pardon vice What he could not pardon was triviality and he hoped that no decent woman could pardon it either There grew up in him a cold steady anger against these silly people who thought it advanced to be shocking and who described as something particularly choice and educational things that he had understood and fought against for years He inquired after missus Elliot and a boy tittered It seemed that she did not know that she lived in a remote suburb taking care of a skinny baby I shall call some time or other said Robert Do said mister Elliot smiling And next time he saw his wife he congratulated her on her rustic admirer She had suffered terribly She had asked for bread and had been given not even a stone People talk of hungering for the ideal but there is another hunger quite as divine for facts She had asked for facts and had been given views emotional standpoints attitudes towards life To a woman who believed that facts are beautiful that the living world is beautiful beyond the laws of beauty that manure is neither gross nor ludicrous that a fire not eternal glows at the heart of the earth it was intolerable to be put off with what the Elliots called philosophy and if she refused to be told that she had no sense of humour Tarrying into the Elliot family It had sounded so splendid for she was a penniless child with nothing to offer and the Elliots held their heads high For what reason What had they ever done except say sarcastic things and limp and be refined mister Failing suffered too but she suffered more inasmuch as Frederick was more impossible than Emily He did not like her he practically lived apart he was not even faithful or polite These were grave faults but they were human ones she could even imagine them in a man she loved What she could never love was a dilettante Robert brought her an armful of sweet peas He laid it on the table put his hands behind his back and kept them there till the end of the visit She knew quite well why he had come and though she also knew that he would fail she loved him too much to snub him or to stare in virtuous indignation Why have you come she asked gravely and why have you brought me so many flowers My garden is full of them he answered Sweetpeas need picking down And generally speaking flowers are plentiful in July She broke his present into bunches so much for the drawing room so much for the nursery so much for the kitchen and her husband s room he would be down for the night The most beautiful she would keep for herself Presently he said Your husband is no good I ve watched him for a week I m thirty and not what you call hasty as I used to be or thinking that nothing matters like the French No I m a plain Britisher yet I I ve begun wrong end missus Elliot I should have said that I ve thought chiefly of you for six years and that though I talk here so respectfully if I once unhooked my hands There was a pause Then she said with great sweetness Thank you I am glad you love me and rang the bell What have you done that for he cried Because you must now leave the house and never enter it again I don t go alone and he began to get furious Her voice was still sweet but strength lay in it too as she said You either go now with my thanks and blessing or else you go with the police I am missus Elliot We need not discuss mister Elliot I am missus Elliot and if you make one step towards me I give you in charge But the maid answered the bell not of the drawing room but of the front door They were joined by mister Elliot who held out his hand with much urbanity It was not taken He looked quickly at his wife and said Am I de trop There was a long silence At last she said Frederick turn this man out My love why Robert said that he loved her Then I am de trop said mister Elliot smoothing out his gloves He would give these sodden barbarians a lesson My hansom is waiting at the door Pray make use of it Don t she cried almost affectionately Dear Frederick it isn t a play Just tell this man to go or send for the police On the contrary it is French comedy of the best type Don t you agree sir that the police would be an inartistic error He was perfectly calm and collected whereas they were in a pitiable state Turn him out at once she cried He has insulted your wife Save me save me She clung to her husband and wept He was going I had managed him he would never have known mister Elliot repulsed her If you don t feel inclined to start at once he said with easy civility Let us have a little tea My dear sir do forgive me for not shooting you Nous avons change tout cela Please don t look so nervous Please do unclasp your hands He was alone That s all right he exclaimed and strolled to the door The hansom was disappearing round the corner That s all right he repeated in more quavering tones as he returned to the drawing room and saw that it was littered with sweet peas Their colour got on his nerves magenta crimson magenta crimson He tried to pick them up and they escaped He trod them underfoot and they multiplied and danced in the triumph of summer like a thousand butterflies The train had left when he got to the station He followed on to London and there he lost all traces At midnight he began to realize that his wife could never belong to him again mister Failing had a letter from Stockholm It was never known what impulse sent them there I am sorry about it all but it was the only way The letter censured the law of England which obliges us to behave like this or else we should never get married I shall come back to face things she will not come back till she is my wife He must bring an action soon or else we shall try one against him It seems all very unconventional but it is not really it is only a difficult start We are not like you or your wife we want to be just ordinary people and make the farm pay and not be noticed all our lives And they were capable of living as they wanted The class difference which so intrigued missus Failing meant very little to them It was there but so were other things They both cared for work and living in the open and for not speaking unless they had got something to say Their love of beauty like their love for each other was not dependent on detail it grew not from the nerves but from the soul I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars And the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the egg of the wren And the tree toad is a chef d oeuvre for the highest And the running blackberry would adorn the parlours of heaven They had never read these lines and would have thought them nonsense if they had They did not dissect indeed they could not But she at all events divined that more than perfect health and perfect weather more than personal love had gone to the making of those seventeen days Ordinary people cried missus Failing on hearing the letter At that time she was young and daring Why they re divine They re forces of Nature They re as ordinary as volcanoes We all knew my brother was disgusting and wanted him to be blown to pieces but we never thought it would happen Do look at the thing bravely and say as I do that they are guiltless in the sight of God I think they are replied her husband But they are not guiltless in the sight of man You conventional she exclaimed in disgust What they have done means misery not only for themselves but for others For your brother though you will not think of him For the little boy did you think of him And perhaps for another child who will have the whole world against him if it knows They have sinned against society and you do not diminish the misery by proving that society is bad or foolish It is the saddest truth I have yet perceived that the Beloved Republic here she took up a book of which Swinburne speaks she put the book down will not be brought about by love alone It will approach with no flourish of trumpets and have no declaration of independence Self sacrifice and worse still self mutilation are the things that sometimes help it most and that is why we should start for Stockholm this evening He waited for her indignation to subside and then continued I don t know whether it can be hushed up I don t yet know whether it ought to be hushed up But we ought to provide the opportunity There is no scandal yet If we go it is just possible there never will be any We must talk over the whole thing and And lie interrupted missus Failing who hated travel And see how to avoid the greatest unhappiness There was to be no scandal By the time they arrived Robert had been drowned missus Elliot described how they had gone swimming and how since he always lived inland the great waves had tired him They had raced for the open sea What are your plans he asked I bring you a message from Frederick I heard him call she continued but I thought he was laughing When I turned it was too late He put his hands behind his back and sank For he would only have drowned me with him I should have done the same missus Failing was thrilled and kissed her But mister Failing knew that life does not continue heroic for long and he gave her the message from her husband Would she come back to him To his intense astonishment at first to his regret she replied I will think about it If I loved him the very least bit I should say no If I had anything to do with my life I should say no But it is simply a question of beating time till I die Nothing that is coming matters I may as well sit in his drawing room and dust his furniture since he has suggested it And mister Elliot though he made certain stipulations was positively glad to see her People had begun to laugh at him and to say that his wife had run away She had not She had been with his sister in Sweden In a half miraculous way the matter was hushed up Even the Silts only scented something strange When Stephen was born it was abroad When he came to England it was as the child of a friend of mister Failing s missus Elliot returned unsuspected to her husband But though things can be hushed up there is no such thing as beating time and as the years passed she realized her terrible mistake When her lover sank eluding her last embrace she thought as Agnes was to think after her that her soul had sunk with him and that never again should she be capable of earthly love Nothing mattered She might as well go and be useful to her husband and to the little boy who looked exactly like him and who she thought was exactly like him in disposition Then Stephen was born and altered her life She could still love people passionately she still drew strength from the heroic past Yet to keep to her bond she must see this son only as a stranger She was protected be the conventions and must pay them their fee And a curious thing happened Her second child drew her towards her first She began to love Rickie also and to be more than useful to him And as her love revived so did her capacity for suffering Life more important grew more bitter She minded her husband more not less and when at last he died and she saw a glorious autumn beautiful with the voices of boys who should call her mother the end came for her as well before she could remember the grave in the alien north and the dust that would never return to the dear fields that had given it XXX Stephen the son of these people had one instinct that troubled him At night especially out of doors it seemed rather strange that he was alive The dry grass pricked his cheek the fields were invisible and mute and here was he throwing stones at the darkness or smoking a pipe The stones vanished the pipe would burn out But he would be here in the morning when the sun rose and he would bathe and run in the mist He was proud of his good circulation and in the morning it seemed quite natural But at night why should there be this difference between him and the acres of land that cooled all round him until the sun returned What lucky chance had heated him up and sent him warm and lovable into a passive world He had other instincts but these gave him no trouble He simply gratified each as it occurred provided he could do so without grave injury to his fellows But the instinct to wonder at the night was not to be thus appeased At first he had lived under the care of mister Failing the only person to whom his mother spoke freely the only person who had treated her neither as a criminal nor as a pioneer In their rare but intimate conversations she had asked him to educate her son I will teach him Latin he answered The rest such a boy must remember Latin at all events was a failure who could attend to Virgil when the sound of the thresher arose and you knew that the stack was decreasing and that rats rushed more plentifully each moment to their doom But he was fond of mister Failing and cried when he died missus Elliot a pleasant woman died soon after There was something fatal in the order of these deaths mister Failing had made no provision for the boy in his will his wife had promised to see to this Then came mister Elliot s death and before the new home was created the sudden death of missus Elliot She also left Stephen no money she had none to leave Chance threw him into the power of missus Failing Let things go on as they are she thought I will take care of this pretty little boy and the ugly little boy can live with the Silts After my death well the papers will be found after my death and they can meet then I like the idea of their mutual ignorance It is amusing He was then twelve With a few brief intervals of school he lived in Wiltshire until he was driven out Life had two distinct sides the drawing room and the other In the drawing room people talked a good deal laughing as they talked Being clever they did not care for animals one man had never seen a hedgehog In the other life people talked and laughed separately or even did neither On the whole in spite of the wet and gamekeepers this life was preferable He knew where he was He glanced at the boy or later at the man and behaved accordingly There was no law the policeman was negligible Nothing bound him but his own word and he gave that sparingly It is impossible to be romantic when you have your heart s desire and such a boy disappointed missus Failing greatly His parents had met for one brief embrace had found one little interval between the power of the rulers of this world and the power of death He was the child of poetry and of rebellion and poetry should run in his veins But he lived too near the things he loved to seem poetical Parted from them he might yet satisfy her and stretch out his hands with a pagan s yearning As it was he only rode her horses and trespassed and bathed and worked for no obvious reason upon her fields Affection she did not believe in and made no attempt to mould him and he for his part was very content to harden untouched into a man His parents had given him excellent gifts health sturdy limbs and a face not ugly gifts that his habits confirmed They had also given him a cloudless spirit the spirit of the seventeen days in which he was created But they had not given him the spirit of their sit years of waiting and love for one person was never to be the greatest thing he knew Philosophy had postponed the quarrel between them Incurious about his personal origin he had a certain interest in our eternal problems The interest never became a passion it sprang out of his physical growth and was soon merged in it again Or as he put it himself I must get fixed up before starting He was soon fixed up as a materialist Then he tore up the sixpenny reprints and never amused missus Failing so much again About the time he fixed himself up he took to drink He knew of no reason against it The instinct was in him and it hurt nobody Here as elsewhere his motions were decided and he passed at once from roaring jollity to silence For those who live on the fuddled borderland who crawl home by the railings and maunder repentance in the morning he had a biting contempt A man must take his tumble and his headache He was in fact as little disgusting as is conceivable and hitherto he had not strained his constitution or his will Nor did he get drunk as often as Agnes suggested The real quarrel gathered elsewhere Presentable people have run wild in their youth But the hour comes when they turn from their boorish company to higher things This hour never came for Stephen Somewhat a bully by nature he kept where his powers would tell and continued to quarrel and play with the men he had known as boys He prolonged their youth unduly They won t settle down said mister Wilbraham to his wife They re wanting things It s the germ of a Trades Union I shall get rid of a few of the worst Then Stephen rushed up to missus Failing and worried her It wasn t fair So and so was a good sort He did his work Keen about it No Why should he be Why should he be keen about somebody else s land But keen enough And very keen on football She laughed and said a word about So and so to mister Wilbraham mister Wilbraham blazed up How could the farm go on without discipline How could there be discipline if mister Stephen interfered mister Stephen liked power He spoke to the men like one of themselves and pretended it was all equality but he took care to come out top Natural of course that being a gentleman he should But not natural for a gentleman to loiter all day with poor people and learn their work and put wrong notions into their heads and carry their newfangled grievances to missus Failing Which partly accounted for the deficit on the past year She rebuked Stephen Then he lost his temper was rude to her and insulted mister Wilbraham The worst days of mister Failing s rule seemed to be returning And Stephen had a practical experience and also a taste for battle that her husband had never possessed He drew up a list of grievances some absurd others fundamental No newspapers in the reading room you could put a plate under the Thompsons door no level cricket pitch no allotments and no time to work in them missus Wilbraham s knife boy underpaid Aren t you a little unwise she asked coldly I am more bored than you think over the farm She was wanting to correct the proofs of the book and rewrite the prefatory memoir In her irritation she wrote to Agnes Agnes replied sympathetically and missus Failing clever as she was fell into the power of the younger woman They discussed him at first as a wretch of a boy then he got drunk and somehow it seemed more criminal All that she needed now was a personal grievance which Agnes casually supplied Though vindictive she was determined to treat him well and thought with satisfaction of our distant colonies But he burst into an odd passion he would sooner starve than leave England Why she asked Are you in love He picked up a lump of the chalk they were by the arbour and made no answer The vicar murmured It is not like going abroad Greater Britain blood is thicker than water A lump of chalk broke her drawing room window on the Saturday Thus Stephen left Wiltshire half blackguard half martyr Do not brand him as a socialist He had no quarrel with society nor any particular belief in people because they are poor He only held the creed of here am I and there are you and therefore class distinctions were trivial things to him and life no decorous scheme but a personal combat or a personal truce For the same reason ancestry also was trivial and a man not the dearer because the same woman was mother to them both Yet it seemed worth while to go to Sawston with the news Perhaps nothing would come of it perhaps friendly intercourse and a home while he looked around When they wronged him he walked quietly away He never thought of allotting the blame nor or appealing to Ansell who still sat brooding in the side garden He only knew that educated people could be horrible and that a clean liver must never enter Dunwood House again The air seemed stuffy He spat in the gutter Was it yesterday he had lain in the rifle butts over Salisbury Slightly aggrieved he wondered why he was not back there now I ought to have written first he reflected Here is my money gone I cannot move The Elliots have as it were practically robbed me That was the only grudge he retained against them Their suspicions and insults were to him as the curses of a tramp whom he passed by the wayside They were dirty people not his sort He summed up the complicated tragedy as a take in While Rickie was being carried upstairs and while Ansell had he known it was dashing about the streets for him he lay under a railway arch trying to settle his plans He must pay back the friends who had given him shillings and clothes He thought of Flea whose Sundays he was spoiling poor Flea who ought to be in them now shining before his girl I daresay he ll be ashamed and not go to see her and then she ll take the other man He was also very hungry That worm missus Elliot would be through her lunch by now Trying his braces round him and tearing up those old wet documents he stepped forth to make money A villainous young brute he looked his clothes were dirty and he had lost the spring of the morning Touching the walls frowning talking to himself at times he slouched disconsolately northwards no wonder that some tawdry girls screamed at him or that matrons averted their eyes as they hurried to afternoon church He wandered from one suburb to another till he was among people more villainous than himself who bought his tobacco from him and sold him food Again the neighbourhood went up and families instead of sitting on their doorsteps would sit behind thick muslin curtains Again it would go down into a more avowed despair Far into the night he wandered until he came to a solemn river majestic as a stream in hell Therein were gathered the waters of Central England those that flow off Hindhead off the Chilterns off Wiltshire north of the Plain Therein they were made intolerable ere they reached the sea But the waters he had known escaped Their course lay southward into the Avon by forests and beautiful fields even swift even pure until they mirrored the tower of Christchurch and greeted the ramparts of the Isle of Wight Of these he thought for a moment as he crossed the black river and entered the heart of the modern world Here he found employment He was not hampered by genteel traditions and as it was near quarter day managed to get taken on at a furniture warehouse He moved people from the suburbs to London from London to the suburbs from one suburb to another His companions were hurried and querulous In particular he loathed the foreman a pious humbug who allowed no swearing but indulged in something far more degraded the Cockney repartee The London intellect so pert and shallow like a stream that never reaches the ocean disgusted him almost as much as the London physique which for all its dexterity is not permanent and seldom continues into the third generation His father had he known it had felt the same for between mister Elliot and the foreman the gulf was social not spiritual both spent their lives in trying to be clever And Tony Failing had once put the thing into words There s no such thing as a Londoner He s only a country man on the road to sterility At the end of ten days he had saved scarcely anything Once he passed the bank where a hundred pounds lay ready for him but it was still inconvenient for him to take them Then duty sent him to a suburb not very far from Sawston In the evening a man who was driving a trap asked him to hold it and by mistake tipped him a sovereign Stephen called after him but the man had a woman with him and wanted to show off and though he had meant to tip a shilling and could not afford that he shouted back that his sovereign was as good as any one s and that if Stephen did not think so he could do various things and go to various places On the action of this man much depends Stephen changed the sovereign into a postal order and sent it off to the people at Cadford It did not pay them back but it paid them something and he felt that his soul was free A few shillings remained in his pocket They would have paid his fare towards Wiltshire a good county but what should he do there Who would employ him Today the journey did not seem worth while Tomorrow perhaps he thought and determined to spend the money on pleasure of another kind Two pence went for a ride on an electric tram From the top he saw the sun descend a disc with a dark red edge The same sun was descending over Salisbury intolerably bright Out of the golden haze the spire would be piercing like a purple needle then mists arose from the Avon and the other streams Lamps flickered but in the outer purity the villages were already slumbering Salisbury is only a Gothic upstart beside these For generations they have come down to her to buy or to worship and have found in her the reasonable crisis of their lives but generations before she was built they were clinging to the soil and renewing it with sheep and dogs and men who found the crisis of their lives upon Stonehenge The blood of these men ran in Stephen the vigour they had won for him was as yet untarnished out on those downs they had united with rough women to make the thing he spoke of as himself the last of them has rescued a woman of a different kind from streets and houses such as these As the sun descended he got off the tram with a smile of expectation A public house lay opposite and a boy in a dirty uniform was already lighting its enormous lamp His lips parted and he went in Two hours later when Rickie and Herbert were going the rounds a brick came crashing at the study window Herbert peered into the garden and a hooligan slipped by him into the house wrecked the hall lurched up the stairs fell against the banisters balanced for a moment on his spine and slid over Herbert called for the police Rickie who was upon the landing caught the man by the knees and saved his life What is it cried Agnes emerging It s Stephen come back was the answer Hullo Stephen XXXI Hither had Rickie moved in ten days from disgust to penitence from penitence to longing from a life of horror to a new life in which he still surprised himself by unexpected words Hullo Stephen For the son of his mother had come back to forgive him as she would have done to live with him as she had planned He s drunk this time said Agnes wearily She too had altered the scandal was ageing her and Ansell came to the house daily Hullo Stephen But Stephen was now insensible Stephen you live here Good gracious me interposed Herbert My advice is that we all go to bed The less said the better while our nerves are in this state Very well Rickie Of course Wonham sleeps the night if you wish They carried the drunken mass into the spare room A mass of scandal it seemed to one of them a symbol of redemption to the other Neither acknowledged it a man who would answer them back after a few hours rest Ansell thought he would never forgive me said Rickie For once he s wrong Come to bed now I think And as Rickie laid his hand on the sleeper s hair he added You won t do anything foolish will you You are still in a morbid state Your poor mother Pardon me dear boy it is my turn to speak out You thought it was your father and minded It is your mother Surely you ought to mind more I have been too far back said Rickie gently Ansell took me on a journey that was even new to him We got behind right and wrong to a place where only one thing matters that the Beloved should rise from the dead But you won t do anything rash Why should I Remember poor Agnes he stammered I I am the first to acknowledge that we might have pursued a different policy But we are committed to it now It makes no difference whose son he is I mean he is the same person You and I and my sister stand or fall together It was our agreement from the first I hope No more of these distressing scenes with her there s a dear fellow I assure you they make my heart bleed Things will quiet down now To bed now I insist upon that much Very well said Rickie and when they were in the passage locked the door from the outside We want no more muddles he explained mister Pembroke was left examining the hall The bust of Hermes was broken So was the pot of the palm He could not go to bed without once more sounding Rickie You ll do nothing rash he called The notion of him living here was of course a passing impulse We three have adopted a common policy Now you go away called a voice that was almost flippant I never did belong to that great sect whose doctrine is that each one should select at least I m not going to belong to it any longer Go away to bed A good night s rest is what you need threatened Herbert and retired not to find one for himself But Rickie slept The guilt of months and the remorse of the last ten days had alike departed He had thought that his life was poisoned and lo it was purified He had cursed his mother and Ansell had replied You may be right but you stand too near to settle Step backwards Pretend that it happened to me Do you want me to curse my mother Now step forward and see whether anything has changed Something had changed He had journeyed as on rare occasions a man must till he stood behind right and wrong On the banks of the grey torrent of life love is the only flower A little way up the stream and a little way down had Rickie glanced and he knew that she whom he loved had risen from the dead and might rise again Come away let them die out let them die out Surely that dream was a vision To night also he hurried to the window to remember with a smile that Orion is not among the stars of June Let me die out She will continue he murmured and in making plans for Stephen s happiness fell asleep Next morning after breakfast he announced that his brother must live at Dunwood House They were awed by the very moderation of his tone There s nothing else to be done Cadover s hopeless and a boy of those tendencies can t go drifting There is also the question of a profession for him and his allowance We have to thank mister Ansell for this was all that Agnes could say and I foresee disaster was the contribution of Herbert There s plenty of money about Rickie continued Quite a man s worth too much It has been one of our absurdities Don t look so sad Herbert I m sorry for you people but he s sure to let us down easy For his experience of drunkards and of Stephen was small He supposed that he had come without malice to renew the offer of ten days ago It is the end of Dunwood House Rickie nodded and hoped not Agnes who was not looking well began to cry Oh it is too bad she complained when I ve saved you from him all these years But he could not pity her nor even sympathize with her wounded delicacy The time for such nonsense was over He would take his share of the blame it was cant to assume it all Perhaps he was over hard He did not realize how large his share was nor how his very virtues were to blame for her deterioration If I had a girl I d keep her in line is not the remark of a fool nor of a cad Rickie had not kept his wife in line He had shown her all the workings of his soul mistaking this for love and in consequence she was the worse woman after two years of marriage and he on this morning of freedom was harder upon her than he need have been The spare room bell rang Herbert had a painful struggle between curiosity and duty for the bell for chapel was ringing also and he must go through the drizzle to school He promised to come up in the interval Rickie who had rapped his head that Sunday on the edge of the table was still forbidden to work Before him a quiet morning lay Secure of his victory he took the portrait of their mother in his hand and walked leisurely upstairs The bell continued to ring See about his breakfast he called to Agnes who replied Very well The handle of the spare room door was moving slowly I m coming he cried The handle was still He unlocked and entered his heart full of charity But within stood a man who probably owned the world Rickie scarcely knew him last night he had seemed so colorless no negligible In a few hours he had recaptured motion and passion and the imprint of the sunlight and the wind He stood not consciously heroic with arms that dangled from broad stooping shoulders and feet that played with a hassock on the carpet But his hair was beautiful against the grey sky and his eyes recalling the sky unclouded shot past the intruder as if to some worthier vision So intent was their gaze that Rickie himself glanced backwards only to see the neat passage and the banisters at the top of the stairs Then the lips beat together twice and out burst a torrent of amazing words Add it all up and let me know how much I d sooner have died It never took me that way before I must have broken pounds worth If you ll not tell the police I promise you shan t lose mister Elliot I swear But it may be months before I send it Everything is to be new You ve not to be a penny out of pocket do you see Do let me go this once again What s the trouble asked Rickie as if they had been friends for years My dear man we ve other things to talk about Gracious me what a fuss If you d smashed the whole house I wouldn t mind so long as you came back I d sooner have died gulped Stephen You did nearly It was I who caught you Never mind yesterday s rag What can you manage for breakfast The face grew more angry and more puzzled Yesterday wasn t a rag he said without focusing his eyes I was drunk but naturally meant it Meant what To smash you Bad liquor did what missus Elliot couldn t I ve put myself in the wrong You ve got me It was a poor beginning As I have got you said Rickie controlling himself I want to have a talk with you There has been a ghastly mistake But Stephen with a countryman s persistency continued on his own line He meant to be civil but Rickie went cold round the mouth For he had not even been angry with them Until he was drunk they had been dirty people not his sort Then the trivial injury recurred and he had reeled to smash them as he passed And I will pay for everything was his refrain with which the sighing of raindrops mingled You shan t lose a penny if only you let me free You ll pay for my coffin if you talk like that any longer Will you one forgive my frightful behaviour two live with me For his only hope was in a cheerful precision Stephen grew more agitated He thought it was some trick I was saying I made an unspeakable mistake Ansell put me right but it was too late to find you Don t think I got off easily Ansell doesn t spare one And you ve got to forgive me to share my life to share my money I ve brought you this photograph I want it to be the first thing you accept from me you have the greater right I know all the story now You know who it is Oh yes but I don t want to drag all that in It is only her wish if we live together She was planning it when she died I can t follow because to share your life Did you know I called here last Sunday week Yes But then I only knew half I thought you were my father s son Stephen s anger and bewilderment were increasing He stuttered What what s the odds if you did I hated my father said Rickie I loved my mother And never had the phrases seemed so destitute of meaning Last Sunday week interrupted Stephen his voice suddenly rising I came to call on you Not as this or that s son Not to fall on your neck Nor to live here Nor damn your dirty little mind I meant to say I didn t come for money Sorry Sorry I simply came as I was and I haven t altered since Yes yet our mother for me she has risen from the dead since then I know I was wrong And where do I come in He kicked the hassock I haven t risen from the dead I haven t altered since last Sunday week I m He stuttered again He could not quite explain what he was The man towards Andover after all he was having principles But you ve His voice broke I mind it I m I don t alter blackguard one week live here the next I keep to one or the other you ve hurt something most badly in me that I didn t know was there Don t let us talk said Rickie It gets worse every minute Simply say you forgive me shake hands and have done with it That I won t That I couldn t In fact I don t know what you mean Then Rickie began a new appeal not to pity for now he was in no mood to whimper For all its pathos there was something heroic in this meeting I warn you to stop here with me Stephen No one else in the world will look after you As far as I know you have never been really unhappy yet or suffered as you should do from your faults Last night you nearly killed yourself with drink Never mind why I m willing to cure you I am willing and I warn you to give me the chance Forgive me or not as you choose I care for other things more Stephen looked at him at last faintly approving The offer was ridiculous but it did treat him as a man Let me tell you of a fault of mine and how I was punished for it continued Rickie Two years ago I behaved badly to you up at the Rings No even a few days before that We went for a ride and I thought too much of other matters and did not try to understand you Then came the Rings and in the evening when you called up to me most kindly I never answered But the ride was the beginning Ever since then I have taken the world at second hand I have bothered less and less to look it in the face until not only you but every one else has turned unreal Never Ansell he kept away and somehow saved himself But every one else Do you remember in one of Tony Failing s books Cast bitter bread upon the waters and after many days it really does come back to you This had been true of my life it will be equally true of a drunkard s and I warn you to stop with me I can t stop after that cheque said Stephen more gently But I do remember the ride I was a bit bored myself Agnes who had not been seeing to the breakfast chose this moment to call from the passage Of course he can t stop she exclaimed For better or worse it s settled We ve none of us altered since last Sunday week There you re right missus Elliot he shouted starting out of the temperate past We haven t altered With a rare flash of insight he turned on Rickie I see your game You don t care about ME drinking or to shake MY hand It s some one else you want to cure as it were that old photograph You talk to me but all the time you look at the photograph He snatched it up I ve my own ideas of good manners and to look friends between the eyes is one of them and this he tore the photograph across and this he tore it again and these He flung the pieces at the man who had sunk into a chair For my part I m off Then Rickie was heroic no longer Turning round in his chair he covered his face The man was right He did not love him even as he had never hated him In either passion he had degraded him to be a symbol for the vanished past The man was right and would have been lovable He longed to be back riding over those windy fields to be back in those mystic circles beneath pure sky Then they could have watched and helped and taught each other until the word was a reality and the past not a torn photograph but Demeter the goddess rejoicing in the spring Ah if he had seized those high opportunities For they led to the highest of all the symbolic moment which if a man accepts he has accepted life The voice of Agnes which had lured him then For my sake she had whispered pealed over him now in triumph Abruptly it broke into sobs that had the effect of rain He started up The anger had died out of Stephen s face not for a subtle reason but because here was a woman near him and unhappy She tried to apologize and brought on a fresh burst of tears Something had upset her They heard her locking the door of her room From that moment their intercourse was changed Why does she keep crying today mused Rickie as if he spoke to some mutual friend I can make a guess said Stephen and his heavy face flushed Did you insult her he asked feebly But who s Gerald Rickie raised his hand to his mouth She looked at me as if she knew me and then gasps Gerald and started crying Gerald is the name of some one she once knew So I thought There was a long silence in which they could hear a piteous gulping cough Where is he now asked Stephen Dead And then you Rickie nodded Bad this sort of thing I didn t know of this particular thing She acted as if she had forgotten him Perhaps she had and you woke him up There are queer tricks in the world She is overstrained She has probably been plotting ever since you burst in last night Against me Yes Stephen stood irresolute I suppose you and she pulled together He said at last Get away from us man I mind losing you Yet it s as well you don t stop Oh THAT S out of the question said Stephen brushing his cap If you ve guessed anything I d be obliged if you didn t mention it I ve no right to ask but I d be obliged He nodded and walked slowly along the landing and down the stairs Rickie accompanied him and even opened the front door It was as if Agnes had absorbed the passion out of both of them The suburb was now wrapped in a cloud not of its own making Sigh after sigh passed along its streets to break against dripping walls The school the houses were hidden and all civilization seemed in abeyance Only the simplest sounds the simplest desires emerged They agreed that this weather was strange after such a sunset That s a collie said Stephen listening I wish you d have some breakfast before starting No food thanks But you know He paused It s all been a muddle and I ve no objection to your coming along with me The cloud descended lower Come with me as a man said Stephen already out in the mist Not as a brother who cares what people did years back We re alive together and the rest is cant Here am I Rickie and there are you a fair wreck They ve no use for you here never had any if the truth was known and they ve only made you beastly This house so to speak has the rot It s common sense that you should come Stephen wait a minute What do you mean Wait s what we won t do said Stephen at the gate I must ask He did wait for a minute and sobs were heard faint hopeless vindictive Then he trudged away and Rickie soon lost his colour and his form But a voice persisted saying Come I do mean it Come I will take care of you I can manage you The words were kind yet it was not for their sake that Rickie plunged into the impalpable cloud In the voice he had found a surer guarantee Habits and sex may change with the new generation features may alter with the play of a private passion but a voice is apart from these It lies nearer to the racial essence and perhaps to the divine it can at all events overleap one grave XXXII mister Pembroke did not receive a clear account of what had happened when he returned for the interval His sister he told her frankly was concealing something from him She could make no reply Had she gone mad she wondered Hitherto she had pretended to love her husband Why choose such a moment for the truth But I understand Rickie s position he told her It is an unbalanced position yet I understand it I noted its approach while he was ill He imagines himself his brother s keeper Therefore we must make concessions We must negotiate The negotiations were still progressing in November the month during which this story draws to its close I understand his position he then told her It is both weak and defiant He is still with those Ansells Read this letter which thanks me for his little stories We sent them last month you remember such of them as we could find It seems that he fills up his time by writing he has already written a book She only gave him half her attention for a beautiful wreath had just arrived from the florist s She was taking it up to the cemetery today her child had been dead a year On the other hand he has altered his will Fortunately he cannot alter much But I fear that what is not settled on you will go Should I read what I wrote on this point and also my minutes of the interview with old mister Ansell and the copy of my correspondence with Stephen Wonham But her fly was announced While he put the wreath in for her she ran for a moment upstairs A few tears had come to her eyes A scandalous divorce would have been more bearable than this withdrawal People asked Why did her husband leave her and the answer came Oh nothing particular he only couldn t stand her she lied and taught him to lie she kept him from the work that suited him from his friends from his brother in a word she tried to run him which a man won t pardon A few tears not many To her life never showed itself as a classic drama in which by trying to advance our fortunes we shatter them She had turned Stephen out of Wiltshire and he fell like a thunderbolt on Sawston and on herself In trying to gain missus Failing s money she had probably lost money which would have been her own But irony is a subtle teacher and she was not the woman to learn from such lessons as these Her suffering was more direct Three men had wronged her therefore she hated them and if she could would do them harm These negotiations are quite useless she told Herbert when she came downstairs We had much better bide our time Tell me just about Stephen Wonham though He drew her into the study again Wonham is or was in Scotland learning to farm with connections of the Ansells I believe the money is to go towards setting him up Apparently he is a hard worker He also drinks She nodded and smiled More than he did My informant mister Tilliard oh I ought not to have mentioned his name He is one of the better sort of Rickie s Cambridge friends and has been dreadfully grieved at the collapse but he does not want to be mixed up in it This autumn he was up in the Lowlands close by and very kindly made a few unobtrusive inquiries for me The man is becoming an habitual drunkard She smiled again Stephen had evoked her secret and she hated him more for that than for anything else that he had done The poise of his shoulders that morning it was no more had recalled Gerald If only she had not been so tired He had reminded her of the greatest thing she had known and to her cloudy mind this seemed degradation She had turned to him as to her lover with a look which a man of his type understood she had asked for his pity for one terrible moment she had desired to be held in his arms Even Herbert was surprised when she said I m glad he drinks I hope he ll kill himself A man like that ought never to have been born Perhaps the sins of the parents are visited on the children said Herbert taking her to the carriage Yet it is not for us to decide I feel sure he will be punished What right has he She broke off What right had he to our common humanity It was a hard lesson for any one to learn For Agnes it was impossible Stephen was illicit abnormal worse than a man diseased Yet she had turned to him he had drawn out the truth My dear don t cry said her brother drawing up the windows I have great hopes of mister Tilliard the Silts have written missus Failing will do what she can As she drove to the cemetery her bitterness turned against Ansell who had kept her husband alive in the days after Stephen s expulsion If he had not been there Rickie would have renounced his mother and his brother and all the outer world troubling no one The mystic inherent in him would have prevailed So Ansell himself had told her And Ansell too had sheltered the fugitives and given them money and saved them from the ludicrous checks that so often stop young men But when she reached the cemetery and stood beside the tiny grave all her bitterness all her hatred were turned against Rickie But he ll come back in the end she thought A wife has only to wait What are his friends beside me They too will marry I have only to wait His book like all that he has done will fail His brother is drinking himself away Poor aimless Rickie I have only to keep civil He will come back in the end She had moved and found herself close to the grave of Gerald The flowers she had planted after his death were dead and she had not liked to renew them There lay the athlete and his dust was as the little child s whom she had brought into the world with such hope with such pain XXXIII That same day Rickie feeling neither poor nor aimless left the Ansells for a night s visit to Cadover His aunt had invited him why he could not think nor could he think why he should refuse the invitation She could not annoy him now and he was not vindictive In the dell near Madingley he had cried I hate no one in his ignorance Now with full knowledge he hated no one again The weather was pleasant the county attractive and he was ready for a little change Maud and Stewart saw him off Stephen who was down for the holiday had been left with his chin on the luncheon table He had wanted to come also Rickie pointed out that you cannot visit where you have broken the windows There was an argument there generally was and now the young man had turned sulky Let him do what he likes said Ansell He knows more than we do He knows everything Is he to get drunk Rickie asked Most certainly And to go where he isn t asked Maud though liking a little spirit in a man declared this to be impossible Well I wish you joy Rickie called as the train moved away He means mischief this evening He told me piously that he felt it beating up Good bye But we ll wait for you to pass they cried For the Salisbury train always backed out of the station and then returned and the Ansell family including Stewart took an incredible pleasure in seeing it do this The carriage was empty Rickie settled himself down for his little journey First he looked at the coloured photographs Then he read the directions for obtaining luncheon baskets and felt the texture of the cushions Through the windows a signal box interested him Then he saw the ugly little town that was now his home and up its chief street the Ansells memorable facade The spirit of a genial comedy dwelt there It was so absurd so kindly The house was divided against itself and yet stood Metaphysics commerce social aspirations all lived together in harmony mister Ansell had done much but one was tempted to believe in a more capricious power the power that abstains from nipping One nips or is nipped and never knows beforehand quoted Rickie and opened the poems of Shelley a man less foolish than you supposed How pleasant it was to read If business worried him if Stephen was noisy or Ansell perverse there still remained this paradise of books It seemed as if he had read nothing for two years Then the train stopped for the shunting and he heard protests from minor officials who were working on the line They complained that some one who didn t ought to had mounted on the footboard of the carriage Stephen s face appeared convulsed with laughter With the action of a swimmer he dived in through the open window and fell comfortably on Rickie s luggage and Rickie He declared it was the finest joke ever known Rickie was not so sure You ll be run over next he said What did you do that for I m coming with you he giggled rolling all that he could on to the dusty floor Now Stephen this is too bad Get up We went into the whole question yesterday I know and I settled we wouldn t go into it again spoiling my holiday Well it s execrable taste Now he was waving to the Ansells and showing them a piece of soap it was all his luggage and even that he abandoned for he flung it at Stewart s lofty brow I can t think what you ve done it for You know how strongly I felt Stephen replied that he should stop in the village meet Rickie at the lodge gates that kind of thing It s execrable taste he repeated trying to keep grave Well you did all you could he exclaimed with sudden sympathy Leaving me talking to old Ansell you might have thought you d got your way I ve as much taste as most chaps but hang it your aunt isn t the German Emperor She doesn t own Wiltshire You ass sputtered Rickie who had taken to laugh at nonsense again No she isn t he repeated blowing a kiss out of the window to maidens Why we started for Wiltshire on the wet morning When Stewart found us at Sawston railway station He smiled happily I never thought we should pull through Well we DIDN T We never did what we meant It s nonsense that I couldn t have managed you alone I ve a notion Slip out after your dinner this evening and we ll get thundering tight together I ve a notion I won t It d do you no end of good You ll get to know people shepherds carters He waved his arms vaguely indicating democracy Then you ll sing And then Plop Precisely But I ll catch you promised Stephen We shall carry you up the hill to bed In the morning you wake have your row with old Em ly she kicks you out we meet we ll meet at the Rings He danced up and down the carriage Some one in the next carriage punched at the partition and when this happens all lads with mettle know that they must punch the partition back Thank you I ve a notion I won t said Rickie when the noise had subsided subsided for a moment only for the following conversation took place to an accompaniment of dust and bangs Except as regards the Rings We will meet there Then I ll get tight by myself No you won t Yes I will I swore to do something special this evening I feel like it In that case I get out at the next station He was laughing but quite determined Stephen had grown too dictatorial of late The Ansells spoilt him It s bad enough having you there at all Having you there drunk is impossible I d sooner not visit my aunt than think when I sat with her that you re down in the village teaching her labourers to be as beastly as yourself Go if you will But not with me Why shouldn t I have a good time while I m young if I don t harm any one said Stephen defiantly Need we discuss self Oh I can stop myself any minute I choose I just say I won t to you or any other fool and I don t Rickie knew that the boast was true He continued There is also a thing called Morality You may learn in the Bible and also from the Greeks that your body is a temple So you said in your longest letter Probably I wrote like a prig for the reason that I have never been tempted in this way but surely it is wrong that your body should escape you I don t follow he retorted punching It isn t right even for a little time to forget that you exist I suppose you ve never been tempted to go to sleep Just then the train passed through a coppice in which the grey undergrowth looked no more alive than firewood Yet every twig in it was waiting for the spring Rickie knew that the analogy was false but argument confused him and he gave up this line of attack also Do be more careful over life If your body escapes you in one thing why not in more A man will have other temptations You mean women said Stephen quietly pausing for a moment in this game But that s absolutely different That would be harming some one else Is that the only thing that keeps you straight What else should And he looked not into Rickie but past him with the wondering eyes of a child Rickie nodded and referred himself to the window He observed that the country was smoother and more plastic The woods had gone and under a pale blue sky long contours of earth were flowing and merging rising a little to bear some coronal of beeches parting a little to disclose some green valley where cottages stood under elms or beside translucent waters It was Wiltshire at last The train had entered the chalk At last it slackened at a wayside platform Without speaking he opened the door What s that for To go back Stephen had forgotten the threat He said that this was not playing the game Surely I can t have you going back Promise to behave decently then He was seized and pulled away from the door We change at Salisbury he remarked There is an hour to wait You will find me troublesome It isn t fair exploded Stephen It s a lowdown trick How can I let you go back Promise then Oh yes yes yes Y M C A But for this occasion only No no For the rest of your holiday Yes yes Very well I promise For the rest of your life Somehow it pleased him that Stephen should bang him crossly with his elbow and say No Get out You ve gone too far So had the train The porter at the end of the wayside platform slammed the door and they proceeded toward Salisbury through the slowly modulating downs Rickie pretended to read Over the book he watched his brother s face and wondered how bad temper could be consistent with a mind so radiant In spite of his obstinacy and conceit Stephen was an easy person to live with He never fidgeted or nursed hidden grievances or indulged in a shoddy pride Though he spent Rickie s money as slowly as he could he asked for it without apology You must put it down against me he would say In time it was still very vague he would rent or purchase a farm There is no formula in which we may sum up decent people So Ansell had preached and had of course proceeded to offer a formula They must be serious they must be truthful Serious not in the sense of glum but they must be convinced that our life is a state of some importance and our earth not a place to beat time on Of so much Stephen was convinced he showed it in his work in his play in his self respect and above all though the fact is hard to face in his sacred passion for alcohol Drink today is an unlovely thing Between us and the heights of Cithaeron the river of sin now flows Yet the cries still call from the mountain and granted a man has responded to them it is better he respond with the candour of the Greek I shall stop at the Thompsons now said the disappointed reveller Prayers Rickie did not press his triumph but it was a happy moment partly because of the triumph partly because he was sure that his brother must care for him Stephen was too selfish to give up any pleasure without grave reasons He was certain that he had been right to disentangle himself from Sawston and to ignore the threats and tears that still tempted him to return Here there was real work for him to do Moreover though he sought no reward it had come His health was better his brain sound his life washed clean not by the waters of sentiment but by the efforts of a fellow man Stephen was man first brother afterwards Herein lay his brutality and also his virtue Look me in the face Don t hang on me clothes that don t belong as you did on your wife giving her saint s robes whereas she was simply a woman of her own sort who needed careful watching Tear up the photographs Here am I and there are you The rest is cant The rest was not cant and perhaps Stephen would confess as much in time But Rickie needed a tonic and a man not a brother must hold it to his lips I see the old spire he called and then added I don t mind seeing it again No one does as far as I know People have come from the other side of the world to see it again Pious people But I don t hold with bishops He was young enough to be uneasy The cathedral a fount of superstition must find no place in his life At the age of twenty he had settled things I ve got my own philosophy he once told Ansell and I don t care a straw about yours Ansell s mirth had annoyed him not a little And it was strange that one so settled should feel his heart leap up at the sight of an old spire I regard it as a public building he told Rickie who agreed It s useful too as a landmark His attitude today was defensive It was part of a subtle change that Rickie had noted in him since his return from Scotland His face gave hints of a new maturity You can see the old spire from the Ridgeway he said suddenly laying a hand on Rickie s knee before rain as clearly as any telegraph post How far is the Ridgeway Seventeen miles Which direction North naturally North again from that you see Devizes the vale of Pewsey and the other downs Also towards Bath It is something of a view You ought to get on the Ridgeway I shouldn t have time for that Or Beacon Hill Or let s do Stonehenge If it s fine I suggest the Rings It will be fine Then he murmured the names of villages I wish you could live here said Rickie kindly I believe you love these particular acres more than the whole world Stephen replied that this was not the case he was only used to them He wished they were driving out instead of waiting for the Cadchurch train They had advanced into Salisbury and the cathedral a public building was grey against a tender sky Rickie suggested that while waiting for the train they should visit it He spoke of the incomparable north porch I ve never been inside it and I never will Sorry to shock you Rickie but I must tell you plainly I m an atheist I don t believe in anything I do said Rickie When a man dies it s as if he s never been he asserted The train drew up in Salisbury station Here a little incident took place which caused them to alter their plans They found outside the station a trap driven by a small boy who had come in from Cadford to fetch some wire netting That ll do us said Stephen and called to the boy If I pay your railway ticket back and if I give you sixpence as well will you let us drive back in the trap The boy said no It will be all right said Rickie I am missus Failing s nephew The boy shook his head And you know mister Wonham The boy couldn t say he didn t Then what s your objection Why What is it Why not But Stephen leant against the time tables and spoke of other matters Presently the boy said Did you say you d pay my railway ticket back mister Wonham Yes said a bystander Didn t you hear him I heard him right enough Now Stephen laid his hand on the splash board saying What I want though is this trap here of yours see to drive in back myself and as he spoke the bystander followed him in canon What he wants though is that there trap of yours see to drive hisself back in I ve no objection said the boy as if deeply offended For a time he sat motionless and then got down remarking I won t rob you of your sixpence Silly little fool snapped Rickie as they drove through the town Stephen looked surprised What s wrong with the boy He had to think it over No one had asked him to do such a thing before Next time he d let us have the trap quick enough Not if he had driven in for a cabbage instead of wire netting He never would drive in for a cabbage Rickie shuffled his feet But his irritation passed He saw that the little incident had been a quiet challenge to the civilization that he had known Organize Systematize Fill up every moment Induce esprit de corps He reviewed the watchwords of the last two years and found that they ignored personal contest personal truces personal love By following them Sawston School had lost its quiet usefulness and become a frothy sea wherein plunged Dunwood House that unnecessary ship Humbled he turned to Stephen and said No you re right Nothing is wrong with the boy He was honestly thinking it out But Stephen had forgotten the incident or else he was not inclined to talk about it His assertive fit was over The direct road from Salisbury to Cadover is extremely dull The city which God intended to keep by the river did she not move there being thirsty in the reign of William Rufus the city had strayed out of her own plain climbed up her slopes and tumbled over them in ugly cataracts of brick The cataracts are still short and doubtless they meet or create some commercial need But instead of looking towards the cathedral as all the city should they look outwards at a pagan entrenchment as the city should not They neglect the poise of the earth and the sentiments she has decreed They are the modern spirit Through them the road descends into an unobtrusive country where nevertheless the power of the earth grows stronger Streams do divide Distances do still exist It is easier to know the men in your valley than those who live in the next across a waste of down It is easier to know men well The country is not paradise and can show the vices that grieve a good man everywhere But there is room in it and leisure I suppose said Rickie as the twilight fell this kind of thing is going on all over England Perhaps he meant that towns are after all excrescences grey fluxions where men hurrying to find one another have lost themselves But he got no response and expected none Turning round in his seat he watched the winter sun slide out of a quiet sky The horizon was primrose and the earth against it gave momentary hints of purple All faded no pageant would conclude the gracious day and when he turned eastward the night was already established Those verlands said Stephen scarcely above his breath What are verlands He pointed at the dusk and said Our name for a kind of field Then he drove his whip into its socket and seemed to swallow something Rickie straining his eyes for verlands could only see a tumbling wilderness of brown Are there many local words There have been I suppose they die out The conversation turned curiously In the tone of one who replies he said I expect that some time or other I shall marry I expect you will said Rickie and wondered a little why the reply seemed not abrupt Would we see the Rings in the daytime from here We do see them But missus Failing once said no decent woman would have me Did you agree to that Drive a little will you The horse went slowly forward into the wilderness that turned from brown to black Then a luminous glimmer surrounded them and the air grew cooler the road was descending between parapets of chalk But Rickie mightn t I find a girl naturally not refined and be happy with her in my own way I would tell her straight I was nothing much faithful of course but that she should never have all my thoughts Out of no disrespect to her but because all one s thoughts can t belong to any single person While he spoke even the road vanished and invisible water came gurgling through the wheel spokes The horse had chosen the ford You can t own people At least a fellow can t It may be different for a poet Let the horse drink And I want to marry some one and don t yet know who she is which a poet again will tell you is disgusting Does it disgust you Being nothing much surely I d better go gently For it s something rather outside that makes one marry if you follow me not exactly oneself Don t hurry the horse We want to marry and yet I can t explain I fancy I ll go wading this is our stream Romantic love is greater than this There are men and women we know it from history who have been born into the world for each other and for no one else who have accomplished the longest journey locked in each other s arms But romantic love is also the code of modern morals and for this reason popular Eternal union eternal ownership these are tempting baits for the average man He swallows them will not confess his mistake and perhaps to cover it cries dirty cynic at such a man as Stephen Rickie watched the black earth unite to the black sky But the sky overhead grew clearer and in it twinkled the Plough and the central stars He thought of his brother s future and of his own past and of how much truth might lie in that antithesis of Ansell s A man wants to love mankind a woman wants to love one man At all events he and his wife had illustrated it and perhaps the conflict so tragic in their own case was elsewhere the salt of the world Meanwhile Stephen called from the water for matches there was some trick with paper which mister Failing had showed him and which he would show Rickie now instead of talking nonsense Bending down he illuminated the dimpled surface of the ford Quite a current he said and his face flickered out in the darkness Yes give me the loose paper quick Crumple it into a ball Rickie obeyed though intent on the transfigured face He believed that a new spirit dwelt there expelling the crudities of youth He saw steadier eyes and the sign of manhood set like a bar of gold upon steadier lips Some faces are knit by beauty or by intellect or by a great passion had Stephen s waited for the touch of the years But they played as boys who continued the nonsense of the railway carriage The paper caught fire from the match and spread into a rose of flame Now gently with me said Stephen and they laid it flowerlike on the stream Gravel and tremulous weeds leapt into sight and then the flower sailed into deep water and up leapt the two arches of a bridge It ll strike they cried no it won t it s chosen the left and one arch became a fairy tunnel dropping diamonds Then it vanished for Rickie but Stephen who knelt in the water declared that it was still afloat far through the arch burning as if it would burn forever XXXIV The carriage that missus Failing had sent to meet her nephew returned from Cadchurch station empty She was preparing for a solitary dinner when he somehow arrived full of apologies but more sedate than she had expected She cut his explanations short Never mind how you got here You are here and I am quite pleased to see you He changed his clothes and they proceeded to the dining room There was a bright fire but the curtains were not drawn mister Failing had believed that windows with the night behind are more beautiful than any pictures and his widow had kept to the custom It was brave of her to persevere lumps of chalk having come out of the night last June For some obscure reason not so obscure to Rickie she had preserved them as mementoes of an episode Seeing them in a row on the mantelpiece he expected that their first topic would be Stephen But they never mentioned him though he was latent in all that they said It was of mister Failing that they spoke The Essays had been a success She was really pleased The book was brought in at her request and between the courses she read it aloud to her nephew in her soft yet unsympathetic voice Then she sent for the press notices after all no one despises them and read their comments on her introduction She wielded a graceful pen was apt adequate suggestive indispensable unnecessary So the meal passed pleasantly away for no one could so well combine the formal with the unconventional and it only seemed charming when papers littered her stately table My man wrote very nicely she observed Now you read me something out of him that you like Read The True Patriot He took the book and found Let us love one another Let our children physical and spiritual love one another It is all that we can do Perhaps the earth will neglect our love Perhaps she will confirm it and suffer some rallying point spire mound for the new generations to cherish He wrote that when he was young Later on he doubted whether we had better love one another or whether the earth will confirm anything He died a most unhappy man He could not help saying Not knowing that the earth had confirmed him Has she It is quite possible We meet so seldom in these days she and I Do you see much of the earth A little Do you expect that she will confirm you It is quite possible Beware of her Rickie I think I think not Beware of her surely Going back to her really is going back throwing away the artificiality which though you young people won t confess it is the only good thing in life Don t pretend you are simple Once I pretended Don t pretend that you care for anything but for clever talk such as this and for books The talk said Leighton afterwards certainly was clever But it meant something all the same He heard no more for his mistress told him to retire And my nephew this being so make up your quarrel with your wife She stretched out her hand to him with real feeling It is easier now than it will be later Poor lady she has written to me foolishly and often but on the whole I side with her against you She would grant you all that you fought for all the people all the theories I have it in her writing that she will never interfere with your life again She cannot help interfering said Rickie with his eyes on the black windows She despises me Besides I do not love her I know my dear Nor she you I am not being sentimental I say once more beware of the earth We are conventional people and conventions if you will but see it are majestic in their way and will claim us in the end We do not live for great passions or for great memories or for anything great He threw up his head We do Now listen to me I am serious and friendly tonight as you must have observed I have asked you here partly to amuse myself you belong to my March Past but also to give you good advice There has been a volcano a phenomenon which I too once greatly admired The eruption is over Let the conventions do their work now and clear the rubbish away My age is fifty nine and I tell you solemnly that the important things in life are little things and that people are not important at all Go back to your wife He looked at her and was filled with pity He knew that he would never be frightened of her again Only because she was serious and friendly did he trouble himself to reply There is one little fact I should like to tell you as confuting your theory The idea of a story a long story had been in my head for a year As a dream to amuse myself the kind of amusement you would recommend for the future I should have had time to write it but the people round me coloured my life and so it never seemed worth while For the story is not likely to pay Then came the volcano A few days after it was over I lay in bed looking out upon a world of rubbish Two men I know one intellectual the other very much the reverse burst into the room They said What happened to your short stories They weren t good but where are they Why have you stopped writing Why haven t you been to Italy You must write You must go Because to write to go is you Well I have written and yesterday we sent the long story out on its rounds The men do not like it for different reasons But it mattered very much to them that I should write it and so it got written As I told you this is only one fact other facts I trust have happened in the last five months But I mention it to prove that people are important and therefore however much it inconveniences my wife I will not go back to her And Italy asked missus Failing This question he avoided Italy must wait Now that he had the time he had not the money Or what is the long story about then About a man and a woman who meet and are happy Somewhat of a tour de force I conclude He frowned In literature we needn t intrude our own limitations I m not so silly as to think that all marriages turn out like mine My character is to blame for our catastrophe not marriage My dear I too have married marriage is to blame But here again he seemed to know better Well she said leaving the table and moving with her dessert to the mantelpiece so you are abandoning marriage and taking to literature And are happy Yes Because as we used to say at Cambridge the cow is there The world is real again This is a room that a window outside is the night Go on He pointed to the floor The day is straight below shining through other windows into other rooms You are very odd she said after a pause and I do not like you at all There you sit eating my biscuits and all the time you know that the earth is round Who taught you I am going to bed now and all the night you tell me you and I and the biscuits go plunging eastwards until we reach the sun But breakfast will be at nine as usual Good night She rang the bell twice and her maid came with her candle and her walking stick it was her habit of late to go to her room as soon as dinner was over for she had no one to sit up with Rickie was impressed by her loneliness and also by the mixture in her of insight and obtuseness She was so quick so clear headed so imaginative even But all the same she had forgotten what people were like Finding life dull she had dropped lies into it as a chemist drops a new element into a solution hoping that life would thereby sparkle or turn some beautiful colour She loved to mislead others and in the end her private view of false and true was obscured and she misled herself How she must have enjoyed their errors over Stephen But her own error had been greater inasmuch as it was spiritual entirely Leighton came in with some coffee Feeling it unnecessary to light the drawing room lamp for one small young man he persuaded Rickie to say he preferred the dining room So Rickie sat down by the fire playing with one of the lumps of chalk His thoughts went back to the ford from which they had scarcely wandered Still he heard the horse in the dark drinking still he saw the mystic rose and the tunnel dropping diamonds He had driven away alone believing the earth had confirmed him He stood behind things at last and knew that conventions are not majestic and that they will not claim us in the end As he mused the chalk slipped from his fingers and fell on the coffee cup which broke The china said Leighton was expensive He believed it was impossible to match it now Each cup was different It was a harlequin set The saucer without the cup was therefore useless Would mister Elliot please explain to missus Failing how it happened Rickie promised he would explain He had left Stephen preparing to bathe and had heard him working up stream like an animal splashing in the shallows breathing heavily as he swam the pools at times reeds snapped or clods of earth were pulled in By the fire he remembered it was again November Should you like a walk he asked Leighton and told him who stopped in the village tonight Leighton was pleased At nine o clock the two young men left the house under a sky that was still only bright in the zenith It will rain tomorrow Leighton said My brother says fine tomorrow Fine tomorrow Leighton echoed Now which do you mean asked Rickie laughing Since the plumes of the fir trees touched over the drive only a very little light penetrated It was clearer outside the lodge gate and bubbles of air which Wiltshire seemed to have travelled from an immense distance broke gently and separately on his face They paused on the bridge He asked whether the little fish and the bright green weeds were here now as well as in the summer The footman had not noticed Over the bridge they came to the cross roads of which one led to Salisbury and the other up through the string of villages to the railway station The road in front was only the Roman road the one that went on to the downs Turning to the left they were in Cadford He will be with the Thompsons said Rickie looking up at dark eaves Perhaps he s in bed already Perhaps he will be at The Antelope No Tonight he is with the Thompsons With the Thompsons After a dozen paces he said The Thompsons have gone away Where Why They were turned out by mister Wilbraham on account of our broken windows Are you sure Five families were turned out That s bad for Stephen said Rickie after a pause He was looking forward oh it s monstrous in any case But the Thompsons have gone to London said Leighton Why that family they say it s been in the valley hundreds of years and never got beyond shepherding To various parts of London Let us try The Antelope then Let us try The Antelope The inn lay up in the village Rickie hastened his pace This tyranny was monstrous Some men of the age of undergraduates had broken windows and therefore they and their families were to be ruined The fools who govern us find it easier to be severe It saves them trouble to say The innocent must suffer with the guilty It even gives them a thrill of pride Against all this wicked nonsense against the Wilbrahams and Pembrokes who try to rule our world Stephen would fight till he died Stephen was a hero He was a law to himself and rightly He was great enough to despise our small moralities He was attaining love This evening Rickie caught Ansell s enthusiasm and felt it worth while to sacrifice everything for such a man The Antelope said Leighton Those lights under the greatest elm Would you please ask if he s there and if he d come for a turn with me I don t think I ll go in Leighton opened the door They saw a little room blue with tobacco smoke Flanking the fire were deep settles hiding all but the legs of the men who lounged in them Between the settles stood a table covered with mugs and glasses The scene was picturesque fairer than the cutglass palaces of the town Oh yes he s there he called and after a moment s hesitation came out Would he come No I shouldn t say so replied Leighton with a furtive glance He knew that Rickie was a milksop First night you know sir among old friends Yes I know said Rickie But he might like a turn down the village It looks stuffy inside there and poor fun probably to watch others drinking Leighton shut the door What was that he called after you Oh nothing A man when he s drunk he says the worst he s ever heard At least so they say A man when he s drunk Yes Sir But Stephen isn t drinking No no He couldn t be If he broke a promise I don t pretend he s a saint I don t want him one But it isn t in him to break a promise Yes sir I understand In the train he promised me not to drink nothing theatrical just a promise for these few days No sir No sir stamped Rickie Yes no yes Can t you speak out Is he drunk or isn t he Leighton justly exasperated cried He can t stand and I ve told you so again and again Stephen shouted Rickie darting up the steps Heat and the smell of beer awaited him and he spoke more furiously than he had intended Is there any one here who s sober he cried The landlord looked over the bar angrily and asked him what he meant He pointed to the deep settles Inside there he s drunk Tell him he s broken his word and I will not go with him to the Rings Very well You won t go with him to the Rings said the landlord stepping forward and slamming the door in his face In the room he was only angry but out in the cool air he remembered that Stephen was a law to himself He had chosen to break his word and would break it again Nothing else bound him To yield to temptation is not fatal for most of us But it was the end of everything for a hero He s suddenly ruined he cried not yet remembering himself For a little he stood by the elm tree clutching the ridges of its bark Even so would he wrestle tomorrow and Stephen imperturbable reply My body is my own Or worse still he might wrestle with a pliant Stephen who promised him glibly again While he prayed for a miracle to convert his brother it struck him that he must pray for himself For he too was ruined Why what s the matter asked Leighton Stephen s only being with friends mister Elliot sir don t break down Nothing s happened bad No one s died yet or even hurt themselves Ever kind he took hold of Rickie s arm and pitying such a nervous fellow set out with him for home The shoulders of Orion rose behind them over the topmost boughs of the elm From the bridge the whole constellation was visible and Rickie said May God receive me and pardon me for trusting the earth But mister Elliot what have you done that s wrong Gone bankrupt Leighton for the second time Pretended again that people were real May God have mercy on me Leighton dropped his arm Though he did not understand a chill of disgust passed over him and he said I will go back to The Antelope I will help them put Stephen to bed Do I will wait for you here Then he leant against the parapet and prayed passionately for he knew that the conventions would claim him soon God was beyond them but ah how far beyond and to be reached after what degradation At the end of this childish detour his wife awaited him not less surely because she was only his wife in name He was too weak Books and friends were not enough Little by little she would claim him and corrupt him and make him what he had been and the woman he loved would die out in drunkenness in debauchery and her strength would be dissipated by a man her beauty defiled in a man She would not continue That mystic rose and the face it illumined meant nothing The stream he was above it now meant nothing though it burst from the pure turf and ran for ever to the sea The bather the shoulders of Orion they all meant nothing and were going nowhere The whole affair was a ridiculous dream Leighton returned saying Haven t you seen Stephen They say he followed us he can still walk I told you he wasn t so bad I don t think he passed me Ought one to look He wandered a little along the Roman road Again nothing mattered At the level crossing he leant on the gate to watch a slow goods train pass In the glare of the engine he saw that his brother had come this way perhaps through some sodden memory of the Rings and now lay drunk over the rails Wearily he did a man s duty There was time to raise him up and push him into safety It is also a man s duty to save his own life and therefore he tried The train went over his knees He died up in Cadover whispering You have been right to missus Failing She wrote of him to missus Lewin afterwards as one who has failed in all he undertook one of the thousands whose dust returns to the dust accomplishing nothing in the interval Agnes and I buried him to the sound of our cracked bell and pretended that he had once been alive The other who was always honest kept away XXXV From the window they looked over a sober valley whose sides were not too sloping to be ploughed and whose trend was followed by a grass grown track It was late on Sunday afternoon and the valley was deserted except for one labourer who was coasting slowly downward on a rosy bicycle The air was very quiet A jay screamed up in the woods behind but the ring doves who roost early were already silent Since the window opened westward the room was flooded with light and Stephen finding it hot was working in his shirtsleeves You guarantee they ll sell he asked with a pen between his teeth He was tidying up a pile of manuscripts I guarantee that the world will be the gainer said mister Pembroke now a clergyman who sat beside him at the table with an expression of refined disapproval on his face I d got the idea that the long story had its points but that these shorter things didn t what s the word Convince is probably the word you want But that type of criticism is quite a thing of the past Have you seen the illustrated American edition I don t remember Might I send you a copy I think you ought to possess one Thank you His eye wandered The bicycle had disappeared into some trees and thither through a cloudless sky the sun was also descending Is all quite plain said mister Pembroke Submit these ten stories to the magazines and make your own terms with the editors Then I have your word for it you will join forces with me and the four stories in my possession together with yours should make up a volume which we might well call Pan Pipes Are you sure Pan Pipes haven t been used up already mister Pembroke clenched his teeth He had been bearing with this sort of thing for nearly an hour If that is the case we can select another A title is easy to come by But that is the idea it must suggest The stories as I have twice explained to you all centre round a Nature theme Pan being the god of I know that said Stephen impatiently Being the god of All right Let s get furrard I ve learnt that It was years since the schoolmaster had been interrupted and he could not stand it Very well he said I bow to your superior knowledge of the classics Let us proceed Oh yes the introduction There must be one It was the introduction with all those wrong details that sold the other book You overwhelm me I never penned the memoir with that intention If you won t do one missus Keynes must My sister leads a busy life I could not ask her I will do it myself since you insist And the binding The binding said mister Pembroke coldly must really be left to the discretion of the publisher We cannot be concerned with such details Our task is purely literary His attention wandered He began to fidget and finally bent down and looked under the table What have we here he asked Stephen looked also and for a moment they smiled at each other over the prostrate figure of a child who was cuddling mister Pembroke s boots She s after the blacking he explained If we left her there she d lick them brown Indeed Is that so very safe It never did me any harm Come up Your tongue s dirty Can I She was understood to ask whether she could clean her tongue on a lollie No no said mister Pembroke Lollipops don t clean little girls tongues Yes they do he retorted But she won t get one He lifted her on his knee and rasped her tongue with his handkerchief Dear little thing said the visitor perfunctorily The child began to squall and kicked her father in the stomach Stephen regarded her quietly You tried to hurt me he said Hurting doesn t count Trying to hurt counts Go and clean your tongue yourself Get off my knee Tears of another sort came into her eyes but she obeyed him How s the great Bertie he asked Thank you My nephew is perfectly well How came you to hear of his existence Through the Silts of course It isn t five miles to Cadover mister Pembroke raised his eyes mournfully I cannot conceive how the poor Silts go on in that great house Whatever she intended it could not have been that The house the farm the money everything down to the personal articles that belong to mister Failing and should have reverted to his family It s legal Interstate succession I do not dispute it But it is a lesson to one to make a will missus Keynes and myself were electrified They ll do there They offered me the agency but He looked down the cultivated slopes His manners were growing rough for he saw few gentlemen now and he was either incoherent or else alarmingly direct However if Lawrie Silt s a Cockney like his father and if my next is a boy and like me A shy beautiful look came into his eyes and passed unnoticed They ll do he repeated They turned out Wilbraham and built new cottages and bridged the railway and made other necessary alterations There was a moment s silence mister Pembroke took out his watch I wonder if I might have the trap I mustn t miss my train must I It is good of you to have granted me an interview It is all quite plain Yes A case of half and half division of profits Half and half said the young farmer slowly What do you take me for Half and half when I provide ten of the stories and you only four I I stammered mister Pembroke I consider you did me over the long story and I m damned if you do me over the short ones Hush if you please hush if only for your little girl s sake He lifted a clerical palm You did me his voice drove and all the thirty nine Articles won t stop me saying so That long story was meant to be mine I got it written You ve done me out of every penny it fetched It s dedicated to me flat out and you even crossed out the dedication and tidied me out of the introduction Listen to me Pembroke You ve done people all your life I think without knowing it but that won t comfort us A wretched devil at your school once wrote to me and he d been done Sham food sham religion sham straight talks and when he broke down you said it was the world in miniature He snatched at him roughly But I ll show you the world He twisted him round like a baby and through the open door they saw only the quiet valley but in it a rivulet that would in time bring its waters to the sea Look even at that and up behind where the Plain begins and you get on the solid chalk think of us riding some night when you re ordering your hot bottle that s the world and there s no miniature world There s one world Pembroke and you can t tidy men out of it They answer you back do you hear they answer back if you do them If you tell a man this way that four sheep equal ten he answers back you re a liar mister Pembroke was speechless and such is human nature he chiefly resented the allusion to the hot bottle an unmanly luxury in which he never indulged contenting himself with nightsocks Enough there is no witness present as you have doubtless observed But there was For a little voice cried Oh mummy they re fighting such fun and feet went pattering up the stairs Enough You talk of doing but what about the money out of which you did my sister What about this picture he pointed to a faded photograph of Stockholm which you caused to be filched from the walls of my house What about enough Let us conclude this disheartening scene You object to my terms Name yours I shall accept them It is futile to reason with one who is the worse for drink Stephen was quiet at once Steady on he said gently Steady on in that direction Take one third for your four stories and the introduction and I will keep two thirds for myself Then he went to harness the horse while mister Pembroke watching his broad back desired to bury a knife in it The desire passed partly because it was unclerical partly because he had no knife and partly because he soon blurred over what had happened To him all criticism was rudeness he never heeded it for he never needed it he was never wrong All his life he had ordered little human beings about and now he was equally magisterial to big ones Stephen was a fifth form lout whom owing to some flaw in the regulations he could not send up to the headmaster to be caned This attitude makes for tranquillity Before long he felt merely an injured martyr His brain cleared He stood deep in thought before the only other picture that the bare room boasted the Demeter of Cnidus Outside the sun was sinking and its last rays fell upon the immortal features and the shattered knees Sweet peas offered their fragrance and with it there entered those more mysterious scents that come from no one flower or clod of earth but from the whole bosom of evening He tried not to be cynical But in his heart he could not regret that tragedy already half forgotten conventionalized indistinct Of course death is a terrible thing Yet death is merciful when it weeds out a failure If we look deep enough it is all for the best He stared at the picture and nodded Stephen who had met his visitor at the station had intended to drive him back there But after their spurt of temper he sent him with the boy He remained in the doorway glad that he was going to make money glad that he had been angry while the glow of the clear sky deepened and the silence was perfected and the scents of the night grew stronger Old vagrancies awoke and he resolved that dearly as he loved his house he would not enter it again till dawn Goodnight he called and then the child came running and he whispered Quick then Bring me a rug Good night he repeated and a pleasant voice called through an upper window Why good night He did not answer until the child was wrapped up in his arms It is time that she learnt to sleep out he cried If you want me we re out on the hillside where I used to be The voice protested saying this and that Stewart s in the house said the man and it cannot matter and I am going anyway Stephen I wish you wouldn t I wish you wouldn t take her Promise you won t say foolish things to her Don t I wish you d come up for a minute The child whose face was laid against his felt the muscles in it harden Don t tell her foolish things about yourself things that aren t any longer true Don t worry her with old dead dreadfulness To please me don t Just tonight I won t then Stevie dear please me more don t take her with you At this he laughed impertinently I suppose I m being kept in line she called and though he could not see her she stretched her arms towards him For a time he stood motionless under her window musing on his happy tangible life Then his breath quickened and he wondered why he was here and why he should hold a warm child in his arms It s time we were starting he whispered and showed the sky whose orange was already fading into green Wish everything goodnight Good night dear mummy she said sleepily Goodnight dear house Good night you pictures long picture stone lady I see you through the window your faces are pink The twilight descended He rested his lips on her hair and carried her without speaking until he reached the open down He had often slept here himself alone and on his wedding night and he knew that the turf was dry and that if you laid your face to it you would smell the thyme For a moment the earth aroused her and she began to chatter My prayers she said anxiously He gave her one hand and she was asleep before her fingers had nestled in its palm Their touch made him pensive and again he marvelled why he the accident was here He was alive and had created life By whose authority Though he could not phrase it he believed that he guided the future of our race and that century after century his thoughts and his passions would triumph in England The dead who had evoked him the unborn whom he would evoke he governed the paths between them By whose authority Out in the west lay Cadover and the fields of his earlier youth and over them descended the crescent moon His eyes followed her decline and against her final radiance he saw or thought he saw the outline of the Rings He had always been grateful as people who understood him knew But this evening his gratitude seemed a gift of small account The ear was deaf and what thanks of his could reach it The body was dust and in what ecstasy of his could it share The spirit had fled in agony and loneliness never to know that it bequeathed him salvation He filled his pipe and then sat pressing the unlit tobacco with his thumb What am I to do he thought Can he notice the things he gave me A parson would know But what s a man like me to do who works all his life out of doors As he wondered the silence of the night was broken The whistle of mister Pembroke s train came faintly and a lurid spot passed over the land passed and the silence returned One thing remained that a man of his sort might do He bent down reverently and saluted the child to whom he had given the name of their mother End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The
