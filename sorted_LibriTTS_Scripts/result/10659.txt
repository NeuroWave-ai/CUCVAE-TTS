Adventures Contents Case I Secret Worship Case II The Camp of the Dog Case III A Victim of Higher Space CASE I SECRET WORSHIP Harris the silk merchant was in South Germany on his way home from a business trip when the idea came to him suddenly that he would take the mountain railway from Strassbourg and run down to revisit his old school after an interval of something more than thirty years And it was to this chance impulse of the junior partner in Harris Brothers of saint Paul s Churchyard that John Silence owed one of the most curious cases of his whole experience for at that very moment he happened to be tramping these same mountains with a holiday knapsack and from different points of the compass the two men were actually converging towards the same inn Now deep down in the heart that for thirty years had been concerned chiefly with the profitable buying and selling of silk this school had left the imprint of its peculiar influence and though perhaps unknown to Harris had strongly coloured the whole of his subsequent existence It belonged to the deeply religious life of a small Protestant community which it is unnecessary to specify and his father had sent him there at the age of fifteen partly because he would learn the German requisite for the conduct of the silk business and partly because the discipline was strict and discipline was what his soul and body needed just then more than anything else The life indeed had proved exceedingly severe and young Harris benefited accordingly for though corporal punishment was unknown there was a system of mental and spiritual correction which somehow made the soul stand proudly erect to receive it while it struck at the very root of the fault and taught the boy that his character was being cleaned and strengthened and that he was not merely being tortured in a kind of personal revenge That was over thirty years ago when he was a dreamy and impressionable youth of fifteen and now as the train climbed slowly up the winding mountain gorges his mind travelled back somewhat lovingly over the intervening period and forgotten details rose vividly again before him out of the shadows The life there had been very wonderful it seemed to him in that remote mountain village protected from the tumults of the world by the love and worship of the devout Brotherhood that ministered to the needs of some hundred boys from every country in Europe Sharply the scenes came back to him He smelt again the long stone corridors the hot pinewood rooms where the sultry hours of summer study were passed with bees droning through open windows in the sunshine and German characters struggling in the mind with dreams of English lawns and then the sudden awful cry of the master in German Harris stand up You sleep And he recalled the dreadful standing motionless for an hour book in hand while the knees felt like wax and the head grew heavier than a cannon ball The very smell of the cooking came back to him the daily Sauerkraut the watery chocolate on Sundays the flavour of the stringy meat served twice a week at Mittagessen and he smiled to think again of the half rations that was the punishment for speaking English The very odour of the milk bowls the hot sweet aroma that rose from the soaking peasant bread at the six o clock breakfast came back to him pungently and he saw the huge Speisesaal with the hundred boys in their school uniform all eating sleepily in silence gulping down the coarse bread and scalding milk in terror of the bell that would presently cut them short and at the far end where the masters sat he saw the narrow slit windows with the vistas of enticing field and forest beyond And this in turn made him think of the great barnlike room on the top floor where all slept together in wooden cots and he heard in memory the clamour of the cruel bell that woke them on winter mornings at five o clock and summoned them to the stone flagged Waschkammer where boys and masters alike after scanty and icy washing dressed in complete silence From this his mind passed swiftly with vivid picture thoughts to other things and with a passing shiver he remembered how the loneliness of never being alone had eaten into him and how everything work meals sleep walks leisure was done with his division of twenty other boys and under the eyes of at least two masters The only solitude possible was by asking for half an hour s practice in the cell like music rooms and Harris smiled to himself as he recalled the zeal of his violin studies Then as the train puffed laboriously through the great pine forests that cover these mountains with a giant carpet of velvet he found the pleasanter layers of memory giving up their dead and he recalled with admiration the kindness of the masters whom all addressed as Brother and marvelled afresh at their devotion in burying themselves for years in such a place only to leave it in most cases for the still rougher life of missionaries in the wild places of the world He thought once more of the still religious atmosphere that hung over the little forest community like a veil barring the distressful world of the picturesque ceremonies at Easter Christmas and New Year of the numerous feast days and charming little festivals The Beschehr Fest in particular came back to him the feast of gifts at Christmas when the entire community paired off and gave presents many of which had taken weeks to make or the savings of many days to purchase And then he saw the midnight ceremony in the church at New Year with the shining face of the Prediger in the pulpit the village preacher who on the last night of the old year saw in the empty gallery beyond the organ loft the faces of all who were to die in the ensuing twelve months and who at last recognised himself among them and in the very middle of his sermon passed into a state of rapt ecstasy and burst into a torrent of praise Thickly the memories crowded upon him The picture of the small village dreaming its unselfish life on the mountain tops clean wholesome simple searching vigorously for its God and training hundreds of boys in the grand way rose up in his mind with all the power of an obsession He felt once more the old mystical enthusiasm deeper than the sea and more wonderful than the stars he heard again the winds sighing from leagues of forest over the red roofs in the moonlight he heard the Brothers voices talking of the things beyond this life as though they had actually experienced them in the body and as he sat in the jolting train a spirit of unutterable longing passed over his seared and tired soul stirring in the depths of him a sea of emotions that he thought had long since frozen into immobility And the contrast pained him the idealistic dreamer then the man of business now so that a spirit of unworldly peace and beauty known only to the soul in meditation laid its feathered finger upon his heart moving strangely the surface of the waters Harris shivered a little and looked out of the window of his empty carriage The train had long passed Hornberg and far below the streams tumbled in white foam down the limestone rocks In front of him dome upon dome of wooded mountain stood against the sky It was October and the air was cool and sharp woodsmoke and damp moss exquisitely mingled in it with the subtle odours of the pines Overhead between the tips of the highest firs he saw the first stars peeping and the sky was a clean pale amethyst that seemed exactly the colour all these memories clothed themselves with in his mind He leaned back in his corner and sighed He was a heavy man and he had not known sentiment for years he was a big man and it took much to move him literally and figuratively he was a man in whom the dreams of God that haunt the soul in youth though overlaid by the scum that gathers in the fight for money had not as with the majority utterly died the death He came back into this little neglected pocket of the years where so much fine gold had collected and lain undisturbed with all his semispiritual emotions aquiver and as he watched the mountain tops come nearer and smelt the forgotten odours of his boyhood something melted on the surface of his soul and left him sensitive to a degree he had not known since thirty years before he had lived here with his dreams his conflicts and his youthful suffering A thrill ran through him as the train stopped with a jolt at a tiny station and he saw the name in large black lettering on the grey stone building and below it the number of metres it stood above the level of the sea The highest point on the line he exclaimed How well I remember it Sommerau Summer Meadow The very next station is mine And as the train ran downhill with brakes on and steam shut off he put his head out of the window and one by one saw the old familiar landmarks in the dusk They stared at him like dead faces in a dream Queer sharp feelings half poignant half sweet stirred in his heart There s the hot white road we walked along so often with the two Brueder always at our heels he thought and there by Jove is the turn through the forest to Die Galgen the stone gallows where they hanged the witches in olden days He smiled a little as the train slid past And there s the copse where the Lilies of the Valley powdered the ground in spring and I swear he put his head out with a sudden impulse if that s not the very clearing where Calame the French boy chased the swallow tail with me and Bruder Pagel gave us half rations for leaving the road without permission and for shouting in our mother tongues And he laughed again as the memories came back with a rush flooding his mind with vivid detail The train stopped and he stood on the grey gravel platform like a man in a dream It seemed half a century since he last waited there with corded wooden boxes and got into the train for Strassbourg and home after the two years exile Time dropped from him like an old garment and he felt a boy again Only things looked so much smaller than his memory of them shrunk and dwindled they looked and the distances seemed on a curiously smaller scale He made his way across the road to the little Gasthaus and as he went faces and figures of former schoolfellows German Swiss Italian French Russian slipped out of the shadowy woods and silently accompanied him They flitted by his side raising their eyes questioningly sadly to his But their names he had forgotten Some of the Brothers too came with them and most of these he remembered by name Bruder Roest Bruder Pagel Bruder Schliemann and the bearded face of the old preacher who had seen himself in the haunted gallery of those about to die Bruder Gysin The dark forest lay all about him like a sea that any moment might rush with velvet waves upon the scene and sweep all the faces away The air was cool and wonderfully fragrant but with every perfumed breath came also a pallid memory Yet in spite of the underlying sadness inseparable from such an experience it was all very interesting and held a pleasure peculiarly its own so that Harris engaged his room and ordered supper feeling well pleased with himself and intending to walk up to the old school that very evening It stood in the centre of the community s village some four miles distant through the forest and he now recollected for the first time that this little Protestant settlement dwelt isolated in a section of the country that was otherwise Catholic Crucifixes and shrines surrounded the clearing like the sentries of a beleaguering army Once beyond the square of the village with its few acres of field and orchard the forest crowded up in solid phalanxes and beyond the rim of trees began the country that was ruled by the priests of another faith He vaguely remembered too that the Catholics had showed sometimes a certain hostility towards the little Protestant oasis that flourished so quietly and benignly in their midst He had quite forgotten this How trumpery it all seemed now with his wide experience of life and his knowledge of other countries and the great outside world It was like stepping back not thirty years but three hundred There were only two others besides himself at supper One of them a bearded middle aged man in tweeds sat by himself at the far end and Harris kept out of his way because he was English He feared he might be in business possibly even in the silk business and that he would perhaps talk on the subject The other traveller however was a Catholic priest He was a little man who ate his salad with a knife yet so gently that it was almost inoffensive and it was the sight of the cloth that recalled his memory of the old antagonism Harris mentioned by way of conversation the object of his sentimental journey and the priest looked up sharply at him with raised eyebrows and an expression of surprise and suspicion that somehow piqued him He ascribed it to his difference of belief Yes went on the silk merchant pleased to talk of what his mind was so full and it was a curious experience for an English boy to be dropped down into a school of a hundred foreigners I well remember the loneliness and intolerable Heimweh of it at first His German was very fluent The priest opposite looked up from his cold veal and potato salad and smiled It was a nice face He explained quietly that he did not belong here but was making a tour of the parishes of Wurttemberg and Baden It was a strict life added Harris We English I remember used to call it Gefaengnisleben prison life The face of the other for some unaccountable reason darkened After a slight pause and more by way of politeness than because he wished to continue the subject he said quietly It was a flourishing school in those days of course Afterwards I have heard He shrugged his shoulders slightly and the odd look it almost seemed a look of alarm came back into his eyes The sentence remained unfinished Something in the tone of the man seemed to his listener uncalled for in a sense reproachful singular Harris bridled in spite of himself It has changed he asked I can hardly believe You have not heard then observed the priest gently making a gesture as though to cross himself yet not actually completing it You have not heard what happened there before it was abandoned It was very childish of course and perhaps he was overtired and overwrought in some way but the words and manner of the little priest seemed to him so offensive so disproportionately offensive that he hardly noticed the concluding sentence He recalled the old bitterness and the old antagonism and for a moment he almost lost his temper Nonsense he interrupted with a forced laugh Unsinn You must forgive me sir for contradicting you But I was a pupil there myself I was at school there There was no place like it I cannot believe that anything serious could have happened to to take away its character The devotion of the Brothers would be difficult to equal anywhere He broke off suddenly realising that his voice had been raised unduly and that the man at the far end of the table might understand German and at the same moment he looked up and saw that this individual s eyes were fixed upon his face intently They were peculiarly bright Also they were rather wonderful eyes and the way they met his own served in some way he could not understand to convey both a reproach and a warning The whole face of the stranger indeed made a vivid impression upon him for it was a face he now noticed for the first time in whose presence one would not willingly have said or done anything unworthy Harris could not explain to himself how it was he had not become conscious sooner of its presence But he could have bitten off his tongue for having so far forgotten himself The little priest lapsed into silence Only once he said looking up and speaking in a low voice that was not intended to be overheard but that evidently was overheard You will find it different Presently he rose and left the table with a polite bow that included both the others And after him from the far end rose also the figure in the tweed suit leaving Harris by himself He sat on for a bit in the darkening room sipping his coffee and smoking his fifteen pfennig cigar till the girl came in to light the oil lamps He felt vexed with himself for his lapse from

none	none	manners yet hardly able to account for it Most likely he reflected he had been annoyed because the priest had unintentionally changed the pleasant character of his dream by introducing a jarring note Later he must seek an opportunity to make amends At present however he was too impatient for his walk to the school and he took his stick and hat and passed out into the open air And as he crossed before the Gasthaus he noticed that the priest and the man in the tweed suit were engaged already in such deep conversation that they hardly noticed him as he passed and raised his hat He started off briskly well remembering the way and hoping to reach the village in time to have a word with one of the Brueder They might even ask him in for a cup of coffee He felt sure of his welcome and the old memories were in full possession once more The hour of return was a matter of no consequence whatever It was then just after seven o clock and the October evening was drawing in with chill airs from the recesses of the forest The road plunged straight from the railway clearing into its depths and in a very few minutes the trees engulfed him and the clack of his boots fell dead and echoless against the serried stems of a million firs It was very black one trunk was hardly distinguishable from another He walked smartly swinging his holly stick Once or twice he passed a peasant on his way to bed and the guttural Gruss Got unheard for so long emphasised the passage of time while yet making it seem as nothing A fresh group of pictures crowded his mind Again the figures of former schoolfellows flitted out of the forest and kept pace by his side whispering of the doings of long ago One reverie stepped hard upon the heels of another Every turn in the road every clearing of the forest he knew and each in turn brought forgotten associations to life He enjoyed himself thoroughly He marched on and on There was powdered gold in the sky till the moon rose and then a wind of faint silver spread silently between the earth and stars He saw the tips of the fir trees shimmer and heard them whisper as the breeze turned their needles towards the light The mountain air was indescribably sweet The road shone like the foam of a river through the gloom White moths flitted here and there like silent thoughts across his path and a hundred smells greeted him from the forest caverns across the years Then when he least expected it the trees fell away abruptly on both sides and he stood on the edge of the village clearing He walked faster There lay the familiar outlines of the houses sheeted with silver there stood the trees in the little central square with the fountain and small green lawns there loomed the shape of the church next to the Gasthof der Bruedergemeinde and just beyond dimly rising into the sky he saw with a sudden thrill the mass of the huge school building blocked castlelike with deep shadows in the moonlight standing square and formidable to face him after the silences of more than a quarter of a century He passed quickly down the deserted village street and stopped close beneath its shadow staring up at the walls that had once held him prisoner for two years two unbroken years of discipline and homesickness Memories and emotions surged through his mind for the most vivid sensations of his youth had focused about this spot and it was here he had first begun to live and learn values Not a single footstep broke the silence though lights glimmered here and there through cottage windows but when he looked up at the high walls of the school draped now in shadow he easily imagined that well known faces crowded to the windows to greet him closed windows that really reflected only moonlight and the gleam of stars This then was the old school building standing foursquare to the world with its shuttered windows its lofty tiled roof and the spiked lightning conductors pointing like black and taloned fingers from the corners For a long time he stood and stared Then presently he came to himself again and realised to his joy that a light still shone in the windows of the Bruderstube He turned from the road and passed through the iron railings then climbed the twelve stone steps and stood facing the black wooden door with the heavy bars of iron a door he had once loathed and dreaded with the hatred and passion of an imprisoned soul but now looked upon tenderly with a sort of boyish delight Almost timorously he pulled the rope and listened with a tremor of excitement to the clanging of the bell deep within the building And the long forgotten sound brought the past before him with such a vivid sense of reality that he positively shivered It was like the magic bell in the fairy tale that rolls back the curtain of Time and summons the figures from the shadows of the dead He had never felt so sentimental in his life It was like being young again And at the same time he began to bulk rather large in his own eyes with a certain spurious importance He was a big man from the world of strife and action In this little place of peaceful dreams would he perhaps not cut something of a figure I ll try once more he thought after a long pause seizing the iron bell rope and was just about to pull it when a step sounded on the stone passage within and the huge door slowly swung open A tall man with a rather severe cast of countenance stood facing him in silence I must apologise it is somewhat late he began a trifle pompously but the fact is I am an old pupil I have only just arrived and really could not restrain myself His German seemed not quite so fluent as usual My interest is so great I was here in seventy The other opened the door wider and at once bowed him in with a smile of genuine welcome I am Bruder Kalkmann he said quietly in a deep voice I myself was a master here about that time It is a great pleasure always to welcome a former pupil He looked at him very keenly for a few seconds and then added I think too it is splendid of you to come very splendid It is a very great pleasure Harris replied delighted with his reception The dimly lighted corridor with its flooring of grey stone and the familiar sound of a German voice echoing through it with the peculiar intonation the Brothers always used in speaking all combined to lift him bodily as it were into the dream atmosphere of long forgotten days He stepped gladly into the building and the door shut with the familiar thunder that completed the reconstruction of the past He almost felt the old sense of imprisonment of aching nostalgia of having lost his liberty Harris sighed involuntarily and turned towards his host who returned his smile faintly and then led the way down the corridor The boys have retired he explained and as you remember we keep early hours here But at least you will join us for a little while in the Bruderstube and enjoy a cup of coffee This was precisely what the silk merchant had hoped and he accepted with an alacrity that he intended to be tempered by graciousness And to morrow continued the Bruder you must come and spend a whole day with us You may even find acquaintances for several pupils of your day have come back here as masters For one brief second there passed into the man s eyes a look that made the visitor start But it vanished as quickly as it came It was impossible to define Harris convinced himself it was the effect of a shadow cast by the lamp they had just passed on the wall He dismissed it from his mind You are very kind I m sure he said politely It is perhaps a greater pleasure to me than you can imagine to see the place again Ah he stopped short opposite a door with the upper half of glass and peered in surely there is one of the music rooms where I used to practise the violin How it comes back to me after all these years Bruder Kalkmann stopped indulgently smiling to allow his guest a moment s inspection You still have the boys orchestra I remember I used to play zweite Geige in it Bruder Schliemann conducted at the piano Dear me I can see him now with his long black hair and and He stopped abruptly Again the odd dark look passed over the stern face of his companion For an instant it seemed curiously familiar We still keep up the pupils orchestra he said but Bruder Schliemann I am sorry to say he hesitated an instant and then added Bruder Schliemann is dead Indeed indeed said Harris quickly I am sorry to hear it He was conscious of a faint feeling of distress but whether it arose from the news of his old music teacher s death or from something else he could not quite determine He gazed down the corridor that lost itself among shadows In the street and village everything had seemed so much smaller than he remembered but here inside the school building everything seemed so much bigger The corridor was loftier and longer more spacious and vast than the mental picture he had preserved His thoughts wandered dreamily for an instant He glanced up and saw the face of the Bruder watching him with a smile of patient indulgence Your memories possess you he observed gently and the stern look passed into something almost pitying You are right returned the man of silk they do This was the most wonderful period of my whole life in a sense At the time I hated it He hesitated not wishing to hurt the Brother s feelings According to English ideas it seemed strict of course the other said persuasively so that he went on Yes partly that and partly the ceaseless nostalgia and the solitude which came from never being really alone In English schools the boys enjoy peculiar freedom you know Bruder Kalkmann he saw was listening intently But it produced one result that I have never wholly lost he continued self consciously and am grateful for Ach Wie so denn The constant inner pain threw me headlong into your religious life so that the whole force of my being seemed to project itself towards the search for a deeper satisfaction a real resting place for the soul During my two years here I yearned for God in my boyish way as perhaps I have never yearned for anything since Moreover I have never quite lost that sense of peace and inward joy which accompanied the search I can never quite forget this school and the deep things it taught me He paused at the end of his long speech and a brief silence fell between them He feared he had said too much or expressed himself clumsily in the foreign language and when Bruder Kalkmann laid a hand upon his shoulder he gave a little involuntary start So that my memories perhaps do possess me rather strongly he added apologetically and this long corridor these rooms that barred and gloomy front door all touch chords that that His German failed him and he glanced at his companion with an explanatory smile and gesture But the Brother had removed the hand from his shoulder and was standing with his back to him looking down the passage Naturally naturally so he said hastily without turning round Es ist doch selbstverstaendlich We shall all understand Then he turned suddenly and Harris saw that his face had turned most oddly and disagreeably sinister It may only have been the shadows again playing their tricks with the wretched oil lamps on the wall for the dark expression passed instantly as they retraced their steps down the corridor but the Englishman somehow got the impression that he had said something to give offence something that was not quite to the other s taste Opposite the door of the Bruderstube they stopped Harris realised that it was late and he had possibly stayed talking too long He made a tentative effort to leave but his companion would not hear of it You must have a cup of coffee with us he said firmly as though he meant it and my colleagues will be delighted to see you Some of them will remember you perhaps The sound of voices came pleasantly through the door men s voices talking together Bruder Kalkmann turned the handle and they entered a room ablaze with light and full of people Ah but your name he whispered bending down to catch the reply you have not told me your name yet Harris said the Englishman quickly as they went in He felt nervous as he crossed the threshold but ascribed the momentary trepidation to the fact that he was breaking the strictest rule of the whole establishment which forbade a boy under severest penalties to come near this holy of holies where the masters took their brief leisure Ah yes of course Harris repeated the other as though he remembered it Come in Herr Harris come in please Your visit will be immensely appreciated It is really very fine very wonderful of you to have come in this way The door closed behind them and in the sudden light which made his sight swim for a moment the exaggeration of the language escaped his attention He heard the voice of Bruder Kalkmann introducing him He spoke very loud indeed unnecessarily absurdly loud Harris thought Brothers he announced it is my pleasure and privilege to introduce to you Herr Harris from England He has just arrived to make us a little visit and I have already expressed to him on behalf of us all the satisfaction we feel that he is here He was as you remember a pupil in the year seventy It was a very formal a very German introduction but Harris rather liked it It made him feel important and he appreciated the tact that made it almost seem as though he had been expected The black forms rose and bowed Harris bowed Kalkmann bowed Every one was very polite and very courtly The room swam with moving figures the light dazzled him after the gloom of the corridor there was thick cigar smoke in the atmosphere He took the chair that was offered to him between two of the Brothers and sat down feeling vaguely that his perceptions were not quite as keen and accurate as usual He felt a trifle dazed perhaps and the spell of the past came strongly over him confusing the immediate present and making everything dwindle oddly to the dimensions of long ago He seemed to pass under the mastery of a great mood that was a composite reproduction of all the moods of his forgotten boyhood Then he pulled himself together with a sharp effort and entered into the conversation that had begun again to buzz round him Moreover he entered into it with keen pleasure for the Brothers there were perhaps a dozen of them in the little room treated him with a charm of manner that speedily made him feel one of themselves This again was a very subtle delight to him He felt that he had stepped out of the greedy vulgar self seeking world the world of silk and markets and profit making stepped into the cleaner atmosphere where spiritual ideals were paramount and life was simple and devoted It all charmed him inexpressibly so that he realised yes in a sense the degradation of his twenty years absorption in business This keen atmosphere under the stars where men thought only of their souls and of the souls of others was too rarefied for the world he was now associated with He found himself making comparisons to his own disadvantage comparisons with the mystical little dreamer that had stepped thirty years before from the stern peace of this devout community and the man of the world that he had since become and the contrast made him shiver with a keen regret and something like self contempt He glanced round at the other faces floating towards him through tobacco smoke this acrid cigar smoke he remembered so well how keen they were how strong placid touched with the nobility of great aims and unselfish purposes At one or two he looked particularly He hardly knew why They rather fascinated him There was something so very stern and uncompromising about them and something too oddly subtly familiar that yet just eluded him But whenever their eyes met his own they held undeniable welcome in them and some held more a kind of perplexed admiration he thought something that was between esteem and deference This note of respect in all the faces was very flattering to his vanity Coffee was served presently made by a black haired Brother who sat in the corner by the piano and bore a marked resemblance to Bruder Schliemann the musical director of thirty years ago Harris exchanged bows with him when he took the cup from his white hands which he noticed were like the hands of a woman He lit a cigar offered to him by his neighbour with whom he was chatting delightfully and who in the glare of the lighted match reminded him sharply for a moment of Bruder Pagel his former room master Es ist wirklich merkwuerdig he said how many resemblances I see or imagine It is really very curious Yes replied the other peering at him over his coffee cup the spell of the place is wonderfully strong I can well understand that the old faces rise before your mind s eye almost to the exclusion of ourselves perhaps They both laughed presently It was soothing to find his mood understood and appreciated And they passed on to talk of the mountain village its isolation its remoteness from worldly life its peculiar fitness for meditation and worship and for spiritual development of a certain kind And your coming back in this way Herr Harris has pleased us all so much joined in the Bruder on his left We esteem you for it most highly We honour you for it Harris made a deprecating gesture I fear for my part it is only a very selfish pleasure he said a trifle unctuously Not all would have had the courage added the one who resembled Bruder Pagel You mean said Harris a little puzzled the disturbing memories Bruder Pagel looked at him steadily with unmistakable admiration and respect I mean that most men hold so strongly to life and can give up so little for their beliefs he said gravely The Englishman felt slightly uncomfortable These worthy men really made too much of his sentimental journey Besides the talk was getting a little out of his depth He hardly followed it The worldly life still has some charms for me he replied smilingly as though to indicate that sainthood was not yet quite within his grasp All the more then must we honour you for so freely coming said the Brother on his left so unconditionally A pause followed and the silk merchant felt relieved when the conversation took a more general turn although he noted that it never travelled very far from the subject of his visit and the wonderful situation of the lonely village for men who wished to develop their spiritual powers and practise the rites of a high worship Others joined in complimenting him on his knowledge of the language making him feel utterly at his ease yet at the same time a little uncomfortable by the excess of their admiration After all it was such a very small thing to do this sentimental journey The time passed along quickly the coffee was excellent the cigars soft and of the nutty flavour he loved At length fearing to outstay his welcome he rose reluctantly to take his leave But the others would not hear of it It was not often a former pupil returned to visit them in this simple unaffected way The night was young If necessary they could even find him a corner in the great Schlafzimmer upstairs He was easily persuaded to stay a little longer Somehow he had become the centre of the little party He felt pleased flattered honoured And perhaps Bruder Schliemann will play something for us now It was Kalkmann speaking and Harris started visibly as he heard the name and saw the black haired man by the piano turn with a smile For Schliemann was the name of his old music director who was dead Could this be his son They were so exactly alike If Bruder Meyer has not put his Amati to bed I will accompany him said the musician suggestively looking across at a man whom Harris had not yet noticed and who he now saw was the very image of a former master of that name Meyer rose and excused himself with a little bow and the Englishman quickly observed that he had a peculiar gesture as though his neck had a false join on to the body just below the collar and feared it might break Meyer of old had this trick of movement He remembered how the boys used to copy it He glanced sharply from face to face feeling as though some silent unseen process were changing everything about him All the faces seemed oddly familiar Pagel the Brother he had been talking with was of course the image of Pagel his former room master and Kalkmann he now realised for the first time was the very twin of another master whose name he had quite forgotten but whom he used to dislike intensely in the old days And through the smoke peering at him from the corners of the room he saw that all the Brothers about him had the faces he had known and lived with long ago Roest Fluheim Meinert Rigel Gysin He stared hard suddenly grown more alert and everywhere saw or fancied he saw strange likenesses ghostly resemblances more the identical faces of years ago There was something queer about it all something not quite right something that made him feel uneasy He shook himself mentally and actually blowing the smoke from before his eyes with a long breath and as he did so he noticed to his dismay that every one was fixedly staring They were watching him This brought him to his senses As an Englishman and a foreigner he did not wish to be rude or to do anything to make himself foolishly conspicuous and spoil the harmony of the evening He was a guest and a privileged guest at that Besides the music had already begun Bruder Schliemann s long white fingers were caressing the keys to some purpose He subsided into his chair and smoked with half closed eyes that yet saw everything But the shudder had established itself in his being and whether he would or not it kept repeating itself As a town far up some inland river feels the pressure of the distant sea so he became aware that mighty forces from somewhere beyond his ken were urging themselves up against his soul in this smoky little room He began to feel exceedingly ill at ease And as the music filled the air his mind began to clear Like a lifted veil there rose up something that had hitherto obscured his vision The words of the priest at the railway inn flashed across his brain unbidden You will find it different And also though why he could not tell he saw mentally the strong rather wonderful eyes of that other guest at the supper table the man who had overheard his conversation and had later got into earnest talk with the priest He took out his watch and stole a glance at it Two hours had slipped by It was already eleven o clock Schliemann meanwhile utterly absorbed in his music was playing a solemn measure The piano sang marvellously The power of a great conviction the simplicity of great art the vital spiritual message of a soul that had found itself all this and more were in the chords and yet somehow the music was what can only be described as impure atrociously and diabolically impure And the piece itself although Harris did not recognise it as anything familiar was surely the music of a Mass huge majestic sombre It stalked through the smoky room with slow power like the passage of something that was mighty yet profoundly intimate and as it went there stirred into each and every face about him the signature of the enormous forces of which it was the audible symbol The countenances round him turned sinister but not idly negatively sinister they grew dark with purpose He suddenly recalled the face of Bruder Kalkmann in the corridor earlier in the evening The motives of their secret souls rose to the eyes and mouths and foreheads and hung there for all to see like the black banners of an assembly of ill starred and fallen creatures Demons was the horrible word that flashed through his brain like a sheet of fire When this sudden discovery leaped out upon him for a moment he lost his self control Without waiting to think and weigh his extraordinary impression he did a very foolish but a very natural thing Feeling himself irresistibly driven by the sudden stress to some kind of action he sprang to his feet and screamed To his own utter amazement he stood up and shrieked aloud But no one stirred No one apparently took the slightest notice of his absurdly wild behaviour It was almost as if no one but himself had heard the scream at all as though the music had drowned it and swallowed it up as though after all perhaps he had not really screamed as loudly as he imagined or had not screamed at all Then as he glanced at the motionless dark faces before him something of utter cold passed into his being touching his very soul All emotion cooled suddenly leaving him like a receding tide He sat down again ashamed mortified angry with himself for behaving like a fool and a boy And the music meanwhile continued to issue from the white and snakelike fingers of Bruder Schliemann as poisoned wine might issue from the weirdly fashioned necks of antique phials And with the rest of them Harris drank it in Forcing himself to believe that he had been the victim of some kind of illusory perception he vigorously restrained his feelings Then the music presently ceased and every one applauded and began to talk at once laughing changing seats complimenting the player and behaving naturally and easily as though nothing out of the way had happened The faces appeared normal once more The Brothers crowded round their visitor and he joined in their talk and even heard himself thanking the gifted musician But at the same time he found himself edging towards the door nearer and nearer changing his chair when possible and joining the groups that stood closest to the way of escape I must thank you all tausendmal for my little reception and the great pleasure the very great honour you have done me he began in decided tones at length but I fear I have trespassed far too long already on your hospitality Moreover I have some distance to walk to my inn A chorus of voices greeted his words They would not hear of his going at least not without first partaking of refreshment They produced pumpernickel from one cupboard and rye bread and sausage from another and all began to talk again and eat More coffee was made fresh cigars lighted and Bruder Meyer took out his violin and began to tune it softly There is always a bed upstairs if Herr Harris will accept it said one And it is difficult to find the way out now for all the doors are locked laughed another loudly Let us take our simple pleasures as they come cried a third Bruder Harris will understand how we appreciate the honour of this last visit of his They made a dozen excuses They all laughed as though the politeness of their words was but formal and veiled thinly more and more thinly a very different meaning And the hour of midnight draws near added Bruder Kalkmann with a charming smile but in a voice that sounded to the Englishman like the grating of iron hinges Their German seemed to him more and more difficult to understand He noted that they called him Bruder too classing him as one of themselves And then suddenly he had a flash of keener perception and realised with a creeping of his flesh that he had all along misinterpreted grossly misinterpreted all they had been saying They had talked about the beauty of the place its isolation and remoteness from the world its peculiar fitness for certain kinds of spiritual development and worship yet hardly he now grasped in the sense in which he had taken the words They had meant something different Their spiritual powers their desire for loneliness their passion for worship were not the powers the solitude or the worship that he meant and understood He was playing a part in some horrible masquerade he was among men who cloaked their lives with religion in order to follow their real purposes unseen of men What did it all mean How had he blundered into so equivocal a situation Had he blundered into it at all Had he not rather been led into it deliberately led His thoughts grew dreadfully confused and his confidence in himself began to fade And why he suddenly thought again were they so impressed by the mere fact of his coming to revisit his old school What was it they so admired and wondered at in his simple act Why did they set such store upon his having the courage to come to give himself so freely unconditionally as one of them had expressed it with such a mockery of exaggeration Fear stirred in his heart most horribly and he found no answer to any of his questionings Only one thing he now understood quite clearly it was their purpose to keep him here They did not intend that he should go And from this moment he realised that they were sinister formidable and in some way he had yet to discover inimical to himself inimical to his life And the phrase one of them had used a moment ago this last visit of his rose before his eyes in letters of flame Harris was not a man of action and had never known in all the course of his career what it meant to be in a situation of real danger He was not necessarily a coward though perhaps a man of untried nerve He realised at last plainly that he was in a very awkward predicament indeed and that he had to deal with men who were utterly in earnest What their intentions were he only vaguely guessed His mind indeed was too confused for definite ratiocination and he was only able to follow blindly the strongest instincts that moved in him It never occurred to him that the Brothers might all be mad or that he himself might have temporarily lost his senses and be suffering under some terrible delusion In fact nothing occurred to him he realised nothing except that he meant to escape and the quicker the better A tremendous revulsion of feeling set in and overpowered him Accordingly without further protest for the moment he ate his pumpernickel and drank his coffee talking meanwhile as naturally and pleasantly as he could and when a suitable interval had passed he rose to his feet and announced once more that he must now take his leave He spoke very quietly but very decidedly No one hearing him could doubt that he meant what he said He had got very close to the door by this time I regret he said using his best German and speaking to a hushed room that our pleasant evening must come to an end but it is now time for me to wish you all good night And then as no one said anything he added though with a trifle less assurance And I thank you all most sincerely for your hospitality On the contrary replied Kalkmann instantly rising from his chair and ignoring the hand the Englishman had stretched out to him it is we who have to thank you and we do so most gratefully and sincerely And at the same moment at least half a dozen of the Brothers took up their position between himself and the door You are very good to say so Harris replied as firmly as he could manage noticing this movement out of the corner of his eye but really I had no conception that my little chance visit could have afforded you so much pleasure He moved another step nearer the door but Bruder Schliemann came across the room quickly and stood in front of him His attitude was uncompromising A dark and terrible expression had come into his face But it was not by chance that you came Bruder Harris he said so that all the room could hear surely we have not misunderstood your presence here He raised his black eyebrows No no the Englishman hastened to reply I was I am delighted to be here I told you what pleasure it gave me to find myself among you Do not misunderstand me I beg His voice faltered a little and he had difficulty in finding the words More and more too he had difficulty in understanding their words Of course interposed Bruder Kalkmann in his iron bass we have not misunderstood You have come back in the spirit of true and unselfish devotion You offer yourself freely and we all appreciate it It is your willingness and nobility that have so completely won our veneration and respect A faint murmur of applause ran round the room What we all delight in what our great Master will especially delight in is the value of your spontaneous and voluntary He used a word Harris did not understand He said Opfer The bewildered Englishman searched his brain for the translation and searched in vain For the life of him he could not remember what it meant But the word for all his inability to translate it touched his soul with ice It was worse far worse than anything he had imagined He felt like a lost helpless creature and all power to fight sank out of him from that moment It is magnificent to be such a willing added Schliemann sidling up to him with a dreadful leer on his face He made use of the same word Opfer God What could it all mean Offer himself True spirit of devotion Willing unselfish magnificent Opfer Opfer Opfer What in the name of heaven did it mean that strange mysterious word that struck such terror into his heart He made a valiant effort to keep his presence of mind and hold his nerves steady Turning he saw that Kalkmann s face was a dead white Kalkmann He understood that well enough Kalkmann meant Man of Chalk he knew that But what did Opfer mean That was the real key to the situation Words poured through his disordered mind in an endless stream unusual rare words he had perhaps heard but once in his life while Opfer a word in common use entirely escaped him What an extraordinary mockery it all was Then Kalkmann pale as death but his face hard as iron spoke a few low words that he did not catch and the Brothers standing by the walls at once turned the lamps down so that the room became dim In the half light he could only just discern their faces and movements It is time he heard Kalkmann s remorseless voice continue just behind him The hour of midnight is at hand Let us prepare He comes He comes Bruder Asmodelius comes His voice rose to a chant And the sound of that name for some extraordinary reason was terrible utterly terrible so that Harris shook from head to foot as he heard it Its utterance filled the air like soft thunder and a hush came over the whole room Forces rose all about him transforming the normal into the horrible and the spirit of craven fear ran through all his being bringing him to the verge of collapse Asmodelius Asmodelius The name was appalling For he understood at last to whom it referred and the meaning that lay between its great syllables At the same instant too he suddenly understood the meaning of that unremembered word The import of the word Opfer flashed upon his soul like a message of death He thought of making a wild effort to reach the door but the weakness of his trembling knees and the row of black figures that stood between dissuaded him at once He would have screamed for help but remembering the emptiness of the vast building and the loneliness of the situation he understood that no help could come that way and he kept his lips closed He stood still and did nothing But he knew now what was coming Two of the Brothers approached and took him gently by the arm Bruder Asmodelius accepts you they whispered are you ready Then he found his tongue and tried to speak But what have I to do with this Bruder Asm Asmo he stammered a desperate rush of words crowding vainly behind the halting tongue The name refused to pass his lips He could not pronounce it as they did He could not pronounce it at all His sense of helplessness then entered the acute stage for this inability to speak the name produced a fresh sense of quite horrible confusion in his mind and he became extraordinarily agitated I came here for a friendly visit he tried to say with a great effort but to his intense dismay he heard his voice saying something quite different and actually making use of that very word they had all used I came here as a willing Opfer he heard his own voice say and I am quite ready He was lost beyond all recall now Not alone his mind but the very muscles of his body had passed out of control He felt that he was hovering on the confines of a phantom or demon world a world in which the name they had spoken constituted the Master name the word of ultimate power What followed he heard and saw as in a nightmare In the half light that veils all truth let us prepare to worship and adore chanted Schliemann who had preceded him to the end of the room In the mists that protect our faces before the Black Throne let us make ready the willing victim echoed Kalkmann in his great bass They raised their faces listening expectantly as a roaring sound like the passing of mighty projectiles filled the air far far away very wonderful very forbidding The walls of the room trembled He comes He comes He comes chanted the Brothers in chorus The sound of roaring died away and an atmosphere of still and utter cold established itself over all Then Kalkmann dark and unutterably stern turned in the dim light and faced the rest Asmodelius our Hauptbruder is about us he cried in a voice that even while it shook was yet a voice of iron Asmodelius is about us Make ready There followed a pause in which no one stirred or spoke A tall Brother approached the Englishman but Kalkmann held up his hand Let the eyes remain uncovered he said in honour of so freely giving himself And to his horror Harris then realised for the first time that his hands were already fastened to his sides The Brother retreated again silently and in the pause that followed all the figures about him dropped to their knees leaving him standing alone and as they dropped in voices hushed with mingled reverence and awe they cried softly odiously appallingly the name of the Being whom they momentarily expected to appear Then at the end of the room where the windows seemed to have disappeared so that he saw the stars there rose into view far up against the night sky grand and terrible the outline of a man A kind of grey glory enveloped it so that it resembled a steel cased statue immense imposing horrific in its distant splendour while at the same time the face was so spiritually mighty yet so proudly so austerely sad that Harris felt as he stared that the sight was more than his eyes could meet and that in another moment the power of vision would fail him altogether and he must sink into utter nothingness So remote and inaccessible hung this figure that it was impossible to gauge anything as to its size yet at the same time so strangely close that when the grey radiance from its mightily broken visage august and mournful beat down upon his soul pulsing like some dark star with the powers of spiritual evil he felt almost as though he were looking into a face no farther removed from him in space than the face of any one of the Brothers who stood by his side And then the room filled and trembled with sounds that Harris understood full well were the failing voices of others who had preceded him in a long series down the years There came first a plain sharp cry as of a man in the last anguish choking for his breath and yet with the very final expiration of it breathing the name of the Worship of the dark Being who rejoiced to hear it The cries of the strangled the short running gasp of the suffocated and the smothered gurgling of the tightened throat all these and more echoed back and forth between the walls the very walls in which he now stood a prisoner a sacrificial victim The cries too not alone of the broken bodies but far worse of beaten broken souls And as the ghastly chorus rose and fell there came also the faces of the lost and unhappy creatures to whom they belonged and against that curtain of pale grey light he saw float past him in the air an array of white and piteous human countenances that seemed to beckon and gibber at him as though he were already one of themselves Slowly too as the voices rose and the pallid crew sailed past that giant form of grey descended from the sky and approached the room that contained the worshippers and their prisoner Hands rose and sank about him in the darkness and he felt that he was being draped in other garments than his own a circlet of ice seemed to run about his head while round the waist enclosing the fastened arms he felt a girdle tightly drawn At last about his very throat there ran a soft and silken touch which better than if there had been full light and a mirror held to his face he understood to be the cord of sacrifice and of death At this moment the Brothers still prostrate upon the floor began again their mournful yet impassioned chanting and as they did so a strange thing happened For apparently without moving or altering its position the huge Figure seemed at once and suddenly to be inside the room almost beside him and to fill the space around him to the exclusion of all else He was now beyond all ordinary sensations of fear only a drab feeling as of death the death of the soul stirred in his heart His thoughts no longer even beat vainly for escape The end was near and he knew it The dreadfully chanting voices rose about him in a wave We worship We adore We offer The sounds filled his ears and hammered almost meaningless upon his brain Then the majestic grey face turned slowly downwards upon him and his very soul passed outwards and seemed to become absorbed in the sea of those anguished eyes At the same moment a dozen hands forced him to his knees and in the air before him he saw the arm of Kalkmann upraised and felt the pressure about his throat grow strong It was in this awful moment when he had given up all hope and the help of gods or men seemed beyond question that a strange thing happened For before his fading and terrified vision there slid as in a dream of light yet without apparent rhyme or reason wholly unbidden and unexplained the face of that other man at the supper table of the railway inn And the sight even mentally of that strong wholesome vigorous English face inspired him suddenly with a new courage It was but a flash of fading vision before he sank into a dark and terrible death yet in some inexplicable way the sight of that face stirred in him unconquerable hope and the certainty of deliverance It was a face of power a face he now realised of simple goodness such as might have been seen by men of old on the shores of Galilee a face by heaven that could conquer even the devils of outer space And in his despair and abandonment he called upon it and called with no uncertain accents He found his voice in this overwhelming moment to some purpose though the words he actually used and whether they were in German or English he could never remember Their effect nevertheless was instantaneous The Brothers understood and that grey Figure of evil understood For a second the confusion was terrific There came a great shattering sound It seemed that the very earth trembled But all Harris remembered afterwards was that voices rose about him in the clamour of terrified alarm A man of power is among us A man of God The vast sound was repeated the rushing through space as of huge projectiles and he sank to the floor of the room unconscious The entire scene had vanished vanished like smoke over the roof of a cottage when the wind blows And by his side sat down a slight un German figure the figure of the stranger at the inn the man who had the rather wonderful eyes When Harris came to himself he felt cold He was lying under the open sky and the cool air of field and forest was blowing upon his face He sat up and looked about him The memory of the late scene was still horribly in his mind but no vestige of it remained No walls or ceiling enclosed him he was no longer in a room at all There were no lamps turned low no cigar smoke no black forms of sinister worshippers no tremendous grey Figure hovering beyond the windows Open space was about him and he was lying on a pile of bricks and mortar his clothes soaked with dew and the kind stars shining brightly overhead He was lying bruised and shaken among the heaped up debris of a ruined building He stood up and stared about him There in the shadowy distance lay the surrounding forest and here close at hand stood the outline of the village buildings But underfoot beyond question lay nothing but the broken heaps of stones that betokened a building long since crumbled to dust Then he saw that the stones were blackened and that great wooden beams half burnt half rotten made lines through the general debris He stood then among the ruins of a burnt and shattered building the weeds and nettles proving conclusively that it had lain thus for many years The moon had already set behind the encircling forest but the stars that spangled the heavens threw enough light to enable him to make quite sure of what he saw Harris the silk merchant stood among these broken and burnt stones and shivered Then he suddenly became aware that out of the gloom a figure had risen and stood beside him Peering at him he thought he recognised the face of the stranger at the railway inn Are you real he asked in a voice he hardly recognised as his own More than real I m friendly replied the stranger I followed you up here from the inn Harris stood and stared for several minutes without adding anything His teeth chattered The least sound made him start but the simple words in his own language and the tone in which they were uttered comforted him inconceivably You re English too thank God he said inconsequently These German devils He broke off and put a hand to his eyes But what s become of them all and the room and and The hand travelled down to his throat and moved nervously round his neck He drew a long long breath of relief Did I dream everything everything he said distractedly He stared wildly about him and the stranger moved forward and took his arm Come he said soothingly yet with a trace of command in the voice we will move away from here The high road or even the woods will be more to your taste for we are standing now on one of the most haunted and most terribly haunted spots of the whole world He guided his companion s stumbling footsteps over the broken masonry until they reached the path the nettles stinging their hands and Harris feeling his way like a man in a dream Passing through the twisted iron railing they reached the path and thence made their way to the road shining white in the night Once safely out of the ruins Harris collected himself and turned to look back But how is it possible he exclaimed his voice still shaking How can it be possible When I came in here I saw the building in the moonlight They opened the door I saw the figures and heard the voices and touched yes touched their very hands and saw their damned black faces saw them far more plainly than I see you now He was deeply bewildered The glamour was still upon his eyes with a degree of reality stronger than the reality even of normal life Was I so utterly deluded Then suddenly the words of the stranger which he had only half heard or understood returned to him Haunted he asked looking hard at him haunted did you say He paused in the roadway and stared into the darkness where the building of the old school had first appeared to him But the stranger hurried him forward We shall talk more safely farther on he said I followed you from the inn the moment I realised where you had gone When I found you it was eleven o clock Eleven o clock said Harris remembering with a shudder I saw you drop I watched over you till you recovered consciousness of your own accord and now now I am here to guide you safely back to the inn I have broken the spell the glamour I owe you a great deal sir interrupted Harris again beginning to understand something of the stranger s kindness but I don t understand it all I feel dazed and shaken His teeth still chattered and spells of violent shivering passed over him from head to foot He found that he was clinging to the other s arm In this way they passed beyond the deserted and crumbling village and gained the high road that led homewards through the forest That school building has long been in ruins said the man at his side presently it was burnt down by order of the Elders of the community at least ten years ago The village has been uninhabited ever since But the simulacra of certain ghastly events that took place under that roof in past days still continue And the shells of the chief participants still enact there the dreadful deeds that led to its final destruction and to the desertion of the whole settlement They were devil worshippers Harris listened with beads of perspiration on his forehead that did not come alone from their leisurely pace through the cool night Although he had seen this man but once before in his life and had never before exchanged so much as a word with him he felt a degree of confidence and a subtle sense of safety and well being in his presence that were the most healing influences he could possibly have wished after the experience he had been through For all that he still felt as if he were walking in a dream and though he heard every word that fell from his companion s lips it was only the next day that the full import of all he said became fully clear to him The presence of this quiet stranger the man with the wonderful eyes which he felt now rather than saw applied a soothing anodyne to his shattered spirit that healed him through and through And this healing influence distilled from the dark figure at his side satisfied his first imperative need so that he almost forgot to realise how strange and opportune it was that the man should be there at all It somehow never occurred to him to ask his name or to feel any undue wonder that one passing tourist should take so much trouble on behalf of another He just walked by his side listening to his quiet words and allowing himself to enjoy the very wonderful experience after his recent ordeal of being helped strengthened blessed Only once remembering vaguely something of his reading of years ago he turned to the man beside him after some more than usually remarkable words and heard himself almost involuntarily it seemed putting the question Then are you a Rosicrucian sir perhaps But the stranger had ignored the words or possibly not heard them for he continued with his talk as though unconscious of any interruption and Harris became aware that another somewhat unusual picture had taken possession of his mind as they walked there side by side through the cool reaches of the forest and that he had found his imagination suddenly charged with the childhood memory of Jacob wrestling with an angel wrestling all night with a being of superior quality whose strength eventually became his own It was your abrupt conversation with the priest at supper that first put me upon the track of this remarkable occurrence he heard the man s quiet voice beside him in the darkness and it was from him I learned after you left the story of the devil worship that became secretly established in the heart of this simple and devout little community Devil worship Here Harris stammered aghast Yes here conducted secretly for years by a group of Brothers before unexplained disappearances in the neighbourhood led to its discovery For where could they have found a safer place in the whole wide world for their ghastly traffic and perverted powers than here in the very precincts under cover of the very shadow of saintliness and holy living Awful awful whispered the silk merchant and when I tell you the words they used to me I know it all the stranger said quietly I saw and heard everything My plan first was to wait till the end and then to take steps for their destruction but in the interest of your personal safety he spoke with the utmost gravity and conviction in the interest of the safety of your soul I made my presence known when I did and before the conclusion had been reached My safety The danger then was real They were alive and Words failed him He stopped in the road and turned towards his companion the shining of whose eyes he could just make out in the gloom It was a concourse of the shells of violent men spiritually developed but evil men seeking after death the death of the body to prolong their vile and unnatural existence And had they accomplished their object you in turn at the death of your body would have passed into their power and helped to swell their dreadful purposes Harris made no reply He was trying hard to concentrate his mind upon the sweet and common things of life He even thought of silk and saint Paul s Churchyard and the faces of his partners in business For you came all prepared to be caught he heard the other s voice like some one talking to him from a distance your deeply introspective mood had already reconstructed the past so vividly so intensely that you were en rapport at once with any forces of those days that chanced still to be lingering And they swept you up all unresistingly Harris tightened his hold upon the stranger s arm as he heard At the moment he had room for one emotion only It did not seem to him odd that this stranger should have such intimate knowledge of his mind It is alas chiefly the evil emotions that are able to leave their photographs upon surrounding scenes and objects the other added and who ever heard of a place haunted by a noble deed or of beautiful and lovely ghosts revisiting the glimpses of the moon It is unfortunate But the wicked passions of men s hearts alone seem strong enough to leave pictures that persist the good are ever too lukewarm The stranger sighed as he spoke But Harris exhausted and shaken as he was to the very core paced by his side only half listening He moved as in a dream still It was very wonderful to him this walk home under the stars in the early hours of the October morning the peaceful forest all about them mist rising here and there over the small clearings and the sound of water from a hundred little invisible streams filling in the pauses of the talk In after life he always looked back to it as something magical and impossible something that had seemed too beautiful too curiously beautiful to have been quite true And though at the time he heard and understood but a quarter of what the stranger said it came back to him afterwards staying with him till the end of his days and always with a curious haunting sense of unreality as though he had enjoyed a wonderful dream of which he could recall only faint and exquisite portions But the horror of the earlier experience was effectually dispelled and when they reached the railway inn somewhere about three o clock in the morning Harris shook the stranger s hand gratefully effusively meeting the look of those rather wonderful eyes with a full heart and went up to his room thinking in a hazy dream like way of the words with which the stranger had brought their conversation to an end as they left the confines of the forest And if thought and emotion can persist in this way so long after the brain that sent them forth has crumbled into dust how vitally important it must be to control their very birth in the heart and guard them with the keenest possible restraint But Harris the silk merchant slept better than might have been expected and with a soundness that carried him half way through the day And when he came downstairs and learned that the stranger had already taken his departure he realised with keen regret that he had never once thought of asking his name Yes he signed the visitors book said the girl in reply to his question And he turned over the blotted pages and found there the last entry in a very delicate and individual handwriting John Silence London CASE II THE CAMP OF THE DOG I Islands of all shapes and sizes troop northward from Stockholm by the hundred and the little steamer that threads their intricate mazes in summer leaves the traveller in a somewhat bewildered state as regards the points of the compass when it reaches the end of its journey at Waxholm But it is only after Waxholm that the true islands begin so to speak to run wild and start up the coast on their tangled course of a hundred miles of deserted loveliness and it was in the very heart of this delightful confusion that we pitched our tents for a summer holiday A veritable wilderness of islands lay about us from the mere round button of a rock that bore a single fir to the mountainous stretch of a square mile densely wooded and bounded by precipitous cliffs so close together often that a strip of water ran between no wider than a country lane or again so far that an expanse stretched like the open sea for miles Although the larger islands boasted farms and fishing stations the majority were uninhabited Carpeted with moss and heather their coast lines showed a series of ravines and clefts and little sandy bays with a growth of splendid pine woods that came down to the water s edge and led the eye through unknown depths of shadow and mystery into the very heart of primitive forest The particular islands to which we had camping rights by virtue of paying a nominal sum to a Stockholm merchant lay together in a picturesque group far beyond the reach of the steamer one being a mere reef with a fringe of fairy like birches and two others cliff bound monsters rising with wooded heads out of the sea The fourth which we selected because it enclosed a little lagoon suitable for anchorage bathing night lines and what not shall have what description is necessary as the story proceeds but so far as paying rent was concerned we might equally well have pitched our tents on any one of a hundred others that clustered about us as thickly as a swarm of bees It was in the blaze of an evening in July the air clear as crystal the sea a cobalt blue when we left the steamer on the borders of civilisation and sailed away with maps compasses and provisions for the little group of dots in the Skaegard that were to be our home for the next two months The dinghy and my Canadian canoe trailed behind us with tents and dunnage carefully piled aboard and when the point of cliff intervened to hide the steamer and the Waxholm hotel we realised for the first time that the horror of trains and houses was far behind us the fever of men and cities the weariness of streets and confined spaces The wilderness opened up on all sides into endless blue reaches and the map and compasses were so frequently called into requisition that we went astray more often than not and progress was enchantingly slow It took us for instance two whole days to find our crescent shaped home and the camps we made on the way were so fascinating that we left them with difficulty and regret for each island seemed more desirable than the one before it and over all lay the spell of haunting peace remoteness from the turmoil of the world and the freedom of open and desolate spaces And so many of these spots of world beauty have I sought out and dwelt in that in my mind remains only a composite memory of their faces a true map of heaven as it were from which this particular one stands forth with unusual sharpness because of the strange things that happened there and also I think because anything in which John Silence played a part has a habit of fixing itself in the mind with a living and lasting quality of vividness For the moment however doctor Silence was not of the party Some private case in the interior of Hungary claimed his attention and it was not till later the fifteenth of August to be exact that I had arranged to meet him in Berlin and then return to London together for our harvest of winter work All the members of our party however were known to him more or less well and on this third day as we sailed through the narrow opening into the lagoon and saw the circular ridge of trees in a gold and crimson sunset before us his last words to me when we parted in London for some unaccountable reason came back very sharply to my memory and recalled the curious impression of prophecy with which I had first heard them Enjoy your holiday and store up all the force you can he had said as the train slipped out of Victoria and we will meet in Berlin on the fifteenth unless you should send for me sooner And now suddenly the words returned to me so clearly that it seemed I almost heard his voice in my ear Unless you should send for me sooner and returned moreover with a significance I was wholly at a loss to understand that touched somewhere in the depths of my mind a vague sense of apprehension that they had all along been intended in the nature of a prophecy In the lagoon then the wind failed us this July evening as was only natural behind the shelter of the belt of woods and we took to the oars all breathless with the beauty of this first sight of our island home yet all talking in somewhat hushed voices of the best place to land the depth of water the safest place to anchor to put up the tents in the most sheltered spot for the camp fires and a dozen things of importance that crop up when a home in the wilderness has actually to be made And during this busy sunset hour of unloading before the dark the souls of my companions adopted the trick of presenting themselves very vividly anew before my mind and introducing themselves afresh In reality I suppose our party was in no sense singular In the conventional life at home they certainly seemed ordinary enough but suddenly as we passed through these gates of the wilderness I saw them more sharply than before with characters stripped of the atmosphere of men and cities A complete change of setting often furnishes a startlingly new view of people hitherto held for well known they present another facet of their personalities I seemed to see my own party almost as new people people I had not known properly hitherto people who would drop all disguises and henceforth reveal themselves as they really were And each one seemed to say Now you will see me as I am You will see me here in this primitive life of the wilderness without clothes All my masks and veils I have left behind in the abodes of men So look out for surprises The Reverend Timothy Maloney helped me to put up the tents long practice making the process easy and while he drove in pegs and tightened ropes his coat off his flannel collar flying open without a tie it was impossible to avoid the conclusion that he was cut out for the life of a pioneer rather than the church He was fifty years of age muscular blue eyed and hearty and he took his share of the work and more without shirking The way he handled the axe in cutting down saplings for the tent poles was a delight to see and his eye in judging the level was unfailing Bullied as a young man into a lucrative family living he had in turn bullied his mind into some semblance of orthodox beliefs doing the honours of the little country church with an energy that made one think of a coal heaver tending china and it was only in the past few years that he had resigned the living and taken instead to cramming young men for their examinations This suited him better It enabled him too to indulge his passion for spells of wild life and to spend the summer months of most years under canvas in one part of the world or another where he could take his young men with him and combine reading with open air His wife usually accompanied him and there was no doubt she enjoyed the trips for she possessed though in less degree the same joy of the wilderness that was his own distinguishing characteristic The only difference was that while he regarded it as the real life she regarded it as an interlude While he camped out with his heart and mind she played at camping out with her clothes and body None the less she made a splendid companion and to watch her busy cooking dinner over the fire we had built among the stones was to understand that her heart was in the business for the moment and that she was happy even with the detail missus Maloney at home knitting in the sun and believing that the world was made in six days was one woman but missus Maloney standing with bare arms over the smoke of a wood fire under the pine trees was another and Peter Sangree the Canadian pupil with his pale skin and his loose though not ungainly figure stood beside her in very unfavourable contrast as he scraped potatoes and sliced bacon with slender white fingers that seemed better suited to hold a pen than a knife She ordered him about like a slave and he obeyed too with willing pleasure for in spite of his general appearance of debility he was as happy to be in camp as any of them But more than any other member of the party Joan Maloney the daughter was the one who seemed a natural and genuine part of the landscape who belonged to it all just in the same way that the trees and the moss and the grey rocks running out into the water belonged to it For she was obviously in her right and natural setting a creature of the wilds a gipsy in her own home To any one with a discerning eye this would have been more or less apparent but to me who had known her during all the twenty two years of her life and was familiar with the ins and outs of her primitive utterly un modern type it was strikingly clear To see her there made it impossible to imagine her again in civilisation I lost all recollection of how she looked in a town The memory somehow evaporated This slim creature before me flitting to and fro with the grace of the woodland life swift supple adroit on her knees blowing the fire or stirring the frying pan through a veil of smoke suddenly seemed the only way I had ever really seen her Here she was at home in London she became some one concealed by clothes an artificial doll overdressed and moving by clockwork only a portion of her alive Here she was alive all over I forget altogether how she was dressed just as I forget how any particular tree was dressed or how the markings ran on any one of the boulders that lay about the Camp She looked just as wild and natural and untamed as everything else that went to make up the scene and more than that I cannot say Pretty she was decidedly not She was thin skinny dark haired and possessed of great physical strength in the form of endurance She had too something of the force and vigorous purpose of a man tempestuous sometimes and wild to passionate frightening her mother and puzzling her easy going father with her storms of waywardness while at the same time she stirred his admiration by her violence A pagan of the pagans she was besides and with some haunting suggestion of old world pagan beauty about her dark face and eyes Altogether an odd and difficult character but with a generosity and high courage that made her very lovable In town life she always seemed to me to feel cramped bored a devil in a cage in her eyes a hunted expression as though any moment she dreaded to be caught But up in these spacious solitudes all this disappeared Away from the limitations that plagued and stung her she would show at her best and as I watched her moving about the Camp I repeatedly found myself thinking of a wild creature that had just obtained its freedom and was trying its muscles Peter Sangree of course at once went down before her But she was so obviously beyond his reach and besides so well able to take care of herself that I think her parents gave the matter but little thought and he himself worshipped at a respectful distance keeping admirable control of his passion in all respects save one for at his age the eyes are difficult to master and the yearning almost the devouring expression often visible in them was probably there unknown even to himself He better than any one else understood that he had fallen in love with something most hard of attainment something that drew him to the very edge of life and almost beyond it It no doubt was a secret and terrible joy to him this passionate worship from afar only I think he suffered more than any one guessed and that his want of vitality was due in large measure to the constant stream of unsatisfied yearning that poured for ever from his soul and body Moreover it seemed to me who now saw them for the first time together that there was an unnamable something an elusive quality of some kind that marked them as belonging to the same world and that although the girl ignored him she was secretly and perhaps unknown to herself drawn by some attribute very deep in her own nature to some quality equally deep in his This then was the party when we first settled down into our two months camp on the island in the Baltic Sea Other figures flitted from time to time across the scene and sometimes one reading man sometimes another came to join us and spend his four hours a day in the clergyman s tent but they came for short periods only and they went without leaving much trace in my memory and certainly they played no important part in what subsequently happened The weather favoured us that night so that by sunset the tents were up the boats unloaded a store of wood collected and chopped into lengths and the candle lanterns hung round ready for lighting on the trees Sangree too had picked deep mattresses of balsam boughs for the women s beds and had cleared little paths of brushwood from their tents to the central fireplace All was prepared for bad weather It was a cosy supper and a well cooked one that we sat down to and ate under the stars and according to the clergyman the only meal fit to eat we had seen since we left London a week before The deep stillness after that roar of steamers trains and tourists held something that thrilled for as we lay round the fire there was no sound but the faint sighing of the pines and the soft lapping of the waves along the shore and against the sides of the boat in the lagoon The ghostly outline of her white sails was just visible through the trees idly rocking to and fro in her calm anchorage her sheets flapping gently against the mast Beyond lay the dim blue shapes of other islands floating in the night and from all the great spaces about us came the murmur of the sea and the soft breathing of great woods The odours of the wilderness smells of wind and earth of trees and water clean vigorous and mighty were the true odours of a virgin world unspoilt by men more penetrating and more subtly intoxicating than any other perfume in the whole world Oh and dangerously strong too no doubt for some natures Ahhh breathed out the clergyman after supper with an indescribable gesture of satisfaction and relief Here there is freedom and room for body and mind to turn in Here one can work and rest and play Here one can be alive and absorb something of the earth forces that never get within touching distance in the cities By George I shall make a permanent camp here and come when it is time to die The good man was merely giving vent to his delight at being under canvas He said the same thing every year and he said it often But it more or less expressed the superficial feelings of us all And when a little later he turned to compliment his wife on the fried potatoes and discovered that she was snoring with her back against a tree he grunted with content at the sight and put a ground sheet over her feet as if it were the most natural thing in the world for her to fall asleep after dinner and then moved back to his own corner smoking his pipe with great satisfaction And I smoking mine too lay and fought against the most delicious sleep imaginable while my eyes wandered from the fire to the stars peeping through the branches and then back again to the group about me The reverend Timothy soon let his pipe go out and succumbed as his wife had done for he had worked hard and eaten well Sangree also smoking leaned against a tree with his gaze fixed on the girl a depth of yearning in his face that he could not hide and that really distressed me for him And Joan herself with wide staring eyes alert full of the new forces of the place evidently keyed up by the magic of finding herself among all the things her soul recognised as home sat rigid by the fire her thoughts roaming through the spaces the blood stirring about her heart She was as unconscious of the Canadian s gaze as she was that her parents both slept She looked to me more like a tree or something that had grown out of the island than a living girl of the century and when I spoke across to her in a whisper and suggested a tour of investigation she started and looked up at me as though she heard a voice in her dreams Sangree leaped up and joined us and without waking the others we three went over the ridge of the island and made our way down to the shore behind The water lay like a lake before us still coloured by the sunset The air was keen and scented wafting the smell of the wooded islands that hung about us in the darkening air Very small waves tumbled softly on the sand The sea was sown with stars and everywhere breathed and pulsed the beauty of the northern summer night I confess I speedily lost consciousness of the human presences beside me and I have little doubt Joan did too Only Sangree felt otherwise I suppose for presently we heard him sighing and I can well imagine that he absorbed the whole wonder and passion of the scene into his aching heart to swell the pain there that was more searching even than the pain at the sight of such matchless and incomprehensible beauty The splash of a fish jumping broke the spell I wish we had the canoe now remarked Joan we could paddle out to the other islands Of course I said wait here and I ll go across for it and was turning to feel my way back through the darkness when she stopped me in a voice that meant what it said No mister Sangree will get it We will wait here and cooee to guide him The Canadian was off in a moment for she had only to hint of her wishes and he obeyed Keep out from shore in case of rocks I cried out as he went and turn to the right out of the lagoon That s the shortest way round by the map My voice travelled across the still waters and woke echoes in the distant islands that came back to us like people calling out of space It was only thirty or forty yards over the ridge and down the other side to the lagoon where the boats lay but it was a good mile to coast round the shore in the dark to where we stood and waited We heard him stumbling away among the boulders and then the sounds suddenly ceased as he topped the ridge and went down past the fire on the other side I didn t want to be left alone with him the girl said presently in a low voice I m always afraid he s going to say or do something She hesitated a moment looking quickly over her shoulder towards the ridge where he had just disappeared something that might lead to unpleasantness She stopped abruptly You frightened Joan I exclaimed with genuine surprise This is a new light on your wicked character I thought the human being who could frighten you did not exist Then I suddenly realised she was talking seriously looking to me for help of some kind and at once I dropped the teasing attitude He s very far gone I think Joan I added gravely You must be kind to him whatever else you may feel He s exceedingly fond of you I know but I can t help it she whispered lest her voice should carry in the stillness there s something about him that that makes me feel creepy and half afraid But poor man it s not his fault if he is delicate and sometimes looks like death I laughed gently by way of defending what I felt to be a very innocent member of my sex Oh but it s not that I mean she answered quickly it s something I feel about him something in his soul something he hardly knows himself but that may come out if we are much together It draws me I feel tremendously It stirs what is wild in me deep down oh very deep down yet at the same time makes me feel afraid I suppose his thoughts are always playing about you I said but he s nice minded and Yes yes she interrupted impatiently I can trust myself absolutely with him He s gentle and singularly pure minded But there s something else that She stopped again sharply to listen Then she came up close beside me in the darkness whispering You know mister Hubbard sometimes my intuitions warn me a little too strongly to be ignored Oh yes you needn t tell me again that it s difficult to distinguish between fancy and intuition I know all that But I also know that there s something deep down in that man s soul that calls to something deep down in mine And at present it frightens me Because I cannot make out what it is and I know I know he ll do something some day that that will shake my life to the very bottom She laughed a little at the strangeness of her own description I turned to look at her more closely but the darkness was too great to show her face There was an intensity almost of suppressed passion in her voice that took me completely by surprise Nonsense Joan I said a little severely you know him well He s been with your father for months now But that was in London and up here it s different I mean I feel that it may be different Life in a place like this blows away the restraints of the artificial life at home I know oh I know what I m saying I feel all untied in a place like this the rigidity of one s nature begins to melt and flow Surely you must understand what I mean Of course I understand I replied yet not wishing to encourage her in her present line of thought and it s a grand experience for a short time But you re overtired to night Joan like the rest of us A few days in this air will set you above all fears of the kind you mention Then after a moment s silence I added feeling I should estrange her confidence altogether if I blundered any more and treated her like a child I think perhaps the true explanation is that you pity him for loving you and at the same time you feel the repulsion of the healthy vigorous animal for what is weak and timid If he came up boldly and took you by the throat and shouted that he would force you to love him well then you would feel no fear at all You would know exactly how to deal with him Isn t it perhaps something of that kind The girl made no reply and when I took her hand I felt that it trembled a little and was cold It s not his love that I m afraid of she said hurriedly for at this moment we heard the dip of a paddle in the water it s something in his very soul that terrifies me in a way I have never been terrified before yet fascinates me In town I was hardly conscious of his presence But the moment we got away from civilisation it began to come He seems so so real up here I dread being alone with him It makes me feel that something must burst and tear its way out that he would do something or I should do something I don t know exactly what I mean probably but that I should let myself go and scream Joan Don t be alarmed she laughed shortly I shan t do anything silly but I wanted to tell you my feelings in case I needed your help When I have intuitions as strong as this they are never wrong only I don t know yet what it means exactly You must hold out for the month at any rate I said in as matter of fact a voice as I could manage for her manner had somehow changed my surprise to a subtle sense of alarm Sangree only stays the month you know And anyhow you are such an odd creature yourself that you should feel generously towards other odd creatures I ended lamely with a forced laugh She gave my hand a sudden pressure I m glad I ve told you at any rate she said quickly under her breath for the canoe was now gliding up silently like a ghost to our feet and I m glad you re here too she added as we moved down towards the water to meet it I made Sangree change into the bows and got into the steering seat myself putting the girl between us so that I could watch them both by keeping their outlines against the sea and stars For the intuitions of certain folk women and children usually I confess I have always felt a great respect that has more often than not been justified by experience and now the curious emotion stirred in me by the girl s words remained somewhat vividly in my consciousness I explained it in some measure by the fact that the girl tired out by the fatigue of many days travel had suffered a vigorous reaction of some kind from the strong desolate scenery and further perhaps that she had been treated to my own experience of seeing the members of the party in a new light the Canadian being partly a stranger more vividly than the rest of us But at the same time I felt it was quite possible that she had sensed some subtle link between his personality and her own some quality that she had hitherto ignored and that the routine of town life had kept buried out of sight The only thing that seemed difficult to explain was the fear she had spoken of and this I hoped the wholesome effects of camp life and exercise would sweep away naturally in the course of time We made the tour of the island without speaking It was all too beautiful for speech The trees crowded down to the shore to hear us pass We saw their fine dark heads bowed low with splendid dignity to watch us forgetting for a moment that the stars were caught in the needled network of their hair Against the sky in the west where still lingered the sunset gold we saw the wild toss of the horizon shaggy with forest and cliff gripping the heart like the motive in a symphony and sending the sense of beauty all a shiver through the mind all these surrounding islands standing above the water like low clouds and like them seeming to post along silently into the engulfing night We heard the musical drip drip of the paddle and the little wash of our waves on the shore and then suddenly we found ourselves at the opening of the lagoon again having made the complete circuit of our home The Reverend Timothy had awakened from sleep and was singing to himself and the sound of his voice as we glided down the fifty yards of enclosed water was pleasant to hear and undeniably wholesome We saw the glow of the fire up among the trees on the ridge and his shadow moving about as he threw on more wood There you are he called aloud Good again Been setting the night lines eh Capital And your mother s still fast asleep Joan His cheery laugh floated across the water he had not been in the least disturbed by our absence for old campers are not easily alarmed Now remember he went on after we had told our little tale of travel by the fire and missus Maloney had asked for the fourth time exactly where her tent was and whether the door faced east or south every one takes their turn at cooking breakfast and one of the men is always out at sunrise to catch it first Hubbard I ll toss you which you do in the morning and which I do He lost the toss Then I ll catch it I said laughing at his discomfiture for I knew he loathed stirring porridge And mind you don t burn it as you did every blessed time last year on the Volga I added by way of reminder missus Maloney s fifth interruption about the door of her tent and her further pointed observation that it was past nine o clock set us lighting lanterns and putting the fire out for safety But before we separated for the night the clergyman had a time honoured little ritual of his own to go through that no one had the heart to deny him He always did this It was a relic of his pulpit habits He glanced briefly from one to the other of us his face grave and earnest his hands lifted to the stars and his eyes all closed and puckered up beneath a momentary frown Then he offered up a short almost inaudible prayer thanking Heaven for our safe arrival begging for good weather no illness or accidents plenty of fish and strong sailing winds And then unexpectedly no one knew why exactly he ended up with an abrupt request that nothing from the kingdom of darkness should be allowed to afflict our peace and no evil thing come near to disturb us in the night time And while he uttered these last surprising words so strangely unlike his usual ending it chanced that I looked up and let my eyes wander round the group assembled about the dying fire And it certainly seemed to me that Sangree s face underwent a sudden and visible alteration He was staring at Joan and as he stared the change ran over it like a shadow and was gone I started in spite of myself for something oddly concentrated potent collected had come into the expression usually so scattered and feeble But it was all swift as a passing meteor and when I looked a second time his face was normal and he was looking among the trees And Joan luckily had not observed him her head being bowed and her eyes tightly closed while her father prayed The girl has a vivid imagination indeed I thought half laughing as I lit the lanterns if her thoughts can put a glamour upon mine in this way and yet somehow when we said good night I took occasion to give her a few vigorous words of encouragement and went to her tent to make sure I could find it quickly in the night in case anything happened In her quick way the girl understood and thanked me and the last thing I heard as I moved off to the men s quarters was missus Maloney crying that there were beetles in her tent and Joan s laughter as she went to help her turn them out Half an hour later the island was silent as the grave but for the mournful voices of the wind as it sighed up from the sea Like white sentries stood the three tents of the men on one side of the ridge and on the other side half hidden by some birches whose leaves just shivered as the breeze caught them the women s tents patches of ghostly grey gathered more closely together for mutual shelter and protection Something like fifty yards of broken ground grey rock moss and lichen lay between and over all lay the curtain of the night and the great whispering winds from the forests of Scandinavia And the very last thing just before floating away on that mighty wave that carries one so softly off into the deeps of forgetfulness I again heard the voice of John Silence as the train moved out of Victoria Station and by some subtle connection that met me on the very threshold of consciousness there rose in my mind simultaneously the memory of the girl s half given confidence and of her distress As by some wizardry of approaching dreams they seemed in that instant to be related but before I could analyse the why and the wherefore both sank away out of sight again and I was off beyond recall Unless you should send for me sooner II Whether missus Maloney s tent door opened south or east I think she never discovered for it is quite certain she always slept with the flap tightly fastened I only know that my own little five by seven all silk faced due east because next morning the sun pouring in as only the wilderness sun knows how to pour woke me early and a moment later with a short run over soft moss and a flying dive from the granite ledge I was swimming in the most sparkling water imaginable It was barely four o clock and the sun came down a long vista of blue islands that led out to the open sea and Finland Nearer by rose the wooded domes of our own property still capped and wreathed with smoky trails of fast melting mist and looking as fresh as though it was the morning of missus Maloney s Sixth Day and they had just issued clean and brilliant from the hands of the great Architect In the open spaces the ground was drenched with dew and from the sea a cool salt wind stole in among the trees and set the branches trembling in an atmosphere of shimmering silver The tents shone white where the sun caught them in patches Below lay the lagoon still dreaming of the summer night in the open the fish were jumping busily sending musical ripples towards the shore and in the air hung the magic of dawn silent incommunicable I lit the fire so that an hour later the clergyman should find good ashes to stir his porridge over and then set forth upon an examination of the island but hardly had I gone a dozen yards when I saw a figure standing a little in front of me where the sunlight fell in a pool among the trees It was Joan She had already been up an hour she told me and had bathed before the last stars had left the sky I saw at once that the new spirit of this solitary region had entered into her banishing the fears of the night for her face was like the face of a happy denizen of the wilderness and her eyes stainless and shining Her feet were bare and drops of dew she had shaken from the branches hung in her loose flying hair Obviously she had come into her own I ve been all over the island she announced laughingly and there are two things wanting You re a good judge Joan What are they There s no animal life and there s no water They go together I said Animals don t bother with a rock like this unless there s a spring on it And as she led me from place to place happy and excited leaping adroitly from rock to rock I was glad to note that my first impressions were correct She made no reference to our conversation of the night before The new spirit had driven out the old There was no room in her heart for fear or anxiety and Nature had everything her own way The island we found was some three quarters of a mile from point to point built in a circle or wide horseshoe with an opening of twenty feet at the mouth of the lagoon Pine trees grew thickly all over but here and there were patches of silver birch scrub oak and considerable colonies of wild raspberry and gooseberry bushes The two ends of the horseshoe formed bare slabs of smooth granite running into the sea and forming dangerous reefs just below the surface but the rest of the island rose in a forty foot ridge and sloped down steeply to the sea on either side being nowhere more than a hundred yards wide The outer shore line was much indented with numberless coves and bays and sandy beaches with here and there caves and precipitous little cliffs against which the sea broke in spray and thunder But the inner shore the shore of the lagoon was low and regular and so well protected by the wall of trees along the ridge that no storm could ever send more than a passing ripple along its sandy marges Eternal shelter reigned there On one of the other islands a few hundred yards away for the rest of the party slept late this first morning and we took to the canoe we discovered a spring of fresh water untainted by the brackish flavour of the Baltic and having thus solved the most important problem of the Camp we next proceeded to deal with the second fish And in half an hour we reeled in and turned homewards for we had no means of storage and to clean more fish than may be stored or eaten in a day is no wise occupation for experienced campers And as we landed towards six o clock we heard the clergyman singing as usual and saw his wife and Sangree shaking out their blankets in the sun and dressed in a fashion that finally dispelled all memories of streets and civilisation The Little People lit the fire for me cried Maloney looking natural and at home in his ancient flannel suit and breaking off in the middle of his singing so I ve got the porridge going and this time it s not burnt We reported the discovery of water and held up the fish Good 
1336_138113_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Good again he cried 
1336_138113_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 We ll have the first decent breakfast we ve had this year 
none	none	Sangree ll clean em in no time and the Bo sun s Mate Will fry them to a turn laughed the voice of missus Maloney appearing on the scene in a tight blue jersey and sandals and catching up the frying pan Her husband always called her the Bo sun s Mate in Camp because it was her duty among others to pipe all hands to meals And as for you Joan went on the happy man you look like the spirit of the island with moss in your hair and wind in your eyes and sun and stars mixed in your face He looked at her with delighted admiration Here Sangree take these twelve there s a good fellow they re the biggest and we ll have em in butter in less time than you can say Baltic island I watched the Canadian as he slowly moved off to the cleaning pail His eyes were drinking in the girl s beauty and a wave of passionate almost feverish joy passed over his face expressive of the ecstasy of true worship more than anything else Perhaps he was thinking that he still had three weeks to come with that vision always before his eyes perhaps he was thinking of his dreams in the night I cannot say But I noticed the curious mingling of yearning and happiness in his eyes and the strength of the impression touched my curiosity Something in his face held my gaze for a second something to do with its intensity That so timid so gentle a personality should conceal so virile a passion almost seemed to require explanation But the impression was momentary for that first breakfast in Camp permitted no divided attentions and I dare swear that the porridge the tea the Swedish flatbread and the fried fish flavoured with points of frizzled bacon were better than any meal eaten elsewhere that day in the whole world The first clear day in a new camp is always a furiously busy one and we soon dropped into the routine upon which in large measure the real comfort of every one depends About the cooking fire greatly improved with stones from the shore we built a high stockade consisting of upright poles thickly twined with branches the roof lined with moss and lichen and weighted with rocks and round the interior we made low wooden seats so that we could lie round the fire even in rain and eat our meals in peace Paths too outlined themselves from tent to tent from the bathing places and the landing stage and a fair division of the island was decided upon between the quarters of the men and the women Wood was stacked awkward trees and boulders removed hammocks slung and tents strengthened In a word Camp was established and duties were assigned and accepted as though we expected to live on this Baltic island for years to come and the smallest detail of the Community life was important Moreover as the Camp came into being this sense of a community developed proving that we were a definite whole and not merely separate human beings living for a while in tents upon a desert island Each fell willingly into the routine Sangree as by natural selection took upon himself the cleaning of the fish and the cutting of the wood into lengths sufficient for a day s use And he did it well The pan of water was never without a fish cleaned and scaled ready to fry for whoever was hungry the nightly fire never died down for lack of material to throw on without going farther afield to search And Timothy once reverend caught the fish and chopped down the trees He also assumed responsibility for the condition of the boat and did it so thoroughly that nothing in the little cutter was ever found wanting And when for any reason his presence was in demand the first place to look for him was in the boat and there too he was usually found tinkering away with sheets sails or rudder and singing as he tinkered Nor was the reading neglected for most mornings there came a sound of droning voices form the white tent by the raspberry bushes which signified that Sangree the tutor and whatever other man chanced to be in the party at the time were hard at it with history or the classics And while missus Maloney also by natural selection took charge of the larder and the kitchen the mending and general supervision of the rough comforts she also made herself peculiarly mistress of the megaphone which summoned to meals and carried her voice easily from one end of the island to the other and in her hours of leisure she daubed the surrounding scenery on to a sketching block with all the honesty and devotion of her determined but unreceptive soul Joan meanwhile Joan elusive creature of the wilds became I know not exactly what She did plenty of work in the Camp yet seemed to have no very precise duties She was everywhere and anywhere Sometimes she slept in her tent sometimes under the stars with a blanket She knew every inch of the island and kept turning up in places where she was least expected for ever wandering about reading her books in sheltered corners making little fires on sunless days to worship by to the gods as she put it ever finding new pools to dive and bathe in and swimming day and night in the warm and waveless lagoon like a fish in a huge tank She went bare legged and bare footed with her hair down and her skirts caught up to the knees and if ever a human being turned into a jolly savage within the compass of a single week Joan Maloney was certainly that human being She ran wild So completely too was she possessed by the strong spirit of the place that the little human fear she had yielded to so strangely on our arrival seemed to have been utterly dispossessed As I hoped and expected she made no reference to our conversation of the first evening Sangree bothered her with no special attentions and after all they were very little together His behaviour was perfect in that respect and I for my part hardly gave the matter another thought Joan was ever a prey to vivid fancies of one kind or another and this was one of them Mercifully for the happiness of all concerned it had melted away before the spirit of busy active life and deep content that reigned over the island Every one was intensely alive and peace was upon all Meanwhile the effect of the camp life began to tell Always a searching test of character its results sooner or later are infallible for it acts upon the soul as swiftly and surely as the hypo bath upon the negative of a photograph A readjustment of the personal forces takes place quickly some parts of the personality go to sleep others wake up but the first sweeping change that the primitive life brings about is that the artificial portions of the character shed themselves one after another like dead skins Attitudes and poses that seemed genuine in the city drop away 
1336_138113_000030_000004	train-clean-360	The mind like the body grows quickly hard simple uncomplex 
none	none	And in a camp as primitive and close to nature as ours was these effects became speedily visible 
1336_138113_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Some folk of course who talk glibly about the simple life when it is safely out of reach betray themselves in camp by for ever peering about for the artificial excitements of civilisation which they miss 
none	none	Some get bored at once some grow slovenly some reveal the animal in most unexpected fashion and some the select few find themselves in very short order and are happy And in our little party we could flatter ourselves that we all belonged to the last category so far as the general effect was concerned Only there were certain other changes as well varying with each individual and all interesting to note It was only after the first week or two that these changes became marked although this is the proper place I think to speak of them For having myself no other duty than to enjoy a well earned holiday I used to load my canoe with blankets and provisions and journey forth on exploration trips among the islands of several days together and it was on my return from the first of these when I rediscovered the party so to speak that these changes first presented themselves vividly to me and in one particular instance produced a rather curious impression In a word then while every one had grown wilder naturally wilder Sangree it seemed to me had grown much wilder and what I can only call unnaturally wilder He made me think of a savage To begin with he had changed immensely in mere physical appearance and the full brown cheeks the brighter eyes of absolute health and the general air of vigour and robustness that had come to replace his customary lassitude and timidity had worked such an improvement that I hardly knew him for the same man His voice too was deeper and his manner bespoke for the first time a greater measure of confidence in himself He now had some claims to be called nice looking or at least to a certain air of virility that would not lessen his value in the eyes of the opposite sex All this of course was natural enough and most welcome But altogether apart from this physical change which no doubt had also been going forward in the rest of us there was a subtle note in his personality that came to me with a degree of surprise that almost amounted to shock And two things as he came down to welcome me and pull up the canoe leaped up in my mind unbidden as though connected in some way I could not at the moment divine first the curious judgment formed of him by Joan and secondly that fugitive expression I had caught in his face while Maloney was offering up his strange prayer for special protection from Heaven The delicacy of manner and feature to call it by no milder term which had always been a distinguishing characteristic of the man had been replaced by something far more vigorous and decided that yet utterly eluded analysis The change which impressed me so oddly was not easy to name The others singing Maloney the bustling Bo sun s Mate and Joan that fascinating half breed of undine and salamander all showed the effects of a life so close to nature but in their case the change was perfectly natural and what was to be expected whereas with Peter Sangree the Canadian it was something unusual and unexpected It is impossible to explain how he managed gradually to convey to my mind the impression that something in him had turned savage yet this more or less is the impression that he did convey It was not that he seemed really less civilised or that his character had undergone any definite alteration but rather that something in him hitherto dormant had awakened to life Some quality latent till now so far at least as we were concerned who after all knew him but slightly had stirred into activity and risen to the surface of his being And while for the moment this seemed as far as I could get it was but natural that my mind should continue the intuitive process and acknowledge that John Silence owing to his peculiar faculties and the girl owing to her singularly receptive temperament might each in a different way have divined this latent quality in his soul and feared its manifestation later On looking back to this painful adventure too it now seems equally natural that the same process carried to its logical conclusion should have wakened some deep instinct in me that wholly without direction from my will set itself sharply and persistently upon the watch from that very moment Thenceforward the personality of Sangree was never far from my thoughts and I was for ever analysing and searching for the explanation that took so long in coming
1336_138113_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I declare Hubbard you re tanned like an aboriginal and you look like one too laughed Maloney 
none	none	And I can return the compliment was my reply as we all gathered round a brew of tea to exchange news and compare notes And later at supper it amused me to observe that the distinguished tutor once clergyman did not eat his food quite as nicely as he did at home he devoured it that missus Maloney ate more and to say the least with less delay than was her custom in the select atmosphere of her English dining room and that while Joan attacked her tin plateful with genuine avidity Sangree the Canadian bit and gnawed at his laughing and talking and complimenting the cook all the while and making me think with secret amusement of a starved animal at its first meal While from their remarks about myself I judged that I had changed and grown wild as much as the rest of them In this and in a hundred other little ways the change showed ways difficult to define in detail but all proving not the coarsening effect of leading the primitive life but let us say the more direct and unvarnished methods that became prevalent For all day long we were in the bath of the elements wind water sun and just as the body became insensible to cold and shed unnecessary clothing the mind grew straightforward and shed many of the disguises required by the conventions of civilisation And in each according to temperament and character there stirred the life instincts that were natural untamed and in a sense savage III So it came about that I stayed with our island party putting off my second exploring trip from day to day and I think that this far fetched instinct to watch Sangree was really the cause of my postponement For another ten days the life of the Camp pursued its even and delightful way blessed by perfect summer weather a good harvest of fish fine winds for sailing and calm starry nights Maloney s selfish prayer had been favourably received Nothing came to disturb or perplex There was not even the prowling of night animals to vex the rest of missus Maloney for in previous camps it had often been her peculiar affliction that she heard the porcupines scratching against the canvas or the squirrels dropping fir cones in the early morning with a sound of miniature thunder upon the roof of her tent But on this island there was not even a squirrel or a mouse I think two toads and a small and harmless snake were the only living creatures that had been discovered during the whole of the first fortnight And these two toads in all probability were not two toads but one toad Then suddenly came the terror that changed the whole aspect of the place the devastating terror It came at first gently but from the very start it made me realise the unpleasant loneliness of our situation our remote isolation in this wilderness of sea and rock and how the islands in this tideless Baltic ocean lay about us like the advance guard of a vast besieging army Its entry as I say was gentle hardly noticeable in fact to most of us singularly undramatic it certainly was But then in actual life this is often the way the dreadful climaxes move upon us leaving the heart undisturbed almost to the last minute and then overwhelming it with a sudden rush of horror For it was the custom at breakfast to listen patiently while each in turn related the trivial adventures of the night how they slept whether the wind shook their tent whether the spider on the ridge pole had moved whether they had heard the toad and so forth and on this particular morning Joan in the middle of a little pause made a truly novel announcement In the night I heard the howling of a dog she said and then flushed up to the roots of her hair when we burst out laughing For the idea of there being a dog on this forsaken island that was only able to support a snake and two toads was distinctly ludicrous and I remember Maloney half way through his burnt porridge capping the announcement by declaring that he had heard a Baltic turtle in the lagoon and his wife s expression of frantic alarm before the laughter undeceived her But the next morning Joan repeated the story with additional and convincing detail Sounds of whining and growling woke me she said and I distinctly heard sniffing under my tent and the scratching of paws Oh Timothy Can it be a porcupine exclaimed the Bo sun s Mate with distress forgetting that Sweden was not Canada But the girl s voice had sounded to me in quite another key and looking up I saw that her father and Sangree were staring at her hard They too understood that she was in earnest and had been struck by the serious note in her voice Rubbish Joan You are always dreaming something or other wild her father said a little impatiently There s not an animal of any size on the whole island added Sangree with a puzzled expression He never took his eyes from her face But there s nothing to prevent one swimming over I put in briskly for somehow a sense of uneasiness that was not pleasant had woven itself into the talk and pauses A deer for instance might easily land in the night and take a look round Or a bear gasped the Bo sun s Mate with a look so portentous that we all welcomed the laugh But Joan did not laugh Instead she sprang up and called to us to follow There she said pointing to the ground by her tent on the side farthest from her mother s there are the marks close to my head You can see for yourselves We saw plainly The moss and lichen for earth there was hardly any had been scratched up by paws An animal about the size of a large dog it must have been to judge by the marks We stood and stared in a row Close to my head repeated the girl looking round at us Her face I noticed was very pale and her lip seemed to quiver for an instant Then she gave a sudden gulp and burst into a flood of tears The whole thing had come about in the brief space of a few minutes and with a curious sense of inevitableness moreover as though it had all been carefully planned from all time and nothing could have stopped it It had all been rehearsed before had actually happened before as the strange feeling sometimes has it it seemed like the opening movement in some ominous drama and that I knew exactly what would happen next Something of great moment was impending For this sinister sensation of coming disaster made itself felt from the very beginning and an atmosphere of gloom and dismay pervaded the entire Camp from that moment forward I drew Sangree to one side and moved away while Maloney took the distressed girl into her tent and his wife followed them energetic and greatly flustered For thus in undramatic fashion it was that the terror I have spoken of first attempted the invasion of our Camp and trivial and unimportant though it seemed every little detail of this opening scene is photographed upon my mind with merciless accuracy and precision It happened exactly as described This was exactly the language used I see it written before me in black and white I see too the faces of all concerned with the sudden ugly signature of alarm where before had been peace The terror had stretched out so to speak a first tentative feeler toward us and had touched the hearts of each with a horrid directness And from this moment the Camp changed Sangree in particular was visibly upset He could not bear to see the girl distressed and to hear her actually cry was almost more than he could stand The feeling that he had no right to protect her hurt him keenly and I could see that he was itching to do something to help and liked him for it His expression said plainly that he would tear in a thousand pieces anything that dared to injure a hair of her head We lit our pipes and strolled over in silence to the men s quarters and it was his odd Canadian expression Gee whiz that drew my attention to a further discovery The brute s been scratching round my tent too he cried as he pointed to similar marks by the door and I stooped down to examine them We both stared in amazement for several minutes without speaking Only I sleep like the dead he added straightening up again and so heard nothing I suppose We traced the paw marks from the mouth of his tent in a direct line across to the girl s but nowhere else about the Camp was there a sign of the strange visitor The deer dog or whatever it was that had twice favoured us with a visit in the night had confined its attentions to these two tents And after all there was really nothing out of the way about these visits of an unknown animal for although our own island was destitute of life we were in the heart of a wilderness and the mainland and larger islands must be swarming with all kinds of four footed creatures and no very prolonged swimming was necessary to reach us In any other country it would not have caused a moment s interest interest of the kind we felt that is In our Canadian camps the bears were for ever grunting about among the provision bags at night porcupines scratching unceasingly and chipmunks scuttling over everything My daughter is overtired and that s the truth of it explained Maloney presently when he rejoined us and had examined in turn the other paw marks She s been overdoing it lately and camp life you know always means a great excitement to her It s natural enough if we take no notice she ll be all right He paused to borrow my tobacco pouch and fill his pipe and the blundering way he filled it and spilled the precious weed on the ground visibly belied the calm of his easy language You might take her out for a bit of fishing Hubbard like a good chap she s hardly up to the long day in the cutter Show her some of the other islands in your canoe perhaps Eh And by lunch time the cloud had passed away as suddenly and as suspiciously as it had come But in the canoe on our way home having till then purposely ignored the subject uppermost in our minds she suddenly spoke to me in a way that again touched the note of sinister alarm the note that kept on sounding and sounding until finally John Silence came with his great vibrating presence and relieved it yes and even after he came too for a while I m ashamed to ask it she said abruptly as she steered me home her sleeves rolled up her hair blowing in the wind and ashamed of my silly tears too because I really can t make out what caused them but mister Hubbard I want you to promise me not to go off for your long expeditions just yet I beg it of you She was so in earnest that she forgot the canoe and the wind caught it sideways and made us roll dangerously I have tried hard not to ask this she added bringing the canoe round again but I simply can t help myself It was a good deal to ask and I suppose my hesitation was plain for she went on before I could reply and her beseeching expression and intensity of manner impressed me very forcibly For another two weeks only mister Sangree leaves in a fortnight I said seeing at once what she was driving at but wondering if it was best to encourage her or not If I knew you were to be on the island till then she said her face alternately pale and blushing and her voice trembling a little I should feel so much happier I looked at her steadily waiting for her to finish And safer she added almost in a whisper especially at night I mean Safer Joan I repeated thinking I had never seen her eyes so soft and tender She nodded her head keeping her gaze fixed on my face It was really difficult to refuse whatever my thoughts and judgment may have been and somehow I understood that she spoke with good reason though for the life of me I could not have put it into words Happier and safer she said gravely the canoe giving a dangerous lurch as she leaned forward in her seat to catch my answer Perhaps after all the wisest way was to grant her request and make light of it easing her anxiety without too much encouraging its cause All right Joan you queer creature I promise and the instant look of relief in her face and the smile that came back like sunlight to her eyes made me feel that unknown to myself and the world I was capable of considerable sacrifice after all But you know there s nothing to be afraid of I added sharply and she looked up in my face with the smile women use when they know we are talking idly yet do not wish to tell us so You don t feel afraid I know she observed quietly Of course not why should I So if you will just humour me this once I I will never ask anything foolish of you again as long as I live she said gratefully You have my promise was all I could find to say She headed the nose of the canoe for the lagoon lying a quarter of a mile ahead and paddled swiftly but a minute or two later she paused again and stared hard at me with the dripping paddle across the thwarts You ve not heard anything at night yourself have you she asked I never hear anything at night I replied shortly from the moment I lie down till the moment I get up That dismal howling for instance she went on determined to get it out far away at first and then getting closer and stopping just outside the Camp Certainly not Because sometimes I think I almost dreamed it Most likely you did was my unsympathetic response And you don t think father has heard it either then No He would have told me if he had This seemed to relieve her mind a little I know mother hasn t she added as if speaking to herself for she hears nothing ever It was two nights after this conversation that I woke out of deep sleep and heard sounds of screaming The voice was really horrible breaking the peace and silence with its shrill clamour In less than ten seconds I was half dressed and out of my tent The screaming had stopped abruptly but I knew the general direction and ran as fast as the darkness would allow over to the women s quarters and on getting close I heard sounds of suppressed weeping It was Joan s voice And just as I came up I saw missus Maloney marvellously attired fumbling with a lantern Other voices became audible in the same moment behind me and Timothy Maloney arrived breathless less than half dressed and carrying another lantern that had gone out on the way from being banged against a tree Dawn was just breaking and a chill wind blew in from the sea Heavy black clouds drove low overhead The scene of confusion may be better imagined than described Questions in frightened voices filled the air against this background of suppressed weeping Briefly Joan s silk tent had been torn and the girl was in a state bordering upon hysterics Somewhat reassured by our noisy presence however for she was plucky at heart she pulled herself together and tried to explain what had happened and her broken words told there on the edge of night and morning upon this wild island ridge were oddly thrilling and distressingly convincing Something touched me and I woke she said simply but in a voice still hushed and broken with the terror of it something pushing against the tent I felt it through the canvas There was the same sniffing and scratching as before and I felt the tent give a little as when wind shakes it I heard breathing very loud very heavy breathing and then came a sudden great tearing blow and the canvas ripped open close to my face She had instantly dashed out through the open flap and screamed at the top of her voice thinking the creature had actually got into the tent But nothing was visible she declared and she heard not the faintest sound of an animal making off under cover of the darkness The brief account seemed to exercise a paralysing effect upon us all as we listened to it I can see the dishevelled group to this day the wind blowing the women s hair and Maloney craning his head forward to listen and his wife open mouthed and gasping leaning against a pine tree Come over to the stockade and we ll get the fire going I said that s the first thing for we were all shaking with the cold in our scanty garments And at that moment Sangree arrived wrapped in a blanket and carrying his gun he was still drunken with sleep The dog again Maloney explained briefly forestalling his questions been at Joan s tent Torn it by Gad this time It s time we did something He went on mumbling confusedly to himself Sangree gripped his gun and looked about swiftly in the darkness I saw his eyes aflame in the glare of the flickering lanterns He made a movement as though to start out and hunt and kill Then his glance fell on the girl crouching on the ground her face hidden in her hands and there leaped into his features an expression of savage anger that transformed them He could have faced a dozen lions with a walking stick at that moment and again I liked him for the strength of his anger his self control and his hopeless devotion But I stopped him going off on a blind and useless chase Come and help me start the fire Sangree I said anxious also to relieve the girl of our presence and a few minutes later the ashes still growing from the night s fire had kindled the fresh wood and there was a blaze that warmed us well while it also lit up the surrounding trees within a radius of twenty yards I heard nothing he whispered what in the world do you think it is It surely can t be only a dog We ll find that out later I said as the others came up to the grateful warmth the first thing is to make as big a fire as we can Joan was calmer now and her mother had put on some warmer and less miraculous garments And while they stood talking in low voices Maloney and I slipped off to examine the tent There was little enough to see but that little was unmistakable Some animal had scratched up the ground at the head of the tent and with a great blow of a powerful paw a paw clearly provided with good claws had struck the silk and torn it open There was a hole large enough to pass a fist and arm through It can t be far away Maloney said excitedly We ll organise a hunt at once this very minute We hurried back to the fire Maloney talking boisterously about his proposed hunt There s nothing like prompt action to dispel alarm he whispered in my ear and then turned to the rest of us We ll hunt the island from end to end at once he said with excitement that s what we ll do The beast can t be far away And the Bo sun s Mate and Joan must come too because they can t be left alone Hubbard you take the right shore and you Sangree the left and I ll go in the middle with the women In this way we can stretch clean across the ridge and nothing bigger than a rabbit can possibly escape us He was extraordinarily excited I thought Anything affecting Joan of course stirred him prodigiously Get your guns and we ll start the drive at once he cried He lit another lantern and handed one each to his wife and Joan and while I ran to fetch my gun I heard him singing to himself with the excitement of it all Meanwhile the dawn had come on quickly It made the flickering lanterns look pale The wind too was rising and I heard the trees moaning overhead and the waves breaking with increasing clamour on the shore In the lagoon the boat dipped and splashed and the sparks from the fire were carried aloft in a stream and scattered far and wide We made our way to the extreme end of the island measured our distances carefully and then began to advance None of us spoke Sangree and I with cocked guns watched the shore lines and all within easy touch and speaking distance It was a slow and blundering drive and there were many false alarms but after the best part of half an hour we stood on the farther end having made the complete tour and without putting up so much as a squirrel Certainly there was no living creature on that island but ourselves I know what it is cried Maloney looking out over the dim expanse of grey sea and speaking with the air of a man making a discovery it s a dog from one of the farms on the larger islands he pointed seawards where the archipelago thickened and it s escaped and turned wild Our fires and voices attracted it and it s probably half starved as well as savage poor brute No one said anything in reply and he began to sing again very low to himself The point where we stood a huddled shivering group faced the wider channels that led to the open sea and Finland The grey dawn had broken in earnest at last and we could see the racing waves with their angry crests of white The surrounding islands showed up as dark masses in the distance and in the east almost as Maloney spoke the sun came up with a rush in a stormy and magnificent sky of red and gold Against this splashed and gorgeous background black clouds shaped like fantastic and legendary animals filed past swiftly in a tearing stream and to this day I have only to close my eyes to see again that vivid and hurrying procession in the air All about us the pines made black splashes against the sky It was an angry sunrise Rain indeed had already begun to fall in big drops We turned as by a common instinct and without speech made our way back slowly to the stockade Maloney humming snatches of his songs Sangree in front with his gun prepared to shoot at a moment s notice and the women floundering in the rear with myself and the extinguished lanterns Yet it was only a dog Really it was most singular when one came to reflect soberly upon it all Events say the occultists have souls or at least that agglomerate life due to the emotions and thoughts of all concerned in them so that cities and even whole countries have great astral shapes which may become visible to the eye of vision and certainly here the soul of this drive this vain blundering futile drive stood somewhere between ourselves and laughed All of us heard that laugh and all of us tried hard to smother the sound or at least to ignore it Every one talked at once loudly and with exaggerated decision obviously trying to say something plausible against heavy odds striving to explain naturally that an animal might so easily conceal itself from us or swim away before we had time to light upon its trail For we all spoke of that trail as though it really existed and we had more to go upon than the mere marks of paws about the tents of Joan and the Canadian Indeed but for these and the torn tent I think it would of course have been possible to ignore the existence of this beast intruder altogether And it was here under this angry dawn as we stood in the shelter of the stockade from the pouring rain weary yet so strangely excited it was here out of this confusion of voices and explanations that very stealthily the ghost of something horrible slipped in and stood among us It made all our explanations seem childish and untrue the false relation was instantly exposed Eyes exchanged quick anxious glances questioning expressive of dismay There was a sense of wonder of poignant distress and of trepidation Alarm stood waiting at our elbows We shivered Then suddenly as we looked into each other s faces came the long unwelcome pause in which this new arrival established itself in our hearts And without further speech or attempt at explanation Maloney moved off abruptly to mix the porridge for an early breakfast Sangree to clean the fish myself to chop wood and tend the fire Joan and her mother to change their wet garments and most significant of all to prepare her mother s tent for its future complement of two Each went to his duty but hurriedly awkwardly silently and this new arrival this shape of terror and distress stalked viewless by the side of each If only I could have traced that dog I think was the thought in the minds of all But in Camp where every one realises how important the individual contribution is to the comfort and well being of all the mind speedily recovers tone and pulls itself together During the day a day of heavy and ceaseless rain we kept more or less to our tents and though there were signs of mysterious conferences between the three members of the Maloney family I think that most of us slept a good deal and stayed alone with his thoughts Certainly I did because when Maloney came to say that his wife invited us all to a special tea in her tent he had to shake me awake before I realised that he was there at all And by supper time we were more or less even minded again and almost jolly I only noticed that there was an undercurrent of what is best described as jumpiness and that the merest snapping of a twig or plop of a fish in the lagoon was sufficient to make us start and look over our shoulders Pauses were rare in our talk and the fire was never for one instant allowed to get low The wind and rain had ceased but the dripping of the branches still kept up an excellent imitation of a downpour In particular Maloney was vigilant and alert telling us a series of tales in which the wholesome humorous element was especially strong He lingered too behind with me after Sangree had gone to bed and while I mixed myself a glass of hot Swedish punch he did a thing I had never known him do before he mixed one for himself and then asked me to light him over to his tent We said nothing on the way but I felt that he was glad of my companionship I returned alone to the stockade and for a long time after that kept the fire blazing and sat up smoking and thinking I hardly knew why but sleep was far from me for one thing and for another an idea was taking form in my mind that required the comfort of tobacco and a bright fire for its growth I lay against a corner of the stockade seat listening to the wind whispering and to the ceaseless drip drip of the trees The night otherwise was very still and the sea quiet as a lake I remember that I was conscious peculiarly conscious of this host of desolate islands crowding about us in the darkness and that we were the one little spot of humanity in a rather wonderful kind of wilderness But this I think was the only symptom that came to warn me of highly strung nerves and it certainly was not sufficiently alarming to destroy my peace of mind One thing however did come to disturb my peace for just as I finally made ready to go and had kicked the embers of the fire into a last effort I fancied I saw peering at me round the farther end of the stockade wall a dark and shadowy mass that might have been that strongly resembled in fact the body of a large animal Two glowing eyes shone for an instant in the middle of it But the next second I saw that it was merely a projecting mass of moss and lichen in the wall of our stockade and the eyes were a couple of wandering sparks from the dying ashes I had kicked It was easy enough too to imagine I saw an animal moving here and there between the trees as I picked my way stealthily to my tent Of course the shadows tricked me And though it was after one o clock Maloney s light was still burning for I saw his tent shining white among the pines It was however in the short space between consciousness and sleep that time when the body is low and the voices of the submerged region tell sometimes true that the idea which had been all this while maturing reached the point of an actual decision and I suddenly realised that I had resolved to send word to doctor Silence For with a sudden wonder that I had hitherto been so blind the unwelcome conviction dawned upon me all at once that some dreadful thing was lurking about us on this island and that the safety of at least one of us was threatened by something monstrous and unclean that was too horrible to contemplate And again remembering those last words of his as the train moved out of the platform I understood that doctor Silence would hold himself in readiness to come Unless you should send for me sooner he had said I found myself suddenly wide awake It is impossible to say what woke me but it was no gradual process seeing that I jumped from deep sleep to absolute alertness in a single instant I had evidently slept for an hour and more for the night had cleared stars crowded the sky and a pallid half moon just sinking into the sea threw a spectral light between the trees I went outside to sniff the air and stood upright A curious impression that something was astir in the Camp came over me and when I glanced across at Sangree s tent some twenty feet away I saw that it was moving He too then was awake and restless for I saw the canvas sides bulge this way and that as he moved within The flap pushed forward He was coming out like myself to sniff the air and I was not surprised for its sweetness after the rain was intoxicating And he came on all fours just as I had done I saw a head thrust round the edge of the tent And then I saw that it was not Sangree at all It was an animal And the same instant I realised something else too it was the animal and its whole presentment for some unaccountable reason was unutterably malefic A cry I was quite unable to suppress escaped me and the creature turned on the instant and stared at me with baleful eyes I could have dropped on the spot for the strength all ran out of my body with a rush Something about it touched in me the living terror that grips and paralyses If the mind requires but the tenth of a second to form an impression I must have stood there stockstill for several seconds while I seized the ropes for support and stared Many and vivid impressions flashed through my mind but not one of them resulted in action because I was in instant dread that the beast any moment would leap in my direction and be upon me Instead however after what seemed a vast period it slowly turned its eyes from my face uttered a low whining sound and came out altogether into the open Then for the first time I saw it in its entirety and noted two things it was about the size of a large dog but at the same time it was utterly unlike any animal that I had ever seen Also that the quality that had impressed me first as being malefic was really only its singular and original strangeness Foolish as it may sound and impossible as it is for me to adduce proof I can only say that the animal seemed to me then to be not real But all this passed through my mind in a flash almost subconsciously and before I had time to check my impressions or even properly verify them I made an involuntary movement catching the tight rope in my hand so that it twanged like a banjo string and in that instant the creature turned the corner of Sangree s tent and was gone into the darkness Then of course my senses in some measure returned to me and I realised only one thing it had been inside his tent I dashed out reached the door in half a dozen strides and looked in The Canadian thank God lay upon his bed of branches His arm was stretched outside across the blankets the fist tightly clenched and the body had an appearance of unusual rigidity that was alarming On his face there was an expression of effort almost of painful effort so far as the uncertain light permitted me to see and his sleep seemed to be very profound He looked I thought so stiff so unnaturally stiff and in some indefinable way too he looked smaller shrunken I called to him to wake but called many times in vain Then I decided to shake him and had already moved forward to do so vigorously when there came a sound of footsteps padding softly behind me and I felt a stream of hot breath burn my neck as I stooped I turned sharply The tent door was darkened and something silently swept in I felt a rough and shaggy body push past me and knew that the animal had returned It seemed to leap forward between me and Sangree in fact to leap upon Sangree for its dark body hid him momentarily from view and in that moment my soul turned sick and coward with a horror that rose from the very dregs and depths of life and gripped my existence at its central source The creature seemed somehow to melt away into him almost as though it belonged to him and were a part of himself but in the same instant that instant of extraordinary confusion and terror in my mind it seemed to pass over and behind him and in some utterly unaccountable fashion it was gone And the Canadian woke and sat up with a start Quick You fool I cried in my excitement the beast has been in your tent here at your very throat while you sleep like the dead Up man Get your gun Only this second it disappeared over there behind your head Quick or Joan And somehow the fact that he was there wide awake now to corroborate me brought the additional conviction to my own mind that this was no animal but some perplexing and dreadful form of life that drew upon my deeper knowledge that much reading had perhaps assented to but that had never yet come within actual range of my senses He was up in a flash and out He was trembling and very white We searched hurriedly feverishly but found only the traces of paw marks passing from the door of his own tent across the moss to the women s And the sight of the tracks about missus Maloney s tent where Joan now slept set him in a perfect fury Do you know what it is Hubbard this beast he hissed under his breath at me it s a damned wolf that s what it is a wolf lost among the islands and starving to death desperate So help me God I believe it s that He talked a lot of rubbish in his excitement He declared he would sleep by day and sit up every night until he killed it Again his rage touched my admiration but I got him away before he made enough noise to wake the whole Camp I have a better plan than that I said watching his face closely I don t think this is anything we can deal with I m going to send for the only man I know who can help We ll go to Waxholm this very morning and get a telegram through Sangree stared at me with a curious expression as the fury died out of his face and a new look of alarm took its place John Silence I said will know You think it s something of that sort he stammered I am sure of it There was a moment s pause That s worse far worse than anything material he said turning visibly paler He looked from my face to the sky and then added with sudden resolution Come the wind s rising Let s get off at once From there you can telephone to Stockholm and get a telegram sent without delay I sent him down to get the boat ready and seized the opportunity myself to run and wake Maloney He was sleeping very lightly and sprang up the moment I put my head inside his tent I told him briefly what I had seen and he showed so little surprise that I caught myself wondering for the first time whether he himself had seen more going on than he had deemed wise to communicate to the rest of us He agreed to my plan without a moment s hesitation and my last words to him were to let his wife and daughter think that the great psychic doctor was coming merely as a chance visitor and not with any professional interest So with frying pan provisions and blankets aboard Sangree and I sailed out of the lagoon fifteen minutes later and headed with a good breeze for the direction of Waxholm and the borders of civilisation IV Although nothing John Silence did ever took me properly speaking by surprise it was certainly unexpected to find a letter from Stockholm waiting for me I have finished my Hungary business he wrote and am here for ten days Do not hesitate to send if you need me If you telephone any morning from Waxholm I can catch the afternoon steamer My years of intercourse with him were full of coincidences of this description and although he never sought to explain them by claiming any magical system of communication with my mind I have never doubted that there actually existed some secret telepathic method by which he knew my circumstances and gauged the degree of my need And that this power was independent of time in the sense that it saw into the future always seemed to me equally apparent Sangree was as much relieved as I was and within an hour of sunset that very evening we met him on the arrival of the little coasting steamer and carried him off in the dinghy to the camp we had prepared on a neighbouring island meaning to start for home early next morning Now he said when supper was over and we were smoking round the fire let me hear your story He glanced from one to the other smiling You tell it mister Hubbard Sangree interrupted abruptly and went off a little way to wash the dishes yet not so far as to be out of earshot And while he splashed with the hot water and scraped the tin plates with sand and moss my voice unbroken by a single question from doctor Silence ran on for the next half hour with the best account I could give of what had happened My listener lay on the other side of the fire his face half hidden by a big sombrero sometimes he glanced up questioningly when a point needed elaboration but he uttered no single word till I had reached the end and his manner all through the recital was grave and attentive Overhead the wash of the wind in the pine branches filled in the pauses the darkness settled down over the sea and the stars came out in thousands and by the time I finished the moon had risen to flood the scene with silver Yet by his face and eyes I knew quite well that the doctor was listening to something he had expected to hear even if he had not actually anticipated all the details You did well to send for me he said very low with a significant glance at me when I finished very well and for one swift second his eye took in Sangree for what we have to deal with here is nothing more than a werewolf rare enough I am glad to say but often very sad and sometimes very terrible I jumped as though I had been shot but the next second was heartily ashamed of my want of control for this brief remark confirming as it did my own worst suspicions did more to convince me of the gravity of the adventure than any number of questions or explanations It seemed to draw close the circle about us shutting a door somewhere that locked us in with the animal and the horror and turning the key Whatever it was had now to be faced and dealt with No one has been actually injured so far he asked aloud but in a matter of fact tone that lent reality to grim possibilities Good heavens no cried the Canadian throwing down his dishcloths and coming forward into the circle of firelight Surely there can be no question of this poor starved beast injuring anybody can there His hair straggled untidily over his forehead and there was a gleam in his eyes that was not all reflection from the fire His words made me turn sharply We all laughed a little short forced laugh I trust not indeed doctor Silence said quietly

none	none	The prompt question explained to me why I had started and I waited with just a tremor of excitement for the reply Sangree hesitated a moment as though the question took him by surprise But he met the doctor s gaze unflinchingly across the fire and with complete honesty Really he faltered with a little shrug of the shoulders I can hardly tell you The phrase seemed to come out of its own accord I have felt from the beginning that it was in pain and starved though why I felt this never occurred to me till you asked You really know very little about it then said the other with a sudden gentleness in his voice No more than that Sangree replied looking at him with a puzzled expression that was unmistakably genuine In fact nothing at all really he added by way of further explanation I am glad of that I heard the doctor murmur under his breath but so low that I only just caught the words and Sangree missed them altogether as evidently he was meant to do And now he cried getting on his feet and shaking himself with a characteristic gesture as though to shake out the horror and the mystery let us leave the problem till to morrow and enjoy this wind and sea and stars I ve been living lately in the atmosphere of many people and feel that I want to wash and be clean 
1336_138115_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I propose a swim and then bed 
none	none	Who ll second me And two minutes later we were all diving from the boat into cool deep water that reflected a thousand moons as the waves broke away from us in countless ripples We slept in blankets under the open sky Sangree and I taking the outside places and were up before sunrise to catch the dawn wind Helped by this early start we were half way home by noon and then the wind shifted to a few points behind us so that we fairly ran In and out among a thousand islands down narrow channels where we lost the wind out into open spaces where we had to take in a reef racing along under a hot and cloudless sky we flew through the very heart of the bewildering and lonely scenery A real wilderness cried doctor Silence from his seat in the bows where he held the jib sheet His hat was off his hair tumbled in the wind and his lean brown face gave him the touch of an Oriental Presently he changed places with Sangree and came down to talk with me by the tiller A wonderful region all this world of islands he said waving his hand to the scenery rushing past us but doesn t it strike you there s something lacking It s hard I answered after a moment s reflection It has a superficial glittering prettiness without I hesitated to find the word I wanted John Silence nodded his head with approval
1336_138115_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly he said 
none	none	The picturesqueness of stage scenery that is not real not alive It s like a landscape by a clever painter yet without true imagination Soulless that s the word you wanted Something like that I answered watching the gusts of wind on the sails Not dead so much as without soul That s it Of course he went on in a voice calculated it seemed to me not to reach our companion in the bows to live long in a place like this long and alone might bring about a strange result in some men I suddenly realised he was talking with a purpose and pricked up my ears There s no life here These islands are mere dead rocks pushed up from below the sea not living land and there s nothing really alive on them Even the sea this tideless brackish sea neither salt water nor fresh is dead It s all a pretty image of life without the real heart and soul of life To a man with too strong desires who came here and lived close to nature strange things might happen Let her out a bit I shouted to Sangree who was coming aft
1336_138115_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 The wind s gusty and we ve got hardly any ballast 
none	none	He went back to the bows and doctor Silence continued Here I mean a long sojourn would lead to deterioration to degeneration The place is utterly unsoftened by human influences by any humanising associations of history good or bad This landscape has never awakened into life it s still dreaming in its primitive sleep In time I put in you mean a man living here might become brutal The passions would run wild selfishness become supreme the instincts coarsen and turn savage probably But In other places just as wild parts of Italy for instance where there are other moderating influences it could not happen The character might grow wild savage too in a sense but with a human wildness one could understand and deal with But here in a hard place like this it might be otherwise He spoke slowly weighing his words carefully I looked at him with many questions in my eyes and a precautionary cry to Sangree to stay in the fore part of the boat out of earshot First of all there would come callousness to pain and indifference to the rights of others Then the soul would turn savage not from passionate human causes or with enthusiasm but by deadening down into a kind of cold primitive emotionless savagery by turning like the landscape soulless And a man with strong desires you say might change Without being aware of it yes he might turn savage his instincts and desires turn animal And if he lowered his voice and turned for a moment towards the bows and then continued in his most weighty manner owing to delicate health or other predisposing causes his Double you know what I mean of course his etheric Body of Desire or astral body as some term it that part in which the emotions passions and desires reside if this I say were for some constitutional reason loosely joined to his physical organism there might well take place an occasional projection Sangree came aft with a sudden rush his face aflame but whether with wind or sun or with what he had heard I cannot say In my surprise I let the tiller slip and the cutter gave a great plunge as she came sharply into the wind and flung us all together in a heap on the bottom Sangree said nothing but while he scrambled up and made the jib sheet fast my companion found a moment to add to his unfinished sentence the words too low for any ear but mine Entirely unknown to himself however We righted the boat and laughed and then Sangree produced the map and explained exactly where we were Far away on the horizon across an open stretch of water lay a blue cluster of islands with our crescent shaped home among them and the safe anchorage of the lagoon An hour with this wind would get us there comfortably and while doctor Silence and Sangree fell into conversation I sat and pondered over the strange suggestions that had just been put into my mind concerning the Double and the possible form it might assume when dissociated temporarily from the physical body The whole way home these two chatted and John Silence was as gentle and sympathetic as a woman I did not hear much of their talk for the wind grew occasionally to the force of a hurricane and the sails and tiller absorbed my attention but I could see that Sangree was pleased and happy and was pouring out intimate revelations to his companion in the way that most people did when John Silence wished them to do so But it was quite suddenly while I sat all intent upon wind and sails that the true meaning of Sangree s remark about the animal flared up in me with its full import For his admission that he knew it was in pain and starved was in reality nothing more or less than a revelation of his deeper self It was in the nature of a confession He was speaking of something that he knew positively something that was beyond question or argument something that had to do directly with himself Poor starved beast he had called it in words that had come out of their own accord and there had not been the slightest evidence of any desire to conceal or explain away He had spoken instinctively from his heart and as though about his own self And half an hour before sunset we raced through the narrow opening of the lagoon and saw the smoke of the dinner fire blowing here and there among the trees and the figures of Joan and the Bo sun s Mate running down to meet us at the landing stage V Everything changed from the moment John Silence set foot on that island it was like the effect produced by calling in some big doctor some great arbiter of life and death for consultation The sense of gravity increased a hundredfold Even inanimate objects took upon themselves a subtle alteration for the setting of the adventure this deserted bit of sea with its hundreds of uninhabited islands somehow turned sombre An element that was mysterious and in a sense disheartening crept unbidden into the severity of grey rock and dark pine forest and took the sparkle from the sunshine and the sea I at least was keenly aware of the change for my whole being shifted as it were a degree higher becoming keyed up and alert The figures from the background of the stage moved forward a little into the light nearer to the inevitable action In a word this man s arrival intensified the whole affair And looking back down the years to the time when all this happened it is clear to me that he had a pretty sharp idea of the meaning of it from the very beginning How much he knew beforehand by his strange divining powers it is impossible to say but from the moment he came upon the scene and caught within himself the note of what was going on amongst us he undoubtedly held the true solution of the puzzle and had no need to ask questions And this certitude it was that set him in such an atmosphere of power and made us all look to him instinctively for he took no tentative steps made no false moves and while the rest of us floundered he moved straight to the climax He was indeed a true diviner of souls I can now read into his behaviour a good deal that puzzled me at the time for though I had dimly guessed the solution I had no idea how he would deal with it And the conversations I can reproduce almost verbatim for according to my invariable habit I kept full notes of all he said To missus Maloney foolish and dazed to Joan alarmed yet plucky and to the clergyman moved by his daughter s distress below his usual shallow emotions he gave the best possible treatment in the best possible way yet all so easily and simply as to make it appear naturally spontaneous For he dominated the Bo sun s Mate taking the measure of her ignorance with infinite patience he keyed up Joan stirring her courage and interest to the highest point for her own safety and the Reverend Timothy he soothed and comforted while obtaining his implicit obedience by taking him into his confidence and leading him gradually to a comprehension of the issue that was bound to follow And Sangree here his wisdom was most wisely calculated he neglected outwardly because inwardly he was the object of his unceasing and most concentrated attention Under the guise of apparent indifference his mind kept the Canadian under constant observation There was a restless feeling in the Camp that evening and none of us lingered round the fire after supper as usual Sangree and I busied ourselves with patching up the torn tent for our guest and with finding heavy stones to hold the ropes for doctor Silence insisted on having it pitched on the highest point of the island ridge just where it was most rocky and there was no earth for pegs The place moreover was midway between the men s and women s tents and of course commanded the most comprehensive view of the Camp So that if your dog comes he said simply I may be able to catch him as he passes across The wind had gone down with the sun and an unusual warmth lay over the island that made sleep heavy and in the morning we assembled at a late breakfast rubbing our eyes and yawning The cool north wind had given way to the warm southern air that sometimes came up with haze and moisture across the Baltic bringing with it the relaxing sensations that produced enervation and listlessness And this may have been the reason why at first I failed to notice that anything unusual was about and why I was less alert than normally for it was not till after breakfast that the silence of our little party struck me and I discovered that Joan had not yet put in an appearance And then in a flash the last heaviness of sleep vanished and I saw that Maloney was white and troubled and his wife could not hold a plate without trembling A desire to ask questions was stopped in me by a swift glance from doctor Silence and I suddenly understood in some vague way that they were waiting till Sangree should have gone How this idea came to me I cannot determine but the soundness of the intuition was soon proved for the moment he moved off to his tent Maloney looked up at me and began to speak in a low voice You slept through it all he half whispered Through what I asked suddenly thrilled with the knowledge that something dreadful had happened We didn t wake you for fear of getting the whole Camp up he went on meaning by the Camp I supposed Sangree It was just before dawn when the screams woke me The dog again I asked with a curious sinking of the heart Got right into the tent he went on speaking passionately but very low and woke my wife by scrambling all over her Then she realised that Joan was struggling beside her And by God the beast had torn her arm scratched all down the arm she was and bleeding Joan injured I gasped Merely scratched this time put in John Silence speaking for the first time suffering more from shock and fright than actual wounds Isn t it a mercy the doctor was here said missus Maloney looking as if she would never know calmness again I think we should both have been killed It has been a most merciful escape Maloney said his pulpit voice struggling with his emotion But of course we cannot risk another we must strike Camp and get away at once Only poor mister Sangree must not know what has happened He is so attached to Joan and would be so terribly upset added the Bo sun s Mate distractedly looking all about in her terror It is perhaps advisable that mister Sangree should not know what has occurred doctor Silence said with quiet authority but I think for the safety of all concerned it will be better not to leave the island just now He spoke with great decision and Maloney looked up and followed his words closely If you will agree to stay here a few days longer I have no doubt we can put an end to the attentions of your strange visitor and incidentally have the opportunity of observing a most singular and interesting phenomenon What gasped missus Maloney a phenomenon you mean that you know what it is I am quite certain I know what it is he replied very low for we heard the footsteps of Sangree approaching though I am not so certain yet as to the best means of dealing with it But in any case it is not wise to leave precipitately Oh Timothy does he think it s a devil cried the Bo sun s Mate in a voice that even the Canadian must have heard In my opinion continued John Silence looking across at me and the clergyman it is a case of modern lycanthropy with other complications that may He left the sentence unfinished for missus Maloney got up with a jump and fled to her tent fearful she might hear a worse thing and at that moment Sangree turned the corner of the stockade and came into view There are footmarks all round the mouth of my tent he said with excitement The animal has been here again in the night doctor Silence you really must come and see them for yourself They re as plain on the moss as tracks in snow But later in the day while Sangree went off in the canoe to fish the pools near the larger islands and Joan still lay bandaged and resting in her tent doctor Silence called me and the tutor and proposed a walk to the granite slabs at the far end missus Maloney sat on a stump near her daughter and busied herself energetically with alternate nursing and painting We ll leave you in charge the doctor said with a smile that was meant to be encouraging and when you want us for lunch or anything the megaphone will always bring us back in time For though the very air was charged with strange emotions every one talked quietly and naturally as with a definite desire to counteract unnecessary excitement I ll keep watch said the plucky Bo sun s Mate and meanwhile I find comfort in my work She was busy with the sketch she had begun on the day after our arrival For even a tree she added proudly pointing to her little easel is a symbol of the divine and the thought makes me feel safer We glanced for a moment at a daub which was more like the symptom of a disease than a symbol of the divine and then took the path round the lagoon At the far end we made a little fire and lay round it in the shadow of a big boulder Maloney stopped his humming suddenly and turned to his companion And what do you make of it all he asked abruptly In the first place replied John Silence making himself comfortable against the rock it is of human origin this animal it is undoubted lycanthropy His words had the effect precisely of a bombshell Maloney listened as though he had been struck You puzzle me utterly he said sitting up closer and staring at him Perhaps replied the other but if you ll listen to me for a few moments you may be less puzzled at the end or more It depends how much you know Let me go further and say that you have underestimated or miscalculated the effect of this primitive wild life upon all of you In what way asked the clergyman bristling a trifle It is strong medicine for any town dweller and for some of you it has been too strong One of you has gone wild He uttered these last words with great emphasis Gone savage he added looking from one to the other Neither of us found anything to reply To say that the brute has awakened in a man is not a mere metaphor always he went on presently Of course not But in the sense I mean may have a very literal and terrible significance pursued doctor Silence Ancient instincts that no one dreamed of least of all their possessor may leap forth Atavism can hardly explain a roaming animal with teeth and claws and sanguinary instincts interrupted Maloney with impatience The term is of your own choice continued the doctor equably not mine and it is a good example of a word that indicates a result while it conceals the process but the explanation of this beast that haunts your island and attacks your daughter is of far deeper significance than mere atavistic tendencies or throwing back to animal origin which I suppose is the thought in your mind You spoke just now of lycanthropy said Maloney looking bewildered and anxious to keep to plain facts evidently I think I have come across the word but really really it can have no actual significance to day can it These superstitions of mediaeval times can hardly He looked round at me with his jolly red face and the expression of astonishment and dismay on it would have made me shout with laughter at any other time Laughter however was never farther from my mind than at this moment when I listened to doctor Silence as he carefully suggested to the clergyman the very explanation that had gradually been forcing itself upon my own mind However mediaeval ideas may have exaggerated the idea is not of much importance to us now he said quietly when we are face to face with a modern example of what I take it has always been a profound fact For the moment let us leave the name of any one in particular out of the matter and consider certain possibilities We all agreed with that at any rate There was no need to speak of Sangree or of any one else until we knew a little more The fundamental fact in this most curious case he went on is that the Double of a man You mean the astral body I ve heard of that of course broke in Maloney with a snort of triumph No doubt said the other smiling no doubt you have that this Double or fluidic body of a man as I was saying has the power under certain conditions of projecting itself and becoming visible to others Certain training will accomplish this and certain drugs likewise illnesses too that ravage the body may produce temporarily the result that death produces permanently and let loose this counterpart of a human being and render it visible to the sight of others Every one of course knows this more or less to day but it is not so generally known and probably believed by none who have not witnessed it that this fluidic body can under certain conditions assume other forms than human and that such other forms may be determined by the dominating thought and wish of the owner For this Double or astral body as you call it is really the seat of the passions emotions and desires in the psychical economy It is the Passion Body and in projecting itself it can often assume a form that gives expression to the overmastering desire that moulds it for it is composed of such tenuous matter that it lends itself readily to the moulding by thought and wish I follow you perfectly said Maloney looking as if he would much rather be chopping firewood elsewhere and singing And there are some persons so constituted the doctor went on with increasing seriousness that the fluid body in them is but loosely associated with the physical persons of poor health as a rule yet often of strong desires and passions and in these persons it is easy for the Double to dissociate itself during deep sleep from their system and driven forth by some consuming desire to assume an animal form and seek the fulfilment of that desire There in broad daylight I saw Maloney deliberately creep closer to the fire and heap the wood on We gathered in to the heat and to each other and listened to doctor Silence s voice as it mingled with the swish and whirr of the wind about us and the falling of the little waves For instance to take a concrete example he resumed suppose some young man with the delicate constitution I have spoken of forms an overpowering attachment to a young woman yet perceives that it is not welcomed and is man enough to repress its outward manifestations In such a case supposing his Double be easily projected the very repression of his love in the daytime would add to the intense force of his desire when released in deep sleep from the control of his will and his fluidic body might issue forth in monstrous or animal shape and become actually visible to others And if his devotion were dog like in its fidelity yet concealing the fires of a fierce passion beneath it might well assume the form of a creature that seemed to be half dog half wolf A werewolf you mean cried Maloney pale to the lips as he listened John Silence held up a restraining hand A werewolf he said is a true psychical fact of profound significance however absurdly it may have been exaggerated by the imaginations of a superstitious peasantry in the days of unenlightenment for a werewolf is nothing but the savage and possibly sanguinary instincts of a passionate man scouring the world in his fluidic body his passion body his body of desire As in the case at hand he may not know it It is not necessarily deliberate then Maloney put in quickly with relief It is hardly ever deliberate It is the desires released in sleep from the control of the will finding a vent In all savage races it has been recognised and dreaded this phenomenon styled Wehr Wolf but to day it is rare And it is becoming rarer still for the world grows tame and civilised emotions have become refined desires lukewarm and few men have savagery enough left in them to generate impulses of such intense force and certainly not to project them in animal form By Gad exclaimed the clergyman breathlessly and with increasing excitement then I feel I must tell you what has been given to me in confidence that Sangree has in him an admixture of savage blood of Red Indian ancestry Let us stick to our supposition of a man as described the doctor stopped him calmly and let us imagine that he has in him this admixture of savage blood and further that he is wholly unaware of his dreadful physical and psychical infirmity and that he suddenly finds himself leading the primitive life together with the object of his desires with the result that the strain of the untamed wild man in his blood Red Indian for instance from Maloney Red Indian perfectly agreed the doctor the result I say that this savage strain in him is awakened and leaps into passionate life What then He looked hard at Timothy Maloney and the clergyman looked hard at him The wild life such as you lead here on this island for instance might quickly awaken his savage instincts his buried instincts and with profoundly disquieting results You mean his Subtle Body as you call it might issue forth automatically in deep sleep and seek the object of its desire I said coming to Maloney s aid who was finding it more and more difficult to get words Precisely yet the desire of the man remaining utterly unmalefic pure and wholesome in every sense Ah I heard the clergyman gasp The lover s desire for union run wild run savage tearing its way out in primitive untamed fashion I mean continued the doctor striving to make himself clear to a mind bounded by conventional thought and knowledge for the desire to possess remember may easily become importunate and embodied in this animal form of the Subtle Body which acts as its vehicle may go forth to tear in pieces all that obstructs to reach to the very heart of the loved object and seize it Au fond it is nothing more than the aspiration for union as I said the splendid and perfectly clean desire to absorb utterly into itself He paused a moment and looked into Maloney s eyes To bathe in the very heart s blood of the one desired he added with grave emphasis The fire spurted and crackled and made me start but Maloney found relief in a genuine shudder and I saw him turn his head and look about him from the sea to the trees The wind dropped just at that moment and the doctor s words rang sharply through the stillness Then it might even kill stammered the clergyman presently in a hushed voice and with a little forced laugh by way of protest that sounded quite ghastly In the last resort it might kill repeated doctor Silence Then after another pause during which he was clearly debating how much or how little it was wise to give to his audience he continued And if the Double does not succeed in getting back to its physical body that physical body would wake an imbecile an idiot or perhaps never wake at all Maloney sat up and found his tongue You mean that if this fluid animal thing or whatever it is should be prevented getting back the man might never wake again he asked with shaking voice He might be dead replied the other calmly The tremor of a positive sensation shivered in the air about us Then isn t that the best way to cure the fool the brute thundered the clergyman half rising to his feet Certainly it would be an easy and undiscoverable form of murder was the stern reply spoken as calmly as though it were a remark about the weather Maloney collapsed visibly and I gathered the wood over the fire and coaxed up a blaze The greater part of the man s life of his vital forces goes out with this Double doctor Silence resumed after a moment s consideration and a considerable portion of the actual material of his physical body So the physical body that remains behind is depleted not only of force but of matter You would see it small shrunken dropped together just like the body of a materialising medium at a seance Moreover any mark or injury inflicted upon this Double will be found exactly reproduced by the phenomenon of repercussion upon the shrunken physical body lying in its trance An injury inflicted upon the one you say would be reproduced also on the other repeated Maloney his excitement growing again Undoubtedly replied the other quietly for there exists all the time a continuous connection between the physical body and the Double a connection of matter though of exceedingly attenuated possibly of etheric matter The wound travels so to speak from one to the other and if this connection were broken the result would be death Death repeated Maloney to himself death He looked anxiously at our faces his thoughts evidently beginning to clear And this solidity he asked presently after a general pause this tearing of tents and flesh this howling and the marks of paws You mean that the Double Has sufficient material drawn from the depleted body to produce physical results Certainly the doctor took him up Although to explain at this moment such problems as the passage of matter through matter would be as difficult as to explain how the thought of a mother can actually break the bones of the child unborn doctor Silence pointed out to sea and Maloney looking wildly about him turned with a violent start I saw a canoe with Sangree in the stern seat slowly coming into view round the farther point His hat was off and his tanned face for the first time appeared to me to us all I think as though it were the face of some one else He looked like a wild man Then he stood up in the canoe to make a cast with the rod and he looked for all the world like an Indian I recalled the expression of his face as I had seen it once or twice notably on that occasion of the evening prayer and an involuntary shudder ran down my spine At that very instant he turned and saw us where we lay and his face broke into a smile so that his teeth showed white in the sun He looked in his element and exceedingly attractive He called out something about his fish and soon after passed out of sight into the lagoon For a time none of us said a word And the cure ventured Maloney at length Is not to quench this savage force replied doctor Silence but to steer it better and to provide other outlets This is the solution of all these problems of accumulated force for this force is the raw material of usefulness and should be increased and cherished not by separating it from the body by death but by raising it to higher channels The best and quickest cure of all he went on speaking very gently and with a hand upon the clergyman s arm is to lead it towards its object provided that object is not unalterably hostile to let it find rest where He stopped abruptly and the eyes of the two men met in a single glance of comprehension Joan Maloney exclaimed under his breath Joan replied John Silence We all went to bed early The day had been unusually warm and after sunset a curious hush descended on the island Nothing was audible but that faint ghostly singing which is inseparable from a pinewood even on the stillest day a low searching sound as though the wind had hair and trailed it o er the world With the sudden cooling of the atmosphere a sea fog began to form It appeared in isolated patches over the water and then these patches slid together and a white wall advanced upon us Not a breath of air stirred the firs stood like flat metal outlines the sea became as oil The whole scene lay as though held motionless by some huge weight in the air and the flames from our fire the largest we had ever made rose upwards straight as a church steeple As I followed the rest of our party tent wards having kicked the embers of the fire into safety the advance guard of the fog was creeping slowly among the trees like white arms feeling their way Mingled with the smoke was the odour of moss and soil and bark and the peculiar flavour of the Baltic half salt half brackish like the smell of an estuary at low water It is difficult to say why it seemed to me that this deep stillness masked an intense activity perhaps in every mood lies the suggestion of its opposite so that I became aware of the contrast of furious energy for it was like moving through the deep pause before a thunderstorm and I trod gently lest by breaking a twig or moving a stone I might set the whole scene into some sort of tumultuous movement Actually no doubt it was nothing more than a result of overstrung nerves There was no more question of undressing and going to bed than there was of undressing and going to bathe Some sense in me was alert and expectant I sat in my tent and waited And at the end of half an hour or so my waiting was justified for the canvas suddenly shivered and some one tripped over the ropes that held it to the earth John Silence came in The effect of his quiet entry was singular and prophetic it was just as though the energy lying behind all this stillness had pressed forward to the edge of action This no doubt was merely the quickening of my own mind and had no other justification for the presence of John Silence always suggested the near possibility of vigorous action and as a matter of fact he came in with nothing more than a nod and a significant gesture He sat down on a corner of my ground sheet and I pushed the blanket over so that he could cover his legs He drew the flap of the tent after him and settled down but hardly had he done so when the canvas shook a second time and in blundered Maloney Sitting in the dark he said self consciously pushing his head inside and hanging up his lantern on the ridge pole nail I just looked in for a smoke I suppose He glanced round caught the eye of doctor Silence and stopped He put his pipe back into his pocket and began to hum softly that underbreath humming of a nondescript melody I knew so well and had come to hate doctor Silence leaned forward opened the lantern and blew the light out Speak low he said and don t strike matches Listen for sounds and movements about the Camp and be ready to follow me at a moment s notice There was light enough to distinguish our faces easily and I saw Maloney glance again hurriedly at both of us Is the Camp asleep the doctor asked presently whispering Sangree is replied the clergyman in a voice equally low I can t answer for the women I think they re sitting up That s for the best And then he added I wish the fog would thin a bit and let the moon through later we may want it It is lifting now I think Maloney whispered back It s over the tops of the trees already I cannot say what it was in this commonplace exchange of remarks that thrilled Probably Maloney s swift acquiescence in the doctor s mood had something to do with it for his quick obedience certainly impressed me a good deal But even without that slight evidence it was clear that each recognised the gravity of the occasion and understood that sleep was impossible and sentry duty was the order of the night Report to me repeated John Silence once again the least sound and do nothing precipitately He shifted across to the mouth of the tent and raised the flap fastening it against the pole so that he could see out Maloney stopped humming and began to force the breath through his teeth with a kind of faint hissing treating us to a medley of church hymns and popular songs of the day Then the tent trembled as though some one had touched it That s the wind rising whispered the clergyman and pulled the flap open as far as it would go A waft of cold damp air entered and made us shiver and with it came a sound of the sea as the first wave washed its way softly along the shores It s got round to the north he added and following his voice came a long drawn whisper that rose from the whole island as the trees sent forth a sighing response The fog ll move a bit now I can make out a lane across the sea already Hush said doctor Silence for Maloney s voice had risen above a whisper and we settled down again to another long period of watching and waiting broken only by the occasional rubbing of shoulders against the canvas as we shifted our positions and the increasing noise of waves on the outer coast line of the island And over all whirred the murmur of wind sweeping the tops of the trees like a great harp and the faint tapping on the tent as drops fell from the branches with a sharp pinging sound We had sat for something over an hour in this way and Maloney and I were finding it increasingly hard to keep awake when suddenly doctor Silence rose to his feet and peered out The next minute he was gone Relieved of the dominating presence the clergyman thrust his face close into mine I don t much care for this waiting game he whispered but Silence wouldn t hear of my sitting up with the others he said it would prevent anything happening if I did He knows I answered shortly No doubt in the world about that he whispered back it s this Double business as he calls it or else it s obsession as the Bible describes it But it s bad whichever it is and I ve got my Winchester outside ready cocked and I brought this too He shoved a pocket Bible under my nose At one time in his life it had been his inseparable companion One s useless and the other s dangerous I replied under my breath conscious of a keen desire to laugh and leaving him to choose Safety lies in following our leader I m not thinking of myself he interrupted sharply only if anything happens to Joan to night I m going to shoot first and pray afterwards Maloney put the book back into his hip pocket and peered out of the doorway What is he up to now in the devil s name I wonder he added going round Sangree s tent and making gestures How weird he looks disappearing in and out of the fog Just trust him and wait I said quickly for the doctor was already on his way back Remember he has the knowledge and knows what he s about I ve been with him through worse cases than this Maloney moved back as doctor Silence darkened the doorway and stooped to enter His sleep is very deep he whispered seating himself by the door again He s in a cataleptic condition and the Double may be released any minute now But I ve taken steps to imprison it in the tent and it can t get out till I permit it Be on the watch for signs of movement Then he looked hard at Maloney But no violence or shooting remember mister Maloney unless you want a murder on your hands Anything done to the Double acts by repercussion upon the physical body You had better take out the cartridges at once His voice was stern The clergyman went out and I heard him emptying the magazine of his rifle When he returned he sat nearer the door than before and from that moment until we left the tent he never once took his eyes from the figure of doctor Silence silhouetted there against sky and canvas And meanwhile the wind came steadily over the sea and opened the mist into lanes and clearings driving it about like a living thing It must have been well after midnight when a low booming sound drew my attention but at first the sense of hearing was so strained that it was impossible exactly to locate it and I imagined it was the thunder of big guns far out at sea carried to us by the rising wind Then Maloney catching hold of my arm and leaning forward somehow brought the true relation and I realised the next second that it was only a few feet away Sangree s tent he exclaimed in a loud and startled whisper I craned my head round the corner but at first the effect of the fog was so confusing that every patch of white driving about before the wind looked like a moving tent and it was some seconds before I discovered the one patch that held steady Then I saw that it was shaking all over and the sides flapping as much as the tightness of the ropes allowed were the cause of the booming sound we had heard Something alive was tearing frantically about inside banging against the stretched canvas in a way that made me think of a great moth dashing against the walls and ceiling of a room The tent bulged and rocked It s trying to get out by Jupiter muttered the clergyman rising to his feet and turning to the side where the unloaded rifle lay I sprang up too hardly knowing what purpose was in my mind but anxious to be prepared for anything John Silence however was before us both and his figure slipped past and blocked the doorway of the tent And there was some quality in his voice next minute when he began to speak that brought our minds instantly to a state of calm obedience First the women s tent he said low looking sharply at Maloney and if I need your help I ll call The clergyman needed no second bidding He dived past me and was out in a moment He was labouring evidently under intense excitement I watched him picking his way silently over the slippery ground giving the moving tent a wide berth and presently disappearing among the floating shapes of fog doctor Silence turned to me You heard those footsteps about half an hour ago he asked significantly I heard nothing They were extraordinarily soft almost the soundless tread of a wild creature But now follow me closely he added for we must waste no time if I am to save this poor man from his affliction and lead his werewolf Double to its rest And unless I am much mistaken he peered at me through the darkness whispering with the utmost distinctness Joan and Sangree are absolutely made for one another And I think she knows it too just as well as he does My head swam a little as I listened but at the same time something cleared in my brain and I saw that he was right Yet it was all so weird and incredible so remote from the commonplace facts of life as commonplace people know them and more than once it flashed upon me that the whole scene people words tents and all the rest of it were delusions created by the intense excitement of my own mind somehow and that suddenly the sea fog would clear off and the world become normal again The cold air from the sea stung our cheeks sharply as we left the close atmosphere of the little crowded tent The sighing of the trees the waves breaking below on the rocks and the lines and patches of mist driving about us seemed to create the momentary illusion that the whole island had broken loose and was floating out to sea like a mighty raft The doctor moved just ahead of me quickly and silently he was making straight for the Canadian s tent where the sides still boomed and shook as the creature of sinister life raced and tore about impatiently within A little distance from the door he paused and held up a hand to stop me We were perhaps a dozen feet away Before I release it you shall see for yourself he said that the reality of the werewolf is beyond all question The matter of which it is composed is of course exceedingly attenuated but you are partially clairvoyant and even if it is not dense enough for normal sight you will see something He added a little more I could not catch The fact was that the curiously strong vibrating atmosphere surrounding his person somewhat confused my senses It was the result of course of his intense concentration of mind and forces and pervaded the entire Camp and all the persons in it And as I watched the canvas shake and heard it boom and flap I heartily welcomed it For it was also protective At the back of Sangree s tent stood a thin group of pine trees but in front and at the sides the ground was comparatively clear The flap was wide open and any ordinary animal would have been out and away without the least trouble doctor Silence led me up to within a few feet evidently careful not to advance beyond a certain limit and then stooped down and signalled to me to do the same And looking over his shoulder I saw the interior lit faintly by the spectral light reflected from the fog and the dim blot upon the balsam boughs and blankets signifying Sangree while over him and round him and up and down him flew the dark mass of something on four legs with pointed muzzle and sharp ears plainly visible against the tent sides and the occasional gleam of fiery eyes and white fangs I held my breath and kept utterly still inwardly and outwardly for fear I suppose that the creature would become conscious of my presence but the distress I felt went far deeper than the mere sense of personal safety or the fact of watching something so incredibly active and real I became keenly aware of the dreadful psychic calamity it involved The realisation that Sangree lay confined in that narrow space with this species of monstrous projection of himself that he was wrapped there in the cataleptic sleep all unconscious that this thing was masquerading with his own life and energies added a distressing touch of horror to the scene In all the cases of John Silence and they were many and often terrible no other psychic affliction has ever before or since impressed me so convincingly with the pathetic impermanence of the human personality with its fluid nature and with the alarming possibilities of its transformations Come he whispered after we had watched for some minutes the frantic efforts to escape from the circle of thought and will that held it prisoner come a little farther away while I release it We moved back a dozen yards or so It was like a scene in some impossible play or in some ghastly and oppressive nightmare from which I should presently awake to find the blankets all heaped up upon my chest By some method undoubtedly mental but which in my confusion and excitement I failed to understand the doctor accomplished his purpose and the next minute I heard him say sharply under his breath It s out Now watch At this very moment a sudden gust from the sea blew aside the mist so that a lane opened to the sky and the moon ghastly and unnatural as the effect of stage limelight dropped down in a momentary gleam upon the door of Sangree s tent and I perceived that something had moved forward from the interior darkness and stood clearly defined upon the threshold And at the same moment the tent ceased its shuddering and held still There in the doorway stood an animal with neck and muzzle thrust forward its head poking into the night its whole body poised in that attitude of intense rigidity that precedes the spring into freedom the running leap of attack It seemed to be about the size of a calf leaner than a mastiff yet more squat than a wolf and I can swear that I saw the fur ridged sharply upon its back Then its upper lip slowly lifted and I saw the whiteness of its teeth Surely no human being ever stared as hard as I did in those next few minutes Yet the harder I stared the clearer appeared the amazing and monstrous apparition For after all it was Sangree and yet it was not Sangree It was the head and face of an animal and yet it was the face of Sangree the face of a wild dog a wolf and yet his face The eyes were sharper narrower more fiery yet they were his eyes his eyes run wild the teeth were longer whiter more pointed yet they were his teeth his teeth grown cruel the expression was flaming terrible exultant yet it was his expression carried to the border of savagery his expression as I had already surprised it more than once only dominant now fully released from human constraint with the mad yearning of a hungry and importunate soul It was the soul of Sangree the long suppressed deeply loving Sangree expressed in its single and intense desire pure utterly and utterly wonderful Yet at the same time came the feeling that it was all an illusion I suddenly remembered the extraordinary changes the human face can undergo in circular insanity when it changes from melancholia to elation and I recalled the effect of hascheesh which shows the human countenance in the form of the bird or animal to which in character it most approximates and for a moment I attributed this mingling of Sangree s face with a wolf to some kind of similar delusion of the senses I was mad deluded dreaming The excitement of the day and this dim light of stars and bewildering mist combined to trick me I had been amazingly imposed upon by some false wizardry of the senses It was all absurd and fantastic it would pass And then sounding across this sea of mental confusion like a bell through a fog came the voice of John Silence bringing me back to a consciousness of the reality of it all Sangree in his Double And when I looked again more calmly I plainly saw that it was indeed the face of the Canadian but his face turned animal yet mingled with the brute expression a curiously pathetic look like the soul seen sometimes in the yearning eyes of a dog the face of an animal shot with vivid streaks of the human The doctor called to him softly under his breath Sangree Sangree you poor afflicted creature Do you know me Can you understand what it is you re doing in your Body of Desire For the first time since its appearance the creature moved Its ears twitched and it shifted the weight of its body on to the hind legs Then lifting its head and muzzle to the sky it opened its long jaws and gave vent to a dismal and prolonged howling But when I heard that howling rise to heaven the breath caught and strangled in my throat and it seemed that my heart missed a beat for though the sound was entirely animal it was at the same time entirely human But more than that it was the cry I had so often heard in the Western States of America where the Indians still fight and hunt and struggle it was the cry of the Redskin The Indian blood whispered John Silence when I caught his arm for support the ancestral cry And that poignant beseeching cry that broken human voice mingling with the savage howl of the brute beast pierced straight to my very heart and touched there something that no music no voice passionate or tender of man woman or child has ever stirred before or since for one second into life It echoed away among the fog and the trees and lost itself somewhere out over the hidden sea And some part of myself something that was far more than the mere act of intense listening went out with it and for several minutes I lost consciousness of my surroundings and felt utterly absorbed in the pain of another stricken fellow creature Again the voice of John Silence recalled me to myself Hark he said aloud Hark His tone galvanised me afresh We stood listening side by side Far across the island faintly sounding through the trees and brushwood came a similar answering cry Shrill yet wonderfully musical shaking the heart with a singular wild sweetness that defies description we heard it rise and fall upon the night air It s across the lagoon doctor Silence cried but this time in full tones that paid no tribute to caution It s Joan She s answering him Again the wonderful cry rose and fell and that same instant the animal lowered its head and muzzle to earth set off on a swift easy canter that took it off into the mist and out of our sight like a thing of wind and vision The doctor made a quick dash to the door of Sangree s tent and following close at his heels I peered in and caught a momentary glimpse of the small shrunken body lying upon the branches but half covered by the blankets the cage from which most of the life and not a little of the actual corporeal substance had escaped into that other form of life and energy the body of passion and desire By another of those swift incalculable processes which at this stage of my apprenticeship I failed often to grasp doctor Silence reclosed the circle about the tent and body Now it cannot return till I permit it he said and the next second was off at full speed into the woods with myself close behind him I had already had some experience of my companion s ability to run swiftly through a dense wood and I now had the further proof of his power almost to see in the dark For once we left the open space about the tents the trees seemed to absorb all the remaining vestiges of light and I understood that special sensibility that is said to develop in the blind the sense of obstacles And twice as we ran we heard the sound of that dismal howling drawing nearer and nearer to the answering faint cry from the point of the island whither we were going Then suddenly the trees fell away and we emerged hot and breathless upon the rocky point where the granite slabs ran bare into the sea It was like passing into the clearness of open day And there sharply defined against sea and sky stood the figure of a human being It was Joan I at once saw that there was something about her appearance that was singular and unusual but it was only when we had moved quite close that I recognised what caused it For while the lips wore a smile that lit the whole face with a happiness I had never seen there before the eyes themselves were fixed in a steady sightless stare as though they were lifeless and made of glass I made an impulsive forward movement but doctor Silence instantly dragged me back No he cried don t wake her What do you mean I replied aloud struggling in his grasp She s asleep It s somnambulistic The shock might injure her permanently I turned and peered closely into his face He was absolutely calm I began to understand a little more catching I suppose something of his strong thinking Walking in her sleep you mean He nodded She s on her way to meet him From the very beginning he must have drawn her irresistibly But the torn tent and the wounded flesh When she did not sleep deep enough to enter the somnambulistic trance he missed her he went instinctively and in all innocence to seek her out with the result of course that she woke and was terrified Then in their heart of hearts they love I asked finally John Silence smiled his inscrutable smile Profoundly he answered and as simply as only primitive souls can love If only they both come to realise it in their normal waking states his Double will cease these nocturnal excursions He will be cured and at rest The words had hardly left his lips when there was a sound of rustling branches on our left and the very next instant the dense brushwood parted where it was darkest and out rushed the swift form of an animal at full gallop The noise of feet was scarcely audible but in that utter stillness I heard the heavy panting breath and caught the swish of the low bushes against its sides It went straight towards Joan and as it went the girl lifted her head and turned to meet it And the same instant a canoe that had been creeping silently and unobserved round the inner shore of the lagoon emerged from the shadows and defined itself upon the water with a figure at the middle thwart It was Maloney It was only afterwards I realised that we were invisible to him where we stood against the dark background of trees the figures of Joan and the animal he saw plainly but not doctor Silence and myself standing just beyond them He stood up in the canoe and pointed with his right arm I saw something gleam in his hand Stand aside Joan girl or you ll get hit he shouted his voice ringing horribly through the deep stillness and the same instant a pistol shot cracked out with a burst of flame and smoke and the figure of the animal with one tremendous leap into the air fell back in the shadows and disappeared like a shape of night and fog Instantly then Joan opened her eyes looked in a dazed fashion about her and pressing both hands against her heart fell with a sharp cry into my arms that were just in time to catch her And an answering cry sounded across the lagoon thin wailing piteous It came from Sangree s tent Fool cried doctor Silence you ve wounded him and before we could move or realise quite what it meant he was in the canoe and half way across the lagoon Some kind of similar abuse came in a torrent from my lips too though I cannot remember the actual words as I cursed the man for his disobedience and tried to make the girl comfortable on the ground But the clergyman was more practical He was spreading his coat over her and dashing water on her face It s not Joan I ve killed at any rate I heard him mutter as she turned and opened her eyes and smiled faintly up in his face I swear the bullet went straight Joan stared at him she was still dazed and bewildered and still imagined herself with the companion of her trance The strange lucidity of the somnambulist still hung over her brain and mind though outwardly she appeared troubled and confused Where has he gone to He disappeared so suddenly crying that he was hurt she asked looking at her father as though she did not recognise him And if they ve done anything to him they have done it to me too for he is more to me than Her words grew vaguer and vaguer as she returned slowly to her normal waking state and now she stopped altogether as though suddenly aware that she had been surprised into telling secrets But all the way back as we carried her carefully through the trees the girl smiled and murmured Sangree s name and asked if he was injured until it finally became clear to me that the wild soul of the one had called to the wild soul of the other and in the secret depths of their beings the call had been heard and understood John Silence was right In the abyss of her heart too deep at first for recognition the girl loved him and had loved him from the very beginning Once her normal waking consciousness recognised the fact they would leap together like twin flames and his affliction would be at an end his intense desire would be satisfied he would be cured And in Sangree s tent doctor Silence and I sat up for the remainder of the night this wonderful and haunted night that had shown us such strange glimpses of a new heaven and a new hell for the Canadian tossed upon his balsam boughs with high fever in his blood and upon each cheek a dark and curious contusion showed throbbing with severe pain although the skin was not broken and there was no outward and visible sign of blood Maloney shot straight you see whispered doctor Silence to me after the clergyman had gone to his tent and had put Joan to sleep beside her mother who by the way had never once awakened The bullet must have passed clean through the face for both cheeks are stained He ll wear these marks all his life smaller but always there They re the most curious scars in the world these scars transferred by repercussion from an injured Double They ll remain visible until just before his death and then with the withdrawal of the subtle body they will disappear finally His words mingled in my dazed mind with the sighs of the troubled sleeper and the crying of the wind about the tent Nothing seemed to paralyse my powers of realisation so much as these twin stains of mysterious significance upon the face before me It was odd too how speedily and easily the Camp resigned itself again to sleep and quietness as though a stage curtain had suddenly dropped down upon the action and concealed it and nothing contributed so vividly to the feeling that I had been a spectator of some kind of visionary drama as the dramatic nature of the change in the girl s attitude Yet as a matter of fact the change had not been so sudden and revolutionary as appeared Underneath in those remoter regions of consciousness where the emotions unknown to their owners do secretly mature and owe thence their abrupt revelation to some abrupt psychological climax there can be no doubt that Joan s love for the Canadian had been growing steadily and irresistibly all the time It had now rushed to the surface so that she recognised it that was all And it has always seemed to me that the presence of John Silence so potent so quietly efficacious produced an effect if one may say so of a psychic forcing house and hastened incalculably the bringing together of these two wild lovers In that sudden awakening had occurred the very psychological climax required to reveal the passionate emotion accumulated below The deeper knowledge had leaped across and transferred itself to her ordinary consciousness and in that shock the collision of the personalities had shaken them to the depths and shown her the truth beyond all possibility of doubt He s sleeping quietly now the doctor said interrupting my reflections If you will watch alone for a bit I ll go to Maloney s tent and help him to arrange his thoughts He smiled in anticipation of that arrangement He ll never quite understand how a wound on the Double can transfer itself to the physical body but at least I can persuade him that the less he talks and explains to morrow the sooner the forces will run their natural course now to peace and quietness He went away softly and with the removal of his presence Sangree sleeping heavily turned over and groaned with the pain of his broken head And it was in the still hour just before the dawn when all the islands were hushed the wind and sea still dreaming and the stars visible through clearing mists that a figure crept silently over the ridge and reached the door of the tent where I dozed beside the sufferer before I was aware of its presence The flap was cautiously lifted a few inches and in looked Joan That same instant Sangree woke and sat up on his bed of branches He recognised her before I could say a word and uttered a low cry It was pain and joy mingled and this time all human And the girl too was no longer walking in her sleep but fully aware of what she was doing I was only just able to prevent him springing from his blankets Joan Joan he cried and in a flash she answered him I m here I m with you always now and had pushed past me into the tent and flung herself upon his breast I knew you would come to me in the end I heard him whisper It was all too big for me to understand at first she murmured and for a long time I was frightened But not now he cried louder you don t feel afraid now of of anything that s in me I fear nothing she cried nothing nothing I led her outside again She looked steadily into my face with eyes shining and her whole being transformed In some intuitive way surviving probably from the somnambulism she knew or guessed as much as I knew You must talk to morrow with John Silence I said gently leading her towards her own tent He understands everything I left her at the door and as I went back softly to take up my place of sentry again with the Canadian I saw the first streaks of dawn lighting up the far rim of the sea behind the distant islands And as though to emphasise the eternal closeness of comedy to tragedy two small details rose out of the scene and impressed me so vividly that I remember them to this very day For in the tent where I had just left Joan all aquiver with her new happiness there rose plainly to my ears the grotesque sounds of the Bo sun s Mate heavily snoring oblivious of all things in heaven or hell and from Maloney s tent so still was the night where I looked across and saw the lantern s glow there came to me through the trees the monotonous rising and falling of a human voice that was beyond question the sound of a man praying to his God CASE III A VICTIM OF HIGHER SPACE There s a hextraordinary gentleman to see you sir said the new man Why extraordinary asked doctor Silence drawing the tips of his thin fingers through his brown beard His eyes twinkled pleasantly Why extraordinary Barker he repeated encouragingly noticing the perplexed expression in the man s eyes He s so so thin sir I could hardly see im at all at first He was inside the house before I could ask the name he added remembering strict orders And who brought him here He come alone sir in a closed cab He pushed by me before I could say a word making no noise not what I could hear He seemed to move so soft like The man stopped short with obvious embarrassment as though he had already said enough to jeopardise his new situation but trying hard to show that he remembered the instructions and warnings he had received with regard to the admission of strangers not properly accredited And where is the gentleman now asked doctor Silence turning away to conceal his amusement I really couldn t exactly say sir I left him standing in the all The doctor looked up sharply But why in the hall Barker Why not in the waiting room He fixed his piercing though kindly eyes on the man s face Did he frighten you he asked quickly I think he did sir if I may say so I seemed to lose sight of him as it were The man stammered evidently convinced by now that he had earned his dismissal He come in so funny just like a cold wind he added boldly setting his heels at attention and looking his master full in the face The doctor made an internal note of the man s halting description he was pleased that the slight signs of psychic intuition which had induced him to engage Barker had not entirely failed at the first trial doctor Silence sought for this qualification in all his assistants from secretary to serving man and if it surrounded him with a somewhat singular crew the drawbacks were more than compensated for on the whole by their occasional flashes of insight So the gentleman made you feel queer did he That was it I think sir repeated the man stolidly And he brings no kind of introduction to me no letter or anything asked the doctor with feigned surprise as though he knew what was coming The man fumbled both in mind and pockets and finally produced an envelope I beg pardon sir he said greatly flustered the gentleman handed me this for you It was a note from a discerning friend who had never yet sent him a case that was not vitally interesting from one point or another Please see the bearer of this note the brief message ran though I doubt if even you can do much to help him John Silence paused a moment so as to gather from the mind of the writer all that lay behind the brief words of the letter Then he looked up at his servant with a graver expression than he had yet worn Go back and find this gentleman he said and show him into the green study Do not reply to his question or speak more than actually necessary but think kind helpful sympathetic thoughts as strongly as you can Barker You remember what I told you about the importance of thinking when I engaged you Put curiosity out of your mind and think gently sympathetically affectionately if you can He smiled and Barker who had recovered his composure in the doctor s presence bowed silently and went out There were two different reception rooms in doctor Silence s house One intended for persons who imagined they needed spiritual assistance when really they were only candidates for the asylum had padded walls and was well supplied with various concealed contrivances by means of which sudden violence could be instantly met and overcome It was however rarely used The other intended for the reception of genuine cases of spiritual distress and out of the way afflictions of a psychic nature was entirely draped and furnished in a soothing deep green calculated to induce calmness and repose of mind And this room was the one in which doctor Silence interviewed the majority of his queer cases and the one into which he had directed Barker to show his present caller To begin with the arm chair in which the patient was always directed to sit was nailed to the floor since its immovability tended to impart this same excellent characteristic to the occupant Patients invariably grew excited when talking about themselves and their excitement tended to confuse their thoughts and to exaggerate their language The inflexibility of the chair helped to counteract this After repeated endeavours to drag it forward or push it back they ended by resigning themselves to sitting quietly And with the futility of fidgeting there followed a calmer state of mind Upon the floor and at intervals in the wall immediately behind were certain tiny green buttons practically unnoticeable which on being pressed permitted a soothing and persuasive narcotic to rise invisibly about the occupant of the chair The effect upon the excitable patient was rapid admirable and harmless The green study was further provided with a secret spy hole for John Silence liked when possible to observe his patient s face before it had assumed that mask the features of the human countenance invariably wear in the presence of another person A man sitting alone wears a psychic expression and this expression is the man himself It disappears the moment another person joins him And doctor Silence often learned more from a few moments secret observation of a face than from hours of conversation with its owner afterwards A very light almost a dancing step followed Barker s heavy tread towards the green room and a moment afterwards the man came in and announced that the gentleman was waiting He was still pale and his manner nervous Never mind Barker the doctor said kindly if you were not psychic the man would have had no effect upon you at all You only need training and development And when you have learned to interpret these feelings and sensations better you will feel no fear but only a great sympathy Yes sir thank you sir And Barker bowed and made his escape while doctor Silence an amused smile lurking about the corners of his mouth made his way noiselessly down the passage and put his eye to the spy hole in the door of the green study This spy hole was so placed that it commanded a view of almost the entire room and looking through it the doctor saw a hat gloves and umbrella lying on a chair by the table but searched at first in vain for their owner The windows were both closed and a brisk fire burned in the grate There were various signs signs intelligible at least to a keenly intuitive soul that the room was occupied yet so far as human beings were concerned it was empty utterly empty No one sat in the chairs no one stood on the mat before the fire there was no sign even that a patient was anywhere close against the wall examining the Bocklin reproductions as patients so often did when they thought they were alone and therefore rather difficult to see from the spy hole Ordinarily speaking there was no one in the room It was undeniable Yet doctor Silence was quite well aware that a human being was in the room His psychic apparatus never failed in letting him know the proximity of an incarnate or discarnate being Even in the dark he could tell that And he now knew positively that his patient the patient who had alarmed Barker and had then tripped down the corridor with that dancing footstep was somewhere concealed within the four walls commanded by his spy hole He also realised and this was most unusual that this individual whom he desired to watch knew that he was being watched And further that the stranger himself was also watching In fact that it was he the doctor who was being observed and by an observer as keen and trained as himself An inkling of the true state of the case began to dawn upon him and he was on the verge of entering indeed his hand already touched the door knob when his eye still glued to the spy hole detected a slight movement Directly opposite between him and the fireplace something stirred He watched very attentively and made certain that he was not mistaken An object on the mantelpiece it was a blue vase disappeared from view It passed out of sight together with the portion of the marble mantelpiece on which it rested Next that part of the fire and grate and brass fender immediately below it vanished entirely as though a slice had been taken clean out of them doctor Silence then understood that something between him and these objects was slowly coming into being something that concealed them and obstructed his vision by inserting itself in the line of sight between them and himself He quietly awaited further results before going in First he saw a thin perpendicular line tracing itself from just above the height of the clock and continuing downwards till it reached the woolly fire mat This line grew wider broadened grew solid It was no shadow it was something substantial It defined itself more and more Then suddenly at the top of the line and about on a level with the face of the clock he saw a round luminous disc gazing steadily at him It was a human eye looking straight into his own pressed there against the spy hole And it was bright with intelligence doctor Silence held his breath for a moment and stared back at it Then like some one moving out of deep shadow into light he saw the figure of a man come sliding sideways into view a whitish face following the eye and the perpendicular line he had first observed broadening out and developing into the complete figure of a human being It was the patient He had apparently been standing there in front of the fire all the time A second eye had followed the first and both of them stared steadily at the spy hole sharply concentrated yet with a sly twinkle of humour and amusement that made it impossible for the doctor to maintain his position any longer He opened the door and went in quickly As he did so he noticed for the first time the sound of a German band coming in gaily through the open ventilators In some intuitive unaccountable fashion the music connected itself with the patient he was about to interview This sort of prevision was not unfamiliar to him It always explained itself later The man he saw was of middle age and of very ordinary appearance so ordinary in fact that he was difficult to describe his only peculiarity being his extreme thinness Pleasant that is good vibrations issued from his atmosphere and met doctor Silence as he advanced to greet him yet vibrations alive with currents and discharges betraying the perturbed and disordered condition of his mind and brain There was evidently something wholly out of the usual in the state of his thoughts Yet though strange it was not altogether distressing it was not the impression that the broken and violent atmosphere of the insane produces upon the mind doctor Silence realised in a flash that here was a case of absorbing interest that might require all his powers to handle properly I was watching you through my little peep hole as you saw he began with a pleasant smile advancing to shake hands I find it of the greatest assistance sometimes But the patient interrupted him at once His voice was hurried and had odd shrill changes in it breaking from high to low in unexpected fashion One moment it thundered the next it almost squeaked I understand without explanation he broke in rapidly You get the true note of a man in this way when he thinks himself unobserved I quite agree Only in my case I fear you saw very little My case as you of course grasp doctor Silence is extremely peculiar uncomfortably peculiar Indeed unless Sir William had positively assured me My friend has sent you to me the doctor interrupted gravely with a gentle note of authority and that is quite sufficient Pray be seated mister Mudge Racine Mudge returned the other Take this comfortable one mister Mudge leading him to the fixed chair and tell me your condition in your own way and at your own pace My whole day is at your service if you require it mister Mudge moved towards the chair in question and then hesitated You will promise me not to use the narcotic buttons he said before sitting down I do not need them Also I ought to mention that anything you think of vividly will reach my mind That is apparently part of my peculiar case He sat down with a sigh and arranged his thin legs and body into a position of comfort Evidently he was very sensitive to the thoughts of others for the picture of the green buttons had only entered the doctor s mind for a second yet the other had instantly snapped it up doctor Silence noticed too that mister Mudge held on tightly with both hands to the arms of the chair I m rather glad the chair is nailed to the floor he remarked as he settled himself more comfortably It suits me admirably The fact is and this is my case in a nutshell which is all that a doctor of your marvellous development requires the fact is doctor Silence I am a victim of Higher Space That s what s the matter with me Higher Space The two looked at each other for a space in silence the little patient holding tightly to the arms of the chair which suited him admirably and looking up with staring eyes his atmosphere positively trembling with the waves of some unknown activity while the doctor smiled kindly and sympathetically and put his whole person as far as possible into the mental condition of the other Higher Space repeated mister Mudge that s what it is Now do you think you can help me with that There was a pause during which the men s eyes steadily searched down below the surface of their respective personalities Then doctor Silence spoke I am quite sure I can help he answered quietly sympathy must always help and suffering always owns my sympathy I see you have suffered cruelly You must tell me all about your case and when I hear the gradual steps by which you reached this strange condition I have no doubt I can be of assistance to you He drew a chair up beside his interlocutor and laid a hand on his shoulder for a moment His whole being radiated kindness intelligence desire to help For instance he went on I feel sure it was the result of no mere chance that you became familiar with the terrors of what you term Higher Space for Higher Space is no mere external measurement It is of course a spiritual state a spiritual condition an inner development and one that we must recognise as abnormal since it is beyond the reach of the world at the present stage of evolution Higher Space is a mythical state Oh cried the other rubbing his birdlike hands with pleasure the relief it is to be able to talk to some one who can understand Of course what you say is the utter truth And you are right that no mere chance led me to my present condition but on the other hand prolonged and deliberate study Yet chance in a sense now governs it I mean my entering the condition of Higher Space seems to depend upon the chance of this and that circumstance For instance the mere sound of that German band sent me off Not that all music will do so but certain sounds certain vibrations at once key me up to the requisite pitch and off I go Wagner s music always does it and that band must have been playing a stray bit of Wagner But I ll come to all that later Only first I must ask you to send away your man from the spy hole John Silence looked up with a start for mister Mudge s back was to the door and there was no mirror He saw the brown eye of Barker glued to the little circle of glass and he crossed the room without a word and snapped down the black shutter provided for the purpose and then heard Barker snuffle away along the passage Now continued the little man in the chair I can begin You have managed to put me completely at my ease and I feel I may tell you my whole case without shame or reserve You will understand But you must be patient with me if I go into details that are already familiar to you details of Higher Space I mean and if I seem stupid when I have to describe things that transcend the power of language and are really therefore indescribable My dear friend put in the other calmly that goes without saying To know Higher Space is an experience that defies description and one is obliged to make use of more or less intelligible symbols But pray proceed Your vivid thoughts will tell me more than your halting words An immense sigh of relief proceeded from the little figure half lost in the depths of the chair Such intelligent sympathy meeting him half way was a new experience to him and it touched his heart at once He leaned back relaxing his tight hold of the arms and began in his thin scale like voice My mother was a Frenchwoman and my father an Essex bargeman he said abruptly Hence my name Racine and Mudge My father died before I ever saw him My mother inherited money from her Bordeaux relations and when she died soon after I was left alone with wealth and a strange freedom I had no guardian trustees sisters brothers or any connection in the world to look after me I grew up therefore utterly without education This much was to my advantage I learned none of that deceitful rubbish taught in schools and so had nothing to unlearn when I awakened to my true love mathematics higher mathematics and higher geometry These however I seemed to know instinctively It was like the memory of what I had deeply studied before the principles were in my blood and I simply raced through the ordinary stages and beyond and then did the same with geometry Afterwards when I read the books on these subjects I understood how swift and undeviating the knowledge had come back to me It was simply memory It was simply re collecting the memories of what I had known before in a previous existence and required no books to teach me In his growing excitement mister Mudge attempted to drag the chair forward a little nearer to his listener and then smiled faintly as he resigned himself instantly again to its immovability and plunged anew into the recital of his singular disease The audacious speculations of Bolyai the amazing theories of Gauss that through a point more than one line could be drawn parallel to a given line the possibility that the angles of a triangle are together greater than two right angles if drawn upon immense curvatures the breathless intuitions of Beltrami and Lobatchewsky all these I hurried through and emerged panting but unsatisfied upon the verge of my my new world my Higher Space possibilities in a word my disease How I got there he resumed after a brief pause during which he appeared to be listening intently for an approaching sound is more than I can put intelligibly into words I can only hope to leave your mind with an intuitive comprehension of the possibility of what I say Here however came a change At this point I was no longer absorbing the fruits of studies I had made before it was the beginning of new efforts to learn for the first time and I had to go slowly and laboriously through terrible work Here I sought for the theories and speculations of others But books were few and far between and with the exception of one man a dreamer the world called him whose audacity and piercing intuition amazed and delighted me beyond description I found no one to guide or help You of course doctor Silence understand something of what I am driving at with these stammering words though you cannot perhaps yet guess what depths of pain my new knowledge brought me to nor why an acquaintance with a new development of space should prove a source of misery and terror mister Racine Mudge remembering that the chair would not move did the next best thing he could in his desire to draw nearer to the attentive man facing him and sat forward upon the very edge of the cushions crossing his legs and gesticulating with both hands as though he saw into this region of new space he was attempting to describe and might any moment tumble into it bodily from the edge of the chair and disappear form view John Silence separated from him by three paces sat with his eyes fixed upon the thin white face opposite noting every word and every gesture with deep attention This room we now sit in doctor Silence has one side open to space to Higher Space A closed box only seems closed There is a way in and out of a soap bubble without breaking the skin You tell me no new thing the doctor interposed gently Hence if Higher Space exists and our world borders upon it and lies partially in it it follows necessarily that we see only portions of all objects We never see their true and complete shape We see their three measurements but not their fourth The new direction is concealed from us and when I hold this book and move my hand all round it I have not really made a complete circuit We only perceive those portions of any object which exist in our three dimensions the rest escapes us But once we learn to see in Higher Space objects will appear as they actually are Only they will thus be hardly recognisable Now you may begin to grasp something of what I am coming to I am beginning to understand something of what you must have suffered observed the doctor soothingly for I have made similar experiments myself and only stopped just in time You are the one man in all the world who can hear and understand and sympathise exclaimed mister Mudge grasping his hand and holding it tightly while he spoke The nailed chair prevented further excitability Well he resumed after a moment s pause I procured the implements and the coloured blocks for practical experiment and I followed the instructions carefully till I had arrived at a working conception of four dimensional space The tessaract the figure whose boundaries are cubes I knew by heart That is to say I knew it and saw it mentally for my eye of course could never take in a new measurement or my hands and feet handle it So at least I thought he added making a wry face I had reached the stage you see when I could imagine in a new dimension I was able to conceive the shape of that new figure which is intrinsically different to all we know the shape of the tessaract I could perceive in four dimensions When therefore I looked at a cube I could see all its sides at once Its top was not foreshortened nor its farther side and base invisible I saw the whole thing out flat so to speak And this tessaract was bounded by cubes Moreover I also saw its content its insides You were not yourself able to enter this new world interrupted doctor Silence Not then I was only able to conceive intuitively what it was like and how exactly it must look Later when I slipped in there and saw objects in their entirety unlimited by the paucity of our poor three measurements I very nearly lost my life For you see space does not stop at a single new dimension a fourth It extends in all possible new ones and we must conceive it as containing any number of new dimensions In other words there is no space at all but only a spiritual condition But meanwhile I had come to grasp the strange fact that the objects in our normal world appear to us only partially mister Mudge moved farther forward till he was balanced dangerously on the very edge of the chair From this starting point he resumed I began my studies and experiments and continued them for years I had money and I was without friends I lived in solitude and experimented My intellect of course had little part in the work for intellectually it was all unthinkable Never was the limitation of mere reason more plainly demonstrated It was mystically intuitively spiritually that I began to advance And what I learnt and knew and did is all impossible to put into language since it all describes experiences transcending the experiences of men It is only some of the results what you would call the symptoms of my disease that I can give you and even these must often appear absurd contradictions and impossible paradoxes I can only tell you doctor Silence his manner became exceedingly impressive that I reached sometimes a point of view whence all the great puzzle of the world became plain to me and I understood what they call in the Yoga books The Great Heresy of Separateness why all great teachers have urged the necessity of man loving his neighbour as himself how men are all really one and why the utter loss of self is necessary to salvation and the discovery of the true life of the soul He paused a moment and drew breath Your speculations have been my own long ago the doctor said quietly I fully realise the force of your words Men are doubtless not separate at all in the sense they imagine All this about the very much Higher Space I only dimly very dimly conceived of course the other went on raising his voice again by jerks but what did happen to me was the humbler accident of the simpler disaster oh dear how shall I put it He stammered and showed visible signs of distress It was simply this he resumed with a sudden rush of words that accidentally as the result of my years of experiment I one day slipped bodily into the next world the world of four dimensions yet without knowing precisely how I got there or how I could get back again I discovered that is that my ordinary three dimensional body was but an expression a projection of my higher four dimensional body Now you understand what I meant much earlier in our talk when I spoke of chance I cannot control my entrance or exit Certain people certain human atmospheres certain wandering forces thoughts desires even the radiations of certain combinations of colour and above all the vibrations of certain kinds of music will suddenly throw me into a state of what I can only describe as an intense and terrific inner vibration and behold I am off Off in the direction at right angles to all our known directions Off in the direction the cube takes when it begins to trace the outlines of the new figure Off into my breathless and semi divine Higher Space Off inside myself into the world of four dimensions He gasped and dropped back into the depths of the immovable chair And there he whispered his voice issuing from among the cushions there I have to stay until these vibrations subside or until they do something which I cannot find words to describe properly or intelligibly to you and then behold I am back again First that is I disappear Then I reappear Just so exclaimed doctor Silence and that is why a few Why a few moments ago interrupted mister Mudge taking the words out of his mouth you found me gone and then saw me return The music of that wretched German band sent me off Your intense thinking about me brought me back when the band had stopped its Wagner I saw you approach the peep hole and I saw Barker s intention of doing so later For me no interiors are hidden I see inside When in that state the content of your mind as of your body is open to me as the day Oh dear oh dear oh dear mister Mudge stopped and again mopped his brow A light trembling ran over the surface of his small body like wind over grass He still held tightly to the arms of the chair At first he presently resumed my new experiences were so vividly interesting that I felt no alarm There was no room for it The alarm came a little later Then you actually penetrated far enough into that state to experience yourself as a normal portion of it asked the doctor leaning forward deeply interested mister Mudge nodded a perspiring face in reply I did he whispered undoubtedly I did I am coming to all that It began first at night when I realised that sleep brought no loss of consciousness The spirit of course can never sleep Only the body becomes unconscious interposed John Silence Yes we know that theoretically At night of course the spirit is active elsewhere and we have no memory of where and how simply because the brain stays behind and receives no record But I found that while remaining conscious I also retained memory I had attained to the state of continuous consciousness for at night I regularly with the first approaches of drowsiness entered nolens volens the four dimensional world For a time this happened regularly and I could not control it though later I found a way to regulate it better Apparently sleep is unnecessary in the higher the four dimensional body Yes perhaps But I should infinitely have preferred dull sleep to the knowledge For unable to control my movements I wandered to and fro attracted owing to my partial development and premature arrival to parts of this new world that alarmed me more and more It was the awful waste and drift of a monstrous world so utterly different to all we know and see that I cannot even hint at the nature of the sights and objects and beings in it More than that I cannot even remember them I cannot now picture them to myself even but can recall only the memory of the impression they made upon me the horror and devastating terror of it all To be in several places at once for instance Perfectly interrupted John Silence noticing the increase of the other s excitement I understand exactly But now please tell me a little more of this alarm you experienced and how it affected you It s not the disappearing and reappearing per se that I mind continued mister Mudge so much as certain other things It s seeing people and objects in their weird entirety in their true and complete shapes that is so distressing It introduces me to a world of monsters Horses dogs cats all of which I loved people trees children all that I have considered beautiful in life everything from a human face to a cathedral appear to me in a different shape and aspect to all I have known before I cannot perhaps convince you why this should be terrible but I assure you that it is so To hear the human voice proceeding from this novel appearance which I scarcely recognise as a human body is ghastly simply ghastly To see inside everything and everybody is a form of insight peculiarly distressing To be so confused in geography as to find myself one moment at the North Pole and the next at Clapham Junction or possibly at both places simultaneously is absurdly terrifying Your imagination will readily furnish other details without my multiplying my experiences now But you have no idea what it all means and how I suffer mister Mudge paused in his panting account and lay back in his chair He still held tightly to the arms as though they could keep him in the world of sanity and three measurements and only now and again released his left hand in order to mop his face He looked very thin and white and oddly unsubstantial and he stared about him as though he saw into this other space he had been talking about John Silence too felt warm He had listened to every word and had made many notes The presence of this man had an exhilarating effect upon him It seemed as if mister Racine Mudge still carried about with him something of that breathless Higher Space condition he had been describing At any rate doctor Silence had himself advanced sufficiently far along the legitimate paths of spiritual and psychic transformations to realise that the visions of this extraordinary little person had a basis of truth for their origin After a pause that prolonged itself into minutes he crossed the room and unlocked a drawer in a bookcase taking out a small book with a red cover It had a lock to it and he produced a key out of his pocket and proceeded to open the covers The bright eyes of mister Mudge never left him for a single second It almost seems a pity he said at length to cure you mister Mudge You are on the way to discovery of great things Though you may lose your life in the process that is your life here in the world of three dimensions you would lose thereby nothing of great value you will pardon my apparent rudeness I know and you might gain what is infinitely greater Your suffering of course lies in the fact that you alternate between the two worlds and are never wholly in one or the other Also I rather imagine though I cannot be certain of this from any personal experiments that you have here and there penetrated even into space of more than four dimensions and have hence experienced the terror you speak of The perspiring son of the Essex bargeman and the woman of Normandy bent his head several times in assent but uttered no word in reply Some strange psychic predisposition dating no doubt from one of your former lives has favoured the development of your disease and the fact that you had no normal training at school or college no leading by the poor intellect into the culs de sac falsely called knowledge has further caused your exceedingly rapid movement along the lines of direct inner experience None of the knowledge you have foreshadowed has come to you through the senses of course mister Mudge sitting in his immovable chair began to tremble slightly A wind again seemed to pass over his surface and again to set it curiously in motion like a field of grass You are merely talking to gain time he said hurriedly in a shaking voice This thinking aloud delays us I see ahead what you are coming to only please be quick for something is going to happen A band is again coming down the street and if it plays if it plays Wagner I shall be off in a twinkling Precisely I will be quick I was leading up to the point of how to effect your cure The way is this You must simply learn to block the entrances True true utterly true exclaimed the little man dodging about nervously in the depths of the chair But how in the name of space is that to be done By concentration They are all within you these entrances although outer cases such as colour music and other things lead you towards them These external things you cannot hope to destroy but once the entrances are blocked they will lead you only to bricked walls and closed channels You will no longer be able to find the way Quick quick cried the bobbing figure in the chair How is this concentration to be effected This little book continued doctor Silence calmly will explain to you the way He tapped the cover Let me now read out to you certain simple instructions composed as I see you divine entirely from my own personal experiences in the same direction Follow these instructions and you will no longer enter the state of Higher Space The entrances will be blocked effectively mister Mudge sat bolt upright in his chair to listen and John Silence cleared his throat and began to read slowly in a very distinct voice But before he had uttered a dozen words something happened A sound of street music entered the room through the open ventilators for a band had begun to play in the stable mews at the back of the house the March from Tannhaeuser Odd as it may seem that a German band should twice within the space of an hour enter the same mews and play Wagner it was nevertheless the fact mister Racine Mudge heard it He uttered a sharp squeaking cry and twisted his arms with nervous energy round the chair A piteous look that was not far from tears spread over his white face Grey shadows followed it the grey of fear He began to struggle convulsively Hold me fast Catch me For God s sake keep me here I m on the rush already Oh it s frightful he cried in tones of anguish his voice as thin as a reed doctor Silence made a plunge forward to seize him but in a flash before he could cover the space between them mister Racine Mudge screaming and struggling seemed to shoot past him into invisibility He disappeared like an arrow from a bow propelled at infinite speed and his voice no longer sounded in the external air but seemed in some curious way to make itself heard somewhere within the depths of the doctor s own being It was almost like a faint singing cry in his head like a voice of dream a voice of vision and unreality Alcohol alcohol it cried give me alcohol It s the quickest way Alcohol before I m out of reach The doctor accustomed to rapid decisions and even more rapid action remembered that a brandy flask stood upon the mantelpiece and in less than a second he had seized it and was holding it out towards the space above the chair recently occupied by the visible Mudge Then before his very eyes and long ere he could unscrew the metal stopper he saw the contents of the closed glass phial sink and lessen as though some one were drinking violently and greedily of the liquor within Thanks Enough It deadens the vibrations cried the faint voice in his interior as he withdrew the flask and set it back upon the mantelpiece He understood that in Mudge s present condition one side of the flask was open to space and he could drink without removing the stopper He could hardly have had a more interesting proof of what he had been hearing described at such length But the next moment the very same moment it almost seemed the German band stopped midway in its tune and there was mister Mudge back in his chair again gasping and panting Quick he shrieked stop that band Send it away Catch hold of me Block the entrances Block the entrances Give me the red book Oh oh oh h h h The music had begun again It was merely a temporary interruption The Tannhaeuser March started again this time at a tremendous pace that made it sound like a rapid two step as though the instruments played against time But the brief interruption gave doctor Silence a moment in which to collect his scattering thoughts and before the band had got through half a bar he had flung forward upon the chair and held mister Racine Mudge the struggling little victim of Higher Space in a grip of iron His arms went all round his diminutive person taking in a good part of the chair at the same time He was not a big man yet he seemed to smother Mudge completely Yet even as he did so and felt the wriggling form underneath him it began to melt and slip away like air or water The wood of the arm chair somehow disentangled itself from between his own arms and those of Mudge The phenomenon known as the passage of matter through matter took place The little man seemed actually to get mixed up in his own being doctor Silence could just see his face beneath him It puckered and grew dark as though from some great internal effort He heard the thin reedy voice cry in his ear to Block the entrances block the entrances and then but how in the world describe what is indescribable John Silence half rose up to watch Racine Mudge his face distorted beyond all recognition was making a marvellous inward movement as though doubling back upon himself He turned funnel wise like water in a whirling vortex and then appeared to break up somewhat as a reflection breaks up and divides in a distorting convex mirror He went neither forward nor backwards neither to the right nor the left neither up nor down But he went He went utterly He simply flashed away out of sight like a vanishing projectile All but one leg doctor Silence just had the time and the presence of mind to seize upon the left ankle and boot as it disappeared and to this he held on for several seconds like grim death Yet all the time he knew it was a foolish and useless thing to do The foot was in his grasp one moment and the next it seemed this was the only way he could describe it inside his own skin and bones and at the same time outside his hand and all round it It seemed mixed up in some amazing way with his own flesh and blood Then it was gone and he was tightly grasping a draught of heated air Gone gone gone cried a thick whispering voice somewhere deep within his own consciousness Lost lost lost it repeated growing fainter and fainter till at length it vanished into nothing and the last signs of mister Racine Mudge vanished with it John Silence locked his red book and replaced it in the cabinet which he fastened with a click and when Barker answered the bell he inquired if mister Mudge had left a card upon the table It appeared that he had and when the servant returned with it doctor Silence read the address and made a note of it It was in North London mister Mudge has gone he said quietly to Barker noticing his expression of alarm He s not taken his at with him sir mister Mudge requires no hat where he is now continued the doctor stooping to poke the fire But he may return for it And the humbrella sir And the umbrella He didn t go out my way sir if you please stuttered the amazed servant his curiosity overcoming his nervousness mister Mudge has his own way of coming and going and prefers it If he returns by the door at any time remember to bring him instantly to me and be kind and gentle with him and ask no questions Also remember Barker to think pleasantly sympathetically affectionately of him while he is away mister Mudge is a very suffering gentleman Barker bowed and went out of the room backwards gasping and feeling round the inside of his collar with three very hot fingers of one hand It was two days later when he brought in a telegram to the study doctor Silence opened it and read as follows Bombay Just slipped out again All safe Have blocked entrances Thousand thanks Address Cooks London MUDGE doctor Silence looked up and saw Barker staring at him bewilderingly It occurred to him that somehow he knew the contents of the telegram Make a parcel of mister Mudge s things he said briefly and address them Thomas Cook Sons Ludgate Circus And send them there exactly a month from to day and marked To be called for Yes sir said Barker leaving the room with a deep sigh and a hurried glance at the waste paper basket

confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For example an eBook of filename ten thousand two hundred thirty four would be found at http www gutenberg net one zero two three ten thousand two hundred thirty four or filename twenty
