BALCONY GENERAL EFFECT OF MASSES PROFILE TEETH OF THE BORDER BORDER AT THE SIDE OF BALCONY OUTLINE OF RETRACTED LEAVES PREFACE The following addresses though spoken at different times are intentionally connected in subject their aim being to set one or two main principles of art in simple light before the general student and to indicate their practical bearing on modern design The law which it has been my effort chiefly to illustrate is the dependence of all noble design in any kind on the sculpture or painting of Organic Form This is the vital law lying at the root of all that I have ever tried to teach respecting architecture or any other art It is also the law most generally disallowed I believe this must be so in every subject We are all of us willing enough to accept dead truths or blunt ones which can be fitted harmlessly into spare niches or shrouded and coffined at once out of the way we holding complacently the cemetery keys and supposing we have learned something But a sapling truth with earth at its root and blossom on its branches or a trenchant truth that can cut its way through bars and sods most men it seems to me dislike the sight or entertainment of if by any means such guest or vision may be avoided And indeed this is no wonder for one such truth thoroughly accepted connects itself strangely with others and there is no saying what it may lead us to And thus the gist of what I have tried to teach about architecture has been throughout denied by my architect readers even when they thought what I said suggestive in other particulars Anything but that Study Italian Gothic perhaps it would be as well build with pointed arches there is no objection use solid stone and well burnt brick by all means but learn to carve or paint organic form ourselves How can such a thing be asked We are above all that The carvers and painters are our servants quite subordinate people They ought to be glad if we leave room for them Well on that it all turns For those who will not learn to carve or paint and think themselves greater men because they cannot it is wholly wasted time to read any words of mine in the truest and sternest sense they can read no words of mine for the most familiar I can use form proportion beauty curvature colour are used in a sense which by no effort I can communicate to such readers and in no building that I praise is the thing that I praise it for visible to them And it is the more necessary for me to state this fully because so called Gothic or Romanesque buildings are now rising every day around us which might be supposed by the public more or less to embody the principles of those styles but which embody not one of them nor any shadow or fragment of them but merely serve to caricature the noble buildings of past ages and to bring their form into dishonour by leaving out their soul The following addresses are therefore arranged as I have just stated to put this great law and one or two collateral ones in less mistakeable light securing even in this irregular form at least clearness of assertion For the rest the question at issue is not one to be decided by argument but by experiment which if the reader is disinclined to make all demonstration must be useless to him The lectures are for the most part printed as they were read mending only obscure sentences here and there The parts which were trusted to extempore speaking are supplied as well as I can remember only with an addition here and there of things I forgot to say in the words or at least the kind of words used at the time and they contain at all events the substance of what I said more accurately than hurried journal reports I must beg my readers not in general to trust to such for even in fast speaking I try to use words carefully and any alteration of expression will sometimes involve a great alteration in meaning A little while ago I had to speak of an architectural design and called it elegant meaning founded on good and well elected models the printed report gave excellent design that is to say design excellingly good which I did not mean and should even in the most hurried speaking never have said The illustrations of the lecture on iron were sketches made too roughly to be engraved and yet of too elaborate subjects to allow of my drawing them completely Those now substituted will however answer the purpose nearly as well and are more directly connected with the subjects of the preceding lectures so that I hope throughout the volume the student will perceive an insistance upon one main truth nor lose in any minor direction of inquiry the sense of the responsibility which the acceptance of that truth fastens upon him responsibility for choice decisive and conclusive between two modes of study which involve ultimately the development or deadening of every power he possesses I have tried to hold that choice clearly out to him and to unveil for him to its farthest the issue of his turning to the right hand or the left Guides he may find many and aids many but all these will be in vain unless he has first recognised the hour and the point of life when the way divides itself one way leading to the Olive mountains one to the vale of the Salt Sea There are few cross roads that I know of from one to the other Let him pause at the parting of THE TWO PATHS THE TWO PATHS BEING LECTURES ON ART AND ITS APPLICATION TO DECORATION AND MANUFACTURE DELIVERED IN eighteen fifty eight nine LECTURE I THE DETERIORATIVE POWER OF CONVENTIONAL ART OVER NATIONS An Inaugural Lecture Delivered at the Kensington Museum January eighteen fifty eight Footnote A few introductory words in which at the opening of this lecture I thanked the Chairman mister Cockerell for his support on the occasion and asked his pardon for any hasty expressions in my writings which might have seemed discourteous towards him or other architects whose general opinions were opposed to mine may be found by those who care for preambles not much misreported in the Building Chronicle with such comments as the genius of that journal was likely to suggest to it As I passed last summer for the first time through the north of Scotland it seemed to me that there was a peculiar painfulness in its scenery caused by the non manifestation of the powers of human art I had never travelled in nor even heard or conceived of such a country before nor though I had passed much of my life amidst mountain scenery in the south was I before aware how much of its charm depended on the little gracefulnesses and tendernesses of human work which are mingled with the beauty of the Alps or spared by their desolation It is true that the art which carves and colours the front of a Swiss cottage is not of any very exalted kind yet it testifies to the completeness and the delicacy of the faculties of the mountaineer it is true that the remnants of tower and battlement which afford footing to the wild vine on the Alpine promontory form but a small part of the great serration of its rocks and yet it is just that fragment of their broken outline which gives them their pathetic power and historical majesty And this element among the wilds of our own country I found wholly wanting The Highland cottage is literally a heap of gray stones choked up rather than roofed over with black peat and withered heather the only approach to an effort at decoration consists in the placing of the clods of protective peat obliquely on its roof so as to give a diagonal arrangement of lines looking somewhat as if the surface had been scored over by a gigantic claymore And at least among the northern hills of Scotland elements of more ancient architectural interest are equally absent The solitary peel house is hardly discernible by the windings of the stream the roofless aisle of the priory is lost among the enclosures of the village and the capital city of the Highlands Inverness placed where it might ennoble one of the sweetest landscapes and by the shore of one of the loveliest estuaries in the world placed between the crests of the Grampians and the flowing of the Moray Firth as if it were a jewel clasping the folds of the mountains to the blue zone of the sea is only distinguishable from a distance by one architectural feature and exalts all the surrounding landscape by no other associations than those which can be connected with its modern castellated gaol While these conditions of Scottish scenery affected me very painfully it being the first time in my life that I had been in any country possessing no valuable monuments or examples of art they also forced me into the consideration of one or two difficult questions respecting the effect of art on the human mind and they forced these questions upon me eminently for this reason that while I was wandering disconsolately among the moors of the Grampians where there was no art to be found news of peculiar interest was every day arriving from a country where there was a great deal of art and art of a delicate kind to be found Among the models set before you in this institution and in the others established throughout the kingdom for the teaching of design there are I suppose none in their kind more admirable than the decorated works of India They are indeed in all materials capable of colour wool marble or metal almost inimitable in their delicate application of divided hue and fine arrangement of fantastic line Nor is this power of theirs exerted by the people rarely or without enjoyment the love of subtle design seems universal in the race and is developed in every implement that they shape and every building that they raise it attaches itself with the same intensity and with the same success to the service of superstition of pleasure or of cruelty and enriches alike with one profusion on enchanted iridescence the dome of the pagoda the fringe of the girdle and the edge of the sword So then you have in these two great populations Indian and Highland in the races of the jungle and of the moor two national capacities distinctly and accurately opposed On the one side you have a race rejoicing in art and eminently and universally endowed with the gift of it on the other you have a people careless of art and apparently incapable of it their utmost effort hitherto reaching no farther than to the variation of the positions of the bars of colour in square chequers And we are thus urged naturally to enquire what is the effect on the moral character in each nation of this vast difference in their pursuits and apparent capacities and whether those rude chequers of the tartan or the exquisitely fancied involutions of the Cashmere fold habitually over the noblest hearts We have had our answer Since the race of man began its course of sin on this earth nothing has ever been done by it so significative of all bestial and lower than bestial degradation as the acts the Indian race in the year that has just passed by Cruelty as fierce may indeed have been wreaked and brutality as abominable been practised before but never under like circumstances rage of prolonged war and resentment of prolonged oppression have made men as cruel before now and gradual decline into barbarism where no examples of decency or civilization existed around them has sunk before now isolated populations to the lowest level of possible humanity But cruelty stretched to its fiercest against the gentle and unoffending and corruption festered to its loathsomest in the midst of the witnessing presence of a disciplined civilization these we could not have known to be within the practicable compass of human guilt but for the acts of the Indian mutineer And as thus on the one hand you have an extreme energy of baseness displayed by these lovers of art on the other as if to put the question into the narrowest compass you have had an extreme energy of virtue displayed by the despisers of art Among all the soldiers to whom you owe your victories in the Crimea and your avenging in the Indies to none are you bound by closer bonds of gratitude than to the men who have been born and bred among those desolate Highland moors And thus you have the differences in capacity and circumstance between the two nations and the differences in result on the moral habits of two nations put into the most significant the most palpable the most brief opposition Out of the peat cottage come faith courage self sacrifice purity and piety and whatever else is fruitful in the work of Heaven out of the ivory palace come treachery cruelty cowardice idolatry bestiality whatever else is fruitful in the work of Hell But the difficulty does not close here From one instance of however great apparent force it would be wholly unfair to gather any general conclusion wholly illogical to assert that because we had once found love of art connected with moral baseness the love of art must be the general root of moral baseness and equally unfair to assert that because we had once found neglect of art coincident with nobleness of disposition neglect of art must be always the source or sign of that nobleness But if we pass from the Indian peninsula into other countries of the globe and from our own recent experience to the records of history we shall still find one great fact fronting us in stern universality namely the apparent connection of great success in art with subsequent national degradation You find in the first place that the nations which possessed a refined art were always subdued by those who possessed none you find the Lydian subdued by the Mede the Athenian by the Spartan the Greek by the Roman the Roman by the Goth the Burgundian by the Switzer but you find beyond this that even where no attack by any external power has accelerated the catastrophe of the state the period in which any given people reach their highest power in art is precisely that in which they appear to sign the warrant of their own ruin and that from the moment in which a perfect statue appears in Florence a perfect picture in Venice or a perfect fresco in Rome from that hour forward probity industry and courage seem to be exiled from their walls and they perish in a sculpturesque paralysis or a many coloured corruption But even this is not all As art seems thus in its delicate form to be one of the chief promoters of indolence and sensuality so I need hardly remind you it hitherto has appeared only in energetic manifestation when it was in the service of superstition The four greatest manifestations of human intellect which founded the four principal kingdoms of art Egyptian Babylonian Greek and Italian were developed by the strong excitement of active superstition in the worship of Osiris Belus Minerva and the Queen of Heaven Therefore to speak briefly it may appear very difficult to show that art has ever yet existed in a consistent and thoroughly energetic school unless it was engaged in the propagation of falsehood or the encouragement of vice And finally while art has thus shown itself always active in the service of luxury and idolatry it has also been strongly directed to the exaltation of cruelty A nation which lives a pastoral and innocent life never decorates the shepherd s staff or the plough handle but races who live by depredation and slaughter nearly always bestow exquisite ornaments on the quiver the helmet and the spear Does it not seem to you then on all these three counts more than questionable whether we are assembled here in Kensington Museum to any good purpose Might we not justly be looked upon with suspicion and fear rather than with sympathy by the innocent and unartistical public Are we even sure of ourselves Do we know what we are about Are we met here as honest people or are we not rather so many Catilines assembled to devise the hasty degradation of our country or like a conclave of midnight witches to summon and send forth on new and unexpected missions the demons of luxury cruelty and superstition I trust upon the whole that it is not so I am sure that mister Redgrave and mister Cole do not at all include results of this kind in their conception of the ultimate objects of the institution which owes so much to their strenuous and well directed exertions And I have put this painful question before you only that we may face it thoroughly and as I hope out face it If you will give it a little sincere attention this evening I trust we may find sufficiently good reasons for our work and proceed to it hereafter as all good workmen should do with clear heads and calm consciences To return then to the first point of difficulty the relations between art and mental disposition in India and Scotland It is quite true that the art of India is delicate and refined But it has one curious character distinguishing it from all other art of equal merit in design it never represents a natural fact It either forms its compositions out of meaningless fragments of colour and flowings of line or if it represents any living creature it represents that creature under some distorted and monstrous form To all the facts and forms of nature it wilfully and resolutely opposes itself it will not draw a man but an eight armed monster it will not draw a flower but only a spiral or a zigzag It thus indicates that the people who practise it are cut off from all possible sources of healthy knowledge or natural delight that they have wilfully sealed up and put aside the entire volume of the world and have got nothing to read nothing to dwell upon but that imagination of the thoughts of their hearts of which we are told that it is only evil continually Over the whole spectacle of creation they have thrown a veil in which there is no rent For them no star peeps through the blanket of the dark for them neither their heaven shines nor their mountains rise for them the flowers do not blossom for them the creatures of field and forest do not live They lie bound in the dungeon of their own corruption encompassed only by doleful phantoms or by spectral vacancy Need I remind you what an exact reverse of this condition of mind as respects the observance of nature is presented by the people whom we have just been led to contemplate in contrast with the Indian race You will find upon reflection that all the highest points of the Scottish character are connected with impressions derived straight from the natural scenery of their country No nation has ever before shown in the general tone of its language in the general current of its literature so constant a habit of hallowing its passions and confirming its principles by direct association with the charm or power of nature The writings of Scott and Burns and yet more of the far greater poets than Burns who gave Scotland her traditional ballads furnish you in every stanza almost in every line with examples of this association of natural scenery with the passions Footnote The great poets of Scotland like the great poets of all other countries never write dissolutely either in matter or method but with stern and measured meaning in every syllable Here s a bit of first rate work for example Tweed said to Till What gars ye rin sae still Till said to Tweed Though ye rin wi speed And I rin slaw Whar ye droon ae man I droon twa but an instance of its farther connection with moral principle struck me forcibly just at the time when I was most lamenting the absence of art among the people In one of the loneliest districts of Scotland where the peat cottages are darkest just at the western foot of that great mass of the Grampians which encircles the sources of the Spey and the Dee the main road which traverses the chain winds round the foot of a broken rock called Crag or Craig Ellachie There is nothing remarkable in either its height or form it is darkened with a few scattered pines and touched along its summit with a flush of heather but it constitutes a kind of headland or leading promontory in the group of hills to which it belongs a sort of initial letter of the mountains and thus stands in the mind of the inhabitants of the district the Clan Grant for a type of their country and of the influence of that country upon themselves Their sense of this is beautifully indicated in the war cry of the clan Stand fast Craig Ellachie You may think long over those few words without exhausting the deep wells of feeling and thought contained in them the love of the native land the assurance of their faithfulness to it the subdued and gentle assertion of indomitable courage I may need to be told to stand but if I do Craig Ellachie does You could not but have felt had you passed beneath it at the time when so many of England s dearest children were being defended by the strength of heart of men born at its foot how often among the delicate Indian palaces whose marble was pallid with horror and whose vermilion was darkened with blood the remembrance of its rough grey rocks and purple heaths must have risen before the sight of the Highland soldier how often the hailing of the shot and the shriek of battle would pass away from his hearing and leave only the whisper of the old pine branches Stand fast Craig Ellachie You have in these two nations seen in direct opposition the effects on moral sentiment of art without nature and of nature without art And you see enough to justify you in suspecting while if you choose to investigate the subject more deeply and with other examples you will find enough to justify you in concluding that art followed as such and for its own sake irrespective of the interpretation of nature by it is destructive of whatever is best and noblest in humanity but that nature however simply observed or imperfectly known is in the degree of the affection felt for it protective and helpful to all that is noblest in humanity You might then conclude farther that art so far as it was devoted to the record or the interpretation of nature would be helpful and ennobling also And you would conclude this with perfect truth Let me repeat the assertion distinctly and solemnly as the first that I am permitted to make in this building devoted in a way so new and so admirable to the service of the art students of England Wherever art is practised for its own sake and the delight of the workman is in what he does and produces instead of what he interprets or exhibits there art has an influence of the most fatal kind on brain and heart and it issues if long so pursued in the destruction both of intellectual power and moral principal whereas art devoted humbly and self forgetfully to the clear statement and record of the facts of the universe is always helpful and beneficent to mankind full of comfort strength and salvation Now when you were once well assured of this you might logically infer another thing namely that when Art was occupied in the function in which she was serviceable she would herself be strengthened by the service and when she was doing what Providence without doubt intended her to do she would gain in vitality and dignity just as she advanced in usefulness On the other hand you might gather that when her agency was distorted to the deception or degradation of mankind she would herself be equally misled and degraded that she would be checked in advance or precipitated in decline And this is the truth also and holding this clue you will easily and justly interpret the phenomena of history So long as Art is steady in the contemplation and exhibition of natural facts so long she herself lives and grows and in her own life and growth partly implies partly secures that of the nation in the midst of which she is practised But a time has always hitherto come in which having thus reached a singular perfection she begins to contemplate that perfection and to imitate it and deduce rules and forms from it and thus to forget her duty and ministry as the interpreter and discoverer of Truth And in the very instant when this diversion of her purpose and forgetfulness of her function take place forgetfulness generally coincident with her apparent perfection in that instant I say begins her actual catastrophe and by her own fall so far as she has influence she accelerates the ruin of the nation by which she is practised The study however of the effect of art on the mind of nations is one rather for the historian than for us at all events it is one for the discussion of which we have no more time this evening But I will ask your patience with me while I try to illustrate in some further particulars the dependence of the healthy state and power of art itself upon the exercise of its appointed function in the interpretation of fact You observe that I always say interpretation never imitation My reason for so doing is first that good art rarely imitates it usually only describes or explains But my second and chief reason is that good art always consists of two things First the observation of fact secondly the manifesting of human design and authority in the way that fact is told Great and good art must unite the two it cannot exist for a moment but in their unity it consists of the two as essentially as water consists of oxygen and hydrogen or marble of lime and carbonic acid Let us inquire a little into the nature of each of the elements The first element we say is the love of Nature leading to the effort to observe and report her truly And this is the first and leading element Review for yourselves the history of art and you will find this to be a manifest certainty that no great school ever yet existed which had not for primal aim the representation of some natural fact as truly as possible There have only yet appeared in the world three schools of perfect art schools that is to say that did their work as well as it seems possible to do it These are the Athenian Footnote See below the farther notice of the real spirit of Greek work in the address at Bradford Florentine and Venetian The Athenian proposed to itself the perfect representation of the form of the human body It strove to do that as well as it could it did that as well as it can be done and all its greatness was founded upon and involved in that single and honest effort The Florentine school proposed to itself the perfect expression of human emotion the showing of the effects of passion in the human face and gesture I call this the Florentine school because whether you take Raphael for the culminating master of expressional art in Italy or Leonardo or Michael Angelo you will find that the whole energy of the national effort which produced those masters had its root in Florence not at Urbino or Milan I say then this Florentine or leading Italian school proposed to itself human expression for its aim in natural truth it strove to do that as well as it could did it as well as it can be done and all its greatness is rooted in that single and honest effort Thirdly the Venetian school propose the representation of the effect of colour and shade on all things chiefly on the human form It tried to do that as well as it could did it as well as it can be done and all its greatness is founded on that single and honest effort Pray do not leave this room without a perfectly clear holding of these three ideas You may try them and toss them about afterwards as much as you like to see if they ll bear shaking but do let me put them well and plainly into your possession Attach them to three works of art which you all have either seen or continually heard of There s the so called Theseus of the Elgin marbles That represents the whole end and aim of the Athenian school the natural form of the human body All their conventional architecture their graceful shaping and painting of pottery whatsoever other art they practised was dependent for its greatness on this sheet anchor of central aim true shape of living man Then take for your type of the Italian school Raphael s Disputa del Sacramento that will be an accepted type by everybody and will involve no possibly questionable points the Germans will admit it the English academicians will admit it and the English purists and pre Raphaelites will admit it Well there you have the truth of human expression proposed as an aim That is the way people look when they feel this or that when they have this or that other mental character are they devotional thoughtful affectionate indignant or inspired are they prophets saints priests or kings then whatsoever is truly thoughtful affectionate prophetic priestly kingly that the Florentine school tried to discern and show that they have discerned and shown and all their greatness is first fastened in their aim at this central truth the open expression of the living human soul Lastly take Veronese s Marriage in Cana in the Louvre There you have the most perfect representation possible of colour and light and shade as they affect the external aspect of the human form and its immediate accessories architecture furniture and dress This external aspect of noblest nature was the first aim of the Venetians and all their greatness depended on their resolution to achieve and their patience in achieving it Here then are the three greatest schools of the former world exemplified for you in three well known works The Phidian Theseus represents the Greek school pursuing truth of form the Disputa of Raphael the Florentine school pursuing truth of mental expression the Marriage in Cana the Venetian school pursuing truth of colour and light But do not suppose that the law which I am stating to you the great law of art life can only be seen in these the most powerful of all art schools It is just as manifest in each and every school that ever has had life in it at all Wheresoever the search after truth begins there life begins wheresoever that search ceases there life ceases As long as a school of art holds any chain of natural facts trying to discover more of them and express them better daily it may play hither and thither as it likes on this side of the chain or that it may design grotesques and conventionalisms build the simplest buildings serve the most practical utilities yet all it does will be gloriously designed and gloriously done but let it once quit hold of the chain of natural fact cease to pursue that as the clue to its work let it propose to itself any other end than preaching this living word and think first of showing its own skill or its own fancy and from that hour its fall is precipitate its destruction sure nothing that it does or designs will ever have life or loveliness in it more its hour has come and there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither it goeth Let us take for example that school of art over which many of you would perhaps think this law had but little power the school of Gothic architecture Many of us may have been in the habit of thinking of that school rather as of one of forms than of facts a school of pinnacles and buttresses and conventional mouldings and disguise of nature by monstrous imaginings not a school of truth at all I think I shall be able even in the little time we have to night to show that this is not so and that our great law holds just as good at Amiens and Salisbury as it does at Athens and Florence I will go back then first to the very beginnings of Gothic art and before you the students of Kensington as an impanelled jury I will bring two examples of the barbarism out of which Gothic art emerges approximately contemporary in date and parallel in executive skill but the one a barbarism that did not get on and could not get on the other a barbarism that could get on and did get on and you the impanelled jury shall judge what is the essential difference between the two barbarisms and decide for yourselves what is the seed of life in the one and the sign of death in the other The first that which has in it the sign of death furnishes us at the same time with an illustration far too interesting to be passed by of certain principles much depended on by our common modern designers Taking up one of our architectural publications the other day and opening it at random I chanced upon this piece of information put in rather curious English but you shall have it as it stands Aristotle asserts that the greatest species of the beautiful are Order Symmetry and the Definite I should tell you however that this statement is not given as authoritative it is one example of various Architectural teachings given in a report in the Building Chronicle for May eighteen fifty seven of a lecture on Proportion in which the only thing the lecturer appears to have proved was that The system of dividing the diameter of the shaft of a column into parts for copying the ancient architectural remains of Greece and Rome adopted by architects from Vitruvius circa B C twenty five to the present period as a method for producing ancient architecture is entirely useless for the several parts of Grecian architecture cannot be reduced or subdivided by this system neither does it apply to the architecture of Rome Still as far as I can make it out the lecture appears to have been one of those of which you will just at present hear so many the protests of architects who have no knowledge of sculpture or of any other mode of expressing natural beauty against natural beauty and their endeavour to substitute mathematical proportions for the knowledge of life they do not possess and the representation of life of which they are incapable Illustration Now this substitution of obedience to mathematical law for sympathy with observed life is the first characteristic of the hopeless work of all ages as such you will find it eminently manifested in the specimen I have to give you of the hopeless Gothic barbarism the barbarism from which nothing could emerge for which no future was possible but extinction The Aristotelian principles of the Beautiful are you remember Order Symmetry and the Definite Here you have the three in perfection applied to the ideal of an angel in a psalter of the eighth century existing in the library of saint John s College Cambridge Footnote I copy this woodcut from Westwood s Palaeographia Sacra Now you see the characteristics of this utterly dead school are first the wilful closing of its eyes to natural facts for however ignorant a person may be he need only look at a human being to see that it has a mouth as well as eyes and secondly the endeavour to adorn or idealize natural fact according to its own notions it puts red spots in the middle of the hands and sharpens the thumbs thinking to improve them Here you have the most pure type possible of the principles of idealism in all ages whenever people don t look at Nature they always think they can improve her You will also admire doubtless the exquisite result of the application of our great modern architectural principle of beauty symmetry or equal balance of part by part you see even the eyes are made symmetrical entirely round instead of irregular oval and the iris is set properly in the middle instead of as nature has absurdly put it rather under the upper lid You will also observe the principle of the pyramid in the general arrangement of the figure and the value of series in the placing of dots From this dead barbarism we pass to living barbarism to work done by hands quite as rude if not ruder and by minds as uninformed and yet work which in every line of it is prophetic of power and has in it the sure dawn of day You have often heard it said that Giotto was the founder of art in Italy He was not neither he nor Giunta Pisano nor Niccolo Pisano They all laid strong hands to the work and brought it first into aspect above ground but the foundation had been laid for them by the builders of the Lombardic churches in the valleys of the Adda and the Arno It is in the sculpture of the round arched churches of North Italy bearing disputable dates ranging from the eighth to the twelfth century that you will find the lowest struck roots of the art of Titian and Raphael Footnote I have said elsewhere the root of all art is struck in the thirteenth century This is quite true but of course some of the smallest fibres run lower as in this instance I go therefore to the church which is certainly the earliest of these saint Ambrogio of Milan said still to retain some portions of the actual structure from which saint Ambrose excluded Theodosius and at all events furnishing the most archaic examples of Lombardic sculpture in North Italy I do not venture to guess their date they are barbarous enough for any date We find the pulpit of this church covered with interlacing patterns closely resembling those of the manuscript at Cambridge but among them is figure sculpture of a very different kind It is wrought with mere incisions in the stone of which the effect may be tolerably given by single lines in a drawing Remember therefore for a moment as characteristic of culminating Italian art Michael Angelo s fresco of the Temptation of Eve in the Sistine chapel and you will be more interested in seeing the birth of Italian art illustrated by the same subject from saint Ambrogio of Milan the Serpent beguiling Eve Footnote This cut is ruder than it should be the incisions in the marble have a lighter effect than these rough black lines but it is not worth while to do it better Yet in that sketch rude and ludicrous as it is you have the elements of life in their first form The people who could do that were sure to get on For observe the workman s whole aim is straight at the facts as well as he can get them and not merely at the facts but at the very heart of the facts A common workman might have looked at nature for his serpent but he would have thought only of its scales But this fellow does not want scales nor coils he can do without them he wants the serpent s heart malice and insinuation and he has actually got them to some extent So also a common workman even in this barbarous stage of art might have carved Eve s arms and body a good deal better but this man does not care about arms and body if he can only get at Eve s mind show that she is pleased at being flattered and yet in a state of uncomfortable hesitation And some look of listening of complacency and of embarrassment he has verily got note the eyes slightly askance the lips compressed and the right hand nervously grasping the left arm nothing can be declared impossible to the people who could begin thus the world is open to them and all that is in it while on the contrary nothing is possible to the man who did the symmetrical angel the world is keyless to him he has built a cell for himself in which he must abide barred up for ever there is no more hope for him than for a sponge or a madrepore I shall not trace from this embryo the progress of Gothic art in Italy because it is much complicated and involved with traditions of other schools and because most of the students will be less familiar with its results than with their own northern buildings So these two designs indicating Death and Life in the beginnings of mediaeval art we will take an example of the progress of that art from our northern work Now many of you doubtless have been interested by the mass grandeur and gloom of Norman architecture as much as by Gothic traceries and when you hear me say that the root of all good work lies in natural facts you doubtless think instantly of your round arches with their rude cushion capitals and of the billet or zigzag work by which they are surrounded and you cannot see what the knowledge of nature has to do with either the simple plan or the rude mouldings But all those simple conditions of Norman art are merely the expiring of it towards the extreme north Do not study Norman architecture in Northumberland but in Normandy and then you will find that it is just a peculiarly manly and practically useful form of the whole great French school of rounded architecture And where has that French school its origin Wholly in the rich conditions of sculpture which rising first out of imitations of the Roman bas reliefs covered all the facades of the French early churches with one continuous arabesque of floral or animal life If you want to study round arched buildings do not go to Durham but go to Poictiers and there you will see how all the simple decorations which give you so much pleasure even in their isolated application were invented by persons practised in carving men monsters wild animals birds and flowers in overwhelming redundance and then trace this architecture forward in central France and you will find it loses nothing of its richness it only gains in truth and therefore in grace until just at the moment of transition into the pointed style you have the consummate type of the sculpture of the school given you in the west front of the Cathedral of Chartres From that front I have chosen two fragments to illustrate it Footnote This part of the lecture was illustrated by two drawings made admirably by mister J T Laing with the help of photographs from statues at Chartres The drawings may be seen at present at the Kensington Museum but any large photograph of the west front of Chartres will enable the reader to follow what is stated in the lecture as far as is needful These statues have been long and justly considered as representative of the highest skill of the twelfth or earliest part of the thirteenth century in France and they indeed possess a dignity and delicate charm which are for the most part wanting in later works It is owing partly to real nobleness of feature but chiefly to the grace mingled with severity of the falling lines of excessively thin drapery as well as to a most studied finish in composition every part of the ornamentation tenderly harmonizing with the rest So far as their power over certain tones of religious mind is owing to a palpable degree of non naturalism in them I do not praise it the exaggerated thinness of body and stiffness of attitude are faults but they are noble faults and give the statues a strange look of forming part of the very building itself and sustaining it not like the Greek caryatid without effort nor like the Renaissance caryatid by painful or impossible effort but as if all that was silent and stern and withdrawn apart and stiffened in chill of heart against the terror of earth had passed into a shape of eternal marble and thus the Ghost had given to bear up the pillars of the church on earth all the patient and expectant nature that it needed no more in heaven This is the transcendental view of the meaning of those sculptures I do not dwell upon it What I do lean upon is their purely naturalistic and vital power They are all portraits unknown most of them I believe but palpably and unmistakeably portraits if not taken from the actual person for whom the statue stands at all events studied from some living person whose features might fairly represent those of the king or saint intended Several of them I suppose to be authentic there is one of a queen who has evidently while she lived been notable for her bright black eyes The sculptor has cut the iris deep into the stone and her dark eyes are still suggested with her smile There is another thing I wish you to notice specially in these statues the way in which the floral moulding is associated with the vertical lines of the figure You have thus the utmost complexity and richness of curvature set side by side with the pure and delicate parallel lines and both the characters gain in interest and beauty but there is deeper significance in the thing than that of mere effect in composition significance not intended on the part of the sculptor but all the more valuable because unintentional I mean the close association of the beauty of lower nature in animals and flowers with the beauty of higher nature in human form You never get this in Greek work Greek statues are always isolated blank fields of stone or depths of shadow relieving the form of the statue as the world of lower nature which they despised retired in darkness from their hearts Here the clothed figure seems the type of the Christian spirit in many respects feebler and more contracted but purer clothed in its white robes and crown and with the riches of all creation at its side The next step in the change will be set before you in a moment merely by comparing this statue from the west front of Chartres with that of the Madonna from the south transept door of Amiens Footnote There are many photographs of this door and of its central statue Its sculpture in the tympanum is farther described in the Fourth Lecture This Madonna with the sculpture round her represents the culminating power of Gothic art in the thirteenth century Sculpture has been gaining continually in the interval gaining simply because becoming every day more truthful more tender and more suggestive By the way the old Douglas motto Tender and true may wisely be taken up again by all of us for our own in art no less than in other things Depend upon it the first universal characteristic of all great art is Tenderness as the second is Truth I find this more and more every day an infinitude of tenderness is the chief gift and inheritance of all the truly great men It is sure to involve a relative intensity of disdain towards base things and an appearance of sternness and arrogance in the eyes of all hard stupid and vulgar people quite terrific to such if they are capable of terror and hateful to them if they are capable of nothing higher than hatred Dante s is the great type of this class of mind I say the first inheritance is Tenderness the second Truth because the Tenderness is in the make of the creature the Truth in his acquired habits and knowledge besides the love comes first in dignity as well as in time and that is always pure and complete the truth at best imperfect To come back to our statue You will observe that the arrangement of this sculpture is exactly the same as at Chartres severe falling drapery set off by rich floral ornament at the side but the statue is now completely animated it is no longer fixed as an upright pillar but bends aside out of its niche and the floral ornament instead of being a conventional wreath is of exquisitely arranged hawthorn The work however as a whole though perfectly characteristic of the advance of the age in style and purpose is in some subtler qualities inferior to that of Chartres The individual sculptor though trained in a more advanced school has been himself a man of inferior order of mind compared to the one who worked at Chartres But I have not time to point out to you the subtler characters by which I know this This statue then marks the culminating point of Gothic art because up to this time the eyes of its designers had been steadily fixed on natural truth they had been advancing from flower to flower from form to form from face to face gaining perpetually in knowledge and veracity therefore perpetually in power and in grace But at this point a fatal change came over their aim From the statue they now began to turn the attention chiefly to the niche of the statue and from the floral ornament to the mouldings that enclosed the floral ornament The first result of this was however though not the grandest yet the most finished of northern genius You have in the earlier Gothic less wonderful construction less careful masonry far less expression of harmony of parts in the balance of the building Earlier work always has more or less of the character of a good solid wall with irregular holes in it well carved wherever there is room But the last phase of good Gothic has no room to spare it rises as high as it can on narrowest foundation stands in perfect strength with the least possible substance in its bars connects niche with niche and line with line in an exquisite harmony from which no stone can be removed and to which you can add not a pinnacle and yet introduces in rich though now more calculated profusion the living element of its sculpture sculpture in the quatrefoils sculpture in the brackets sculpture in the gargoyles sculpture in the niches sculpture in the ridges and hollows of its mouldings not a shadow without meaning and not a light without life Footnote The two transepts of Rouen Cathedral illustrate this style There are plenty of photographs of them I take this opportunity of repeating what I have several times before stated for the sake of travellers that saint Ouen impressive as it is is entirely inferior to the transepts of Rouen Cathedral But with this very perfection of his work came the unhappy pride of the builder in what he had done As long as he had been merely raising clumsy walls and carving them like a child in waywardness of fancy his delight was in the things he thought of as he carved but when he had once reached this pitch of constructive science he began to think only how cleverly he could put the stones together The question was not now with him What can I represent but How high can I build how wonderfully can I hang this arch in air or weave this tracery across the clouds And the catastrophe was instant and irrevocable Architecture became in France a mere web of waving lines in England a mere grating of perpendicular ones Redundance was substituted for invention and geometry for passion tho Gothic art became a mere expression of wanton expenditure and vulgar mathematics and was swept away as it then deserved to be swept away by the severer pride and purer learning of the schools founded on classical traditions You cannot now fail to see how throughout the history of this wonderful art from its earliest dawn in Lombardy to its last catastrophe in France and England sculpture founded on love of nature was the talisman of its existence wherever sculpture was practised architecture arose wherever that was neglected architecture expired and believe me all you students who love this mediaeval art there is no hope of your ever doing any good with it but on this everlasting principle Your patriotic associations with it are of no use your romantic associations with it either of chivalry or religion are of no use they are worse than useless they are false Gothic is not an art for knights and nobles it is an art for the people it is not an art for churches or sanctuaries it is an art for houses and homes it is not an art for England only but an art for the world above all it is not an art of form or tradition only but an art of vital practice and perpetual renewal And whosoever pleads for it as an ancient or a formal thing and tries to teach it you as an ecclesiastical tradition or a geometrical science knows nothing of its essence less than nothing of its power Leave therefore boldly though not irreverently mysticism and symbolism on the one side cast away with utter scorn geometry and legalism on the other seize hold of God s hand and look full in the face of His creation and there is nothing He will not enable you to achieve Thus then you will find and the more profound and accurate your knowledge of the history of art the more assuredly you will find that the living power in all the real schools be they great or small is love of nature But do not mistake me by supposing that I mean this law to be all that is necessary to form a school There needs to be much superadded to it though there never must be anything superseding it The main thing which needs to be superadded is the gift of design It is always dangerous and liable to diminish the clearness of impression to go over much ground in the course of one lecture But I dare not present you with a maimed view of this important subject I dare not put off to another time when the same persons would not be again assembled the statement of the great collateral necessity which as well as the necessity of truth governs all noble art That collateral necessity is the visible operation of human intellect in the presentation of truth the evidence of what is properly called design or plan in the work no less than of veracity A looking glass does not design it receives and communicates indiscriminately all that passes before it a painter designs when he chooses some things refuses others and arranges all This selection and arrangement must have influence over everything that the art is concerned with great or small over lines over colours and over ideas Given a certain group of colours by adding another colour at the side of them you will either improve the group and render it more delightful or injure it and render it discordant and unintelligible Design is the choosing and placing the colour so as to help and enhance all the other colours it is set beside So of thoughts in a good composition every idea is presented in just that order and with just that force which will perfectly connect it with all the other thoughts in the work and will illustrate the others as well as receive illustration from them so that the entire chain of thoughts offered to the beholder s mind shall be received by him with as much delight and with as little effort as is possible And thus you see design properly so called is human invention consulting human capacity Out of the infinite heap of things around us in the world it chooses a certain number which it can thoroughly grasp and presents this group to the spectator in the form best calculated to enable him to grasp it also and to grasp it with delight And accordingly the capacities of both gatherer and receiver being limited the object is to make everything that you offer helpful and precious If you give one grain of weight too much so as to increase fatigue without profit or bulk without value that added grain is hurtful if you put one spot or one syllable out of its proper place that spot or syllable will be destructive how far destructive it is almost impossible to tell a misplaced touch may sometimes annihilate the labour of hours Nor are any of us prepared to understand the work of any great master till we feel this and feel it as distinctly as we do the value of arrangement in the notes of music Take any noble musical air and you find on examining it that not one even of the faintest or shortest notes can be removed without destruction to the whole passage in which it occurs and that every note in the passage is twenty times more beautiful so introduced than it would have been if played singly on the instrument Precisely this degree of arrangement and relation must exist between every touch Footnote Literally I know how exaggerated this statement sounds but I mean it every syllable of it See Appendix IV and line in a great picture You may consider the whole as a prolonged musical composition its parts as separate airs connected in the story its little bits and fragments of colour and line as separate passages or bars in melodies and down to the minutest note of the whole down to the minutest touch if there is one that can be spared that one is doing mischief Remember therefore always you have two characters in which all greatness of art consists First the earnest and intense seizing of natural facts then the ordering those facts by strength of human intellect so as to make them for all who look upon them to the utmost serviceable memorable and beautiful And thus great art is nothing else than the type of strong and noble life for as the ignoble person in his dealings with all that occurs in the world about him first sees nothing clearly looks nothing fairly in the face and then allows himself to be swept away by the trampling torrent and unescapable force of the things that he would not foresee and could not understand so the noble person looking the facts of the world full in the face and fathoming them with deep faculty then deals with them in unalarmed intelligence and unhurried strength and becomes with his human intellect and will no unconscious nor insignificant agent in consummating their good and restraining their evil Thus in human life you have the two fields of rightful toil for ever distinguished yet for ever associated Truth first plan or design founded thereon so in art you have the same two fields for ever distinguished for ever associated Truth first plan or design founded thereon Now hitherto there is not the least difficulty in the subject none of you can look for a moment at any great sculptor or painter without seeing the full bearing of these principles But a difficulty arises when you come to examine the art of a lower order concerned with furniture and manufacture for in that art the element of design enters without apparently the element of truth You have often to obtain beauty and display invention without direct representation of nature Yet respecting all these things also the principle is perfectly simple If the designer of furniture of cups and vases of dress patterns and the like exercises himself continually in the imitation of natural form in some leading division of his work then holding by this stem of life he may pass down into all kinds of merely geometrical or formal design with perfect safety and with noble results Footnote This principle here cursorily stated is one of the chief subjects of inquiry in the following Lectures Thus Giotto being primarily a figure painter and sculptor is secondarily the richest of all designers in mere mosaic of coloured bars and triangles thus Benvenuto Cellini being in all the higher branches of metal work a perfect imitator of nature is in all its lower branches the best designer of curve for lips of cups and handles of vases thus Holbein exercised primarily in the noble art of truthful portraiture becomes secondarily the most exquisite designer of embroideries of robe and blazonries on wall and thus Michael Angelo exercised primarily in the drawing of body and limb distributes in the mightiest masses the order of his pillars and in the loftiest shadow the hollows of his dome But once quit hold of this living stem and set yourself to the designing of ornamentation either in the ignorant play of your own heartless fancy as the Indian does or according to received application of heartless laws as the modern European does and there is but one word for you Death death of every healthy faculty and of every noble intelligence incapacity of understanding one great work that man has ever done or of doing anything that it shall be helpful for him to behold You have cut yourselves off voluntarily presumptuously insolently from the whole teaching of your Maker in His Universe you have cut yourselves off from it not because you were forced to mechanical labour for your bread not because your fate had appointed you to wear away your life in walled chambers or dig your life out of dusty furrows but when your whole profession your whole occupation all the necessities and chances of your existence led you straight to the feet of the great Teacher and thrust you into the treasury of His works where you have nothing to do but to live by gazing and to grow by wondering wilfully you bind up your eyes from the splendour wilfully bind up your life blood from its beating wilfully turn your backs upon all the majesties of Omnipotence wilfully snatch your hands from all the aids of love and what can remain for you but helplessness and blindness except the worse fate than the being blind yourselves that of becoming Leaders of the blind Do not think that I am speaking under excited feeling or in any exaggerated terms I have written the words I use that I may know what I say and that you if you choose may see what I have said For indeed I have set before you tonight to the best of my power the sum and substance of the system of art to the promulgation of which I have devoted my life hitherto and intend to devote what of life may still be spared to me I have had but one steady aim in all that I have ever tried to teach namely to declare that whatever was great in human art was the expression of man s delight in God s work And at this time I have endeavoured to prove to you if you investigate the subject you may more entirely prove to yourselves that no school ever advanced far which had not the love of natural fact as a primal energy But it is still more important for you to be assured that the conditions of life and death in the art of nations are also the conditions of life and death in your own and that you have it each in his power at this very instant to determine in which direction his steps are turning It seems almost a terrible thing to tell you that all here have all the power of knowing at once what hope there is for them as artists you would perhaps like better that there was some unremovable doubt about the chances of the future some possibility that you might be advancing in unconscious ways towards unexpected successes some excuse or reason for going about as students do so often to this master or the other asking him if they have genius and whether they are doing right and gathering from his careless or formal replies vague flashes of encouragement or fitfulnesses of despair There is no need for this no excuse for it All of you have the trial of yourselves in your own power each may undergo at this instant before his own judgment seat the ordeal by fire Ask yourselves what is the leading motive which actuates you while you are at work I do not ask you what your leading motive is for working that is a different thing you may have families to support parents to help brides to win you may have all these or other such sacred and pre eminent motives to press the morning s labour and prompt the twilight thought But when you are fairly at the work what is the motive then which tells upon every touch of it If it is the love of that which your work represents if being a landscape painter it is love of hills and trees that moves you if being a figure painter it is love of human beauty and human soul that moves you if being a flower or animal painter it is love and wonder and delight in petal and in limb that move you then the Spirit is upon you and the earth is yours and the fulness thereof But if on the other hand it is petty self complacency in your own skill trust in precepts and laws hope for academical or popular approbation or avarice of wealth it is quite possible that by steady industry or even by fortunate chance you may win the applause the position the fortune that you desire but one touch of true art you will never lay on canvas or on stone as long as you live Make then your choice boldly and consciously for one way or other it must be made On the dark and dangerous side are set the pride which delights in self contemplation the indolence which rests in unquestioned forms the ignorance that despises what is fairest among God s creatures and the dulness that denies what is marvellous in His working there is a life of monotony for your own souls and of misguiding for those of others And on the other side is open to your choice the life of the crowned spirit moving as a light in creation discovering always illuminating always gaining every hour in strength yet bowed down every hour into deeper humility sure of being right in its aim sure of being irresistible in its progress happy in what it has securely done happier in what day by day it may as securely hope happiest at the close of life when the right hand begins to forget its cunning to remember that there never was a touch of the chisel or the pencil it wielded but has added to the knowledge and quickened the happiness of mankind LECTURE II THE UNITY OF ART Part of an Address delivered at Manchester fourteenth March eighteen fifty nine Footnote I was prevented by press of other engagements from preparing this address with the care I wished and forced to trust to such expression as I could give at the moment to the points of principal importance reading however the close of the preceding lecture which I thought contained some truths that would bear repetition The whole was reported better than it deserved by mister Pitman of the Manchester Courier and published nearly verbatim I have here extracted from the published report the facts which I wish especially to enforce and have a little cleared their expression its loose and colloquial character I cannot now help unless by re writing the whole which it seems not worth while to do It is sometimes my pleasant duty to visit other cities in the hope of being able to encourage their art students but here it is my pleasanter privilege to come for encouragement myself I do not know when I have received so much as from the report read this evening by mister Hammersley bearing upon a subject which has caused me great anxiety For I have always felt in my own pursuit of art and in my endeavors to urge the pursuit of art on others that while there are many advantages now that never existed before there are certain grievous difficulties existing just in the very cause that is giving the stimulus to art in the immense spread of the manufactures of every country which is now attending vigorously to art We find that manufacture and art are now going on always together that where there is no manufacture there is no art I know how much there is of pretended art where there is no manufacture there is much in Italy for instance no country makes so bold pretence to the production of new art as Italy at this moment yet no country produces so little If you glance over the map of Europe you will find that where the manufactures are strongest there art also is strongest And yet I always felt that there was an immense difficulty to be encountered by the students who were in these centres of modern movement They had to avoid the notion that art and manufacture were in any respect one Art may be healthily associated with manufacture and probably in future will always be so but the student must be strenuously warned against supposing that they can ever be one and the same thing that art can ever be followed on the principles of manufacture Each must be followed separately the one must influence the other but each must be kept distinctly separate from the other It would be well if all students would keep clearly in their mind the real distinction between those words which we use so often Manufacture Art and Fine Art MANUFACTURE is according to the etymology and right use of the word the making of anything by hands directly or indirectly with or without the help of instruments or machines Anything proceeding from the hand of man is manufacture but it must have proceeded from his hand only acting mechanically and uninfluenced at the moment by direct intelligence Then secondly ART is the operation of the hand and the intelligence of man together there is an art of making machinery there is an art of building ships an art of making carriages and so on All these properly called Arts but not Fine Arts are pursuits in which the hand of man and his head go together working at the same instant Then FINE ART is that in which the hand the head and the heart of man go together Recollect this triple group it will help you to solve many difficult problems And remember that though the hand must be at the bottom of everything it must also go to the top of everything for Fine Art must be produced by the hand of man in a much greater and clearer sense than manufacture is Fine Art must always be produced by the subtlest of all machines which is the human hand No machine yet contrived or hereafter contrivable will ever equal the fine machinery of the human fingers Thoroughly perfect art is that which proceeds from the heart which involves all the noble emotions associates with these the head yet as inferior to the heart and the hand yet as inferior to the heart and head and thus brings out the whole man Hence it follows that since Manufacture is simply the operation of the hand of man in producing that which is useful to him it essentially separates itself from the emotions when emotions interfere with machinery they spoil it machinery must go evenly without emotion But the Fine Arts cannot go evenly they always must have emotion ruling their mechanism and until the pupil begins to feel and until all he does associates itself with the current of his feeling he is not an artist But pupils in all the schools in this country are now exposed to all kinds of temptations which blunt their feelings I constantly feel discouraged in addressing them because I know not how to tell them boldly what they ought to do when I feel how practically difficult it is for them to do it There are all sorts of demands made upon them in every direction and money is to be made in every conceivable way but the right way If you paint as you ought and study as you ought depend upon it the public will take no notice of you for a long while If you study wrongly and try to draw the attention of the public upon you supposing you to be clever students you will get swift reward but the reward does not come fast when it is sought wisely it is always held aloof for a little while the right roads of early life are very quiet ones hedged in from nearly all help or praise But the wrong roads are noisy vociferous everywhere with all kinds of demand upon you for art which is not properly art at all and in the various meetings of modern interests money is to be made in every way but art is to be followed only in one way That is what I want mainly to say to you or if not to you yourselves for from what I have heard from your excellent master to night I know you are going on all rightly you must let me say it through you to others Our Schools of Art are confused by the various teaching and various interests that are now abroad among us Everybody is talking about art and writing about it and more or less interested in it everybody wants art and there is not art for everybody and few who talk know what they are talking about thus students are led in all variable ways while there is only one way in which they can make steady progress for true art is always and will be always one Whatever changes may be made in the customs of society whatever new machines we may invent whatever new manufactures we may supply Fine Art must remain what it was two thousand years ago in the days of Phidias two thousand years hence it will be in all its principles and in all its great effects upon the mind of man just the same Observe this that I say please carefully for I mean it to the very utmost There is but one right way of doing any given thing required of an artist there may be a hundred wrong deficient or mannered ways but there is only one complete and right way Whenever two artists are trying to do the same thing with the same materials and do it in different ways one of them is wrong he may be charmingly wrong or impressively wrong various circumstances in his temper may make his wrong pleasanter than any person s right it may for him under his given limitations of knowledge or temper be better perhaps that he should err in his own way than try for anybody else s but for all that his way is wrong and it is essential for all masters of schools to know what the right way is and what right art is and to see how simple and how single all right art has been since the beginning of it But farther not only is there but one way of doing things rightly but there is only one way of seeing them and that is seeing the whole of them without any choice or more intense perception of one point than another owing to our special idiosyncrasies Thus when Titian or Tintoret look at a human being they see at a glance the whole of its nature outside and in all that it has of form of colour of passion or of thought saintliness and loveliness fleshly body and spiritual power grace or strength or softness or whatsoever other quality those men will see to the full and so paint that when narrower people come to look at what they have done every one may if he chooses find his own special pleasure in the work The sensualist will find sensuality in Titian the thinker will find thought the saint sanctity the colourist colour the anatomist form and yet the picture will never be a popular one in the full sense for none of these narrower people will find their special taste so alone consulted as that the qualities which would ensure their gratification shall be sifted or separated from others they are checked by the presence of the other qualities which ensure the gratification of other men Thus Titian is not soft enough for the sensualist Correggio suits him better Titian is not defined enough for the formalist Leonardo suits him better Titian is not pure enough for the religionist Raphael suits him better Titian is not polite enough for the man of the world Vandyke suits him better Titian is not forcible enough for the lovers of the picturesque Rembrandt suits him better So Correggio is popular with a certain set and Vandyke with a certain set and Rembrandt with a certain set All are great men but of inferior stamp and therefore Vandyke is popular and Rembrandt is popular Footnote And Murillo of all true painters the narrowest feeblest and most superficial for those reasons the most popular but nobody cares much at heart about Titian only there is a strange under current of everlasting murmur about his name which means the deep consent of all great men that he is greater than they the consent of those who having sat long enough at his feet have found in that restrained harmony of his strength there are indeed depths of each balanced power more wonderful than all those separate manifestations in inferior painters that there is a softness more exquisite than Correggio s a purity loftier than Leonardo s a force mightier than Rembrandt s a sanctity more solemn even than Raffaelle s Do not suppose that in saying this of Titian I am returning to the old eclectic theories of Bologna for all those eclectic theories observe were based not upon an endeavour to unite the various characters of nature which it is possible to do but the various narrownesses of taste which it is impossible to do Rubens is not more vigorous than Titian but less vigorous but because he is so narrow minded as to enjoy vigour only he refuses to give the other qualities of nature which would interfere with that vigour and with our perception of it Again Rembrandt is not a greater master of chiaroscuro than Titian he is a less master but because he is so narrow minded as to enjoy chiaroscuro only he withdraws from you the splendour of hue which would interfere with this and gives you only the shadow in which you can at once feel it Now all these specialties have their own charm in their own way and there are times when the particular humour of each man is refreshing to us from its very distinctness but the effort to add any other qualities to this refreshing one instantly takes away the distinctiveness and therefore the exact character to be enjoyed in its appeal to a particular humour in us Our enjoyment arose from a weakness meeting a weakness from a partiality in the painter fitting to a partiality in us and giving us sugar when we wanted sugar and myrrh when we wanted myrrh but sugar and myrrh are not meat and when we want meat and bread we must go to better men The eclectic schools endeavoured to unite these opposite partialities and weaknesses They trained themselves under masters of exaggeration and tried to unite opposite exaggerations That was impossible They did not see that the only possible eclecticism had been already accomplished the eclecticism of temperance which by the restraint of force gains higher force and by the self denial of delight gains higher delight This you will find is ultimately the case with every true and right master at first while we are tyros in art or before we have earnestly studied the man in question we shall see little in him or perhaps see as we think deficiencies we shall fancy he is inferior to this man in that and to the other man in the other but as we go on studying him we shall find that he has got both that and the other and both in a far higher sense than the man who seemed to possess those qualities in excess Thus in Turner s lifetime when people first looked at him those who liked rainy weather said he was not equal to Copley Fielding but those who looked at Turner long enough found that he could be much more wet than Copley Fielding when he chose The people who liked force said that Turner was not strong enough for them he was effeminate they liked De Wint nice strong tone or Cox great greeny dark masses of colour solemn feeling of the freshness and depth of nature they liked Cox Turner was too hot for them Had they looked long enough they would have found that he had far more force than De Wint far more freshness than Cox when he chose only united with other elements and that he didn t choose to be cool if nature had appointed the weather to be hot The people who liked Prout said Turner had not firmness of hand he did not know enough about architecture he was not picturesque enough Had they looked at his architecture long they would have found that it contained subtle picturesquenesses infinitely more picturesque than anything of Prout s People who liked Callcott said that Turner was not correct or pure enough had no classical taste Had they looked at Turner long enough they would have found him as severe when he chose as the greater Poussin Callcott a mere vulgar imitator of other men s high breeding And so throughout with all thoroughly great men their strength is not seen at first precisely because they unite in due place and measure every great quality Now the question is whether as students we are to study only these mightiest men who unite all greatness or whether we are to study the works of inferior men who present us with the greatness which we particularly like That question often comes before me when I see a strong idiosyncrasy in a student and he asks me what he should study Shall I send him to a true master who does not present the quality in a prominent way in which that student delights or send him to a man with whom he has direct sympathy It is a hard question For very curious results have sometimes been brought out especially in late years not only by students following their own bent but by their being withdrawn from teaching altogether I have just named a very great man in his own field Prout We all know his drawings and love them they have a peculiar character which no other architectural drawings ever possessed and which no others can possess because all Prout s subjects are being knocked down or restored Prout did not like restored buildings any more than I do There will never be any more Prout drawings Nor could he have been what he was or expressed with that mysteriously effective touch that peculiar delight in broken and old buildings unless he had been withdrawn from all high art influence You know that Prout was born of poor parents that he was educated down in Cornwall and that for many years all the art teaching he had was his own or the fishermen s Under the keels of the fishing boats on the sands of our southern coasts Prout learned all that he needed to learn about art Entirely by himself he felt his way to this particular style and became the painter of pictures which I think we should all regret to lose It becomes a very difficult question what that man would have been had he been brought under some entirely wholesome artistic influence He had immense gifts of composition I do not know any man who had more power of invention than Prout or who had a sublimer instinct in his treatment of things but being entirely withdrawn from all artistical help he blunders his way to that short coming representation which by the very reason of its short coming has a certain charm we should all be sorry to lose And therefore I feel embarrassed when a student comes to me in whom I see a strong instinct of that kind and cannot tell whether I ought to say to him Give up all your studies of old boats and keep away from the sea shore and come up to the Royal Academy in London and look at nothing but Titian It is a difficult thing to make up one s mind to say that However I believe on the whole we may wisely leave such matters in the hands of Providence that if we have the power of teaching the right to anybody we should teach them the right if we have the power of showing them the best thing we should show them the best thing there will always I fear be enough want of teaching and enough bad teaching to bring out very curious erratical results if we want them So if we are to teach at all let us teach the right thing and ever the right thing There are many attractive qualities inconsistent with rightness do not let us teach them let us be content to waive them There are attractive qualities in Burns and attractive qualities in Dickens which neither of those writers would have possessed if the one had been educated and the other had been studying higher nature than that of cockney London but those attractive qualities are not such as we should seek in a school of literature If we want to teach young men a good manner of writing we should teach it from Shakspeare not from Burns from Walter Scott and not from Dickens And I believe that our schools of painting are at present inefficient in their action because they have not fixed on this high principle what are the painters to whom to point nor boldly resolved to point to the best if determinable It is becoming a matter of stern necessity that they should give a simple direction to the attention of the student and that they should say This is the mark you are to aim at and you are not to go about to the print shops and peep in to see how this engraver does that and the other engraver does the other and how a nice bit of character has been caught by a new man and why this odd picture has caught the popular attention You are to have nothing to do with all that you are not to mind about popular attention just now but here is a thing which is eternally right and good you are to look at that and see if you cannot do something eternally right and good too But suppose you accept this principle and resolve to look to some great man Titian or Turner or whomsoever it may be as the model of perfection in art then the question is since this great man pursued his art in Venice or in the fields of England under totally different conditions from those possible to us now how are you to make your study of him effective here in Manchester how bring it down into patterns and all that you are called upon as operatives to produce how make it the means of your livelihood and associate inferior branches of art with this great art That may become a serious doubt to you You may think there is some other way of producing clever and pretty and saleable patterns than going to look at Titian or any other great man And that brings me to the question perhaps the most vexed question of all amongst us just now between conventional and perfect art You know that among architects and artists there are and have been almost always since art became a subject of much discussion two parties one maintaining that nature should be always altered and modified and that the artist is greater than nature they do not maintain indeed in words but they maintain in idea that the artist is greater than the Divine Maker of these things and can improve them while the other party say that he cannot improve nature and that nature on the whole should improve him That is the real meaning of the two parties the essence of them the practical result of their several theories being that the Idealists are always producing more or less formal conditions of art and the Realists striving to produce in all their art either some image of nature or record of nature these observe being quite different things the image being a resemblance and the record something which will give information about nature but not necessarily imitate it Footnote The portion of the lecture here omitted was a recapitulation of that part of the previous one which opposed conventional art to natural art You may separate these two groups of artists more distinctly in your mind as those who seek for the pleasure of art in the relations of its colours and lines without caring to convey any truth with it and those who seek for the truth first and then go down from the truth to the pleasure of colour and line Marking those two bodies distinctly as separate and thinking over them you may come to some rather notable conclusions respecting the mental dispositions which are involved in each mode of study You will find that large masses of the art of the world fall definitely under one or the other of these heads Observe pleasure first and truth afterwards or not at all as with the Arabians and Indians or truth first and pleasure afterwards as with Angelico and all other great European painters You will find that the art whose end is pleasure only is pre eminently the gift of cruel and savage nations cruel in temper savage in habits and conception but that the art which is especially dedicated to natural fact always indicates a peculiar gentleness and tenderness of mind and that all great and successful work of that kind will assuredly be the production of thoughtful sensitive earnest kind men large in their views of life and full of various intellectual power And farther when you examine the men in whom the gifts of art are variously mingled or universally mingled you will discern that the ornamental or pleasurable power though it may be possessed by good men is not in itself an indication of their goodness but is rather unless balanced by other faculties indicative of violence of temper inclining to cruelty and to irreligion On the other hand so sure as you find any man endowed with a keen and separate faculty of representing natural fact so surely you will find that man gentle and upright full of nobleness and breadth of thought I will give you two instances the first peculiarly English and another peculiarly interesting because it occurs among a nation not generally very kind or gentle I am inclined to think that considering all the disadvantages of circumstances and education under which his genius was developed there was perhaps hardly ever born a man with a more intense and innate gift of insight into nature than our own Sir Joshua Reynolds Considered as a painter of individuality in the human form and mind I think him even as it is the prince of portrait painters Titian paints nobler pictures and Vandyke had nobler subjects but neither of them entered so subtly as Sir Joshua did into the minor varieties of human heart and temper arid when you consider that with a frightful conventionality of social habitude all around him he yet conceived the simplest types of all feminine and childish loveliness that in a northern climate and with gray and white and black as the principal colours around him he yet became a colourist who can be crushed by none even of the Venetians and that with Dutch painting and Dresden china for the prevailing types of art in the saloons of his day he threw himself at once at the feet of the great masters of Italy and arose from their feet to share their throne I know not that in the whole history of art you can produce another instance of so strong so unaided so unerring an instinct for all that was true pure and noble Now do you recollect the evidence respecting the character of this man the two points of bright peculiar evidence given by the sayings of the two greatest literary men of his day Johnson and Goldsmith Johnson who as you know was always Reynolds attached friend had but one complaint to make against him that he hated nobody Reynolds he said you hate no one living I like a good hater Still more significant is the little touch in Goldsmith s Retaliation You recollect how in that poem he describes the various persons who met at one of their dinners at saint James s Coffee house each person being described under the name of some appropriate dish You will often hear the concluding lines about Reynolds Quoted He shifted his trumpet c less often or at least less attentively the preceding ones far more important Still born to improve us in every part His pencil our faces his manners our heart and never the most characteristic touch of all near the beginning Our dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains Our Burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains To make out the dinner full certain I am That Rich is anchovy and Reynolds is lamb The other painter whom I would give you as an instance of this gentleness is a man of another nation on the whole I suppose one of the most cruel civilized nations in the world the Spaniards They produced but one great painter only one but he among the very greatest of painters Velasquez You would not suppose from looking at Velasquez portraits generally that he was an especially kind or good man you perceive a peculiar sternness about them for they were as true as steel and the persons whom he had to paint being not generally kind or good people they were stern in expression and Velasquez gave the sternness but he had precisely the same intense perception of truth the same marvellous instinct for the rendering of all natural soul and all natural form that our Reynolds had Let me then read you his character as it is given by mister Stirling of Kier Certain charges of what nature we are not informed brought against him after his death made it necessary for his executor Fuensalida to refute them at a private audience granted to him by the king for that purpose After listening to the defence of his friend Philip immediately made answer I can believe all you say of the excellent disposition of Diego Velasquez Having lived for half his life in courts he was yet capable both of gratitude and generosity and in the misfortunes he could remember the early kindness of Olivares The friend of the exile of Loeches it is just to believe that he was also the friend of the all powerful favourite at Buenretiro No mean jealousy ever influenced his conduct to his brother artists he could afford not only to acknowledge the merits but to forgive the malice of his rivals His character was of that rare and happy kind in which high intellectual power is combined with indomitable strength of will and a winning sweetness of temper and which seldom fails to raise the possessor above his fellow men making his life a laurelled victory and smooth success Be strewed before his feet I am sometimes accused of trying to make art too moral yet observe I do not say in the least that in order to be a good painter you must be a good man but I do say that in order to be a good natural painter there must be strong elements of good in the mind however warped by other parts of the character There are hundreds of other gifts of painting which are not at all involved with moral conditions but this one the perception of nature is never given but under certain moral conditions Therefore now you have it in your choice here are your two paths for you it is required of you to produce conventional ornament and you may approach the task as the Hindoo does and as the Arab did without nature at all with the chance of approximating your disposition somewhat to that of the Hindoos and Arabs or as Sir Joshua and Velasquez did with not the chance but the certainty of approximating your disposition according to the sincerity of your effort to the disposition of those great and good men And do you suppose you will lose anything by approaching your conventional art from this higher side Not so I called with deliberate measurement of my expression long ago the decoration of the Alhambra detestable not merely because indicative of base conditions of moral being but because merely as decorative work however captivating in some respects it is wholly wanting in the real deep and intense qualities of ornamental art Noble conventional decoration belongs only to three periods First there is the conventional decoration of the Greeks used in subordination to their sculpture There are then the noble conventional decoration of the early Gothic schools and the noble conventional arabesque of the great Italian schools All these were reached from above all reached by stooping from a knowledge of the human form Depend upon it you will find as you look more and more into the matter that good subordinate ornament has ever been rooted in a higher knowledge and if you are again to produce anything that is noble you must have the higher knowledge first and descend to all lower service condescend as much as you like condescension never does any man any harm but get your noble standing first So then without any scruple whatever branch of art you may be inclined as a student here to follow whatever you are to make your bread by I say so far as you have time and power make yourself first a noble and accomplished artist understand at least what noble and accomplished art is and then you will be able to apply your knowledge to all service whatsoever I am now going to ask your permission to name the masters whom I think it would be well if we could agree in our Schools of Art in England to consider our leaders The first and chief I will not myself presume to name he shall be distinguished for you by the authority of those two great painters of whom we have just been speaking Reynolds and Velasquez You may remember that in your Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition the most impressive things were the works of those two men nothing told upon the eye so much no other pictures retained it with such a persistent power Now I have the testimony first of Reynolds to Velasquez and then of Velasquez to the man whom I want you to take as the master of all your English schools The testimony of Reynolds to Velasquez is very striking I take it from some fragments which have just been published by mister William Cotton precious fragments of Reynolds diaries which I chanced upon luckily as I was coming down here for I was going to take Velasquez testimony alone and then fell upon this testimony of Reynolds to Velasquez written most fortunately in Reynolds own hand you may see the manuscript What we are all said Reynolds attempting to do with great labor Velasquez does at once Just think what is implied when a man of the enormous power and facility that Reynolds had says he was trying to do with great labor what Velasquez did at once Having thus Reynolds testimony to Velasquez I will take Velasquez testimony to somebody else You know that Velasquez was sent by Philip of Spain to Italy to buy pictures for him He went all over Italy saw the living artists there and all their best pictures when freshly painted so that he had every opportunity of judging and never was a man so capable of judging He went to Rome and ordered various works of living artists and while there he was one day asked by Salvator Rosa what he thought of Raphael His reply and the ensuing conversation are thus reported by Boschini in curious Italian verse which thus translated by doctor Donaldson is quoted in mister Stirling s Life of Velasquez The master Velasquez stiffly bowed his figure tall And said For Rafael to speak the truth I always was plain spoken from my youth I cannot say I like his works at all Well said the other Salvator if you can run down So great a man I really cannot see What you can find to like in Italy To him we all agree to give the crown Diego answered thus I saw in Venice The true test of the good and beautiful First in my judgment ever stands that school And Titian first of all Italian men is Tizian ze quel die porta la bandiera Learn that line by heart and act at all events for some time to come upon Velasquez opinion in that matter Titian is much the safest master for you Raphael s power such as it characters in his mind it is Raphaelesque properly so called but Titian s power is simply the power of doing right Whatever came before Titian he did wholly as it ought to be done Do not suppose that now in recommending Titian to you so strongly and speaking of nobody else to night I am retreating in anywise from what some of you may perhaps recollect in my works the enthusiasm with which I have always spoken of another Venetian painter There are three Venetians who are never separated in my mind Titian Veronese and Tintoret They all have their own unequalled gifts and Tintoret especially has imagination and depth of soul which I think renders him indisputably the greatest man but equally indisputably Titian is the greatest painter and therefore the greatest painter who ever lived You may be led wrong by Tintoret Footnote See Appendix I Right and Wrong in many respects wrong by Raphael in more all that you learn from Titian will be right Then with Titian take Leonardo Rembrandt and Albert Duerer I name those three masters for this reason Leonardo has powers of subtle drawing which are peculiarly applicable in many ways to the drawing of fine ornament and are very useful for all students Rembrandt and Duerer are the only men whose actual work of hand you can have to look at you can have Rembrandt s etchings or Duerer s engravings actually hung in your schools and it is a main point for the student to see the real thing and avoid judging of masters at second hand As however in obeying this principle you cannot often have opportunities of studying Venetian painting it is desirable that you should have a useful standard of colour and I think it is possible for you to obtain this I cannot indeed without entering upon ground which might involve the hurting the feelings of living artists state exactly what I believe to be the relative position of various painters in England at present with respect to power of colour But I may say this that in the peculiar gifts of colour which will be useful to you as students there are only one or two of the pre Raphaelites and William Hunt of the old Water Colour Society who would be safe guides for you and as quite a safe guide there is nobody but William Hunt because the pre Raphaelites are all more or less affected by enthusiasm and by various morbid conditions of intellect and temper but old William Hunt I am sorry to say old but I say it in a loving way for every year that has added to his life has added also to his skill William Hunt is as right as the Venetians as far as he goes and what is more nearly as inimitable as they And I think if we manage to put in the principal schools of England a little bit of Hunt s work and make that somewhat of a standard of colour that we can apply his principles of colouring to subjects of all kinds Until you have had a work of his long near you nay unless you have been labouring at it and trying to copy it you do not know the thoroughly grand qualities that are concentrated in it Simplicity and intensity both of the highest character simplicity of aim and intensity of power and success are involved in that man s unpretending labour Finally you cannot believe that I would omit my own favourite Turner I fear from the very number of his works left to the nation that there is a disposition now rising to look upon his vast bequest with some contempt I beg of you if in nothing else to believe me in this that you cannot further the art of England in any way more distinctly than by giving attention to every fragment that has been left by that man The time will come when his full power and right place will be acknowledged that time will not be for many a day yet nevertheless be assured as far as you are inclined to give the least faith to anything I may say to you be assured that you can act for the good of art in England in no better way than by using whatever influence any of you have in any direction to urge the reverent study and yet more reverent preservation of the works of Turner I do not say the exhibition of his works for we are not altogether ripe for it they are still too far above us uniting as I was telling you too many qualities for us yet to feel fully their range and their influence but let us only try to keep them safe from harm and show thoroughly and conveniently what we show of them at all and day by day their greatness will dawn upon us more and more and be the root of a school of art in England which I do not doubt may be as bright as just and as refined as even that of Venice herself The dominion of the sea seems to have been associated in past time with dominion in the arts also Athens had them together Venice had them together but by so much as our authority over the ocean is wider than theirs over the AEgean or Adriatic let us strive to make our art more widely beneficent than theirs though it cannot be more exalted so working out the fulfilment in their wakening as well as their warning sense of those great words of the aged Tintoret Sempre si fa il mare maggiore LECTURE III MODERN MANUFACTURE AND DESIGN A Lecture delivered at Bradford March eighteen fifty nine It is with a deep sense of necessity for your indulgence that I venture to address you to night or that I venture at any time to address the pupils of schools of design intended for the advancement of taste in special branches of manufacture No person is able to give useful and definite help towards such special applications of art unless he is entirely familiar with the conditions of labour and natures of material involved in the work and indefinite help is little better than no help at all Nay the few remarks which I propose to lay before you this evening will I fear be rather suggestive of difficulties than helpful in conquering them nevertheless it may not be altogether unserviceable to define clearly for you and this at least I am able to do one or two of the more stern general obstacles which stand at present in the way of our success in design and to warn you against exertion of effort in any vain or wasteful way till these main obstacles are removed The first of these is our not understanding the scope and dignity of Decorative design With all our talk about it the very meaning of the words Decorative art remains confused and undecided I want if possible to settle this question for you to night and to show you that the principles on which you must work are likely to be false in proportion as they are narrow true only as they are founded on a perception of the connection of all branches of art with each other Observe then first the only essential distinction between Decorative and other art is the being fitted for a fixed place and in that place related either in subordination or command to the effect of other pieces of art And all the greatest art which the world has produced is thus fitted for a place and subordinated to a purpose There is no existing highest order art but is decorative The best sculpture yet produced has been the decoration of a temple front the best painting the decoration of a room Raphael s best doing is merely the wall colouring of a suite of apartments in the Vatican and his cartoons were made for tapestries Correggio s best doing is the decoration of two small church cupolas at Parma Michael Angelo s of a ceiling in the Pope s private chapel Tintoret s of a ceiling and side wall belonging to a charitable society at Venice while Titian and Veronese threw out their noblest thoughts not even on the inside but on the outside of the common brick and plaster walls of Venice Get rid then at once of any idea of Decorative art being a degraded or a separate kind of art Its nature or essence is simply its being fitted for a definite place and in that place forming part of a great and harmonious whole in companionship with other art and so far from this being a degradation to it so far from Decorative art being inferior to other art because it is fixed to a spot on the whole it may be considered as rather a piece of degradation that it should be portable Portable art independent of all place is for the most part ignoble art Your little Dutch landscape which you put over your sideboard to day and between the windows tomorrow is a far more contemptible piece of work than the extents of field and forest with which Benozzo has made green and beautiful the once melancholy arcade of the Campo Santo at Pisa and the wild boar of silver which you use for a seal or lock into a velvet case is little likely to be so noble a beast as the bronze boar who foams forth the fountain from under his tusks in the market place of Florence It is indeed possible that the portable picture or image may be first rate of its kind but it is not first rate because it is portable nor are Titian s frescoes less than first rate because they are fixed nay very frequently the highest compliment you can pay to a cabinet picture is to say It is as grand as a fresco Keeping then this fact fixed in our minds that all art may be decorative and that the greatest art yet produced has been decorative we may proceed to distinguish the orders and dignities of decorative art thus I The first order of it is that which is meant for places where it cannot be disturbed or injured and where it can be perfectly seen and then the main parts of it should be and have always been made by the great masters as perfect and as full of nature as possible You will every day hear it absurdly said that room decoration should be by flat patterns by dead colours by conventional monotonies and I know not what Now just be assured of this nobody ever yet used conventional art to decorate with when he could do anything better and knew that what he did would be safe Nay a great painter will always give you the natural art safe or not Correggio gets a commission to paint a room on the ground floor of a palace at Parma any of our people bred on our fine modern principles would have covered it with a diaper or with stripes or flourishes or mosaic patterns Not so Correggio he paints a thick trellis of vine leaves with oval openings and lovely children leaping through them into the room and lovely children depend upon it are rather more desirable decorations than diaper if you can do them but they are not quite so easily done In like manner Tintoret has to paint the whole end of the Council Hall at Venice An orthodox decorator would have set himself to make the wall look like a wall Tintoret thinks it would be rather better if he can manage it to make it look a little like Paradise stretches his canvas right over the wall and his clouds right over his canvas brings the light through his clouds all blue and clear zodiac beyond zodiac rolls away the vaporous flood from under the feet of saints leaving them at last in infinitudes of light unorthodox in the last degree but on the whole pleasant And so in all other cases whatever the greatest decorative art is wholly unconventional downright pure good painting and sculpture but always fitted for its place and subordinated to the purpose it has to serve in that place II But if art is to be placed where it is liable to injury to wear and tear or to alteration of its form as for instance on domestic utensils and armour and weapons and dress in which either the ornament will be worn out by the usage of the thing or will be cast into altered shape by the play of its folds then it is wrong to put beautiful and perfect art to such uses and you want forms of inferior art such as will be by their simplicity less liable to injury or by reason of their complexity and continuousness may show to advantage however distorted by the folds they are cast into And thus arise the various forms of inferior decorative art respecting which the general law is that the lower the place and office of the thing the less of natural or perfect form you should have in it a zigzag or a chequer is thus a better because a more consistent ornament for a cup or platter than a landscape or portrait is hence the general definition of the true forms of conventional ornament is that they consist in the bestowal of as much beauty on the object as shall be consistent with its Material its Place and its Office Let us consider these three modes of consistency a little A Conventionalism by cause of inefficiency of material If for instance we are required to represent a human figure with stone only we cannot represent its colour we reduce its colour to whiteness That is not elevating the human body but degrading it only it would be a much greater degradation to give its colour falsely Diminish beauty as much as you will but do not misrepresent it So again when we are sculpturing a face we can t carve its eyelashes The face is none the better for wanting its eyelashes it is injured by the want but would be much more injured by a clumsy representation of them Neither can we carve the hair We must be content with the conventionalism of vile solid knots and lumps of marble instead of the golden cloud that encompasses the fair human face with its waving mystery The lumps of marble are not an elevated representation of hair they are a degraded one yet better than any attempt to imitate hair with the incapable material In all cases in which such imitation is attempted instant degradation to a still lower level is the result For the effort to imitate shows that the workman has only a base and poor conception of the beauty of the reality else he would know his task to be hopeless and give it up at once so that all endeavours to avoid conventionalism when the material demands it result from insensibility to truth and are among the worst forms of vulgarity Hence in the greatest Greek statues the hair is very slightly indicated not because the sculptor disdained hair but because he knew what it was too well to touch it insolently I do not doubt but that the Greek painters drew hair exactly as Titian does Modern attempts to produce finished pictures on glass result from the same base vulgarism No man who knows what painting means can endure a painted glass window which emulates painter s work But he rejoices in a glowing mosaic of broken colour for that is what the glass has the special gift and right of producing Footnote See Appendix II Sir Joshua Reynolds s disappointment B Conventionalism by cause of inferiority of place When work is to be seen at a great distance or in dark places or in some other imperfect way it constantly becomes necessary to treat it coarsely or severely in order to make it effective The statues on cathedral fronts in good times of design are variously treated according to their distances no fine execution is put into the features of the Madonna who rules the group of figures above the south transept of Rouen at one hundred fifty feet above the ground but in base modern work as Milan Cathedral the sculpture is finished without any reference to distance and the merit of every statue is supposed to consist in the visitor s being obliged to ascend three hundred steps before he can see it C Conventionalism by cause of inferiority of office When one piece of ornament is to be subordinated to another as the moulding is to the sculpture it encloses or the fringe of a drapery to the statue it veils this inferior ornament needs to be degraded in order to mark its lower office and this is best done by refusing more or less the introduction of natural form The less of nature it contains the more degraded is the ornament and the fitter for a humble place but however far a great workman may go in refusing the higher organisms of nature he always takes care to retain the magnificence of natural lines that is to say of the infinite curves such as I have analyzed in the fourth volume of Modern Painters His copyists fancying that they can follow him without nature miss precisely the essence of all the work so that even the simplest piece of Greek conventional ornament loses the whole of its value in any modern imitation of it the finer curves being always missed Perhaps one of the dullest and least justifiable mistakes which have yet been made about my writing is the supposition that I have attacked or despised Greek work I have attacked Palladian work and modern imitation of Greek work Of Greek work itself I have never spoken but with a reverence quite infinite I name Phidias always in exactly the same tone with which I speak of Michael Angelo Titian and Dante My first statement of this faith now thirteen years ago was surely clear enough We shall see by this light three colossal images standing up side by side looming in their great rest of spirituality above the whole world horizon Phidias Michael Angelo and Dante from these we may go down step by step among the mighty men of every age securely and certainly observant of diminished lustre in every appearance of restlessness and effort until the last trace of inspiration vanishes in the tottering affectation or tortured insanities of modern times Modern Painters vol ii p two hundred fifty three This was surely plain speaking enough and from that day to this my effort has been not less continually to make the heart of Greek work known than the heart of Gothic namely the nobleness of conception of form derived from perpetual study of the figure and my complaint of the modern architect has been not that he followed the Greeks but that he denied the first laws of life in theirs as in all other art The fact is that all good subordinate forms of ornamentation ever yet existent in the world have been invented and others as beautiful can only be invented by men primarily exercised in drawing or carving the human figure I will not repeat here what I have already twice insisted upon to the students of London and Manchester respecting the degradation of temper and intellect which follows the pursuit of art without reference to natural form as among the Asiatics here I will only trespass on your patience so far as to mark the inseparable connection between figure drawing and good ornamental work in the great European schools and all that are connected with them Tell me then first of all what ornamental work is usually put before our students as the type of decorative perfection Raphael s arabesques are they not Well Raphael knew a little about the figure I suppose before he drew them I do not say that I like those arabesques but there are certain qualities in them which are inimitable by modern designers and those qualities are just the fruit of the master s figure study What is given the student as next to Raphael s work Cinquecento ornament generally Well cinquecento generally with its birds and cherubs and wreathed foliage and clustered fruit was the amusement of men who habitually and easily carved the figure or painted it All the truly fine specimens of it have figures or animals as main parts of the design Nay but some anciently or mediaevally minded person will exclaim we don t want to study cinquecento We want severer purer conventionalism What will you have Egyptian ornament Why the whole mass of it is made up of multitudinous human figures in every kind of action and magnificent action their kings drawing their bows in their chariots their sheaves of arrows rattling at their shoulders the slain falling under them as before a pestilence their captors driven before them in astonied troops and do you expect to imitate Egyptian ornament without knowing how to draw the human figure Nay but you will take Christian ornament purest mediaeval Christian thirteenth century Yes and do you suppose you will find the Christian less human The least natural and most purely conventional ornament of the Gothic schools is that of their painted glass and do you suppose painted glass in the fine times was ever wrought without figures We have got into the way among our other modern wretchednesses of trying to make windows of leaf diapers and of strips of twisted red and yellow bands looking like the patterns of currant jelly on the top of Christmas cakes but every casement of old glass contained a saint s history The windows of Bourges Chartres or Rouen have ten fifteen or twenty medallions in each and each medallion contains two figures at least often six or seven representing every event of interest in the history of the saint whose life is in question Nay but you say those figures are rude and quaint and ought not to be imitated Why so is the leafage rude and quaint yet you imitate that The coloured border pattern of geranium or ivy leaf is not one whit better drawn or more like geraniums and ivy than the figures are like figures but you call the geranium leaf idealized why don t you call the figures so The fact is neither are idealized but both are conventionalized on the same principles and in the same way and if you want to learn how to treat the leafage the only way is to learn first how to treat the figure And you may soon test your powers in this respect Those old workmen were not afraid of the most familiar subjects The windows of Chartres were presented by the trades of the town and at the bottom of each window is a representation of the proceedings of the tradesmen at the business which enabled them to pay for the window There are smiths at the forge curriers at their hides tanners looking into their pits mercers selling goods over the counter all made into beautiful medallions Therefore whenever you want to know whether you have got any real power of composition or adaptation in ornament don t be content with sticking leaves together by the ends anybody can do that but try to conventionalize a butcher s or a greengrocer s with Saturday night customers buying cabbage and beef That will tell you if you can design or not I can fancy your losing patience with me altogether just now We asked this fellow down to tell our workmen how to make shawls and he is only trying to teach them how to caricature But have a little patience with me and examine after I have done a little for yourselves into the history of ornamental art and you will discover why I do this You will discover I repeat that all great ornamental art whatever is founded on the effort of the workman to draw the figure and in the best schools to draw all that he saw about him in living nature The best art of pottery is acknowledged to be that of Greece and all the power of design exhibited in it down to the merest zigzag arises primarily from the workman having been forced to outline nymphs and knights from those helmed and draped figures he holds his power Of Egyptian ornament I have just spoken You have everything given there that the workman saw people of his nation employed in hunting fighting fishing visiting making love building cooking everything they did is drawn magnificently or familiarly as was needed In Byzantine ornament saints or animals which are types of various spiritual power are the main subjects and from the church down to the piece of enamelled metal figure figure figure always principal In Norman and Gothic work you have with all their quiet saints also other much disquieted persons hunting feasting fighting and so on or whole hordes of animals racing after each other In the Bayeux tapestry Queen Matilda gave as well as she could in many respects graphically enough the whole history of the conquest of England Thence as you increase in power of art you have more and more finished figures up to the solemn sculptures of Wells Cathedral or the cherubic enrichments of the Venetian Madonna dei Miracoli Therefore I will tell you fearlessly for I know it is true you must raise your workman up to life or you will never get from him one line of well imagined conventionalism We have at present no good ornamental design We can t have it yet and we must be patient if we want to have it Do not hope to feel the effect of your schools at once but raise the men as high as you can and then let them stoop as low as you need no great man ever minds stooping Encourage the students in sketching accurately and continually from nature anything that comes in their way still life flowers animals but above all figures and so far as you allow of any difference between an artist s training and theirs let it be not in what they draw but in the degree of conventionalism you require in the sketch For my own part I should always endeavour to give thorough artistical training first but I am not certain the experiment being yet untried what results may be obtained by a truly intelligent practice of conventional drawing such as that of the Egyptians Greeks or thirteenth century French which consists in the utmost possible rendering of natural form by the fewest possible lines The animal and bird drawing of the Egyptians is in their fine age quite magnificent under its conditions magnificent in two ways first in keenest perception of the main forms and facts in the creature and secondly in the grandeur of line by which their forms are abstracted and insisted on making every asp ibis and vulture a sublime spectre of asp or ibis or vulture power The way for students to get some of this gift again some only for I believe the fulness of the gift itself to be connected with vital superstition and with resulting intensity of reverence people were likely to know something about hawks and ibises when to kill one was to be irrevocably judged to death is never to pass a day without drawing some animal from the life allowing themselves the fewest possible lines and colours to do it with but resolving that whatever is characteristic of the animal shall in some way or other be shown Footnote Plate seventy five in Vol V of Wilkinson s Ancient Egypt will give the student an idea of how to set to work I repeat it cannot yet be judged what results might be obtained by a nobly practised conventionalism of this kind but however that may be the first fact the necessity of animal and figure drawing is absolutely certain and no person who shrinks from it will ever become a great designer One great good arises even from the first step in figure drawing that it gets the student quit at once of the notion of formal symmetry If you learn only to draw a leaf well you are taught in some of our schools to turn it the other way opposite to itself and the two leaves set opposite ways are called a design and thus it is supposed possible to produce ornamentation though you have no more brains than a looking glass or a kaleidoscope has But if you once learn to draw the human figure you will find that knocking two men s heads together does not necessarily constitute a good design nay that it makes a very bad design or no design at all and you will see at once that to arrange a group of two or more figures you must though perhaps it may be desirable to balance or oppose them at the same time vary their attitudes and make one not the reverse of the other but the companion of the other I had a somewhat amusing discussion on this subject with a friend only the other day and one of his retorts upon me was so neatly put and expresses so completely all that can either be said or shown on the opposite side that it is well worth while giving it you exactly in the form it was sent to me My friend had been maintaining that the essence of ornament consisted in three things contrast series and symmetry I replied by letter that none of them nor all of them together would produce ornament Here making a ragged blot with the back of my pen on the paper you have contrast but it isn t ornament here one two three four five six writing the numerals You have series but it isn t ornament and here sketching a rough but symmetrical stick figure sketch of a human body at the side you have symmetry but it isn t ornament My friend replied Your materials were not ornament because you did not apply them I send them to you back made up into a choice sporting neckerchief Illustration Sketch of a square of cloth decorated with a diagonal grid pattern of stick figure human forms with repeated and reflected ink blot shapes at the corners and the digits one through six arranged into simple symmetrical shapes and repeated around the border Symmetrical figure Unit of diaper Contrast Corner ornaments Series Border ornaments Each figure is converted into a harmony by being revolved on its two axes the whole opposed in contrasting series My answer was or rather was to the effect for I must expand it a little here that his words because you did not apply them contained the gist of the whole matter that the application of them or any other things was precisely the essence of design the non application or wrong application the negation of design that his use of the poor materials was in this case admirable and that if he could explain to me in clear words the principles on which he had so used them he would be doing a very great service to all students of art Tell me therefore I asked these main points one How did you determine the number of figures you would put into the neckerchief Had there been more it would have been mean and ineffective a pepper and salt sprinkling of figures Had there been fewer it would have been monstrous How did you fix the number two How did you determine the breadth of the border and relative size of the numerals three Why are there two lines outside of the border and one only inside Why are there no more lines Why not three and two or three and five Why lines at all to separate the barbarous figures and why if lines at all not double or treble instead of single four Why did you put the double blots at the corners Why not at the angles of the chequers or in the middle of the border It is precisely your knowing why not to do these things and why to do just what you have done which constituted your power of design and like all the people I have ever known who had that power you are entirely unconscious of the essential laws by which you work and confuse other people by telling them that the design depends on symmetry and series when in fact it depends entirely on your own sense and judgment This was the substance of my last answer to which as I knew beforehand would be the case I got no reply but it still remains to be observed that with all the skill and taste especially involving the architect s great trust harmony of proportion which my friend could bring to bear on the materials given him the result is still only a sporting neckerchief that is to say the materials addressed first to recklessness in the shape of a mere blot then to computativeness in a series of figures and then to absurdity and ignorance in the shape of an ill drawn caricature such materials however treated can only work up into what will please reckless computative and vulgar persons that is to say into a sporting neckerchief The difference between this piece of ornamentation and Correggio s painting at Parma lies simply and wholly in the additions somewhat large ones of truth and of tenderness in the drawing being lovely as well as symmetrical and representative of realities as well as agreeably disposed And truth tenderness and inventive application or disposition are indeed the roots of ornament not contrast nor symmetry It ought yet farther to be observed that the nobler the materials the less their symmetry is endurable In the present case the sense of fitness and order produced by the repetition of the figures neutralizes in some degree their reckless vulgarity and is wholly therefore beneficent to them But draw the figures better and their repetition will become painful You may harmlessly balance a mere geometrical form and oppose one quatrefoil or cusp by another exactly like it But put two Apollo Belvideres back to back and you will not think the symmetry improves them Whenever the materials of ornament are noble they must be various and repetition of parts is either the sign of utterly bad hopeless and base work or of the intended degradation of the parts in which such repetition is allowed in order to foil others more noble Such then are a few of the great principles by the enforcement of which you may hope to promote the success of the modern student of design but remember none of these principles will be useful at all unless you understand them to be in one profound and stern sense useless Footnote I shall endeavour for the future to put my self contradictions in short sentences and direct terms in order to save sagacious persons the trouble of looking for them That is to say unless you feel that neither you nor I nor any one can in the great ultimate sense teach anybody how to make a good design If designing could be taught all the world would learn as all the world reads or calculates But designing is not to be spelled nor summed My men continually come to me in my drawing class in London thinking I am to teach them what is instantly to enable them to gain their bread Please sir show us how to design Make designers of us And you I doubt not partly expect me to tell you to night how to make designers of your Bradford youths Alas I could as soon tell you how to make or manufacture an ear of wheat as to make a good artist of any kind I can analyze the wheat very learnedly for you tell you there is starch in it and carbon and silex I can give you starch and charcoal and flint but you are as far from your ear of wheat as you were before All that can possibly be done for any one who wants ears of wheat is to show them where to find grains of wheat and how to sow them and then with patience in Heaven s time the ears will come or will perhaps come ground and weather permitting So in this matter of making artists first you must find your artist in the grain then you must plant him fence and weed the field about him and with patience ground and weather permitting you may get an artist out of him not otherwise And what I have to speak to you about tonight is mainly the ground and the weather it being the first and quite most material question in this matter whether the ground and weather of Bradford or the ground and weather of England in general suit wheat And observe in the outset it is not so much what the present circumstances of England are as what we wish to make them that we have to consider If you will tell me what you ultimately intend Bradford to be perhaps I can tell you what Bradford can ultimately produce But you must have your minds clearly made up and be distinct in telling me what you do want At present I don t know what you are aiming at and possibly on consideration you may feel some doubt whether you know yourselves As matters stand all over England as soon as one mill is at work occupying two hundred hands we try by means of it to set another mill at work occupying four hundred That is all simple and comprehensive enough but what is it to come to How many mills do we want or do we indeed want no end of mills Let us entirely understand each other on this point before we go any farther Last week I drove from Rochdale to Bolton Abbey quietly in order to see the country and certainly it was well worth while I never went over a more interesting twenty miles than those between Rochdale and Burnley Naturally the valley has been one of the most beautiful in the Lancashire hills one of the far away solitudes full of old shepherd ways of life At this time there are not I speak deliberately and I believe quite literally there are not I think more than a thousand yards of road to be traversed anywhere without passing a furnace or mill Now is that the kind of thing you want to come to everywhere Because if it be and you tell me so distinctly I think I can make several suggestions to night and could make more if you give me time which would materially advance your object The extent of our operations at present is more or less limited by the extent of coal and ironstone but we have not yet learned to make proper use of our clay Over the greater part of England south of the manufacturing districts there are magnificent beds of various kinds of useful clay and I believe that it would not be difficult to point out modes of employing it which might enable us to turn nearly the whole of the south of England into a brickfield as we have already turned nearly the whole of the north into a coal pit I say nearly the whole because as you are doubtless aware there are considerable districts in the south composed of chalk renowned up to the present time for their downs and mutton But I think by examining carefully into the conceivable uses of chalk we might discover a quite feasible probability of turning all the chalk districts into a limekiln as we turn the clay districts into a brickfield There would then remain nothing but the mountain districts to be dealt with but as we have not yet ascertained all the uses of clay and chalk still less have we ascertained those of stone and I think by draining the useless inlets of the Cumberland Welsh and Scotch lakes and turning them with their rivers into navigable reservoirs and canals there would be no difficulty in working the whole of our mountain districts as a gigantic quarry of slate and granite from which all the rest of the world might be supplied with roofing and building stone Is this then what you want You are going straight at it at present and I have only to ask under what limitations I am to conceive or describe your final success Or shall there be no limitations There are none to your powers every day puts new machinery at your disposal and increases with your capital the vastness of your undertakings The changes in the state of this country are now so rapid that it would be wholly absurd to endeavour to lay down laws of art education for it under its present aspect and circumstances and therefore I must necessarily ask how much of it do you seriously intend within the next fifty years to be coal pit brickfield or quarry For the sake of distinctness of conclusion I will suppose your success absolute that from shore to shore the whole of the island is to be set as thick with chimneys as the masts stand in the docks of Liverpool and there shall be no meadows in it no trees no gardens only a little corn grown upon the housetops reaped and threshed by steam that you do not leave even room for roads but travel either over the roofs of your mills on viaducts or under their floors in tunnels that the smoke having rendered the light of the sun unserviceable you work always by the light of your own gas that no acre of English ground shall be without its shaft and its engine and therefore no spot of English ground left on which it shall be possible to stand without a definite and calculable chance of being blown off it at any moment into small pieces Under these circumstances if this is to be the future of England no designing or any other development of beautiful art will be possible Do not vex your minds nor waste your money with any thought or effort in the matter Beautiful art can only be produced by people who have beautiful things about them and leisure to look at them and unless you provide some elements of beauty for your workmen to be surrounded by you will find that no elements of beauty can be invented by them I was struck forcibly by the bearing of this great fact upon our modern efforts at ornamentation in an afternoon walk last week in the suburbs of one of our large manufacturing towns I was thinking of the difference in the effect upon the designer s mind between the scene which I then came upon and the scene which would have presented itself to the eyes of any designer of the middle ages when he left his workshop Just outside the town I came upon an old English cottage or mansion I hardly know which to call it set close under the hill and beside the river perhaps built somewhere in the Charles s time with mullioned windows and a low arched porch round which in the little triangular garden one can imagine the family as they used to sit in old summer times the ripple of the river heard faintly through the sweetbrier hedge and the sheep on the far off wolds shining in the evening sunlight There uninhabited for many and many a year it had been left in unregarded havoc of ruin the garden gate still swung loose to its latch the garden blighted utterly into a field of ashes not even a weed taking root there the roof torn into shapeless rents the shutters hanging about the windows in rags of rotten wood before its gate the stream which had gladdened it now soaking slowly by black as ebony and thick with curdling scum the bank above it trodden into unctuous sooty slime far in front of it between it and the old hills the furnaces of the city foaming forth perpetual plague of sulphurous darkness the volumes of their storm clouds coiling low over a waste of grassless fields fenced from each other not by hedges but by slabs of square stone like gravestones riveted together with iron That was your scene for the designer s contemplation in his afternoon walk at Rochdale Now fancy what was the scene which presented itself in his afternoon walk to a designer of the Gothic school of Pisa Nino Pisano or any of his men On each side of a bright river he saw rise a line of brighter palaces arched and pillared and inlaid with deep red porphyry and with serpentine along the quays before their gates were riding troops of knights noble in face and form dazzling in crest and shield horse and man one labyrinth of quaint colour and gleaming light the purple and silver and scarlet fringes flowing over the strong limbs and clashing mail like sea waves over rocks at sunset Opening on each side from the river were gardens courts and cloisters long successions of white pillars among wreaths of vine leaping of fountains through buds of pomegranate and orange and still along the garden paths and under and through the crimson of the pomegranate shadows moving slowly groups of the fairest women that Italy ever saw fairest because purest and thoughtfullest trained in all high knowledge as in all courteous art in dance in song in sweet wit in lofty learning in loftier courage in loftiest love able alike to cheer to enchant or save the souls of men Above all this scenery of perfect human life rose dome and bell tower burning with white alabaster and gold beyond dome and bell tower the slopes of mighty hills hoary with olive far in the north above a purple sea of peaks of solemn Apennine the clear sharp cloven Carrara mountains sent up their steadfast flames of marble summit into amber sky the great sea itself scorching with expanse of light stretching from their feet to the Gorgonian isles and over all these ever present near or far seen through the leaves of vine or imaged with all its march of clouds in the Arno s stream or set with its depth of blue close against the golden hair and burning cheek of lady and knight that untroubled and sacred sky which was to all men in those days of innocent faith indeed the unquestioned abode of spirits as the earth was of men and which opened straight through its gates of cloud and veils of dew into the awfulness of the eternal world a heaven in which every cloud that passed was literally the chariot of an angel and every ray of its Evening and Morning streamed from the throne of God What think you of that for a school of design I do not bring this contrast before you as a ground of hopelessness in our task neither do I look for any possible renovation of the Republic of Pisa at Bradford in the nineteenth century but I put it before you in order that you may be aware precisely of the kind of difficulty you have to meet and may then consider with yourselves how far you can meet it To men surrounded by the depressing and monotonous circumstances of English manufacturing life depend upon it design is simply impossible This is the most distinct of all the experiences I have had in dealing with the modern workman He is intelligent and ingenious in the highest degree subtle in touch and keen in sight but he is generally speaking wholly destitute of designing power And if you want to give him the power you must give him the materials and put him in the circumstances for it Design is not the offspring of idle fancy it is the studied result of accumulative observation and delightful habit Without observation and experience no design without peace and pleasurableness in occupation no design and all the lecturings and teachings and prizes and principles of art in the world are of no use so long as you don t surround your men with happy influences and beautiful things It is impossible for them to have right ideas about colour unless they see the lovely colours of nature unspoiled impossible for them to supply beautiful incident and action in their ornament unless they see beautiful incident and action in the world about them Inform their minds refine their habits and you form and refine their designs but keep them illiterate uncomfortable and in the midst of unbeautiful things and whatever they do will still be spurious vulgar and valueless I repeat that I do not ask you nor wish you to build a new Pisa for them We don t want either the life or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again and the circumstances with which you must surround your workmen are those simply of happy modern English life because the designs you have now to ask for from your workmen are such as will make modern English life beautiful All that gorgeousness of the middle ages beautiful as it sounds in description noble as in many respects it was in reality had nevertheless for foundation and for end nothing but the pride of life the pride of the so called superior classes a pride which supported itself by violence and robbery and led in the end to the destruction both of the arts themselves and the States in which they nourished The great lesson of history is that all the fine arts hitherto having been supported by the selfish power of the noblesse and never having extended their range to the comfort or the relief of the mass of the people the arts I say thus practised and thus matured have only accelerated the ruin of the States they adorned and at the moment when in any kingdom you point to the triumphs of its greatest artists you point also to the determined hour of the kingdom s decline The names of great painters are like passing bells in the name of Velasquez you hear sounded the fall of Spain in the name of Titian that of Venice in the name of Leonardo that of Milan in the name of Raphael that of Rome And there is profound justice in this for in proportion to the nobleness of the power is the guilt of its use for purposes vain or vile and hitherto the greater the art the more surely has it been used and used solely for the decoration of pride Footnote Whether religious or profane pride chapel or banqueting room is no matter or the provoking of sensuality Another course lies open to us We may abandon the hope or if you like the words better we may disdain the temptation of the pomp and grace of Italy in her youth For us there can be no more the throne of marble for us no more the vault of gold but for us there is the loftier and lovelier privilege of bringing the power and charm of art within the reach of the humble and the poor and as the magnificence of past ages failed by its narrowness and its pride ours may prevail and continue by its universality and its lowliness And thus between the picture of too laborious England which we imagined as future and the picture of too luxurious Italy which we remember in the past there may exist there will exist if we do our duty an intermediate condition neither oppressed by labour nor wasted in vanity the condition of a peaceful and thoughtful temperance in aims and acts and arts We are about to enter upon a period of our world s history in which domestic life aided by the arts of peace will slowly but at last entirely supersede public life and the arts of war For our own England she will not I believe be blasted throughout with furnaces nor will she be encumbered with palaces I trust she will keep her green fields her cottages and her homes of middle life but these ought to be and I trust will be enriched with a useful truthful substantial form of art We want now no more feasts of the gods nor martyrdoms of the saints we have no need of sensuality no place for superstition or for costly insolence Let us have learned and faithful historical painting touching and thoughtful representations of human nature in dramatic painting poetical and familiar renderings of natural objects and of landscape and rational deeply felt realizations of the events which are the subjects of our religious faith And let these things we want as far as possible be scattered abroad and made accessible to all men So also in manufacture we require work substantial rather than rich in make and refined rather than splendid in design Your stuffs need not be such as would catch the eye of a duchess but they should be such as may at once serve the need and refine the taste of a cottager The prevailing error in English dress especially among the lower orders is a tendency to flimsiness and gaudiness arising mainly from the awkward imitation of their superiors Footnote If their superiors would give them simplicity and economy to imitate it would in the issue be well for themselves as well as for those whom they guide The typhoid fever of passion for dress and all other display which has struck the upper classes of Europe at this time is one of the most dangerous political elements we have to deal with Its wickedness I have shown elsewhere Polit Economy of Art p sixty two et seq but its wickedness is in the minds of most persons a matter of no importance I wish I had time also to show them its danger I cannot enter here into political investigation but this is a certain fact that the wasteful and vain expenses at present indulged in by the upper classes are hastening the advance of republicanism more than any other element of modern change No agitators no clubs no epidemical errors ever were or will be fatal to social order in any nation Nothing but the guilt of the upper classes wanton accumulated reckless and merciless ever overthrows them Of such guilt they have now much to answer for let them look to it in time It should be one of the first objects of all manufacturers to produce stuffs not only beautiful and quaint in design but also adapted for every day service and decorous in humble and secluded life And you must remember always that your business as manufacturers is to form the market as much as to supply it If in shortsighted and reckless eagerness for wealth you catch at every humour of the populace as it shapes itself into momentary demand if in jealous rivalry with neighbouring States or with other producers you try to attract attention by singularities novelties and gaudinesses to make every design an advertisement and pilfer every idea of a successful neighbour s that you may insidiously imitate it or pompously eclipse no good design will ever be possible to you or perceived by you You may by accident snatch the market or by energy command it you may obtain the confidence of the public and cause the ruin of opponent houses or you may with equal justice of fortune be ruined by them But whatever happens to you this at least is certain that the whole of your life will have been spent in corrupting public taste and encouraging public extravagance Every preference you have won by gaudiness must have been based on the purchaser s vanity every demand you have created by novelty has fostered in the consumer a habit of discontent and when you retire into inactive life you may as a subject of consolation for your declining years reflect that precisely according to the extent of your past operations your life has been successful in retarding the arts tarnishing the virtues and confusing the manners of your country But on the other hand if you resolve from the first that so far as you can ascertain or discern what is best you will produce what is best on an intelligent consideration of the probable tendencies and possible tastes of the people whom you supply you may literally become more influential for all kinds of good than many lecturers on art or many treatise writers on morality Considering the materials dealt with and the crude state of art knowledge at the time I do not know that any more wide or effective influence in public taste was ever exercised than that of the Staffordshire manufacture of pottery under William Wedgwood and it only rests with the manufacturer in every other business to determine whether he will in like manner make his wares educational instruments or mere drugs of the market You all should be in a certain sense authors you must indeed first catch the public eye as an author must the public ear but once gain your audience or observance and as it is in the writer s power thenceforward to publish what will educate as it amuses so it is in yours to publish what will educate as it adorns Nor is this surely a subject of poor ambition I hear it said continually that men are too ambitious alas to me it seems they are never enough ambitious How many are content to be merely the thriving merchants of a state when they might be its guides counsellors and rulers wielding powers of subtle but gigantic beneficence in restraining its follies while they supplied its wants Let such duty such ambition be once accepted in their fulness and the best glory of European art and of European manufacture may yet be to come The paintings of Raphael and of Buonaroti gave force to the falsehoods of superstition and majesty to the imaginations of sin but the arts of England may have for their task to inform the soul with truth and touch the heart with compassion The steel of Toledo and the silk of Genoa did but give strength to oppression and lustre to pride let it be for the furnace and for the loom of England as they have already richly earned still more abundantly to bestow comfort on the indigent civilization on the rude and to dispense through the peaceful homes of nations the grace and the preciousness of simple adornment and useful possession LECTURE IV INFLUENCE OF IMAGINATION IN ARCHITECTURE An Address Delivered to the Members of the Architectural Association in Lyon s Inn Hall eighteen fifty seven If we were to be asked abruptly and required to answer briefly what qualities chiefly distinguish great artists from feeble artists we should answer I suppose first their sensibility and tenderness secondly their imagination and thirdly their industry Some of us might perhaps doubt the justice of attaching so much importance to this last character because we have all known clever men who were indolent and dull men who were industrious But though you may have known clever men who were indolent you never knew a great man who was so and during such investigation as I have been able to give to the lives of the artists whose works are in all points noblest no fact ever looms so large upon me no law remains so steadfast in the universality of its application as the fact and law that they are all great workers nothing concerning them is matter of more astonishment than the quantity they have accomplished in the given length of their life and when I hear a young man spoken of as giving promise of high genius the first question I ask about him is always Does he work But though this quality of industry is essential to an artist it does not in anywise make an artist many people are busy whose doings are little worth Neither does sensibility make an artist since as I hope many can feel both strongly and nobly who yet care nothing about art But the gifts which distinctively mark the artist without which he must be feeble in life forgotten in death with which he may become one of the shakers of the earth and one of the signal lights in heaven are those of sympathy and imagination I will not occupy your time nor incur the risk of your dissent by endeavouring to give any close definition of this last word We all have a general and sufficient idea of imagination and of its work with our hands and in our hearts we understand it I suppose as the imaging or picturing of new things in our thoughts and we always show an involuntary respect for this power wherever we can recognize it acknowledging it to be a greater power than manipulation or calculation or observation or any other human faculty If we see an old woman spinning at the fireside and distributing her thread dexterously from the distaff we respect her for her manipulation if we ask her how much she expects to make in a year and she answers quickly we respect her for her calculation if she is watching at the same time that none of her grandchildren fall into the fire we respect her for her observation yet for all this she may still be a commonplace old woman enough But if she is all the time telling her grandchildren a fairy tale out of her head we praise her for her imagination and say she must be a rather remarkable old woman Precisely in like manner if an architect does his working drawing well we praise him for his manipulation if he keeps closely within his contract we praise him for his honest arithmetic if he looks well to the laying of his beams so that nobody shall drop through the floor we praise him for his observation But he must somehow tell us a fairy tale out of his head beside all this else we cannot praise him for his imagination nor speak of him as we did of the old woman as being in any wise out of the common way a rather remarkable architect It seemed to me therefore as if it might interest you to night if we were to consider together what fairy tales are in and by architecture to be told what there is for you to do in this severe art of yours out of your heads as well as by your hands Perhaps the first idea which a young architect is apt to be allured by as a head problem in these experimental days is its being incumbent upon him to invent a new style worthy of modern civilization in general and of England in particular a style worthy of our engines and telegraphs as expansive as steam and as sparkling as electricity But if there are any of my hearers who have been impressed with this sense of inventive duty may I ask them first whether their plan is that every inventive architect among us shall invent a new style for himself and have a county set aside for his conceptions or a province for his practice Or must every architect invent a little piece of the new style and all put it together at last like a dissected map And if so when the new style is invented what is to be done next I will grant you this Eldorado of imagination but can you have more than one Columbus Or if you sail in company and divide the prize of your discovery and the honour thereof who is to come after you clustered Columbuses to what fortunate islands of style are your architectural descendants to sail avaricious of new lands When our desired style is invented will not the best we can all do be simply to build in it and cannot you now do that in styles that are known Observe I grant for the sake of your argument what perhaps many of you know that I would not grant otherwise that a new style can be invented I grant you not only this but that it shall be wholly different from any that was ever practised before We will suppose that capitals are to be at the bottom of pillars instead of the top and that buttresses shall be on the tops of pinnacles instead of at the bottom that you roof your apertures with stones which shall neither be arched nor horizontal and that you compose your decoration of lines which shall neither be crooked nor straight The furnace and the forge shall be at your service you shall draw out your plates of glass and beat out your bars of iron till you have encompassed us all if your style is of the practical kind with endless perspective of black skeleton and blinding square or if your style is to be of the ideal kind you shall wreathe your streets with ductile leafage and roof them with variegated crystal you shall put if you will all London under one blazing dome of many colours that shall light the clouds round it with its flashing as far as to the sea And still I ask you What after this Do you suppose those imaginations of yours will ever lie down there asleep beneath the shade of your iron leafage or within the coloured light of your enchanted dome Not so Those souls and fancies and ambitions of yours are wholly infinite and whatever may be done by others you will still want to do something for yourselves if you cannot rest content with Palladio neither will you with Paxton all the metal and glass that ever were melted have not so much weight in them as will clog the wings of one human spirit s aspiration If you will think over this quietly by yourselves and can get the noise out of your ears of the perpetual empty idle incomparably idiotic talk about the necessity of some novelty in architecture you will soon see that the very essence of a Style properly so called is that it should be practised for ages and applied to all purposes and that so long as any given style is in practice all that is left for individual imagination to accomplish must be within the scope of that style not in the invention of a new one If there are any here therefore who hope to obtain celebrity by the invention of some strange way of building which must convince all Europe into its adoption to them for the moment I must not be understood to address myself but only to those who would be content with that degree of celebrity which an artist may enjoy who works in the manner of his forefathers which the builder of Salisbury Cathedral might enjoy in England though he did not invent Gothic and which Titian might enjoy at Venice though he did not invent oil painting Addressing myself then to those humbler but wiser or rather only wise students who are content to avail themselves of some system of building already understood let us consider together what room for the exercise of the imagination may be left to us under such conditions And first I suppose it will be said or thought that the architect s principal field for exercise of his invention must be in the disposition of lines mouldings and masses in agreeable proportions Indeed if you adopt some styles of architecture you cannot exercise invention in any other way And I admit that it requires genius and special gift to do this rightly Not by rule nor by study can the gift of graceful proportionate design be obtained only by the intuition of genius can so much as a single tier of facade be beautifully arranged and the man has just cause for pride as far as our gifts can ever be a cause for pride who finds himself able in a design of his own to rival even the simplest arrangement of parts in one by Sanmicheli Inigo Jones or Christopher Wren Invention then and genius being granted as necessary to accomplish this let me ask you What after all with this special gift and genius you have accomplished when you have arranged the lines of a building beautifully In the first place you will not I think tell me that the beauty there attained is of a touching or pathetic kind A well disposed group of notes in music will make you sometimes weep and sometimes laugh You can express the depth of all affections by those dispositions of sound you can give courage to the soldier language to the lover consolation to the mourner more joy to the joyful more humility to the devout Can you do as much by your group of lines Do you suppose the front of Whitehall a singularly beautiful one ever inspires the two Horse Guards during the hour they sit opposite to it with military ardour Do you think that the lovers in our London walk down to the front of Whitehall for consolation when mistresses are unkind or that any person wavering in duty or feeble in faith was ever confirmed in purpose or in creed by the pathetic appeal of those harmonious architraves You will not say so Then if they cannot touch or inspire or comfort any one can your architectural proportions amuse any one Christmas is just over you have doubtless been at many merry parties during the period Can you remember any in which architectural proportions contributed to the entertainment of the evening Proportions of notes in music were I am sure essential to your amusement the setting of flowers in hair and of ribands on dresses were also subjects of frequent admiration with you not inessential to your happiness Among the juvenile members of your society the proportion of currants in cake and of sugar in comfits became subjects of acute interest and when such proportions were harmonious motives also of gratitude to cook and to confectioner But did you ever see either young or old amused by the architrave of the door Or otherwise interested in the proportions of the room than as they admitted more or fewer friendly faces Nay if all the amusement that there is in the best proportioned architecture of London could be concentrated into one evening and you were to issue tickets for nothing to this great proportional entertainment how do you think it would stand between you and the Drury pantomine You are then remember granted to be people of genius great and admirable and you devote your lives to your art but you admit that you cannot comfort anybody you cannot encourage anybody you cannot improve anybody and you cannot amuse anybody I proceed then farther to ask Can you inform anybody Many sciences cannot be considered as highly touching or emotional nay perhaps not specially amusing scientific men may sometimes in these respects stand on the same ground with you As far as we can judge by the results of the late war science helps our soldiers about as much as the front of Whitehall and at the Christmas parties the children wanted no geologists to tell them about the behaviour of bears and dragons in Queen Elizabeth s time Still your man of science teaches you something he may be dull at a party or helpless in a battle he is not always that but he can give you at all events knowledge of noble facts and open to you the secrets of the earth and air Will your architectural proportions do as much Your genius is granted and your life is given and what do you teach us Nothing I believe from one end of that life to the other but that two and two make four and that one is to two as three is to six You cannot then it is admitted comfort any one serve or amuse any one nor teach any one Finally I ask Can you be of Use to any one Yes you reply certainly we are of some use we architects in a climate like this where it always rains You are of use certainly but pardon me only as builders not as proportionalists We are not talking of building as a protection but only of that special work which your genius is to do not of building substantial and comfortable houses like mister Cubitt but of putting beautiful facades on them like Inigo Jones And again I ask Are you of use to any one Will your proportions of the facade heal the sick or clothe the naked Supposing you devoted your lives to be merchants you might reflect at the close of them how many fainting for want you had brought corn to sustain how many infected with disease you had brought balms to heal how widely among multitudes of far away nations you had scattered the first seeds of national power and guided the first rays of sacred light Had you been in fine anything else in the world but architectural designers you might have been of some use or good to people Content to be petty tradesmen you would have saved the time of mankind rough handed daily labourers you would have added to their stock of food or of clothing But being men of genius and devoting your lives to the exquisite exposition of this genius on what achievements do you think the memories of your old age are to fasten Whose gratitude will surround you with its glow or on what accomplished good of that greatest kind for which men show no gratitude will your life rest the contentment of its close Truly I fear that the ghosts of proportionate lines will be thin phantoms at your bedsides very speechless to you and that on all the emanations of your high genius you will look back with less delight than you might have done on a cup of cold water given to him who was thirsty or to a single moment when you had prevented with your bread him that fled Do not answer nor think to answer that with your great works and great payments of workmen in them you would do this I know you would and will as Builders but I repeat it is not your building that I am talking about but your brains it is your invention and imagination of whose profit I am speaking The good done through the building observe is done by your employers not by you you share in the benefit of it The good that you personally must do is by your designing and I compare you with musicians who do good by their pathetic composing not as they do good by employing fiddlers in the orchestra for it is the public who in reality do that not the musicians So clearly keeping to this one question what good we architects are to do by our genius and having found that on our proportionate system we can do no good to others will you tell me lastly what good we can do to ourselves Observe nearly every other liberal art or profession has some intense pleasure connected with it irrespective of any good to others As lawyers or physicians or clergymen you would have the pleasure of investigation and of historical reading as part of your work as men of science you would be rejoicing in curiosity perpetually gratified respecting the laws and facts of nature as artists you would have delight in watching the external forms of nature as day labourers or petty tradesmen supposing you to undertake such work with as much intellect as you are going to devote to your designing you would find continued subjects of interest in the manufacture or the agriculture which you helped to improve or in the problems of commerce which bore on your business But your architectural designing leads you into no pleasant journeys into no seeing of lovely things no discerning of just laws no warmths of compassion no humilities of veneration no progressive state of sight or soul Our conclusion is must be that you will not amuse nor inform nor help anybody you will not amuse nor better nor inform yourselves you will sink into a state in which you can neither show nor feel nor see anything but that one is to two as three is to six And in that state what should we call ourselves Men I think not The right name for us would be numerators and denominators Vulgar Fractions Shall we then abandon this theory of the soul of architecture being in proportional lines and look whether we can find anything better to exert our fancies upon May we not to begin with accept this great principle that as our bodies to be in health must be generally exercised so our minds to be in health must be generally cultivated You would not call a man healthy who had strong arms but was paralytic in his feet nor one who could walk well but had no use of his hands nor one who could see well if he could not hear You would not voluntarily reduce your bodies to any such partially developed state Much more then you would not if you could help it reduce your minds to it Now your minds are endowed with a vast number of gifts of totally different uses limbs of mind as it were which if you don t exercise you cripple One is curiosity that is a gift a capacity of pleasure in knowing which if you destroy you make yourselves cold and dull Another is sympathy the power of sharing in the feelings of living creatures which if you destroy you make yourselves hard and cruel Another of your limbs of mind is admiration the power of enjoying beauty or ingenuity which if you destroy you make yourselves base and irreverent Another is wit or the power of playing with the lights on the many sides of truth which if you destroy you make yourselves gloomy and less useful and cheering to others than you might be So that in choosing your way of work it should be your aim as far as possible to bring out all these faculties as far as they exist in you not one merely nor another but all of them And the way to bring them out is simply to concern yourselves attentively with the subjects of each faculty To cultivate sympathy you must be among living creatures and thinking about them and to cultivate admiration you must be among beautiful things and looking at them All this sounds much like truism at least I hope it does for then you will surely not refuse to act upon it and to consider farther how as architects you are to keep yourselves in contemplation of living creatures and lovely things You all probably know the beautiful photographs which have been published within the last year or two of the porches of the Cathedral of Amiens I hold one of these up to you merely that you may know what I am talking about as of course you cannot see the detail at this distance but you will recognise the subject Have you ever considered how much sympathy and how much humour 
6364-65388-0000	train-other-500	are developed in filling this single doorway Footnote The tympanum of the south transcept door it is to be found generally among all collections of architectural photographs
none	none	 with these sculptures of the history of saint Honore and by the way considering how often we English are now driving up and down the Rue saint Honore we may as well know as much of the saint as the old architect cared to tell us You know in all legends of saints who ever were bishops the first thing you are told of them is that they didn t want to be bishops So here is saint Honore who doesn t want to be a bishop 
6364-65388-0001	train-other-500	sitting sulkily in the corner he hugs his book with both hands and won t get up to take his crosier
none	none	 and here are all the city aldermen of Amiens come to poke him up and all the monks in the town in a great puzzle what they shall do for a bishop if saint Honore won t be 
6364-65388-0002	train-other-500	and here s one of the monks in the opposite corner who is quite cool about it and thinks they ll get on well enough without saint Honore you see that in his face perfectly
none	none	 At last saint Honore consents to be bishop and here he sits in a throne 
6364-65388-0003	train-other-500	and has his book now grandly on his desk instead of his knees and he directs one of his village curates how to find relics in a wood here is the wood and here is the village curate
none	none	 and here are the tombs with the bones of saint Victorien and Gentien in them After this saint Honore performs grand mass and the miracle occurs of the appearance of a hand blessing the wafer 
6364-65388-0004	train-other-500	which occurrence afterwards was painted for the arms of the abbey
none	none	 Then saint Honore dies 
6364-65388-0005	train-other-500	and here is his tomb with his statue on the top and miracles are being performed at it a deaf man having his ear touched and a blind man groping his way up to the tomb with his dog
none	none	 Then here is a great procession in honour of the relics of saint Honore and under his coffin are some cripples being healed and the coffin itself is put above the bar which separates the cross from the lower subjects because the tradition is that the figure on the crucifix of the Church of saint Firmin 
6364-65388-0006	train-other-500	bowed its head in token of acceptance as the relics of saint Honore passed beneath Now just consider the amount of sympathy with human nature and observance of it
none	none	 shown in this one bas relief 
6364-65388-0007	train-other-500	the sympathy with disputing monks with puzzled aldermen with melancholy recluse with triumphant prelate with palsy stricken poverty with ecclesiastical magnificence or miracle working faith
none	none	 Consider how much intellect was needed in the architect and how much observance of nature before he could give the expression to these various figures cast these multitudinous draperies 
6364-65388-0008	train-other-500	design these rich and quaint fragments of tombs and altars weave with perfect animation the entangled branches of the forest But you will answer me all this is not architecture at all it is sculpture
6364-65388-0009	train-other-500	Will you then tell me precisely where the separation exists between one and the other We will begin at the very beginning I will show you a piece of what you will certainly admit to be a piece of pure architecture
none	none	 Footnote See Appendix III Classical Architecture it is drawn on the back of another photograph another of these marvellous tympana from Notre Dame 
6364-65388-0010	train-other-500	which you call I suppose impure Well look on this picture and on this Don t laugh you must not laugh that s very improper of you this is classical architecture I have taken it out of the essay on that subject in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
6364-65388-0011	train-other-500	Yet I suppose none of you would think yourselves particularly ingenious architects if you had designed nothing more than this nay I will even let you improve it into any grand proportion you choose
none	none	 and add to it as many windows as you choose the only thing I insist upon in our specimen of pure architecture is that there shall be no mouldings nor ornaments upon it And I suspect you don t quite like your architecture so pure as this 
6364-65388-0012	train-other-500	We want a few mouldings you will say just a few Those who want mouldings hold up their hands We are unanimous I think Will you then design the profiles of these mouldings yourselves or will you copy them If you wish to copy them
none	none	 and to copy them always of course I leave you at once to your authorities and your imaginations to their repose 
6364-65388-0013	train-other-500	But if you wish to design them yourselves how do you do it
none	none	 You draw the profile according to your taste 
6364-65388-0014	train-other-500	and you order your mason to cut it Now will you tell me the logical difference between drawing the profile of a moulding and giving that to be cut and drawing the folds of the drapery of a statue and giving those to be cut
none	none	 The last is much more difficult to do than the first but degrees of difficulty constitute no specific difference and you will not accept it surely as a definition of the difference between architecture and sculpture that architecture is doing anything that is easy 
6364-65388-0015	train-other-500	and sculpture anything that is difficult It is true also that the carved moulding represents nothing and the carved drapery represents something but you will not I should think accept as an explanation of the difference between architecture and sculpture
6364-65388-0016	train-other-500	this any more than the other that sculpture is art which has meaning and architecture art which has none Where then is your difference In this perhaps you will say
6364-65388-0017	train-other-500	that whatever ornaments we can direct ourselves and get accurately cut to order we consider architectural The ornaments that we are obliged to leave to the pleasure of the workman or the superintendence of some other designer we consider sculptural
none	none	 especially if they are more or less extraneous and incrusted not an essential part of the building Accepting this definition I am compelled to reply that it is in effect nothing more than an amplification of my first one that whatever is easy you call architecture whatever is difficult you call sculpture For you cannot suppose the arrangement of the place in which the sculpture is to be put is so difficult or so great a part of the design as the sculpture itself 
6364-65388-0018	train-other-500	For instance you all know the pulpit of Niccolo Pisano in the baptistry at Pisa It is composed of seven rich relievi surrounded by panel mouldings and sustained on marble shafts
6364-65388-0019	train-other-500	Do you suppose Niccolo Pisano s reputation such part of it at least as rests on this pulpit and much does depends on the panel mouldings or on the relievi The panel mouldings are by his hand
6364-65388-0020	train-other-500	he would have disdained to leave even them to a common workman but do you think he found any difficulty in them or thought there was any credit in them Having once done the sculpture those enclosing lines were mere child s play to him
none	none	 the determination of the diameter of shafts and height of capitals was an affair of minutes his work was in carving the Crucifixion and the Baptism Or again do you recollect Orcagna s tabernacle in the church of San Michele at Florence 
6364-65388-0021	train-other-500	That also consists of rich and multitudinous bas reliefs enclosed in panel mouldings with shafts of mosaic and foliated arches sustaining the canopy
none	none	 Do you think Orcagna any more than Pisano if his spirit could rise in the midst of us at this moment would tell us that he had trusted his fame to the foliation or had put his soul s pride into the panelling Not so he would tell you that his spirit was in the stooping figures that stand round the couch of the dying Virgin Or lastly do you think the man who designed the procession on the portal of Amiens was the subordinate workman that there was an architect over him restraining him within certain limits and ordering of him his bishops at so much a mitre and his cripples at so much a crutch Not so 
6364-65388-0022	train-other-500	Here on this sculptured shield rests the Master s hand this is the centre of the Master s thought from this and in subordination to this waved the arch and sprang the pinnacle
6364-65388-0023	train-other-500	Having done this and being able to give human expression and action to the stone all the rest the rib the niche the foil the shaft were mere toys to his hand and accessories to his conception and if once you also gain the gift of doing this
6364-65388-0024	train-other-500	if once you can carve one fronton such as you have here I tell you you would be able so far as it depended on your invention to scatter cathedrals over England as fast as clouds rise from its streams after summer rain
6364-65388-0025	train-other-500	Nay but perhaps you answer again our sculptors at present do not design cathedrals and could not No they could not but that is merely because we have made architecture so dull that they cannot take any interest in it
6364-65388-0026	train-other-500	and therefore do not care to add to their higher knowledge the poor and common knowledge of principles of building You have thus separated building from sculpture and you have taken away the power of both
6364-65388-0027	train-other-500	for the sculptor loses nearly as much by never having room for the development of a continuous work as you do from having reduced your work to a continuity of mechanism You are essentially and should always be the same body of men
6364-65388-0028	train-other-500	admitting only such difference in operation as there is between the work of a painter at different times who sometimes labours on a small picture and sometimes on the frescoes of a palace gallery This conclusion then we arrive at
6364-65388-0029	train-other-500	must arrive at the fact being irrevocably so that in order to give your imagination and the other powers of your souls full play you must do as all the great architects of old time did
none	none	 you must yourselves be your sculptors Phidias Michael Angelo Orcagna Pisano Giotto which of these men do you think could not use his chisel You say It is difficult quite out of your way I know it is 
6364-65388-0030	train-other-500	nothing that is great is easy and nothing that is great so long as you study building without sculpture can be in your way I want to put it in your way and you to find your way to it
6364-65388-0031	train-other-500	But on the other hand do not shrink from the task as if the refined art of perfect sculpture were always required from you For though architecture and sculpture are not separate arts there is an architectural manner of sculpture
none	none	 and it is in the majority of its applications a comparatively easy one Our great mistake at present in dealing with stone at all is requiring to have all our work too refined it is just the same mistake as if we were to require all our book illustrations to be as fine work as Raphael s 
6364-65388-0032	train-other-500	John Leech does not sketch so well as Leonardo da Vinci but do you think that the public could easily spare him or that he is wrong in bringing out his talent in the way in which it is most effective Would you advise him if he asked your advice
none	none	 to give up his wood blocks and take to canvas I know you would not neither would you tell him I believe on the other hand that because he could not draw as well as Leonardo therefore he ought to draw nothing but straight lines with a ruler and circles with compasses and no figure subjects at all That would be some loss to you would it not You would all be vexed if next week s Punch had nothing in it but proportionate lines 
6364-65388-0033	train-other-500	And yet do not you see that you are doing precisely the same thing with your powers of sculptural design that he would be doing with his powers of pictorial design if he gave you nothing but such lines You feel that you cannot carve like Phidias
none	none	 therefore you will not carve at all but only draw mouldings and thus all that intermediate power which is of especial value in modern days 
6364-65388-0034	train-other-500	that popular power of expression which is within the attainment of thousands and would address itself to tens of thousands is utterly lost to us in stone though in ink and paper it has become one of the most desired luxuries of modern civilization
none	none	 Here then is one part of the subject to which I would especially invite your attention namely the distinctive character which may be wisely permitted to belong to architectural sculpture as distinguished from perfect sculpture on one side 
6364-65388-0035	train-other-500	and from mere geometrical decoration on the other And first observe what an indulgence we have in the distance at which most work is to be seen Supposing we were able to carve eyes and lips with the most exquisite precision
6364-65388-0036	train-other-500	it would all be of no use as soon as the work was put far above the eye but on the other hand as beauties disappear by being far withdrawn so will faults and the mystery and confusion which are the natural consequence of distance
none	none	 while they would often render your best skill but vain will as often render your worst errors of little consequence nay more than this 
6364-65388-0037	train-other-500	often a deep cut or a rude angle will produce in certain positions an effect of expression both startling and true which you never hoped for Not that mere distance will give animation to the work if it has none in itself
6364-65388-0038	train-other-500	but if it has life at all the distance will make that life more perceptible and powerful by softening the defects of execution So that you are placed as workmen in this position of singular advantage that you may give your fancies free play
6364-65388-0039	train-other-500	and strike hard for the expression that you want knowing that if you miss it no one will detect you if you at all touch it nature herself will help you
6364-65388-0040	train-other-500	and with every changing shadow and basking sunbeam bring forth new phases of your fancy But it is not merely this privilege of being imperfect which belongs to architectural sculpture It has a true privilege of imagination
none	none	 far excelling all that can be granted to the more finished work which for the sake of distinction I will call and I don t think we can have a much better term furniture sculpture sculpture that is which can be moved from place to furnish rooms 
6364-65388-0041	train-other-500	For observe to that sculpture the spectator is usually brought in a tranquil or prosaic state of mind he sees it associated rather with what is sumptuous than sublime and under circumstances
6364-65388-0042	train-other-500	which address themselves more to his comfort than his curiosity The statue which is to be pathetic seen between the flashes of footmen s livery round the dining table must have strong elements of pathos in itself and the statue which is to be awful
6364-65388-0043	train-other-500	in the midst of the gossip of the drawing room must have the elements of awe wholly in itself But the spectator is brought to your work already in an excited and imaginative mood
6364-65388-0044	train-other-500	He has been impressed by the cathedral wall as it loomed over the low streets before he looks up to the carving of its porch and his love of mystery has been touched by the silence and the shadows of the cloister
6364-65388-0045	train-other-500	before he can set himself to decipher the bosses on its vaulting So that when once he begins to observe your doings he will ask nothing better from you nothing kinder from you than that you would meet this imaginative temper of his half way
none	none	 that you would farther touch the sense of terror or satisfy the expectation of things strange which have been prompted by the mystery or the majesty of the surrounding scene And thus your leaving forms more or less undefined 
6364-65388-0046	train-other-500	or carrying out your fancies however extravagant in grotesqueness of shadow or shape will be for the most part in accordance with the temper of the observer and he is likely therefore much more willingly to use his fancy to help your meanings
6364-65388-0047	train-other-500	than his judgment to detect your faults Again Remember that when the imagination and feelings are strongly excited they will not only bear with strange things but they will look into minute things with a delight quite unknown in hours of tranquillity
6364-65388-0048	train-other-500	You surely must remember moments of your lives in which under some strong excitement of feeling all the details of visible objects presented themselves with a strange intensity and insistance whether you would or no
none	none	 urging themselves upon the mind and thrust upon the eye with a force of fascination which you could not refuse Now to a certain extent the senses get into this state whenever the imagination is strongly excited 
6364-65388-0049	train-other-500	Things trivial at other times assume a dignity or significance which we cannot explain but which is only the more attractive because inexplicable and the powers of attention quickened by the feverish excitement
none	none	 fasten and feed upon the minutest circumstances of detail and remotest traces of intention So that what would at other times be felt as more or less mean or extraneous in a work of sculpture 
6364-65388-0050	train-other-500	and which would assuredly be offensive to the perfect taste in its moments of languor or of critical judgment will be grateful and even sublime when it meets this frightened inquisitiveness this fascinated watchfulness
6364-65388-0051	train-other-500	of the roused imagination And this is all for your advantage for in the beginnings of your sculpture you will assuredly find it easier to imitate minute circumstances of costume or character
6364-65388-0052	train-other-500	than to perfect the anatomy of simple forms or the flow of noble masses and it will be encouraging to remember that the grace you cannot perfect and the simplicity you cannot achieve
none	none	 would be in great part vain even if you could achieve them in their appeal to the hasty curiosity of passionate fancy but that the sympathy which would be refused to your science will be granted to your innocence and that the mind of the general observer though wholly unaffected by the correctness of anatomy or propriety of gesture will follow you with fond and pleased concurrence as you carve the knots of the hair and the patterns of the vesture Farther yet We are to remember that not only do the associated features of the larger architecture tend to excite the strength of fancy but the architectural laws to which you are obliged to submit your decoration stimulate its ingenuity Every crocket which you are to crest with sculpture every foliation which you have to fill presents itself to the spectator s fancy not only as a pretty thing but as a problematic thing It contained he perceives immediately not only a beauty which you wished to display but a necessity which you were forced to meet and the problem how to occupy such and such a space with organic form in any probable way or how to turn such a boss or ridge into a conceivable image of life becomes at once to him as to you a matter of amusement as much as of admiration The ordinary conditions of perfection in form gesture or feature are willingly dispensed with when the ugly dwarf and ungainly goblin have only to gather themselves into angles or crouch to carry corbels and the want of skill which in other kinds of work would have been required for the finishing of the parts will at once be forgiven here if you have only disposed ingeniously what you have executed roughly and atoned for the rudeness of your hands by the quickness of your wits Hitherto however we have been considering only the circumstances in architecture favourable to the development of the powers of imagination A yet more important point for us seems to me the place which it gives to all the objects of imagination For I suppose you will not wish me to spend any time in proving that imagination must be vigorous in proportion to the quantity of material which it has to handle and that just as we increase the range of what we see we increase the richness of what we can imagine Granting this consider what a field is opened to your fancy merely in the subject matter which architecture admits Nearly every other art is severely limited in its subjects the landscape painter for instance gets little help from the aspects of beautiful humanity the historical painter less perhaps than he ought from the accidents of wild nature and the pure sculptor still less from the minor details of common life But is there anything within range of sight or conception which may not be of use to you or in which your interest may not be excited with advantage to your art From visions of angels down to the least important gesture of a child at play whatever may be conceived of Divine or beheld of Human may be dared or adopted by you throughout the kingdom of animal life no creature is so vast or so minute that you cannot deal with it or bring it into service the lion and the crocodile will couch about your shafts the moth and the bee will sun themselves upon your flowers for you the fawn will leap for you the snail be slow for you the dove smooth her bosom and the hawk spread her wings toward the south All the wide world of vegetation blooms and bends for you the leaves tremble that you may bid them be still under the marble snow the thorn and the thistle which the earth casts forth as evil are to you the kindliest servants no dying petal nor drooping tendril is so feeble as to have no more help for you no robed pride of blossom so kingly but it will lay aside its purple to receive at your hands the pale immortality Is there anything in common life too mean in common too trivial to be ennobled by your touch As there is nothing in life so there is nothing in lifelessness which has not its lesson for you or its gift and when you are tired of watching the strength of the plume and the tenderness of the leaf you may walk down to your rough river shore or into the thickest markets of your thoroughfares and there is not a piece of torn cable that will not twine into a perfect moulding there is not a fragment of cast away matting or shattered basket work that will not work into a chequer or capital Yes and if you gather up the very sand and break the stone on which you tread among its fragments of all but invisible shells you will find forms that will take their place and that proudly among the starred traceries of your vaulting and you who can crown the mountain with its fortress and the city with its towers are thus able also to give beauty to ashes and worthiness to dust Now in that your art presents all this material to you you have already much to rejoice in But you have more to rejoice in because all this is submitted to you not to be dissected or analyzed but to be sympathized with and to bring out therefore what may be accurately called the moral part of imagination We saw that if we kept ourselves among lines only we should have cause to envy the naturalist because he was conversant with facts but you will have little to envy now if you make yourselves conversant with the feelings that arise out of his facts For instance the naturalist coming upon a block of marble has to begin considering immediately how far its purple is owing to iron or its whiteness to magnesia he breaks his piece of marble and at the close of his day has nothing but a little sand in his crucible and some data added to the theory of the elements But you approach your marble to sympathize with it and rejoice over its beauty You cut it a little indeed but only to bring out its veins more perfectly and at the end of your day s work you leave your marble shaft with joy and complacency in its perfectness as marble When you have to watch an animal instead of a stone you differ from the naturalist in the same way He may perhaps if he be an amiable naturalist take delight in having living creatures round him still the major part of his work is or has been in counting feathers separating fibres and analyzing structures But your work is always with the living creature the thing you have to get at in him is his life and ways of going about things It does not matter to you how many cells there are in his bones or how many filaments in his feathers what you want is his moral character and way of behaving himself it is just that which your imagination if healthy will first seize just that which your chisel if vigorous will first cut You must get the storm spirit into your eagles and the lordliness into your lions and the tripping fear into your fawns and in order to do this you must be in continual sympathy with every fawn of them and be hand in glove with all the lions and hand in claw with all the hawks And don t fancy that you will lower yourselves by sympathy with the lower creatures you cannot sympathize rightly with the higher unless you do with those but you have to sympathize with the higher too with queens and kings and martyrs and angels Yes and above all and more than all with simple humanity in all its needs and ways for there is not one hurried face that passes you in the street that will not be impressive if you can only fathom it All history is open to you all high thoughts and dreams that the past fortunes of men can suggest all fairy land is open to you no vision that ever haunted forest or gleamed over hill side but calls you to understand how it came into men s hearts and may still touch them and all Paradise is open to you yes and the work of Paradise for in bringing all this in perpetual and attractive truth before the eyes of your fellow men you have to join in the employment of the angels as well as to imagine their companies And observe in this last respect what a peculiar importance and responsibility are attached to your work when you consider its permanence and the multitudes to whom it is addressed We frequently are led by wise people to consider what responsibility may sometimes attach to words which yet the chance is will be heard by few and forgotten as soon as heard But none of your words will be heard by few and none will be forgotten for five or six hundred years if you build well You will talk to all who pass by and all those little sympathies those freaks of fancy those jests in stone those workings out of problems in caprice will occupy mind after mind of utterly countless multitudes long after you are gone You have not like authors to plead for a hearing or to fear oblivion Do but build large enough and carve boldly enough and all the world will hear you they cannot choose but look I do not mean to awe you by this thought I do not mean that because you will have so many witnesses and watchers you are never to jest or do anything gaily or lightly on the contrary I have pleaded from the beginning for this art of yours especially because it has room for the whole of your character if jest is in you let the jest be jested if mathematical ingenuity is yours let your problem be put and your solution worked out as quaintly as you choose above all see that your work is easily and happily done else it will never make anybody else happy but while you thus give the rein to all your impulses see that those impulses be headed and centred by one noble impulse and let that be Love triple love for the art which you practise the creation in which you move and the creatures to whom you minister I I say first Love for the art which you practise Be assured that if ever any other motive becomes a leading one in your mind as the principal one for exertion except your love of art that moment it is all over with your art I do not say you are to desire money nor to desire fame nor to desire position you cannot but desire all three nay you may if you are willing that I should use the word Love in a desecrated sense love all three that is passionately covet them yet you must not covet or love them in the first place Men of strong passions and imaginations must always care a great deal for anything they care for at all but the whole question is one of first or second Does your art lead you or your gain lead you You may like making money exceedingly but if it come to a fair question whether you are to make five hundred pounds less by this business or to spoil your building and you choose to spoil your building there s an end of you So you may be as thirsty for fame as a cricket is for cream but if it come to a fair question whether you are to please the mob or do the thing as you know it ought to be done and you can t do both and choose to please the mob it s all over with you there s no hope for you nothing that you can do will ever be worth a man s glance as he passes by The test is absolute inevitable Is your art first with you Then you are artists you may be after you have made your money misers and usurers you may be after you have got your fame jealous and proud and wretched and base but yet as long as you won t spoil your work you are artists On the other hand Is your money first with you and your fame first with you Then you may be very charitable with your money and very magnificent with your money and very graceful in the way you wear your reputation and very courteous to those beneath you and very acceptable to those above you but you are not artists You are mechanics and drudges II You must love the creation you work in the midst of For wholly in proportion to the intensity of feeling which you bring to the subject you have chosen will be the depth and justice of our perception of its character And this depth of feeling is not to be gained on the instant when you want to bring it to bear on this or that It is the result of the general habit of striving to feel rightly and among thousands of various means of doing this perhaps the one I ought specially to name to you is the keeping yourselves clear of petty and mean cares Whatever you do don t be anxious nor fill your heads with little chagrins and little desires I have just said that you may be great artists and yet be miserly and jealous and troubled about many things So you may be but I said also that the miserliness or trouble must not be in your hearts all day It is possible that you may get a habit of saving money or it is possible at a time of great trial you may yield to the temptation of speaking unjustly of a rival and you will shorten your powers arid dim your sight even by this but the thing that you have to dread far more than any such unconscious habit or any such momentary fall is the constancy of small emotions the anxiety whether mister So and so will like your work whether such and such a workman will do all that you want of him and so on not wrong feelings or anxieties in themselves but impertinent and wholly incompatible with the full exercise of your imagination Keep yourselves therefore quiet peaceful with your eyes open It doesn t matter at all what mister So and so thinks of your work but it matters a great deal what that bird is doing up there in its nest or how that vagabond child at the street corner is managing his game of knuckle down And remember you cannot turn aside from your own interests to the birds and the children s interests unless you have long before got into the habit of loving and watching birds and children so that it all comes at last to the forgetting yourselves and the living out of yourselves in the calm of the great world or if you will in its agitation but always in a calm of your own bringing Do not think it wasted time to submit yourselves to any influence which may bring upon you any noble feeling Rise early always watch the sunrise and the way the clouds break from the dawn you will cast your statue draperies in quite another than your common way when the remembrance of that cloud motion is with you and of the scarlet vesture of the morning Live always in the springtime in the country you do not know what leaf form means unless you have seen the buds burst and the young leaves breathing low in the sunshine and wondering at the first shower of rain But above all accustom yourselves to look for and to love all nobleness of gesture and feature in the human form and remember that the highest nobleness is usually among the aged the poor and the infirm you will find in the end that it is not the strong arm of the soldier nor the laugh of the young beauty that are the best studies for you Look at them and look at them reverently but be assured that endurance is nobler than strength and patience than beauty and that it is not in the high church pews where the gay dresses are but in the church free seats where the widows weeds are that you may see the faces that will fit best between the angels wings in the church porch III And therefore lastly and chiefly you must love the creatures to whom you minister your fellow men for if you do not love them not only will you be little interested in the passing events of life but in all your gazing at humanity you will be apt to be struck only by outside form and not by expression It is only kindness and tenderness which will ever enable you to see what beauty there is in the dark eyes that are sunk with weeping and in the paleness of those fixed faces which the earth s adversity has compassed about till they shine in their patience like dying watchfires through twilight But it is not this only which makes it needful for you if you would be great to be also kind there is a most important and all essential reason in the very nature of your own art So soon as you desire to build largely and with addition of noble sculpture you will find that your work must be associative You cannot carve a whole cathedral yourself you can carve but few and simple parts of it Either your own work must be disgraced in the mass of the collateral inferiority or you must raise your fellow designers to correspondence of power If you have genius you will yourselves take the lead in the building you design you will carve its porch and direct its disposition But for all subsequent advancement of its detail you must trust to the agency and the invention of others and it rests with you either to repress what faculties your workmen have into cunning subordination to your own or to rejoice in discovering even the powers that may rival you and leading forth mind after mind into fellowship with your fancy and association with your fame I need not tell you that if you do the first if you endeavour to depress or disguise the talents of your subordinates you are lost for nothing could imply more darkly and decisively than this that your art and your work were not beloved by you that it was your own prosperity that you were seeking and your own skill only that you cared to contemplate I do not say that you must not be jealous at all it is rarely in human nature to be wholly without jealousy and you may be forgiven for going some day sadly home when you find some youth unpractised and unapproved giving the life stroke to his work which you after years of training perhaps cannot reach but your jealousy must not conquer your love of your building must conquer helped by your kindness of heart See I set no high or difficult standard before you I do not say that you are to surrender your pre eminence in mere unselfish generosity But I do say that you must surrender your pre eminence in your love of your building helped by your kindness and that whomsoever you find better able to do what will adorn it than you that person you are to give place to and to console yourselves for the humiliation first by your joy in seeing the edifice grow more beautiful under his chisel and secondly by your sense of having done kindly and justly But if you are morally strong enough to make the kindness and justice the first motive it will be better best of all if you do not consider it as kindness at all but bare and stern justice for truly such help as we can give each other in this world is a debt to each other and the man who perceives a superiority or a capacity in a subordinate and neither confesses nor assists it is not merely the withholder of kindness but the committer of injury But be the motive what you will only see that you do the thing and take the joy of the consciousness that as your art embraces a wider field than all others and addresses a vaster multitude than all others and is surer of audience than all others so it is profounder and holier in Fellowship than all others The artist when his pupil is perfect must see him leave his side that he may declare his distinct perhaps opponent skill Man of science wrestles with man of science for priority of discovery and pursues in pangs of jealous haste his solitary inquiry You alone are called by kindness by necessity by equity to fraternity of toil and thus in those misty and massive piles which rise above the domestic roofs of our ancient cities there was there may be again a meaning more profound and true than any that fancy so commonly has attached to them Men say their pinnacles point to heaven Why so does every tree that buds and every bird that rises as it sings Men say their aisles are good for worship Why so is every mountain glen and rough sea shore But this they have of distinct and indisputable glory that their mighty walls were never raised and never shall be but by men who love and aid each other in their weakness that all their interlacing strength of vaulted stone has its foundation upon the stronger arches of manly fellowship and all their changing grace of depressed or lifted pinnacle owes its cadence and completeness to sweeter symmetries of human soul LECTURE V THE WORK OP IRON IN NATURE ART AND POLICY A Lecture Delivered at Tunbridge Wells February eighteen fifty eight When first I heard that you wished me to address you this evening it was a matter of some doubt with me whether I could find any subject that would possess any sufficient interest for you to justify my bringing you out of your comfortable houses on a winter s night When I venture to speak about my own special business of art it is almost always before students of art among whom I may sometimes permit myself to be dull if I can feel that I am useful but a mere talk about art especially without examples to refer to and I have been unable to prepare any careful illustrations for this lecture is seldom of much interest to a general audience As I was considering what you might best bear with me in speaking about there came naturally into my mind a subject connected with the origin and present prosperity of the town you live in and it seemed to me in the out branchings of it capable of a very general interest When long ago I am afraid to think how long Tunbridge Wells was my Switzerland and I used to be brought down here in the summer a sufficiently active child rejoicing in the hope of clambering sandstone cliffs of stupendous height above the common there used sometimes as I suppose there are in the lives of all children at the Wells to be dark days in my life days of condemnation to the pantiles and band under which calamities my only consolation used to be in watching at every turn in my walk the welling forth of the spring over the orange rim of its marble basin The memory of the clear water sparkling over its saffron stain came back to me as the strongest image connected with the place and it struck me that you might not be unwilling to night to think a little over the full significance of that saffron stain and of the power in other ways and other functions of the steelly element to which so many here owe returning strength and life chief as it has been always and is yet more and more markedly so day by day among the precious gifts of the earth The subject is of course too wide to be more than suggestively treated and even my suggestions must be few and drawn chiefly from my own fields of work nevertheless I think I shall have time to indicate some courses of thought which you may afterwards follow out for yourselves if they interest you and so I will not shrink from the full scope of the subject which I have announced to you the functions of Iron in Nature Art and Policy Without more preface I will take up the first head I IRON IN NATURE You all probably know that the ochreous stain which perhaps is often thought to spoil the basin of your spring is iron in a state of rust and when you see rusty iron in other places you generally think not only that it spoils the places it stains but that it is spoiled itself that rusty iron is spoiled iron For most of our uses it generally is so and because we cannot use a rusty knife or razor so well as a polished one we suppose it to be a great defect in iron that it is subject to rust But not at all On the contrary the most perfect and useful state of it is that ochreous stain and therefore it is endowed with so ready a disposition to get itself into that state It is not a fault in the iron but a virtue to be so fond of getting rusted for in that condition it fulfils its most important functions in the universe and most kindly duties to mankind Nay in a certain sense and almost a literal one we may say that iron rusted is Living but when pure or polished Dead You all probably know that in the mixed air we breathe the part of it essentially needful to us is called oxygen and that this substance is to all animals in the most accurate sense of the word breath of life The nervous power of life is a different thing but the supporting element of the breath without which the blood and therefore the life cannot be nourished is this oxygen Now it is this very same air which the iron breathes when it gets rusty It takes the oxygen from the atmosphere as eagerly as we do though it uses it differently The iron keeps all that it gets we and other animals part with it again but the metal absolutely keeps what it has once received of this aerial gift and the ochreous dust which we so much despise is in fact just so much nobler than pure iron in so far as it is iron and the air Nobler and more useful for indeed as I shall be able to show you presently the main service of this metal and of all other metals to us is not in making knives and scissors and pokers and pans but in making the ground we feed from and nearly all the substances first needful to our existence For these are all nothing but metals and oxygen metals with breath put into them Sand lime clay and the rest of the earths potash and soda and the rest of the alkalies are all of them metals which have undergone this so to speak vital change and have been rendered fit for the service of man by permanent unity with the purest air which he himself breathes There is only one metal which does not rust readily and that in its influence on Man hitherto has caused Death rather than Life it will not be put to its right use till it is made a pavement of and so trodden under foot Is there not something striking in this fact considered largely as one of the types or lessons furnished by the inanimate creation Here you have your hard bright cold lifeless metal good enough for swords and scissors but not for food You think perhaps that your iron is wonderfully useful in a pure form but how would you like the world if all your meadows instead of grass grew nothing but iron wire if all your arable ground instead of being made of sand and clay were suddenly turned into flat surfaces of steel if the whole earth instead of its green and glowing sphere rich with forest and flower showed nothing but the image of the vast furnace of a ghastly engine a globe of black lifeless excoriated metal It would be that probably it was once that but assuredly it would be were it not that all the substance of which it is made sucks and breathes the brilliancy of the atmosphere and as it breathes softening from its merciless hardness it falls into fruitful and beneficent dust gathering itself again into the earths from which we feed and the stones with which we build into the rocks that frame the mountains and the sands that bind the sea Hence it is impossible for you to take up the most insignificant pebble at your feet without being able to read if you like this curious lesson in it You look upon it at first as if it were earth only Nay it answers I am not earth I am earth and air in one part of that blue heaven which you love and long for is already in me it is all my life without it I should be nothing and able for nothing I could not minister to you nor nourish you I should be a cruel and helpless thing but because there is according to my need and place in creation a kind of soul in me I have become capable of good and helpful in the circles of vitality Thus far the same interest attaches to all the earths and all the metals of which they are made but a deeper interest and larger beneficence belong to that ochreous earth of iron which stains the marble of your springs It stains much besides that marble It stains the great earth wheresoever you can see it far and wide it is the colouring substance appointed to colour the globe for the sight as well as subdue it to the service of man You have just seen your hills covered with snow and perhaps have enjoyed at first the contrast of their fair white with the dark blocks of pine woods but have you ever considered how you would like them always white not pure white but dirty white the white of thaw with all the chill of snow in it but none of its brightness That is what the colour of the earth would be without its iron that would be its colour not here or there only but in all places and at all times Follow out that idea till you get it in some detail Think first of your pretty gravel walks in your gardens yellow and fine like plots of sunshine between the flower beds fancy them all suddenly turned to the colour of ashes That is what they would be without iron ochre Think of your winding walks over the common as warm to the eye as they are dry to the foot and imagine them all laid down suddenly with gray cinders Then pass beyond the common into the country and pause at the first ploughed field that you see sweeping up the hill sides in the sun with its deep brown furrows and wealth of ridges all a glow heaved aside by the ploughshare like deep folds of a mantle of russet velvet fancy it all changed suddenly into grisly furrows in a field of mud That is what it would be without iron Pass on in fancy over hill and dale till you reach the bending line of the sea shore go down upon its breezy beach watch the white foam flashing among the amber of it and all the blue sea embayed in belts of gold then fancy those circlets of far sweeping shore suddenly put into mounds of mourning all those golden sands turned into gray slime the fairies no more able to call to each other Come unto these yellow sands but Come unto these drab sands That is what they would be without iron Iron is in some sort therefore the sunshine and light of landscape so far as that light depends on the ground but it is a source of another kind of sunshine quite as important to us in the way we live at present sunshine not of landscape but of dwelling place In these days of swift locomotion I may doubtless assume that most of my audience have been somewhere out of England have been in Scotland or France or Switzerland Whatever may have been their impression on returning to their own country of its superiority or inferiority in other respects they cannot but have felt one thing about it the comfortable look of its towns and villages Foreign towns are often very picturesque very beautiful but they never have quite that look of warm self sufficiency and wholesome quiet with which our villages nestle themselves down among the green fields If you will take the trouble to examine into the sources of this impression you will find that by far the greater part of that warm and satisfactory appearance depends upon the rich scarlet colour of the bricks and tiles It does not belong to the neat building very neat building has an uncomfortable rather than a comfortable look but it depends on the warm building our villages are dressed in red tiles as our old women are in red cloaks and it does not matter how worn the cloaks or how bent and bowed the roof may be so long as there are no holes in either one or the other and the sobered but unextinguishable colour still glows in the shadow of the hood and burns among the green mosses of the gable And what do you suppose dyes your tiles of cottage roof You don t paint them It is nature who puts all that lovely vermilion into the clay for you and all that lovely vermilion is this oxide of iron Think therefore what your streets of towns would become ugly enough indeed already some of them but still comfortable looking if instead of that warm brick red the houses became all pepper and salt colour Fancy your country villages changing from that homely scarlet of theirs which in its sweet suggestion of laborious peace is as honourable as the soldiers scarlet of laborious battle suppose all those cottage roofs I say turned at once into the colour of unbaked clay the colour of street gutters in rainy weather That s what they would be without iron There is however yet another effect of colour in our English country towns which perhaps you may not all yourselves have noticed but for which you must take the word of a sketcher They are not so often merely warm scarlet as they are warm purple a more beautiful colour still and they owe this colour to a mingling with the vermilion of the deep grayish or purple hue of our fine Welsh slates on the more respectable roofs made more blue still by the colour of intervening atmosphere If you examine one of these Welsh slates freshly broken you will find its purple colour clear and vivid and although never strikingly so after it has been long exposed to weather it always retains enough of the tint to give rich harmonies of distant purple in opposition to the green of our woods and fields Whatever brightness or power there is in the hue is entirely owing to the oxide of iron Without it the slates would either be pale stone colour or cold gray or black Thus far we have only been considering the use and pleasantness of iron in the common earth of clay But there are three kinds of earth which in mixed mass and prevalent quantity form the world Those are in common language the earths of clay of lime and of flint Many other elements are mingled with these in sparing quantities but the great frame and substance of the earth is made of these three so that wherever you stand on solid ground in any country of the globe the thing that is mainly under your feet will be either clay limestone or some condition of the earth of flint mingled with both These being what we have usually to deal with Nature seems to have set herself to make these three substances as interesting to us and as beautiful for us as she can The clay being a soft and changeable substance she doesn t take much pains about as we have seen till it is baked she brings the colour into it only when it receives a permanent form But the limestone and flint she paints in her own way in their native state and her object in painting them seems to be much the same as in her painting of flowers to draw us careless and idle human creatures to watch her a little and see what she is about that being on the whole good for us her children For Nature is always carrying on very strange work with this limestone and flint of hers laying down beds of them at the bottom of the sea building islands out of the sea filling chinks and veins in mountains with curious treasures petrifying mosses and trees and shells in fact carrying on all sorts of business subterranean or submarine which it would be highly desirable for us who profit and live by it to notice as it goes on And apparently to lead us to do this she makes picture books for us of limestone and flint and tempts us like foolish children as we are to read her books by the pretty colours in them The pretty colours in her limestone books form those variegated marbles which all mankind have taken delight to polish and build with from the beginning of time and the pretty colours in her flint books form those agates jaspers cornelians bloodstones onyxes cairngorms chrysoprases which men have in like manner taken delight to cut and polish and make ornaments of from the beginning of time and yet so much of babies are they and so fond of looking at the pictures instead of reading the book that I question whether after six thousand years of cutting and polishing there are above two or three people out of any given hundred who know or care to know how a bit of agate or a bit of marble was made or painted How it was made may not be always very easy to say but with what it was painted there is no manner of question All those beautiful violet veinings and variegations of the marbles of Sicily and Spain the glowing orange and amber colours of those of Siena the deep russet of the Rosso antico and the blood colour of all the precious jaspers that enrich the temples of Italy and finally all the lovely transitions of tint in the pebbles of Scotland and the Rhine which form though not the most precious by far the most interesting portion of our modern jewellers work all these are painted by nature with this one material only variously proportioned and applied the oxide of iron that stains your Tunbridge springs But this is not all nor the best part of the work of iron Its service in producing these beautiful stones is only rendered to rich people who can afford to quarry and polish them But Nature paints for all the world poor and rich together and while therefore she thus adorns the innermost rocks of her hills to tempt your investigation or indulge your luxury she paints far more carefully the outsides of the hills which are for the eyes of the shepherd and the ploughman I spoke just now of the effect in the roofs of our villages of their purple slates but if the slates are beautiful even in their flat and formal rows on house roofs much more are they beautiful on the rugged crests and flanks of their native mountains Have you ever considered in speaking as we do so often of distant blue hills what it is that makes them blue To a certain extent it is distance but distance alone will not do it Many hills look white however distant That lovely dark purple colour of our Welsh and Highland hills is owing not to their distance merely but to their rocks Some of their rocks are indeed too dark to be beautiful being black or ashy gray owing to imperfect and porous structure But when you see this dark colour dashed with russet and blue and coming out in masses among the green ferns so purple that you can hardly tell at first whether it is rock or heather then you must thank your old Tunbridge friend the oxide of iron But this is not all It is necessary for the beauty of hill scenery that Nature should colour not only her soft rocks but her hard ones and she colours them with the same thing only more beautifully Perhaps you have wondered at my use of the word purple so often of stones but the Greeks and still more the Romans who had profound respect for purple used it of stone long ago You have all heard of porphyry as among the most precious of the harder massive stones The colour which gave it that noble name as well as that which gives the flush to all the rosy granite of Egypt yes and to the rosiest summits of the Alps themselves is still owing to the same substance your humble oxide of iron And last of all A nobler colour than all these the noblest colour ever seen on this earth one which belongs to a strength greater than that of the Egyptian granite and to a beauty greater than that of the sunset or the rose is still mysteriously connected with the presence of this dark iron I believe it is not ascertained on what the crimson of blood actually depends but the colour is connected of course with its vitality and that vitality with the existence of iron as one of its substantial elements Is it not strange to find this stern and strong metal mingled so delicately in our human life that we cannot even blush without its help Think of it my fair and gentle hearers how terrible the alternative sometimes you have actually no choice but to be brazen faced or iron faced In this slight review of some of the functions of the metal you observe that I confine myself strictly to its operations as a colouring element I should only confuse your conception of the facts if I endeavoured to describe its uses as a substantial element either in strengthening rocks or influencing vegetation by the decomposition of rocks I have not therefore even glanced at any of the more serious uses of the metal in the economy of nature But what I wish you to carry clearly away with you is the remembrance that in all these uses the metal would be nothing without the air The pure metal has no power and never occurs in nature at all except in meteoric stones whose fall no one can account for and which are useless after they have fallen in the necessary work of the world the iron is invariably joined with the oxygen and would be capable of no service or beauty whatever without it II IRON IN ART Passing then from the offices of the metal in the operations of nature to its uses in the hands of man you must remember in the outset that the type which has been thus given you by the lifeless metal of the action of body and soul together has noble antitype in the operation of all human power All art worthy the name is the energy neither of the human body alone nor of the human soul alone but of both united one guiding the other good craftsmanship and work of the fingers joined with good emotion and work of the heart There is no good art nor possible judgment of art when these two are not united yet we are constantly trying to separate them Our amateurs cannot be persuaded but that they may produce some kind of art by their fancy or sensibility without going through the necessary manual toil That is entirely hopeless Without a certain number and that a very great number of steady acts of hand a practice as careful and constant as would be necessary to learn any other manual business no drawing is possible On the other side the workman and those who employ him are continually trying to produce art by trick or habit of fingers without using their fancy or sensibility That also is hopeless Without mingling of heart passion with hand power no art is possible Footnote No fine art that is See the previous definition of fine art at p thirty eight The highest art unites both in their intensest degrees the action of the hand at its finest with that of the heart at its fullest Hence it follows that the utmost power of art can only be given in a material capable of receiving and retaining the influence of the subtlest touch of the human hand That hand is the most perfect agent of material power existing in the universe and its full subtlety can only be shown when the material it works on or with is entirely yielding The chords of a perfect instrument will receive it but not of an imperfect one the softly bending point of the hair pencil and soft melting of colour will receive it but not even the chalk or pen point still less the steel point chisel or marble The hand of a sculptor may indeed be as subtle as that of a painter but all its subtlety is not bestowable nor expressible the touch of Titian Correggio or Turner Footnote See Appendix IV Subtlety of Hand is a far more marvellous piece of nervous action than can be shown in anything but colour or in the very highest conditions of executive expression in music In proportion as the material worked upon is less delicate the execution necessarily becomes lower and the art with it This is one main principle of all work Another is that whatever the material you choose to work with your art is base if it does not bring out the distinctive qualities of that material The reason of this second law is that if you don t want the qualities of the substance you use you ought to use some other substance it can be only affectation and desire to display your skill that lead you to employ a refractory substance and therefore your art will all be base Glass for instance is eminently in its nature transparent If you don t want transparency let the glass alone Do not try to make a window look like an opaque picture but take an opaque ground to begin with Again marble is eminently a solid and massive substance Unless you want mass and solidity don t work in marble If you wish for lightness take wood if for freedom take stucco if for ductility take glass Don t try to carve leathers or trees or nets or foam out of marble Carve white limbs and broad breasts only out of that So again iron is eminently a ductile and tenacious substance tenacious above all things ductile more than most When you want tenacity therefore and involved form take iron It is eminently made for that It is the material given to the sculptor as the companion of marble with a message as plain as it can well be spoken from the lips of the earth mother Here s for you to cut and here s for you to hammer Shape this and twist that What is solid and simple carve out what is thin and entangled beat out I give you all kinds of forms to be delighted in fluttering leaves as well as fair bodies twisted branches as well as open brows The leaf and the branch you may beat and drag into their imagery the body and brow you shall reverently touch into their imagery And if you choose rightly and work rightly what you do shall be safe afterwards Your slender leaves shall not break off in my tenacious iron though they may be rusted a little with an iron autumn Your broad surfaces shall not be unsmoothed in my pure crystalline marble no decay shall touch them But if you carve in the marble what will break with a touch or mould in the metal what a stain of rust or verdigris will spoil it is your fault not mine These are the main principles in this matter which like nearly all other right principles in art we moderns delight in contradicting as directly and specially as may be We continually look for and praise in our exhibitions the sculpture of veils and lace and thin leaves and all kinds of impossible things pushed as far as possible in the fragile stone for the sake of showing the sculptor s dexterity Footnote I do not mean to attach any degree of blame to the effort to represent leafage in marble for certain expressive purposes The later works of mister Munro have depended for some of their most tender thoughts on a delicate and skilful use of such accessories And in general leaf sculpture is good and admirable if it renders as in Gothic work the grace and lightness of the leaf by the arrangement of light and shadow supporting the masses well by strength of stone below but all carving is base which proposes to itself slightness as an aim and tries to imitate the absolute thinness of thin or slight things as much modern wood carving does I saw in Italy a year or two ago a marble sculpture of birds nests On the other hand we cast our iron into bars brittle though an inch thick sharpen them at the ends and consider fences and other work made of such materials decorative I do not believe it would be easy to calculate the amount of mischief done to our taste in England by that fence iron work of ours alone If it were asked of us by a single characteristic to distinguish the dwellings of a country into two broad sections and to set on one side the places where people were for the most part simple happy benevolent and honest and on the other side the places where at least a great number of the people were sophisticated unkind uncomfortable and unprincipled there is I think one feature that you could fix upon as a positive test the uncomfortable and unprincipled parts of a country would be the parts where people lived among iron railings and the comfortable and principled parts where they had none A broad generalization you will say Perhaps a little too broad yet in all sobriety it will come truer than you think Consider every other kind of fence or defence and you will find some virtue in it but in the iron railing none There is first your castle rampart of stone somewhat too grand to be considered here among our types of fencing next your garden or park wall of brick which has indeed often an unkind look on the outside but there is more modesty in it than unkindness It generally means not that the builder of it wants to shut you out from the view of his garden but from the view of himself it is a frank statement that as he needs a certain portion of time to himself so he needs a certain portion of ground to himself and must not be stared at when he digs there in his shirt sleeves or plays at leapfrog with his boys from school or talks over old times with his wife walking up and down in the evening sunshine Besides the brick wall has good practical service in it and shelters you from the east wind and ripens your peaches and nectarines and glows in autumn like a sunny bank And moreover your brick wall if you build it properly so that it shall stand long enough is a beautiful thing when it is old and has assumed its grave purple red touched with mossy green Next to your lordly wall in dignity of enclosure comes your close set wooden paling which is more objectionable because it commonly means enclosure on a larger scale than people want Still it is significative of pleasant parks and well kept field walks and herds of deer and other such aristocratic pastoralisms which have here and there their proper place in a country and may be passed without any discredit Next to your paling comes your low stone dyke your mountain fence indicative at a glance either of wild hill country or of beds of stone beneath the soil the hedge of the mountains delightful in all its associations and yet more in the varied and craggy forms of the loose stones it is built of and next to the low stone wall your lowland hedge either in trim line of massive green suggested of the pleasances of old Elizabethan houses and smooth alleys for aged feet and quaint labyrinths for young ones or else in fair entanglement of eglantine and virgin s bower tossing its scented luxuriance along our country waysides how many such you have here among your pretty hills fruitful with black clusters of the bramble for boys in autumn and crimson hawthorn berries for birds in winter And then last and most difficult to class among fences comes your handrail expressive of all sorts of things sometimes having a knowing and vicious look which it learns at race courses sometimes an innocent and tender look which it learns at rustic bridges over cressy brooks and sometimes a prudent and protective look which it learns on passes of the Alps where it has posts of granite and bars of pine and guards the brows of cliffs and the banks of torrents So that in all these kinds of defence there is some good pleasant or noble meaning But what meaning has the iron railing Either observe that you are living in the midst of such bad characters that you must keep them out by main force of bar or that you are yourself of a character requiring to be kept inside in the same manner Your iron railing always means thieves outside or Bedlam inside it can mean nothing else than that If the people outside were good for anything a hint in the way of fence would be enough for them but because they are violent and at enmity with you you are forced to put the close bars and the spikes at the top Last summer I was lodging for a little while in a cottage in the country and in front of my low window there were first some beds of daisies then a row of gooseberry and currant bushes and then a low wall about three feet above the ground covered with stone cress Outside a corn field with its green ears glistening in the sun and a field path through it just past the garden gate From my window I could see every peasant of the village who passed that way with basket on arm for market or spade on shoulder for field When I was inclined for society I could lean over my wall and talk to anybody when I was inclined for science I could botanize all along the top of my wall there were four species of stone cress alone growing on it and when I was inclined for exercise I could jump over my wall backwards and forwards That s the sort of fence to have in a Christian country not a thing which you can t walk inside of without making yourself look like a wild beast nor look at out of your window in the morning without expecting to see somebody impaled upon it in the night And yet farther observe that the iron railing is a useless fence it can shelter nothing and support nothing you can t nail your peaches to it nor protect your flowers with it nor make anything whatever out of its costly tyranny and besides being useless it is an insolent fence it says plainly to everybody who passes You may be an honest person but also you may be a thief honest or not you shall not get in here for I am a respectable person and much above you you shall only see what a grand place I have got to keep you out of look here and depart in humiliation This however being in the present state of civilization a frequent manner of discourse and there being unfortunately many districts where the iron railing is unavoidable it yet remains a question whether you need absolutely make it ugly no less than significative of evil You must have railings round your squares in London and at the sides of your areas but need you therefore have railings so ugly that the constant sight of them is enough to neutralise the effect of all the schools of art in the kingdom You need not Far from such necessity it is even in your power to turn all your police force of iron bars actually into drawing masters and natural historians Not of course without some trouble and some expense you can do nothing much worth doing in this world without trouble you can get nothing much worth having without expense The main question is only what is worth doing and having Consider therefore if this be not Here is your iron railing as yet an uneducated monster a sombre seneschal incapable of any words except his perpetual Keep out and Away with you Would it not be worth some trouble and cost to turn this ungainly ruffian porter into a well educated servant who while he was severe as ever in forbidding entrance to evilly disposed people should yet have a kind word for well disposed people and a pleasant look and a little useful information at his command in case he should be asked a question by the passers by We have not time to night to look at many examples of ironwork and those I happen to have by me are not the best ironwork is not one of my special subjects of study so that I only have memoranda of bits that happened to come into picturesque subjects which I was drawing for other reasons Besides external ironwork is more difficult to find good than any other sort of ancient art for when it gets rusty and broken people are sure if they can afford it to send it to the old iron shop and get a fine new grating instead and in the great cities of Italy the old iron is thus nearly all gone the best bits I remember in the open air were at Brescia fantastic sprays of laurel like foliage rising over the garden gates and there are a few fine fragments at Verona and some good trellis work enclosing the Scala tombs but on the whole the most interesting pieces though by no means the purest in style are to be found in out of the way provincial towns where people do not care or are unable to make polite alterations The little town of Bellinzona for instance on the south of the Alps and that of Sion on the north have both of them complete schools of ironwork in their balconies and vineyard gates That of Bellinzona is the best though not very old I suppose most of it of the seventeenth century still it is very quaint and beautiful Here for example are two balconies from two different houses one has been a cardinal s and the hat is the principal ornament of the balcony its tassels being wrought with delightful delicacy and freedom and catching the eye clearly even among the mass of rich wreathed leaves These tassels and strings are precisely the kind of subject fit for ironwork noble in ironwork they would have been entirely ignoble in marble on the grounds above stated The real plant of oleander standing in the window enriches the whole group of lines very happily The other balcony from a very ordinary looking house in the same street is much more interesting in its details It is shown in the plate as it appeared last summer with convolvulus twined about the bars the arrow shaped living leaves mingled among the leaves of iron but you may see in the centre of these real leaves a cluster of lighter ones which are those of the ironwork itself This cluster is worth giving a little larger to show its treatment Fig two in Appendix V is the front view of it Fig four its profile It is composed of a large tulip in the centre then two turkscap lilies then two pinks a little conventionalized then two narcissi then two nondescripts or at least flowers I do not know and then two dark buds and a few leaves I say dark buds for all these flowers have been coloured in their original state The plan of the group is exceedingly simple it is all enclosed in a pointed arch Fig three Appendix V the large mass of the tulip forming the apex a six foiled star on each side then a jagged star then a five foiled star then an unjagged star or rose finally a small bud so as to establish relation and cadence through the whole group The profile is very free and fine and the upper bar of the balcony exceedingly beautiful in effect none the less so on account of the marvellously simple means employed A thin strip of iron is bent over a square rod out of the edge of this strip are cut a series of triangular openings widest at top leaving projecting teeth of iron Appendix Fig five then each of these projecting pieces gets a little sharp tap with the hammer in front which beaks its edge inwards tearing it a little open at the same time and the thing is done The common forms of Swiss ironwork are less naturalistic than these Italian balconies depending more on beautiful arrangements of various curve nevertheless there has been a rich naturalist school at Fribourg where a few bell handles are still left consisting of rods branched into laurel and other leafage At Geneva modern improvements have left nothing but at Annecy a little good work remains the balcony of its old hotel de ville especially with a trout of the lake presumably the town arms forming its central ornament I might expatiate all night if you would sit and hear me on the treatment of such required subject or introduction of pleasant caprice by the old workmen but we have no more time to spare and I must quit this part of our subject the rather as I could not explain to you the intrinsic merit of such ironwork without going fully into the theory of curvilinear design only let me leave with you this one distinct assertion that the quaint beauty and character of many natural objects such as intricate branches grass foliage especially thorny branches and prickly foliage as well as that of many animals plumed spined or bristled is sculpturally expressible in iron only and in iron would be majestic and impressive in the highest degree and that every piece of metal work you use might be rightly treated not only a superb decoration but a most valuable abstract of portions of natural forms holding in dignity precisely the same relation to the painted representation of plants that a statue does to the painted form of man It is difficult to give you an idea of the grace and interest which the simplest objects possess when their forms are thus abstracted from among the surrounding of rich circumstance which in nature disturbs the feebleness of our attention In Plate two a few blades of common green grass and a wild leaf or two just as they were thrown by nature are thus abstracted from the associated redundance of the forms about them and shown on a dark ground every cluster of herbage would furnish fifty such groups and every such group would work into iron fitting it of course rightly to its service with perfect ease and endless grandeur of result III IRON in POLICY Having thus obtained some idea of the use of iron in art as dependent on its ductility I need not certainly say anything of its uses in manufacture and commerce we all of us know enough perhaps a little too much about them So I pass lastly to consider its uses in policy dependent chiefly upon its tenacity that is to say on its power of bearing a pull and receiving an edge These powers which enable it to pierce to bind and to smite render it fit for the three great instruments by which its political action may be simply typified namely the Plough the Fetter and the Sword On our understanding the right use of these three instruments depend of course all our power as a nation and all our happiness as individuals I THE PLOUGH I say first on our understanding the right use of the plough with which in justice to the fairest of our labourers we must always associate that feminine plough the needle The first requirement for the happiness of a nation is that it should understand the function in this world of these two great instruments a happy nation may be defined as one in which the husband s hand is on the plough and the housewife s on the needle so in due time reaping its golden harvest and shining in golden vesture and an unhappy nation is one which acknowledging no use of plough nor needle will assuredly at last find its storehouse empty in the famine and its breast naked to the cold Perhaps you think this is a mere truism which I am wasting your time in repeating I wish it were By far the greater part of the suffering and crime which exist at this moment in civilized Europe arises simply from people not understanding this truism not knowing that produce or wealth is eternally connected by the laws of heaven and earth with resolute labour but hoping in some way to cheat or abrogate this everlasting law of life and to feed where they have not furrowed and be warm where they have not woven I repeat nearly all our misery and crime result from this one misapprehension The law of nature is that a certain quantity of work is necessary to produce a certain quantity of good of any kind whatever If you want knowledge you must toil for it if food you must toil for it and if pleasure you must toil for it But men do not acknowledge this law or strive to evade it hoping to get their knowledge and food and pleasure for nothing and in this effort they either fail of getting them and remain ignorant and miserable or they obtain them by making other men work for their benefit and then they are tyrants and robbers Yes and worse than robbers I am not one who in the least doubts or disputes the progress of this century in many things useful to mankind but it seems to me a very dark sign respecting us that we look with so much indifference upon dishonesty and cruelty in the pursuit of wealth In the dream of Nebuchadnezzar it was only the feet that were part of iron and part of clay but many of us are now getting so cruel in our avarice that it seems as if in us the heart were part of iron and part of clay From what I have heard of the inhabitants of this town I do not doubt but that I may be permitted to do here what I have found it usually thought elsewhere highly improper and absurd to do namely trace a few Bible sentences to their practical result You cannot but have noticed how often in those parts of the Bible which are likely to be oftenest opened when people look for guidance comfort or help in the affairs of daily life namely the Psalms and Proverbs mention is made of the guilt attaching to the Oppression of the poor Observe not the neglect of them but the Oppression of them the word is as frequent as it is strange You can hardly open either of those books but somewhere in their pages you will find a description of the wicked man s attempts against the poor such as He doth ravish the poor when he getteth him into his net He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages his eyes are privily set against the poor In his pride he doth persecute the poor and blesseth the covetous whom God abhorreth His mouth is full of deceit and fraud in the secret places doth he murder the innocent Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread They have drawn out the sword and bent the bow to cast down the poor and needy They are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression Pride compasseth them about as a chain and violence as a garment Their poison is like the poison of a serpent Ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth Yes Ye weigh the violence of your hands weigh these words as well The last things we ever usually think of weighing are Bible words We like to dream and dispute over them but to weigh them and see what their true contents are anything but that Yet weigh these for I have purposely taken all these verses perhaps more striking to you read in this connection than separately in their places out of the Psalms because for all people belonging to the Established Church of this country these Psalms are appointed lessons portioned out to them by their clergy to be read once through every month Presumably therefore whatever portions of Scripture we may pass by or forget these at all events must be brought continually to our observance as useful for direction of daily life Now do we ever ask ourselves what the real meaning of these passages may be and who these wicked people are who are murdering the innocent You know it is rather singular language this rather strong language we might perhaps call it hearing it for the first time Murder and murder of innocent people nay even a sort of cannibalism Eating people yes and God s people too eating My people as if they were bread swords drawn bows bent poison of serpents mixed violence of hands weighed measured and trafficked with as so much coin where is all this going on Do you suppose it was only going on in the time of David and that nobody but Jews ever murder the poor If so it would surely be wiser not to mutter and mumble for our daily lessons what does not concern us but if there be any chance that it may concern us and if this description in the Psalms of human guilt is at all generally applicable as the descriptions in the Psalms of human sorrow are may it not be advisable to know wherein this guilt is being committed round about us or by ourselves and when we take the words of the Bible into our mouths in a congregational way to be sure whether we mean merely to chant a piece of melodious poetry relating to other people we know not exactly to whom or to assert our belief in facts bearing somewhat stringently on ourselves and our daily business And if you make up your minds to do this no longer and take pains to examine into the matter you will find that these strange words occurring as they do not in a few places only but almost in every alternate psalm and every alternate chapter of proverb or prophecy with tremendous reiteration were not written for one nation or one time only but for all nations and languages for all places and all centuries and it is as true of the wicked man now as ever it was of Nabal or Dives that his eyes are set against the poor Set against the poor mind you Not merely set away from the poor so as to neglect or lose sight of them but set against so as to afflict and destroy them This is the main point I want to fix your attention upon You will often hear sermons about neglect or carelessness of the poor But neglect and carelessness are not at all the points The Bible hardly ever talks about neglect of the poor It always talks of oppression of the poor a very different matter It does not merely speak of passing by on the other side and binding up no wounds but of drawing the sword and ourselves smiting the men down It does not charge us with being idle in the pest house and giving no medicine but with being busy in the pest house and giving much poison May we not advisedly look into this matter a little even tonight and ask first Who are these poor No country is or ever will be without them that is to say without the class which cannot on the average do more by its labour than provide for its subsistence and which has no accumulations of property laid by on any considerable scale Now there are a certain number of this class whom we cannot oppress with much severity An able bodied and intelligent workman sober honest and industrious will almost always command a fair price for his work and lay by enough in a few years to enable him to hold his own in the labour market But all men are not able bodied nor intelligent nor industrious and you cannot expect them to be Nothing appears to me at once more ludicrous and more melancholy than the way the people of the present age usually talk about the morals of labourers You hardly ever address a labouring man upon his prospects in life without quietly assuming that he is to possess at starting as a small moral capital to begin with the virtue of Socrates the philosophy of Plato and the heroism of Epaminondas Be assured my good man you say to him that if you work steadily for ten hours a day all your life long and if you drink nothing but water or the very mildest beer and live on very plain food and never lose your temper and go to church every Sunday and always remain content in the position in which Providence has placed you and never grumble nor swear and always keep your clothes decent and rise early and use every opportunity of improving yourself you will get on very well and never come to the parish All this is exceedingly true but before giving the advice so confidently it would be well if we sometimes tried it practically ourselves and spent a year or so at some hard manual labour not of an entertaining kind ploughing or digging for instance with a very moderate allowance of beer nothing hut bread and cheese for dinner no papers nor muffins in the morning no sofas nor magazines at night one small room for parlour and kitchen and a large family of children always in the middle of the floor If we think we could under these circumstances enact Socrates or Epaminondas entirely to our own satisfaction we shall be somewhat justified in requiring the same behaviour from our poorer neighbours but if not we should surely consider a little whether among the various forms of the oppression of the poor we may not rank as one of the first and likeliest the oppression of expecting too much from them But let this pass and let it be admitted that we can never be guilty of oppression towards the sober industrious intelligent exemplary labourer There will always be in the world some who are not altogether intelligent and exemplary we shall I believe to the end of time find the majority somewhat unintelligent a little inclined to be idle and occasionally on Saturday night drunk we must even be prepared to hear of reprobates who like skittles on Sunday morning better than prayers and of unnatural parents who send their children out to beg instead of to go to school Now these are the kind of people whom you can oppress and whom you do oppress and that to purpose and with all the more cruelty and the greater sting because it is just their own fault that puts them into your power You know the words about wicked people are He doth ravish the poor when he getteth him into his net This getting into the net is constantly the fault or folly of the sufferer his own heedlessness or his own indolence but after he is once in the net the oppression of him and making the most of his distress are ours The nets which we use against the poor are just those worldly embarrassments which either their ignorance or their improvidence are almost certain at some time or other to bring them into then just at the time when we ought to hasten to help them and disentangle them and teach them how to manage better in future we rush forward to pillage them and force all we can out of them in their adversity For to take one instance only remember this is literally and simply what we do whenever we buy or try to buy cheap goods goods offered at a price which we know cannot be remunerative for the labour involved in them Whenever we buy such goods remember we are stealing somebody s labour Don t let us mince the matter I say in plain Saxon STEALING taking from him the proper reward of his work and putting it into our own pocket You know well enough that the thing could not have been offered you at that price unless distress of some kind had forced the producer to part with it You take advantage of this distress and you force as much out of him as you can under the circumstances The old barons of the middle ages used in general the thumbscrew to extort property we moderns use in preference hunger or domestic affliction but the fact of extortion remains precisely the same Whether we force the man s property from him by pinching his stomach or pinching his fingers makes some difference anatomically morally none whatsoever we use a form of torture of some sort in order to make him give up his property we use indeed the man s own anxieties instead of the rack and his immediate peril of starvation instead of the pistol at the head but otherwise we differ from Front de Boeuf or Dick Turpin merely in being less dexterous more cowardly and more cruel More cruel I say because the fierce baron and the redoubted highwayman are reported to have robbed at least by preference only the rich we steal habitually from the poor We buy our liveries and gild our prayer books with pilfered pence out of children s and sick men s wages and thus ingeniously dispose a given quantity of Theft so that it may produce the largest possible measure of delicately distributed suffering But this is only one form of common oppression of the poor only one way of taking our hands off the plough handle and binding another s upon it This first way of doing it is the economical way the way preferred by prudent and virtuous people The bolder way is the acquisitive way the way of speculation You know we are considering at present the various modes in which a nation corrupts itself by not acknowledging the eternal connection between its plough and its pleasure by striving to get pleasure without working for it Well I say the first and commonest way of doing so is to try to get the product of other people s work and enjoy it ourselves by cheapening their labour in times of distress then the second way is that grand one of watching the chances of the market the way of speculation Of course there are some speculations that are fair and honest speculations made with our own money and which do not involve in their success the loss by others of what we gain But generally modern speculation involves much risk to others with chance of profit only to ourselves even in its best conditions it is merely one of the forms of gambling or treasure hunting it is either leaving the steady plough and the steady pilgrimage of life to look for silver mines beside the way or else it is the full stop beside the dice tables in Vanity Fair investing all the thoughts and passions of the soul in the fall of the cards and choosing rather the wild accidents of idle fortune than the calm and accumulative rewards of toil And this is destructive enough at least to our peace and virtue But is usually destructive of far more than our peace or our virtue Have you ever deliberately set yourselves to imagine and measure the suffering the guilt and the mortality caused necessarily by the failure of any large dealing merchant or largely branched bank Take it at the lowest possible supposition count at the fewest you choose the families whose means of support have been involved in the catastrophe Then on the morning after the intelli gence of ruin let us go forth amongst them in earnest thought let us use that imagination which we waste so often on fictitious sorrow to measure the stern facts of that multitudinous distress strike open the private doors of their chambers and enter silently into the midst of the domestic misery look upon the old men who had reserved for their failing strength some remainder of rest in the evening tide of life cast helplessly back into its trouble and tumult look upon the active strength of middle age suddenly blasted into incapacity its hopes crushed and its hardly earned rewards snatched away in the same instant at once the heart withered and the right arm snapped look upon the piteous children delicately nurtured whose soft eyes now large with wonder at their parents grief must soon be set in the dimness of famine and far more than all this look forward to the length of sorrow beyond to the hardest labour of life now to be undergone either in all the severity of unexpected and inexperienced trial or else more bitter still to be begun again and endured for the second time amidst the ruins of cherished hopes and the feebleness of advancing years embittered by the continual sting and taunt of the inner feeling that it has all been brought about not by the fair course of appointed circumstance but by miserable chance and wanton treachery and last of all look beyond this to the shattered destinies of those who have faltered under the trial and sunk past recovery to despair And then consider whether the hand which has poured this poison into all the springs of life be one whit less guiltily red with human blood than that which literally pours the hemlock into the cup or guides the dagger to the heart We read with horror of the crimes of a Borgia or a Tophana but there never lived Borgias such as live now in the midst of us The cruel lady of Ferrara slew only in the strength of passion she slew only a few those who thwarted her purposes or who vexed her soul she slew sharply and suddenly embittering the fate of her victims with no foretastes of destruction no prolongations of pain and finally and chiefly she slew not without remorse nor without pity But we in no storm of passion in no blindness of wrath we in calm and clear and untempted selfishness pour our poison not for a few only but for multitudes not for those who have wronged us or resisted but for those who have trusted us and aided we not with sudden gift of merciful and unconscious death but with slow waste of hunger and weary rack of disappointment and despair we last and chiefly do our murdering not with any pauses of pity or scorching of conscience but in facile and forgetful calm of mind and so forsooth read day by day complacently as if they meant any one else than ourselves the words that forever describe the wicked The poison of asps is under their lips and their feet are swift to shed blood You may indeed perhaps think there is some excuse for many in this matter just because the sin is so unconscious that the guilt is not so great when it is unapprehended and that it is much more pardonable to slay heedlessly than purposefully I believe no feeling can be more mistaken and that in reality and in the sight of heaven the callous indifference which pursues its own interests at any cost of life though it does not definitely adopt the purpose of sin is a state of mind at once more heinous and more hopeless than the wildest aberrations of ungoverned passion There may be in the last case some elements of good and of redemption still mingled in the character but in the other few or none There may be hope for the man who has slain his enemy in anger hope even for the man who has betrayed his friend in fear but what hope for him who trades in unregarded blood and builds his fortune on unrepented treason But however this may be and wherever you may think yourselves bound in justice to impute the greater sin be assured that the question is one of responsibilities only not of facts The definite result of all our modern haste to be rich is assuredly and constantly the murder of a certain number of persons by our hands every year I have not time to go into the details of another on the whole the broadest and terriblest way in which we cause the destruction of the poor namely the way of luxury and waste destroying in improvidence what might have been the support of thousands Footnote The analysis of this error will be found completely carried out in my lectures on the political economy of art And it is an error worth analyzing for until it is finally trodden under foot no healthy political economical or moral action is possible in any state I do not say this impetuously or suddenly for I have investigated this subject as deeply and as long as my own special subject of art and the principles of political economy which I have stated in those lectures are as sure as the principles of Euclid Foolish readers doubted their certainty because I told them I had never read any books on Political Economy Did they suppose I had got my knowledge of art by reading books but if you follow out the subject for yourselves at home and what I have endeavoured to lay before you to night will only be useful to you if you do you will find that wherever and whenever men are endeavouring to make money hastily and to avoid the labour which Providence has appointed to be tho only source of honourable profit and also wherever and whenever they permit themselves to spend it luxuriously without reflecting how far they are misguiding the labour of others there and then in either case they are literally and infallibly causing for their own benefit or their own pleasure a certain annual number of human deaths that therefore the choice given to every man born into this world is simply whether he will be a labourer or an assassin and that whosoever has not his hand on the Stilt of the plough has it on the Hilt of the dagger It would also be quite vain for me to endeavour to follow out this evening the lines of thought which would be suggested by the other two great political uses of iron in the Fetter and the Sword a few words only I must permit myself respecting both two THE FETTER As the plough is the typical instrument of industry so the fetter is the typical instrument of the restraint or subjection necessary in a nation either literally for its evil doers or figuratively in accepted laws for its wise and good men You have to choose between this figurative and literal use for depend upon it the more laws you accept the fewer penalties you will have to endure and the fewer punishments to enforce For wise laws and just restraints are to a noble nation not chains but chain mail strength and defence though something also of an incumbrance And this necessity of restraint remember is just as honourable to man as the necessity of labour You hear every day greater numbers of foolish people speaking about liberty as if it were such an honourable thing so far from being that it is on the whole and in the broadest sense dishonourable and an attribute of the lower creatures No human being however great or powerful was ever so free as a fish There is always something that he must or must not do while the fish may do whatever he likes All the kingdoms of the world put together are not half so large as the sea and all the railroads and wheels that ever were or will be invented are not so easy as fins You will find on fairly thinking of it that it is his Restraint which is honourable to man not his Liberty and what is more it is restraint which is honourable even in the lower animals A butterfly is much more free than a bee but you honour the bee more just because it is subject to certain laws which fit it for orderly function in bee society And throughout the world of the two abstract things liberty and restraint restraint is always the more honourable It is true indeed that in these and all other matters you never can reason finally from the abstraction for both liberty and restraint are good when they are nobly chosen and both are bad when they are basely chosen but of the two I repeat it is restraint which characterizes the higher creature and betters the lower creature and from the ministering of the archangel to the labour of the insect from the poising of the planets to the gravitation of a grain of dust the power and glory of all creatures and all matter consist in their obedience not in their freedom The Sun has no liberty a dead leaf has much The dust of which you are formed has no liberty Its liberty will come with its corruption And therefore I say boldly though it seems a strange thing to say in England that as the first power of a nation consists in knowing how to guide the Plough its second power consists in knowing how to wear the Fetter three THE SWORD And its third power which perfects it as a nation consist in knowing how to wield the sword so that the three talismans of national existence are expressed in these three short words Labour Law and Courage This last virtue we at least possess and all that is to be alleged against us is that we do not honour it enough I do not mean honour by acknowledgment of service though sometimes we are slow in doing even that But we do not honour it enough in consistent regard to the lives and souls of our soldiers How wantonly we have wasted their lives you have seen lately in the reports of their mortality by disease which a little care and science might have prevented but we regard their souls less than their lives by keeping them in ignorance and idleness and regarding them merely as instruments of battle The argument brought forward for the maintenance of a standing army usually refers only to expediency in the case of unexpected war whereas one of the chief reasons for the maintenance of an army is the advantage of the military system as a method of education The most fiery and headstrong who are often also the most gifted and generous of your youths have always a tendency both in the lower and upper classes to offer themselves for your soldiers others weak and unserviceable in a civil capacity are tempted or entrapped into the army in a fortunate hour for them out of this fiery or uncouth material it is only a soldier s discipline which can bring the full value and power Even at present by mere force of order and authority the army is the salvation of myriads and men who under other circumstances would have sunk into lethargy or dissipation are redeemed into noble life by a service which at once summons and directs their energies How much more than this military education is capable of doing you will find only when you make it education indeed We have no excuse for leaving our private soldiers at their present level of ignorance and want of refinement for we shall invariably find that both among officers and men the gentlest and best informed are the bravest still less have we excuse for diminishing our army either in the present state of political events or as I believe in any other conjunction of them that for many a year will be possible in this world You may perhaps be surprised at my saying this perhaps surprised at my implying that war itself can be right or necessary or noble at all Nor do I speak of all war as necessary nor of all war as noble Both peace and war are noble or ignoble according to their kind and occasion No man has a profounder sense of the horror and guilt of ignoble war than I have I have personally seen its effects upon nations of unmitigated evil on soul and body with perhaps as much pity and as much bitterness of indignation as any of those whom you will hear continually declaiming in the cause of peace But peace may be sought in two ways One way is as Gideon sought it when he built his altar in Ophrah naming it God send peace yet sought this peace that he loved as he was ordered to seek it and the peace was sent in God s way the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon And the other way of seeking peace is as Menahem sought it when he gave the King of Assyria a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him That is you may either win your peace or buy it win it by resistance to evil buy it by compromise with evil You may buy your peace with silenced consciences you may buy it with broken vows buy it with lying words buy it with base connivances buy it with the blood of the slain and the cry of the captive and the silence of lost souls over hemispheres of the earth while you sit smiling at your serene hearths lisping comfortable prayers evening and morning and counting your pretty Protestant beads which are flat and of gold instead of round and of ebony as the monks ones were and so mutter continually to yourselves Peace peace when there is No peace but only captivity and death for you as well as for those you leave unsaved and yours darker than theirs I cannot utter to you what I would in this matter we all see too dimly as yet what our great world duties are to allow any of us to try to outline their enlarging shadows But think over what I have said and as you return to your quiet homes to night reflect that their peace was not won for you by your own hands but by theirs who long ago jeoparded their lives for you their children and remember that neither this inherited peace nor any other can be kept but through the same jeopardy No peace was ever won from Fate by subterfuge or agreement no peace is ever in store for any of us but that which we shall win by victory over shame or sin victory over the sin that oppresses as well as over that which corrupts For many a year to come the sword of every righteous nation must be whetted to save or subdue nor will it be by patience of others suffering but by the offering of your own that you ever will draw nearer to the time when the great change shall pass upon the iron of the earth when men shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks neither shall they learn war any more APPENDICES APPENDIX I RIGHT AND WRONG Readers who are using my Elements of Drawing may be surprised by my saying here that Tintoret may lead them wrong while in the Elements he is one of the six men named as being always right 
6364-65393-0000	train-other-500	I bring the apparent inconsistency forward at the beginning of this Appendix because the illustration of it will be farther useful in showing the real nature of the self contradiction which is often alleged against me by careless readers It is not only possible
6364-65393-0001	train-other-500	but a frequent condition of human action to do right and be right yet so as to mislead other people if they rashly imitate the thing done For there are many rights which are not absolutely but relatively right
6364-65393-0002	train-other-500	right only for that person to do under those circumstances not for this person to do under other circumstances Thus it stands between Titian and Tintoret Titian is always absolutely Right
6364-65393-0003	train-other-500	You may imitate him with entire security that you are doing the best thing that can possibly be done for the purpose in hand Tintoret is always relatively Right relatively to his own aims and peculiar powers
none	none	 But you must quite understand Tintoret before you can be sure what his aim was and why he was then right in doing what would not be right always If however you take the pains thus to understand him 
6364-65393-0004	train-other-500	he becomes entirely instructive and exemplary just as Titian is
none	none	 and therefore I have placed him among those are always right 
6364-65393-0005	train-other-500	and you can only study him rightly with that reverence for him Then the artists who are named as admitting question of right and wrong
none	none	 are those who from some mischance of circumstance or short coming in their education do not always do right 
6364-65393-0006	train-other-500	even with relation to their own aims and powers Take for example the quality of imperfection in drawing form There are many pictures of Tintoret in which the trees are drawn with a few curved flourishes of the brush instead of leaves
6364-65393-0007	train-other-500	That is absolutely wrong If you copied the tree as a model you would be going very wrong indeed But it is relatively and for Tintoret s purposes right In the nature of the superficial work
none	none	 you will find there must have been a cause for it Somebody perhaps wanted the picture in a hurry to fill a dark corner Tintoret good naturedly did all he could painted the figures tolerably had five minutes left only for the trees when the servant came 
6364-65393-0008	train-other-500	Let him wait another five minutes And this is the best foliage we can do in the time Entirely admirably unsurpassably right under the conditions Titian would not have worked under them but Tintoret was kinder and humbler
6364-65393-0009	train-other-500	yet he may lead you wrong if you don t understand him Or perhaps another day somebody came in while Tintoret was at work who tormented Tintoret An ignoble person
none	none	 Titian would have been polite to him and gone on steadily with his trees 
6364-65393-0010	train-other-500	Tintoret cannot stand the ignobleness it is unendurably repulsive and discomfiting to him The Black Plague take him and the trees too Shall such a fellow see me paint And the trees go all to pieces
6364-65393-0011	train-other-500	This in you would be mere ill breeding and ill temper In Tintoret it was one of the necessary conditions of his intense sensibility had he been capable then of keeping his temper he could never have done his greatest works
6364-65393-0012	train-other-500	Let the trees go to pieces by all means it is quite right they should he is always right But in a background of Gainsborough you would find the trees unjustifiably gone to pieces
none	none	 The carelessness of form there is definitely purposed by him adopted as an advisable thing and therefore it is both absolutely and relatively wrong it indicates his being imperfectly educated as a painter and not having brought out all his powers It may still happen that the man whose work thus partially erroneous is greater far than others who have fewer faults Gainsborough s and Reynolds wrongs are more charming than almost anybody else s right Still they occasionally are wrong but the Venetians and Velasquez 
6364-65393-0013	train-other-500	Footnote At least after his style was formed early pictures like the Adoration of the Magi in our Gallery are of little value
none	none	 never I ought perhaps to have added in that Manchester address 
6364-65393-0014	train-other-500	only one does not like to say things that shock people some words of warning against painters likely to mislead the student For indeed though here and there something may be gained by looking at inferior men there is always more to be gained by looking at the best
6364-65393-0015	train-other-500	and there is not time with all the looking of human life to exhaust even one great painter s instruction How then shall we dare to waste our sight and thoughts on inferior ones even if we could do so
6364-65393-0016	train-other-500	which we rarely can without danger of being led astray Nay strictly speaking what people call inferior painters are in general no painters Artists are divided by an impassable gulf into the men who can paint
6364-65393-0017	train-other-500	and who cannot The men who can paint often fall short of what they should have done are repressed or defeated or otherwise rendered inferior one to another still there is an everlasting barrier between them
6364-65393-0018	train-other-500	and the men who cannot paint who can only in various popular ways pretend to paint And if once you know the difference there is always some good to be got by looking at a real painter
6364-65393-0019	train-other-500	seldom anything but mischief to be got out of a false one but do not suppose real painters are common I do not speak of living men but among those who labour no more in this England of ours since it first had a school
6364-65393-0020	train-other-500	we have had only five real painters Reynolds Gainsborough Hogarth Richard Wilson and Turner The reader may perhaps think I have forgotten Wilkie No I once much overrated him as an expressional draughtsman
6364-65393-0021	train-other-500	not having then studied the figure long enough to be able to detect superficial sentiment
none	none	 But his colour I have never praised 
6364-65393-0022	train-other-500	it is entirely false and valueless
none	none	 And it would tie unjust to English art if I did not here express my regret that the admiration of Constable already harmful enough in England is extending even into France There was perhaps the making in Constable of a second or third rate painter if any careful discipline had developed in him the instincts which 
6364-65393-0023	train-other-500	though unparalleled for narrowness were as far as they went true But as it is he is nothing more than an industrious and innocent amateur blundering his way to a superficial expression of one or two popular aspects of common nature
6364-65393-0024	train-other-500	And my readers may depend upon it that all blame which I express in this sweeping way is trustworthy I have often had to repent of over praise of inferior men and continually to repent of insufficient praise of great men
none	none	 but of broad condemnation never For I do not speak it but after the most searching examination of the matter and under stern sense of need for it so that whenever the reader is entirely shocked by what I say 
6364-65393-0025	train-other-500	he may be assured every word is true Footnote He must however be careful to distinguish blame however strongly expressed of some special fault or error in a true painter
6364-65393-0026	train-other-500	from these general statements of inferiority or worthlessness Thus he will find me continually laughing at Wilson s tree painting
none	none	 not because Wilson could not paint but because he had never looked at a tree 
6364-65393-0027	train-other-500	It is just because it so much offends him that it was necessary and knowing that it must offend him I should not have ventured to say it without certainty of its truth I say certainty for it is just as possible to be certain
none	none	 whether the drawing of a tree or a stone is true or false 
6364-65393-0028	train-other-500	as whether the drawing of a triangle is and what I mean primarily by saying that a picture is in all respects worthless is that it is in all respects False which is not a matter of opinion at all
6364-65393-0029	train-other-500	but a matter of ascertainable fact such as I never assert till I have ascertained And the thing so commonly said about my writings that they are rather persuasive than just
6364-65393-0030	train-other-500	and that though my language may be good I am an unsafe guide in art criticism is like many other popular estimates in such matters not merely untrue but precisely the reverse of the truth
6364-65393-0031	train-other-500	it is truth like reflections in water distorted much by the shaking receptive surface and in every particular upside down For my language
none	none	 until within the last six or seven years was loose obscure and more or less feeble 
6364-65393-0032	train-other-500	and still though I have tried hard to mend it the best I can do is inferior to much contemporary work No description that I have ever given of anything is worth four lines of Tennyson and in serious thought
none	none	 my half pages are generally only worth about as much as a single sentence either of his or of Carlyle s They are I well trust as true and necessary but they are neither so concentrated nor so well put 
6364-65393-0033	train-other-500	But I am an entirely safe guide in art judgment and that
none	none	 simply as the necessary result of my having given the labour of life to the determination of facts rather than to the following of feelings or theories Not indeed that my work is free from mistakes it admits many and always must admit many from its scattered range but in the long run it will be found to enter sternly and searchingly into the nature of what it deals with and the kind of mistake it admits is never dangerous consisting usually in pressing the truth too far 
6364-65393-0034	train-other-500	It is quite easy for instance to take an accidental irregularity in a piece of architecture which less careful examination would never have detected at all for an intentional irregularity quite possible to misinterpret an obscure passage in a picture
none	none	 which a less earnest observer would never have tried to interpret But mistakes of this kind honest enthusiastic mistakes are never harmful because they are always made in a true direction 
6364-65393-0035	train-other-500	falls forward on the road not into the ditch beside it and they are sure to be corrected by the next comer But the blunt and dead mistakes made by too many other writers on art the mistakes of sheer inattention and want of sympathy
none	none	 are mortal The entire purpose of a great thinker may be difficult to fathom and we may be over and over again more or less mistaken in guessing at his meaning but the real profound 
6364-65393-0036	train-other-500	nay quite bottomless and unredeemable mistake is the fool s thought that he had no meaning I do not refer in saying this to any of my statements respecting subjects which it has been my main work to study
6364-65393-0037	train-other-500	as far as I am aware I have never yet misinterpreted any picture of Turner s though often remaining blind to the half of what he had intended neither have I as yet found anything to correct in my statements respecting Venetian architecture
none	none	 Footnote The subtle portions of the Byzantine Palaces given in precise measurements in the second volume of the Stones of Venice were alleged by architects to be accidental irregularities 
6364-65393-0038	train-other-500	They will be found by every one who will take the pains to examine them most assuredly and indisputably intentional and not only so but one of the principal subjects of the designer s care
none	none	 but in casual references to what has been quickly seen it is impossible to guard wholly against error without losing much valuable observation true in ninety nine cases out of a hundred and harmless even when erroneous APPENDIX II REYNOLDS DISAPPOINTMENT It is very fortunate that in the fragment of Mason s MSS published lately by mister Cotton in his Sir Joshua Reynolds Notes Footnote Smith Soho Square eighteen fifty nine 
6364-65393-0040	train-other-500	record is preserved of Sir Joshua s feelings respecting the paintings in the window of New College which might otherwise have been supposed to give his full sanction to this mode of painting on glass
none	none	 Nothing can possibly be more curious to my mind than the great painter s expectations or his having at all entertained the idea that the qualities of colour which are peculiar to opaque bodies could be obtained in a transparent medium 
6364-65393-0041	train-other-500	but so it is and with the simplicity and humbleness of an entirely great man he hopes that mister Jervas on glass is to excel Sir Joshua on canvas Happily Mason tells us the result
none	none	 With the copy Jervas made of this picture he was grievously disappointed I had frequently he said to me pleased myself by reflecting after I had produced what I thought a brilliant effect of light and shadow on my canvas how greatly that effect would be heightened by the transparency which the painting on glass would be sure to produce It turned out quite the reverse APPENDIX III CLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE This passage in the lecture was illustrated by an enlargement of the woodcut Fig one but I did not choose to disfigure the middle of this book with it It is copied from the forty ninth plate of the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica Edinburgh seventeen ninety seven and represents an English farmhouse arranged on classical principles If the reader cares to consult the work itself he will find in the same plate another composition of similar propriety and dignified by the addition of a pediment beneath the shadow of which a private gentleman who has a small family may find conveniency APPENDIX IV SUBTLETY OF HAND I had intended in one or other of these lectures to have spoken at some length of the quality of refinement in Colour but found the subject would lead me too far A few words are however necessary in order to explain some expressions in the text Refinement in colour is indeed a tautological expression for colour in the true sense of the word does not exist until it is refined Dirt exists stains exist and pigments exist easily enough in all places and are laid on easily enough by all hands but colour exists only where there is tenderness and can be laid on only by a hand which has strong life in it The law concerning colour is very strange very noble in some sense almost awful In every given touch laid on canvas if one grain of the colour is inoperative and does not take its full part in producing the hue the hue will be imperfect The grain of colour which does not work is dead It infects all about it with its death It must be got quit of or the touch is spoiled We acknowledge this instinctively in our use of the phrases dead colour killed colour foul colour Those words are in some sort literally true If more colour is put on than is necessary a heavy touch when a light one would have been enough the quantity of colour that was not wanted and is overlaid by the rest is as dead and it pollutes the rest There will be no good in the touch The art of painting properly so called consists in laying on the least possible colour that will produce the required result and this measurement in all the ultimate that is to say the principal operations of colouring is so delicate that not one human hand in a million has the required lightness The final touch of any painter properly so named of Correggio Titian Turner or Reynolds would be always quite invisible to any one watching the progress of the work the films of hue being laid thinner than the depths of the grooves in mother of pearl The work may be swift apparently careless nay to the painter himself almost unconscious Great painters are so organized that they do their best work without effort but analyze the touches afterwards and you will find the structure and depth of the colour laid mathematically demonstrable to be of literally infinite fineness the last touches passing away at their edges by untraceable gradation The very essence of a master s work may thus be removed by a picture cleaner in ten minutes Observe however this thinness exists only in portions of the ultimate touches for which the preparation may often have been made with solid colours commonly and literally called dead colouring but even that is always subtle if a master lays it subtle at least in drawing if simple in hue and farther observe that the refinement of work consists not in laying absolutely little colour but in always laying precisely the right quantity To lay on little needs indeed the rare lightness of hand but to lay much yet not one atom too much and obtain subtlety not by withholding strength but by precision of pause that is the master s final sign manual power knowledge and tenderness all united A great deal of colour may often be wanted perhaps quite a mass of it such as shall project from the canvas but the real painter lays this mass of its required thickness and shape with as much precision as if it were a bud of a flower which he had to touch into blossom one of Turner s loaded fragments of white cloud is modelled and gradated in an instant as if it alone were the subject of the picture when the same quantity of colour under another hand would be a lifeless lump The following extract from a letter in the Literary Gazette of thirteenth November eighteen fifty eight which I was obliged to write to defend a questioned expression respecting Turner s subtlety of hand from a charge of hyperbole contains some interesting and conclusive evidence on the point though it refers to pencil and chalk drawing only I must ask you to allow me yet leave to reply to the objections you make to two statements in my catalogue as those objections would otherwise diminish its usefulness I have asserted that in a given drawing named as one of the chief in the series Turner s pencil did not move over the thousandth of an inch without meaning and you charge this expression with extravagant hyperbole On the contrary it is much within the truth being merely a mathematically accurate description of fairly good execution in either drawing or engraving It is only necessary to measure a piece of any ordinary good work to ascertain this Take for instance Finden s engraving at the one hundred and eightieth page of Rogers poems in which the face of the figure from the chin to the top of the brow occupies just a quarter of an inch and the space between the upper lip and chin as nearly as possible one seventeenth of an inch The whole mouth occupies one third of this space say one fiftieth of an inch and within that space both the lips and the much more difficult inner corner of the mouth are perfectly drawn and rounded with quite successful and sufficiently subtle expression Any artist will assure you that in order to draw a mouth as well as this there must be more than twenty gradations of shade in the touches that is to say in this case gradations changing with meaning within less than the thousandth of an inch But this is mere child s play compared to the refinement of a first rate mechanical work much more of brush or pencil drawing by a master s hand In order at once to furnish you with authoritative evidence on this point I wrote to mister Kingsley tutor of Sidney Sussex College a friend to whom I always have recourse when I want to be precisely right in any matter for his great knowledge both of mathematics and of natural science is joined not only with singular powers of delicate experimental manipulation but with a keen sensitiveness to beauty in art His answer in its final statement respecting Turner s work is amazing even to me and will I should think be more so to your readers Observe the successions of measured and tested refinement here is No one The finest mechanical work that I know which is not optical is that done by Nobert in the way of ruling lines I have a series ruled by him on glass giving actual scales from twenty four and sixteen of an inch perfectly correct to these places of decimals and he has executed others as fine as twelve though I do not know how far he could repeat these last with accuracy This is No one of precision mister Kingsley proceeds to No two But this is rude work compared to the accuracy necessary for the construction of the object glass of a microscope such as Rosse turns out I am sorry to omit the explanation which follows of the ten lenses composing such a glass each of which must be exact in radius and in surface and all have their axes coincident but it would not be intelligible without the figure by which it is illustrated so I pass to mister Kingsley s No three I am tolerably familiar he proceeds with the actual grinding and polishing of lenses and specula and have produced by my own hand some by no means bad optical work and I have copied no small amount of Turner s work and I still look with awe at the combined delicacy and precision of his hand IT BEATS OPTICAL WORK OUT OF SIGHT In optical work as in refined drawing the hand goes beyond the eye and one has to depend upon the feel and when one has once learned what a delicate affair touch is one gets a horror of all coarse work and is ready to forgive any amount of feebleness sooner than that boldness which is akin to impudence In optics the distinction is easily seen when the work is put to trial but here too as in drawing it requires an educated eye to tell the difference when the work is only moderately bad but with bold work nothing can be seen but distortion and fog and I heartily wish the same result would follow the same kind of handling in drawing but here the boldness cheats the unlearned by looking like the precision of the true man It is very strange how much better our ears are than our eyes in this country if an ignorant man were to be bold with a violin he would not get many admirers though his boldness was far below that of ninety nine out of a hundred drawings one sees The words which I have put in italics in the above extract are those which were surprising to me I knew that Turner s was as refined as any optical work but had no idea of its going beyond it mister Kingsley s word awe occurring just before is however as I have often felt precisely the right one When once we begin at all to understand the handling of any truly great executor such as that of any of the three great Venetians of Correggio or Turner the awe of it is something greater than can be felt from the most stupendous natural scenery For the creation of such a system as a high human intelligence endowed with its ineffably perfect instruments of eye and hand is a far more appalling manifestation of Infinite Power than the making either of seas or mountains After this testimony to the completion of Turner s work I need not at length defend myself from the charge of hyperbole in the statement that as far as I know the galleries of Europe may be challenged to produce one sketch footnote A sketch observe not a finished drawing Sketches are only proper subjects of comparison with each other when they contain about the same quantity of work the test of their merit is the quantity of truth told with a given number of touches The assertion in the Catalogue which this letter was written to defend was made respecting the sketch of Rome No one hundred one that shall equal the chalk study No forty five or the feeblest of the memoranda in the seventy first and following frames which memoranda however it should have been observed are stated at the forty fourth page to be in some respects the grandest work in grey that he did in his life For I believe that as manipulators none but the four men whom I have just named the three Venetians and Correggio were equal to Turner and as far as I know none of those four ever put their full strength into sketches But whether they did or not my statement in the catalogue is limited by my own knowledge and as far as I can trust that knowledge it is not an enthusiastic statement but an entirely calm and considered one It may be a mistake but it is not a hyperbole APPENDIX V I can only give to illustrate this balcony fac similes of rough memoranda made on a single leaf of my note book with a tired hand but it may be useful to young students to see them in order that they may know the difference between notes made to get at the gist and heart of a thing and notes made merely to look neat Only it must be observed that the best characters of free drawing are always lost even in the most careful facsimile and I should not show even these slight notes in woodcut imitation unless the reader had it in his power by a glance at the twenty first or thirty fifth plates in Modern Painters and yet better by trying to copy a piece of either of them to ascertain how far I can draw or not I refer to these plates because though I distinctly stated in the preface that they together with the twelfth twentieth thirty fourth and thirty seventh were executed on the steel by my own hand the use of the dry point in the foregrounds of the twelfth and twenty first plates being moreover wholly different from the common processes of etching I find it constantly assumed that they were engraved for me as if direct lying in such matters were a thing of quite common usage Fig two is the centre piece of the balcony but a leaf spray is omitted on the right hand side having been too much buried among the real leaves to be drawn Fig three shows the intended general effect of its masses the five leaved and six leaved flowers being clearly distinguishable at any distance Fig four is its profile rather carefully drawn at the top to show the tulip and turkscap lily leaves Underneath there is a plate of iron beaten into broad thin leaves which gives the centre of the balcony a gradual sweep outwards like the side of a ship of war The central profile is of the greatest importance in ironwork as the flow of it affects the curves of the whole design not merely in surface as in marble carving but in their intersections when the side is seen through the front The lighter leaves b b are real bindweed Fig five shows two of the teeth of the border illustrating their irregularity of form which takes place quite to the extent indicated Fig six is the border at the side of the balcony showing the most interesting circumstance in the treatment of the whole namely the enlargement and retraction of the teeth of the cornice as it approaches the wall This treatment of the whole cornice as a kind of wreath round the balcony having its leaves flung loose at the back and set close at the front as a girl would throw a wreath of leaves round her hair is precisely the most finished indication of a good workman s mind to be found in the whole thing Fig seven shows the outline of the retracted leaves accurately It was noted in the text that the whole of this ironwork had been coloured The difficulty of colouring ironwork rightly and the necessity of doing it in some way or other have been the principal reasons for my never having entered heartily into this subject for all the ironwork I have ever seen look beautiful was rusty and rusty iron will not answer modern purposes Nevertheless it may be painted but it needs some one to do it who knows what painting means and few of us do certainly none as yet of our restorers of decoration or writers on colour It is a marvellous thing to me that book after book should appear on this last subject without apparently the slightest consciousness on the part of the writers that the first necessity of beauty in colour is gradation as the first necessity of beauty in line is curvature or that the second necessity in colour is mystery or subtlety as the second necessity in line is softness Colour ungradated is wholly valueless colour unmysterious is wholly barbarous Unless it looses itself and melts away towards other colours as a true line loses itself and melts away towards other lines colour has no proper existence in the noble sense of the word What a cube or tetrahedron is to organic form ungradated and unconfused colour is to organic colour and a person who attempts to arrange colour harmonies without gradation of tint is in precisely the same category as an artist who should try to compose a beautiful picture out of an accumulation of cubes and parallelepipeds The value of hue in all illuminations on painted glass of fine periods depends primarily on the expedients used to make the colours palpitate and fluctuate inequality of brilliancy being the condition of brilliancy just as inequality of accent is the condition of power and loveliness in sound The skill with which the thirteenth century illuminators in books and the Indians in shawls and carpets use the minutest atoms of colour to gradate other colours and confuse the eye is the first secret in their gift of splendour associated however with so many other artifices which are quite instinctive and unteachable that it is of little use to dwell upon them Delicacy of organization in the designer given you will soon have all and without it nothing However not to close my book with desponding words let me set down as many of us like such things five Laws to which there is no exception whatever and which if they can enable no one to produce good colour are at least as far as they reach accurately condemnatory of bad colour one ALL GOOD COLOUR IS GRADATED A blush rose or better still a blush itself is the type of rightness in arrangement of pure hue two ALL HARMONIES OF COLOUR DEPEND FOR THEIR VITALITY ON THE ACTION AND HELPFUL OPERATION OF EVERY PARTICLE OF COLOUR THEY CONTAIN three THE FINAL PARTICLES OF COLOUR NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF A COLOUR HARMONY ARE ALWAYS INFINITELY SMALL either laid by immeasurably subtle touches of the pencil or produced by portions of the colouring substance however distributed which are so absolutely small as to become at the intended distance infinitely so to the eye four NO COLOUR HARMONY IS OF HIGH ORDER UNLESS IT INVOLVES INDESCRIBABLE TINTS It is the best possible sign of a colour when nobody who sees it knows what to call it or how to give an idea of it to any one else Even among simple hues the most valuable are those which cannot be defined the most precious purples will look brown beside pure purple and purple beside pure brown and the most precious greens will be called blue if seen beside pure green and green if seen beside pure blue five THE FINER THE EYE FOR COLOUR THE LESS IT WILL REQUIRE TO GRATIFY IT INTENSELY But that little must be supremely good and pure as the finest notes of a great singer which are so near to silence And a great colourist will make even the absence of colour lovely as the fading of the perfect voice makes silence sacred END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TWO PATHS This file should be named seventtpaten txt or seventtpaten zip Corrected EDITIONS
