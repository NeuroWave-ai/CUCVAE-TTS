his turn was coming in the Eternal Sequence of things The stars in their courses indicated the beginning of the undoing of Mike Clinch From Esthonia a refugee Countess wrote to James Darragh in New York After two years we have discovered that it was Jose Quintana s band of international thieves that robbed Ricca Quintana has disappeared A Levantine diamond broker in New York named Emanuel Sard may be in communication with him Ricca and I are going to America as soon as possible VALENTINE The day Darragh received the letter he started to look up Sard But that very morning Sard had received a curious letter from Rotterdam This was the letter Sardius Tourmaline Aragonite Rhodonite Porphyry Obsidian Nugget Gold Diaspore Novaculite Yu Nugget Silver Amber Matrix Turquoise Elaeolite Ivory

Mine Stone Natrolite Cats Eye Electrum one five a a That afternoon young Darragh located Sard s office and presented himself as a customer The weasel faced clerk behind the wicket laid a pistol handy and informed Darragh that Sard was away on a business trip Darragh looked cautiously around the small office Can anybody hear us Nobody Why I have important news concerning Jose Quintana whispered Darragh Where is Sard Why he had a letter from Quintana this very morning replied the clerk in a low uneasy voice mister Sard left for Albany on the one o clock train Is there any trouble Plenty replied Darragh coolly do you know Quintana No But mister Sard expects him here any day now Darragh leaned closer against the grille Listen very carefully if a man comes here who calls himself Jose Quintana turn him over to the police until mister Sard returns No matter what he tells you turn him over to the police Do you understand Who are you demanded the worried clerk Are you one of Quintana s people Young man said Darragh I m close enough to Quintana to give you orders And give Sard orders And Quintana too A great light dawned on the scared clerk You are Jose Quintana he said hoarsely Darragh bored him through with his dark stare Mind your business he said That night in Albany Darragh picked up Sard s trail It led to a dealer in automobiles Sard had bought a Comet Six paying cash and had started north Through Schenectady Fonda and Mayfield the following day Darragh traced a brand new Comet Six containing one short dark Levantine with a parrot nose In Northville Darragh hired a Ford At Lake Pleasant Sard s car went wrong Darragh missed him by ten minutes but he learned that Sard had inquired the way to Ghost Lake Inn That was sufficient Darragh bought an axe drove as far as Harrod s Corners dismissed the Ford and walked into a forest entirely familiar to him He emerged in half an hour on a wood road two miles farther on Here he felled a tree across the road and sat down in the bushes to await events Toward sunset hearing a car coming he tied his handkerchief over his face below the eyes and took an automatic from his pocket Sard s car stopped and Sard got out to inspect the obstruction Darragh sauntered out of the bushes poked his pistol against mister Sard s fat abdomen and leisurely and thoroughly robbed him In an agreeable spot near a brook Darragh lighted his pipe and sat him down to examine the booty in detail Two pistols a stiletto and a blackjack composed the arsenal of mister Sard A large wallet disclosed more than four thousand dollars in Treasury notes something to reimburse Ricca when she arrived he thought Among Sard s papers he discovered a cipher letter from Rotterdam probably from Quintana Cipher was rather in Darragh s line All ciphers are solved by similar methods unless the key is contained in a code book known only to sender and receiver But Quintana s cipher proved to be only an easy acrostic the very simplest of secret messages Within an hour Darragh had it pencilled out Cipher Take notice Star Pond N Y Name is Mike Clinch Has Flaming Jewel Erosite I sail at once QUINTANA Having served in Russia as an officer in the Military Intelligence Department attached to the American Expeditionary Forces Darragh had little trouble with Quintana s letter Even the signature was not difficult the fraction one five was easily translated Quint and the familiar prescription symbol a a spelled ana which gave Quintana s name in full He had heard of Erosite as the rarest and most magnificent of all gems Only three were known The young Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia had possessed one Darragh was immensely amused to find that the chase after Emanuel Sard should have led him to the very borders of the great Harrod estate in the Adirondacks He gathered up his loot and walked on through the splendid forest which once had belonged to Henry Harrod of Boston and which now was the property of Harrod s nephew James Darragh When he came to the first trespass notice he stood a moment to read it Then slowly he turned and looked toward Clinch s An autumn sunset flared like a conflagration through the pines There was a glimmer of water too where Star Pond lay Fate Chance and Destiny were becoming very busy with Mike Clinch They had started Quintana Sard and Darragh on his trail Now they stirred up the sovereign State of New York That lank wolf Justice was afoot and sniffing uncomfortably close to the heels of Mike Clinch II Two State Troopers drew bridles in the yellowing October forest Their smart drab uniforms touched with purple blended harmoniously with the autumn woods They were as inconspicuous as two deer in the dappled shadow There was a sunny clearing just ahead The wood road they had been travelling entered it Beyond lay Star Pond Trooper Lannis said to Trooper Stormont That s Mike Clinch s clearing Our man may be there Now we ll see if anybody tips him off this time Forest and clearing were very still in the sunshine Nothing stirred save gold leaves drifting down and a hawk high in the deep blue sky turning in narrow circles Lannis was instructing Stormont who had been transferred from the Long Island Troop and who was unacquainted with local matters Lannis said Clinch s dump stands on the other edge of the clearing Clinch owns five hundred acres in here He s a rat Bad Well he s mean I don t know how bad he is But he runs a rotten dump The forest has its slums as well as the city This is the Hell s Kitchen of the North Woods Stormont nodded All the scum of the wilderness gathers here went on Lannis Here s where half the trouble in the North Woods hatches We ll eat dinner at Clinch s His stepdaughter is a peach The sturdy sun browned trooper glanced at his wrist watch stretched his legs in his stirrups Jack he said I want you to get Clinch right and I m going to tell you about his outfit while we watch this road It s like a movie Clinch plays the lead I ll dope out the scenario for you He turned sideways in his saddle freeing both spurred heels and lolled so constructing a cigarette while he talked Way back around nineteen hundred Mike Clinch was a guide a decent young fellow they say He guided fishing parties in summer hunters in fall and winter He made money and built the house The people he guided were wealthy He made a lot of money and bought land I understand he was square and that everybody liked him About that time there came to Clinch s hotel a mister and missus Strayer They were lungers Strayer seemed to be a gentleman his wife was good looking and rather common Both were very young He had the consump bad the galloping variety He didn t last long A month after he died his young wife had a baby Clinch married her She also died the same year The baby s name was Eve Clinch became quite crazy about her and started to make a lady of her That was his mania Lannis leaned from his saddle and carefully dropped his cigarette end into a puddle of rain water Then he swung one leg over and sat side saddle Clinch had plenty of money in those days he went on He could afford to educate the child The kid had a governess Then he sent her to a fancy boarding school She had everything a young girl could want She developed into a pretty young thing at fifteen She s eighteen now and I don t know what to call her She pulled a gun on me in July What Sure There was a row at Clinch s dump A rum runner called Jake Kloon got shot up I came up to get Clinch He was sick drunk in his bunk When I broke in the door Eve Strayer pulled a gun on me What happened inquired Stormont Nothing I took Clinch But he got off as usual Acquitted Lannis nodded rolling another cigarette Now I ll tell you how Clinch happened to go wrong he said You see he d always made his living by guiding Well some years ago Henry Harrod of Boston came here and bought thousands and thousands of acres of forest all around Clinch s Lannis half rose on one stirrup and with a comprehensive sweep of his muscular arm ending in a flourish He bought everything for miles and miles And that started Clinch down hill Harrod tried to force Clinch to sell The millionaire tactics you know He was determined to oust him Clinch got mad and wouldn t sell at any price Harrod kept on buying all around Clinch and posted trespass notices That meant ruin to Clinch He was walled in No hunters care to be restricted Clinch s little property was no good Business stopped His stepdaughter s education became expensive He was in a bad way Harrod offered him a big price But Clinch turned ugly and wouldn t budge And that s how Clinch began to go wrong Poor devil said Stormont Devil all right Poor too But he needed money He was crazy to make a lady of Eve Strayer And there are ways of finding money you know Stormont nodded Well Clinch found money in those ways The Conservation Commissioner in Albany began to hear about game law violations The Revenue people heard of rum running Clinch lost his guide s license But nobody could get the goods on him There was a rough backwoods bunch always drifting about Clinch s place in those days There were fights And not so many miles from Clinch s there was highway robbery and a murder or two Then the war came The draft caught Clinch Malone exempted him he being the sole support of his stepchild But the girl volunteered She got to France somehow scrubbed in a hospital I believe anyway Clinch wanted to be on the same side of the world she was on and he went with a Forestry Regiment and cut trees for railroad ties in southern France until the war ended and they sent him home Eve Strayer came back too She s there now You ll see her at dinner time She sticks to Clinch He s a rat He s up against the dry laws and the game laws Government enforcement agents game protectors State Constabulary all keep an eye on Clinch Harrod s trespass signs fence him in He s like a rat in a trap Yet Clinch makes money at law breaking and nobody can catch him red handed He kills Harrod s deer That s certain I mean Harrod s nephew s deer Harrod s dead Darragh s the young nephew s name He s never been here he was in the army in Russia I don t know what became of him but he keeps up the Harrod preserve game wardens patrols watchers trespass signs and all Lannis finished his second cigarette got back into his stirrups and gathering bridle began leisurely to divide curb and snaffle That s the layout Jack he said Yonder lies the Red Light district of the North Woods Mike Clinch is the brains of all the dirty work that goes on A floating population of crooks and bums game violators boot leggers market hunters pelt collectors rum runners hootch makers do his dirty work and I guess there are some who ll stick you up by starlight for a quarter and others who ll knock your block off for a dollar And there s the girl Eve Strayer I don t get her at all except that she s loyal to Clinch And now you know what you ought to know about this movie called Hell in the Woods And it s up to us to keep a calm impartial eye on the picture and try to follow the plot they re acting out if there is any Stormont said Thanks Bill I m posted And I m getting hungry too I believe said Lannis that you want to see that girl I do returned the other laughing Well you ll see her She s good to look at But I don t get her at all Why Because she looks right and yet she lives at Clinch s with him and his bunch of bums Would you think a straight girl could stand it No man can tell what a straight girl can stand Straight or crooked she stands for Mike Clinch said Lannis and he s a ratty customer Maybe the girl is fond of him It s natural I guess it s that But I don t see how any young girl can stomach the life at Clinch s It s a wonder what a decent woman will stand observed Stormont Ninety nine per cent of all wives ought to receive the D S O Do you think we re so rotten inquired Lannis smiling Not so rotten No But any man knows what men are And it s a wonder women stick to us when they learn They laughed Lannis glanced at his watch again Well he said I don t believe anybody has tipped off our man It s noon Come on to dinner Jack They cantered forward into the sunlit clearing Star Pond lay ahead On its edge stood Clinch s III Clinch in his shirt sleeves came out on the veranda He had little light grey eyes close clipped grey hair and was clean shaven How are you Clinch inquired Lannis affably All right replied Clinch you re the same I hope Trooper Stormont mister Clinch said Lannis in his genial way Pleased to know you said Clinch level eyed unstirring The troopers dismounted Both shook hands with Clinch Then Lannis led the way to the barn We ll eat well he remarked to his comrade Clinch cooks From the care of their horses they went to a pump to wash One or two rough looking men slouched out of the house and glanced at them Hallo Jake said Lannis cheerily Jake Kloon grunted acknowledgment Lannis said in Stormont s ear Here she comes with towels She s pretty isn t she A young girl in pink gingham advanced toward them across the patch of grass Lannis was very polite and presented Stormont The girl handed them two rough towels glanced at Stormont again after the introduction smiled slightly Dinner is ready she said They dried their faces and followed her back to the house It was an unpainted building partly of log In the dining room half a dozen men waited silently for food Lannis saluted all named his comrade and seated himself A delicious odour of johnny cake pervaded the room Presently Eve Strayer appeared with the dinner There was dew on her pale forehead the heat of the kitchen no doubt The girl s thick lustrous hair was brownish gold and so twisted up that it revealed her ears and a very white neck When she brought Stormont his dinner he caught her eyes a moment experienced a slight shock of pleasure at their intense blue the gentian blue of the summer zenith at midday Lannis remained affable even became jocose at moments No hootch for dinner Mike How s that now The Boot leg Express is a day late replied Clinch with cold humour Around the table ran an odd sound a company of catamounts feeding might have made such a noise if catamounts ever laugh How s the fur market Jake inquired Lannis pouring gravy over his mashed potato Kloon quoted prices with an oath A mean visaged young man named Leverett complained of the price of traps What do you care inquired Lannis genially The other man pays What are you kicking about anyway It wasn t so long ago that muskrats were ten cents The trooper s good humoured intimation that Earl Leverett took fur in other men s traps was not lost on the company Leverett s fox visage reddened Jake Kloon who had only one eye glared at the State Trooper but said nothing Clinch s pale gaze met the trooper s smiling one The jays and squirrels talk too he said slowly It don t mean anything Only the show down counts You re quite right Clinch The show down is what we pay to see But talk is the tune the orchestra plays before the curtain rises Stormont had finished dinner He heard a low charming voice from behind his chair Apple pie lemon pie maple cake berry roll He looked up into two gentian blue eyes Lemon pie please he said blushing When dinner was over and the bare little dining room empty except for Clinch and the two State Troopers the former folded his heavy powerful hands on the table s edge and turned his square face and pale eyed gaze on Lannis Spit it out he said in a passionless voice Lannis crossed one knee over the other lighted a cigarette Is there a young fellow working for you named Hal Smith No said Clinch Sure Sure Clinch continued Lannis have you heard about a stick up on the wood road out of Ghost Lake No Well a wealthy tourist from New York a mister Sard stopping at Ghost Lake Inn was held up and robbed last Saturday toward sundown Never heard of him said Clinch calmly The robber took four thousand dollars in bills and some private papers from him It s no skin off my shins remarked Clinch He s laid a complaint Yes Have any strangers been here since Saturday evening No There was a pause We heard you had a new man named Hal Smith working around your place No He came here Saturday night Who says so A guide from Ghost Lake He s a liar You know said Lannis it won t do you any good if hold up men can hide here and make a getaway G wan and search said Clinch calmly They searched the hotel from garret to cellar They searched the barn boat shed out houses While this was going on Clinch went into the kitchen Eve he said coolly the State Troopers are after that fellow Hal Smith who came here Saturday night Where is he He went into Harrod s to get us a deer she replied in a low voice What has he done Stuck up a man on the Ghost Lake road He ought to have told me Do you think you could meet up with him and tip him off He s hunting on Owl Marsh I ll try All right Change your clothes and slip out the back door And look out for Harrod s patrols too All right dad she said If I have to be out to night don t worry I ll get word to Smith somehow Half an hour later Lannis and Stormont returned from a prowl around the clearing Lannis paid the reckoning his comrade led out the horses He said again to Lannis I m sure it was the girl She wore men s clothes and she went into the woods on a run As they started to ride away Lannis said to Clinch who stood on the veranda It s still blue jay and squirrel talk between us Mike but the show down is sure to come Better go straight while the going s good I go straight enough to suit me said Clinch But it s the Government that is to be suited Mike And if it gets you right you ll be in dutch Don t let that worry you said Clinch About three o clock the two State Troopers riding at a walk came to the forks of the Ghost Lake road Now said Lannis to Stormont if you really believe you saw the girl beat it out of the back door and take to the woods she s probably somewhere in there he pointed into the western forest But he added what s your idea in following her She wore men s clothes she was in a hurry and trying to keep out of sight I wondered whether Clinch might have sent her to warn this hold up fellow That s rather a long shot isn t it Very long I could go in and look about a bit if you ll lead my horse All right Take your bearings This road runs west to Ghost Lake We sleep at the Inn there if you mean to cross the woods on foot Stormont nodded consulted his map and compass pocketed both unbuckled his spurs When he was ready he gave his bridle to Lannis I d just like to see what she s up to he remarked All right If you miss me come to the Inn said Lannis starting on with the led horse The forest was open amid a big stand of white pine and hemlock and Stormont travelled easily and swiftly He had struck a line by compass that must cross the direction taken by Eve Strayer when she left Clinch s But it was a wild chance that he would ever run across her And probably he never would have if the man that she was looking for had not fired a shot on the edge of that vast maze of stream morass and dead timber called Owl Marsh Far away in the open forest Stormont heard the shot and turned in that direction But Eve already was very near when the young man who called himself Hal Smith fired at one of Harrod s deer a three prong buck on the edge of the dead water Smith had drawn and dressed the buck by the time the girl found him He was cleaning up when she arrived squatting by the water s edge when he heard her voice across the swale Smith The State Troopers are looking for you He stood up dried his hands on his breeches The girl picked her way across the bog jumping from one tussock to the next When she told him what had happened he began to laugh Did you really stick up this man she asked incredulously I m afraid I did Eve he replied still laughing The girl s entire expression altered So that s the sort you are she said I thought you different But you re all a rotten lot Hold on he interrupted what do you mean by that I mean that the only men who ever come to Star Pond are crooks she retorted bitterly I didn t believe you were You look decent But you re as crooked as the rest of them and it seems as if I I couldn t stand it any longer If you think me so rotten why did you run all the way from Clinch s to warn me he asked curiously I didn t do it for you I did it for my father They ll jail him if they catch him hiding you They ve got it in for him If they put him in prison he ll die He couldn t stand it I know And that s why I came to find you and tell you to clear out The distant crack of a dry stick checked her The next instant she picked up his rifle seized his arm and fairly dragged him into a spruce thicket Do you want to get my father into trouble she said fiercely The rocky flank of Star Peak bordered the marsh here Come on she whispered jerking him along through the thicket and up the rocks to a cleft a hole in the sheer rock overhung by shaggy hemlock Get in there she said breathlessly Whoever comes he protested will see the buck yonder and will certainly look in here Not if I go down there and take your medicine Creep into that cave and lie down What do you intend to do he demanded interested and amused If it s one of Harrod s game keepers said the girl drily it only means a summons and a fine for me And if it s a State Trooper who is prowling in the woods yonder hunting crooks he ll find nobody here but a trespasser Keep quiet I ll stand him off IV When State Trooper Stormont came out on the edge of Owl Marsh the girl was kneeling by the water washing deer blood from her slender sun tanned fingers What are you doing here she enquired looking up over her shoulder with a slight smile Just having a look around he said pleasantly That s a nice fat buck you have there Yes he s nice You shot him asked Stormont Who else do you suppose shot him she enquired smilingly She rinsed her fingers again and stood up swinging her arms to dry her hands a lithe grey shirted figure in her boyish garments straight supple and strong I saw you hurrying into the woods said Stormont Yes I was in a hurry We need meat I didn t notice that you carried a rifle when I saw you leave the house by the back door No it was in the woods she said indifferently You have a hiding place for your rifle For other things also she said letting her eyes of gentian blue rest on the young man You seem to be very secretive Is a girl more so than a man she asked smilingly Stormont smiled too then became grave Who else was here with you he asked quietly She seemed surprised Did you see anybody else He hesitated flushed pointed down at the wet sphagnum Smith s foot prints were there in damning contrast to her own Worse than that Smith s pipe lay on an embedded log and a rubber tobacco pouch beside it She said with a slight catch in her breath It seems that somebody has been here Some hunter perhaps or a game warden Or Hal Smith said Stormont A painful colour swept the girl s face and throat The man sorry for her looked away After a silence I know something about you he said gently And now that I ve seen you heard you speak met your eyes I know enough about you to form an opinion So I don t ask you to turn informer But the law won t stand for what Clinch is doing whatever provocation he has had And he must not aid or abet any criminal or harbour any malefactor The girl s features were expressionless The passive sullen beauty of her troubled the trooper Trouble for Clinch means sorrow for you he said I don t want you to be unhappy I bear Clinch no ill will For this reason I ask him and I ask you too to stand clear of this affair Hal Smith is wanted I m here to take him As she said nothing he looked down at the foot print in the sphagnum Then his eyes moved to the next imprint to the next Then he moved slowly along the water s edge tracking the course of the man he was following The girl watched him in silence until the plain trail led him to the spruce thicket Don t go in there she said sharply with an odd tremor in her voice He turned and looked at her then stepped calmly into the thicket And the next instant she was among the spruces too confronting him with her rifle Get out of these woods she said He looked into the girl s deathly white face Eve he said it will go hard with you if you kill me I don t want you to live out your life in prison I can t help it If you send my father to prison he ll die I d rather die myself Let us alone I tell you The man you re after is nothing to us We didn t know he had stuck up anybody If he s nothing to you why do you point that rifle at me I tell you he is nothing to us But my father wouldn t betray a dog And I won t That s all Now get out of these woods and come back to morrow Nobody ll interfere with you then Stormont smiled Eve he said do you really think me as yellow as that Her blue eyes flashed a terrible warning but in the same instant he had caught her rifle twisting it out of her grasp as it exploded The detonation dazed her then as he flung the rifle into the water she caught him by neck and belt and flung him bodily into the spruces But she fell with him he held her twisting and struggling with all her superb and supple strength staggered to his feet still mastering her and as she struggled sobbing locked hot and panting in his arms he snapped a pair of handcuffs on her wrists and flung her aside She fell on both knees got up shoulder deep in spruce blood running from her lip over her chin The trooper took her by the arm She was trembling all over He took a thin steel chain and padlock from his pocket passed the links around her steel bound wrists and fastened her to a young birch tree Then drawing his pistol from its holster he went swiftly forward through the spruces When he saw the cleft in the rocky flank of Star Peak he walked straight to the black hole which confronted him Come out of there he said distinctly After a few seconds Smith came out Good God said Stormont in a low voice What are you doing here Darragh Darragh came close and rested one hand on Stormont s shoulder Don t crab my game Stormont I never dreamed you were in the Constabulary or I d have let you know Are you Hal Smith I sure am Where s that girl Handcuffed out yonder Then for God s sake go back and act as if you hadn t found me Tell Mayor Chandler that I m after bigger game than he is Clinch Stormont I m here to protect Mike Clinch Tell the Mayor not to touch him The men I m after are going to try to rob him I don t want them to because well I m going to rob him myself Stormont stared You must stand by me said Darragh So must the Mayor He knows me through and through Tell him to forget that hold up I stopped that man Sard I frisked him Tell the Mayor I ll keep in touch with him Of course said Stormont that settles it Thanks old chap Now go back to that girl and let her believe that you never found me A slight smile touched their eyes Both instinctively saluted Then they shook hands Darragh alias Hal Smith went back into the hemlock shaded hole in the rocks Trooper Stormont walked slowly down through the spruces When Eve saw him returning empty handed something flashed in her pallid face like sunlight across snow Stormont passed her went to the water s edge soaked a spicy handful of sphagnum moss in the icy water came back and wiped the blood from her face The girl seemed astounded her face surged in vivid colour as he unlocked the handcuffs and pocketed them and the little steel chain Her lip was bleeding again He washed it with wet moss took a clean handkerchief from the breast of his tunic and laid it against her mouth Hold it there he said Mechanically she raised her hand to support the compress Stormont went back to the shore recovered her rifle from the shallow water and returned with it As she made no motion to take it he stood it against the tree to which he had tied her Then he came close to her where she stood holding his handkerchief against her mouth and looking at him out of steady eyes as deeply blue as gentian blossoms Eve he said you win But you won t forgive me I wish we could be friends some day We never can now Good bye Neither spoke again Then of a sudden the girl s eyes filled and Trooper Stormont caught her free hand and kissed it kissed it again and again dropped it and went striding away through the underbrush which was now all rosy with the rays of sunset After he had disappeared the girl Eve went to the cleft in the rocks above Come out she said contemptuously It s a good thing you hid because there was a real man after you and God help you if he ever finds you Hal Smith came out Pack in your meat said the girl curtly and flung his rifle across her shoulder Through the ruddy afterglow she led the way homeward a man s handkerchief pressed to her wounded mouth her eyes preoccupied with the strangest thoughts that ever had stirred her virgin mind Behind her walked Darragh with his load of venison and his alias and his tongue in his cheek Thus began the preliminaries toward the ultimate undoing of Mike Clinch Fate Chance and Destiny had undertaken the job in earnest EPISODE TWO THE RULING PASSION I Nobody understood how Jose Quintana had slipped through the Secret Service net spread for him at every port The United States authorities did not know why Quintana had come to America They realised merely that he arrived for no good purpose and they had meant to arrest and hold him for extradition if requested for deportation as an undesirable alien anyway Only two men in America knew that Quintana had come to the United States for the purpose of recovering the famous Flaming Jewel stolen by him from the Grand Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia and stolen from Quintana in turn by a private soldier in an American Forestry Regiment on leave in Paris This soldier s name probably was Michael Clinch One of the men who knew why Quintana might come to America was James Darragh recently of the Military Intelligence but now passing as a hold up man under the name of Hal Smith and actually in the employment of Clinch at his disreputable hotel at Star Pond in the North Woods The other man who knew why Quintana had come to America was Emanuel Sard a Levantine diamond broker of New York Quintana s agent in America Now as the October days passed without any report of Quintana s detention Darragh known as Hal Smith at Clinch s dump began to suspect that Quintana had already slid into America through the meshes of the police If so this desperate international criminal could be expected at Clinch s under some guise or other piloted thither by Emanuel Sard So Hal Smith whose duty was to wash dishes do chores and also to supply Clinch s with mountain beef or deer taken illegally made it convenient to prowl every day in the vicinity of the Ghost Lake road He was perfectly familiar with Emanuel Sard s squat features and parrot nose having robbed mister Sard of Quintana s cipher and of four thousand dollars at pistol point And one morning while roving around the guide s quarters at Ghost Lake Inn Smith beheld Sard himself on the hotel veranda in company with five strangers of foreign aspect During the midday dinner Smith on pretense of enquiring for a guide s license got a look at the Inn ledger Sard s signature was on it followed by the names of Henri Picquet Nicolas Salzar Victor Georgiades Harry Beck and Jose Sanchez And Smith went back through the wilderness to Star Pond convinced that one of these gentlemen was Quintana and the remainder Quintana s gang and that they were here to do murder if necessary in their remorseless quest of The Flaming Jewel Two million dollars once had been offered for the Flaming Jewel and had been refused Clinch probably possessed it Smith was now convinced of that But he was there to rob Clinch of it himself For he had promised the little Grand Duchess to help recover her Erosite jewel and now that he had finally traced its probable possession to Clinch he was wondering how this recovery was to be accomplished To arrest Clinch meant ruin to Eve Strayer Besides he knew now that Clinch would die in prison before revealing the hiding place of the Flaming Jewel Also how could it be proven that Clinch had the Erosite gem The cipher from Quintana was not sufficient evidence No the only way was to watch Clinch prevent any robbery by Quintana s gang somehow discover where the Flaming Jewel had been concealed take it and restore it to the beggared young girl whose only financial resource now lay in the possible recovery of this almost priceless gem Toward evening Hal Smith shot two deer near Owl Marsh To poach on his own property appealed to his sense of humour And Clinch never dreaming that Hal Smith was the James Darragh who had inherited Harrod s vast preserve damned all millionaires for every buck brought in and became friendlier to Smith II Clinch s dump was the disposal plant in which collected the human sewage of the wilderness It being Saturday the scum of the North Woods was gathering at the Star Pond resort A venison and chicken supper was promised and a dance if any women appeared Jake Kloon had run in some Canadian hooch Darragh alias Hal Smith contributed two fat deer and Clinch cooked them By ten o clock that morning many of the men were growing noisy some were already drunk by noon Shortly after midday dinner the first fight started extinguished only after Clinch had beaten several of the backwoods aristocracy insensible Towering amid the wreck of battle his light grey eyes a glitter Clinch dominated swinging his iron fists When the combat ended and the fallen lay starkly where they fell Clinch said in his pleasant level voice Take them out and stick their heads in the pond And don t go for to get me mad boys or I m liable to act up rough They bore forth the sleepers for immersion in Star Pond Clinch relighted his cigar and repeated the rulings which had caused the fracas You gotta play square cards here or you don t play none in my house No living thumb nail can nick no cards in my place and get away with it Three kings and two trays is better than three chickens and two eggs If you don t like it g wan home He went out in his shirt sleeves to see how the knock outs were reviving and met Hal Smith returning from the pond who reported progress toward consciousness They walked back to the hotel together Say young fella said Clinch in his soft agreeable way you want to keep your eye peeled to night Why inquired Smith Well there ll be a lot o folks here There ll be strangers too Don t forget the State Troopers are looking for you Do the State Troopers ever play detective asked Smith smiling Sure They ve been in here rigged out like peddlers and lumber jacks and timber lookers Did they ever get anything on you Not a thing Can you always spot them Mike No But when a stranger shows up here who don t know nobody he never sees nothing and he don t never learn nothing He gets no hootch outa me No nor no craps and no cards He gets his supper that s what he gets and a dance if there s ladies and if any girl favours him That s all the change any stranger gets out of Mike Clinch They had paused on the rough veranda in the hot October sunshine Mike suggested Smith carelessly wouldn t it pay you better to go straight Clinch s small grey eyes which had been roaming over the prospect of lake and forest focussed on Smith s smiling features What s that to you he asked I ll be out of a job remarked Smith laughing if they ever land you Clinch s level gaze measured him his mind was busy measuring him too Who the hell are you anyway he asked I don t know You stick up a man on the Ghost Lake Road and hide out here when the State Troopers come after you And now you ask me if it pays better to go straight Why didn t you go straight if you think it pays I haven t got a daughter to worry about explained Smith If they get me it won t hurt anybody else A dull red tinge came out under Clinch s tan Who asked you to worry about Eve She s a fine girl that s all Clinch s steely glare measured the young man You trying to make up to her he enquired gently No She has no use for me Clinch reflected his cold tiger gaze still fastened on Smith You re right he said after a moment Eve is a good girl Some day I ll make a lady of her She is one Clinch At that Clinch reddened heavily the first finer emotion ever betrayed before Smith He did not say anything for a few moments but his grim mouth worked Finally I guess you was a gentleman once before you went crooked Hal he said You act up like you once was Say there s only one thing on God s earth I care about You ve guessed it too He was off again upon his ruling passion Eve nodded Smith Sure She isn t my flesh and blood But it seems like she s more even I want she should be a lady It s all I want That damned millionaire Harrod bust me But he couldn t stop me giving Eve her schooling And now all I m livin for is to be fixed so s to give her money to go to the city like a lady I don t care how I make money all I want is to make it And I m a going to Smith nodded again Clinch now obsessed by his monomania went on with an oath I can t make no money on the level after what Harrod done to me And I gotta fix up Eve What the hell do you mean by asking me would it pay me to travel straight I dunno I was only thinking of Eve A lady isn t supposed to have a crook for a father Clinch s grey eyes blazed for a moment then their menacing glare dulled died out into wintry fixity I wan t born a crook he said I ain t got no choice And don t worry young fella they ain t a going to get me You can t go on beating the game forever Clinch I m beating it he hesitated and it won t be so long neither before I turn over enough to let Eve live in the city like any lady with her autymobile and her own butler and all her swell friends in a big house like she is educated for He broke off abruptly as a procession approached from the lake escorting the battered gentry who now were able to wabble about a little One of them a fox faced trap thief named Earl Leverett slunk hastily by as though expecting another kick from Clinch G wan inside Earl and act up right said Clinch pleasantly You oughter have more sense than to start a fight in my place you and Sid Hone and Harvey Chase G wan in and behave He and Smith followed the procession of damaged ones into the house The big unpainted room where a bar had once been was blue with cheap cigar smoke the air reeked with the stench of beer and spirits A score or more shambling forest louts in their dingy Saturday finery were gathered there playing cards shooting craps lolling around tables and tilting slopping glasses at one another Heavy pleasantries were exchanged with the victims of Clinch s ponderous fists as they re entered the room from which they had been borne so recently feet first Now boys said Clinch kindly act up like swell gents and behave friendly And if any ladies come in for the chicken supper why gol dang it we ll have a dance III Toward sundown the first woodland nymph appeared a half shy half bold willowy thing in the rosy light of the clearing Hal Smith washing glasses and dishes on the back porch for Eve Strayer to dry asked who the rustic beauty might be Harvey Chase s sister said Eve She shouldn t come here but I can t keep her away and her brother doesn t care She s only a child too Is there any harm in a chicken supper and a dance Eve looked gravely at young Smith without replying Other girlish shapes loomed in the evening light Some were met by gallants some arrived at the veranda unescorted Where do they all come from Do they live in trees like dryads asked Smith There are always squatters in the woods she replied indifferently Some of these girls come from Ghost Lake I suppose Yes waitresses at the Inn What music is there Jim Hastings plays a fiddle I play the melodeon if they need me What do you do when there s a fight he asked with a side glance at her pure profile What do you suppose I do Fight too He laughed mirthlessly conscious always of his secret pity for this girl Well he said when your father makes enough to quit he ll take you out of this It s a vile hole for a young girl See here she said flushing you re rather particular for a young man who stuck up a tourist and robbed him of four thousand dollars I m not complaining on my own account returned Smith laughing Clinch s suits me Well don t concern yourself on my account Hal Smith And you d better keep out of the dance too if there are any strangers there You think a State Trooper may happen in It s likely A lot of people come and go We don t always know them She opened a sliding wooden shutter and looked into the bar room After a moment she beckoned him to her side There are strangers there now she said that thin dark man who looks like a Kanuk And those two men shaking dice I don t know who they are I never before saw them But Smith had seen them at Ghost Lake Inn One of them was Sard Quintana s gang had arrived at Clinch s dump A moment later Clinch came through the pantry and kitchen and out onto the rear porch where Smith was washing glasses in a tub filled from an ever flowing spring I m a going to get supper he said to Eve There ll be twenty three plates And to Smith Hal you help Eve wait on the table And if anybody acts up rough you slam him on the jaw don t argue don t wait just slam him good and I ll come on the hop Who are the strangers dad asked Eve Don t nobody know em none girlie But they ain t State Troopers They talk like they was foreign One of em s English the big bony one with yellow hair and mustache Did they give any names asked Smith You bet The stout dark man calls himself Hongri Picket French I guess The fat beak is a fella named Sard Sanchez is the guy with a face like a Canada priest Jose Sanchez or something on that style And then the yellow skinned young man is Nicole Salzar the Britisher Harry Beck and that good lookin dark gent with a little black Charlie Chaplin he s Victor Georgiades What are those foreigners doing in the North Woods Clinch enquired Smith Oh they all give the same spiel hire out in a lumber camp But they ain t no lumberjacks added Clinch contemptuously I don t know what they be hootch runners maybe or booze bandits or they done something crooked som ers r other It s safe to serve em drinks Clinch himself had been drinking He always drank when preparing to cook He turned and went into the kitchen now rolling up his shirt sleeves and relighting his clay pipe IV By nine o clock the noisy chicken supper had ended the table had been cleared Jim Hastings was tuning his fiddle in the big room Eve had seated herself before the battered melodeon Ladies and gents said Clinch in his clear pleasant voice which carried through the hubbub we re a going to have a dance thanks and beholden to Jim Hastings and my daughter Eve Eve she don t drink and she don t dance so no use askin and no hard feelin toward nobody So act up pleasant to one and all and have a good time and no rough stuff in no form shape or manner but behave like gents all and swell dames like you was to a swarry on Fifth Avenue Let s go He went back to the pantry taking no notice of the cheering The fiddler scraped a fox trot and Eve s melodeon joined in A vast scuffling of heavily shod feet filled the momentary silence accented by the shrill giggle of young girls They re off remarked Clinch to Smith who stood at the pantry shelf prepared to serve whiskey or beer upon previous receipt of payment In the event of a sudden raid the arrangements at Clinch s were quite simple Two large drain pipes emerged from the kitchen floor beside Smith and ended in Star Pond In case of alarm the tub of beer was poured down one pipe the whiskey down the other Only the trout in Star Pond would ever sample that hootch again Clinch now slightly intoxicated leaned heavily on the pantry shelf beside Smith adjusting his pistol under his suspenders Young fella he said in his agreeable voice you re dead right You sure said a face full when you says to me Eve s a lady by God You oughta know You was a gentleman yourself once Even if you take to stickin up tourists you know a lady when you see one And you called the turn She is a lady All I m livin for is to get her down to the city and give her money to live like a lady I ll do it yet Soon I d do it to morrow to night if I dared If I thought it sure fire If I was dead certain I could get away with it I ve got the money Now Only it ain t in money Smith Yes Mike You know me Sure You size me up I do All right If you ever tell anyone I got money that ain t money I ll shoot you through the head Don t worry Clinch I ain t You re a crook you won t talk You re a gentleman too They don t sell out a pal Say Hal there s only one fella I don t want to meet Who s that Mike Lemme tell you continued Clinch resting more heavily on the shelf while Smith looking out through the pantry shutter at the dancing listened intently When I was in France in a Forestry Rig ment went on Clinch lowering his always pleasant voice I was to Paris on leave a few days before they sent us home I was in the washroom of a caffy a cleanin up for supper when dod bang into the place comes a tumblin a man with two cops pushing and kickin him They didn t see me in there for they locked the door on the man He was a swell gent too in full dress and silk hat and all like that and a opry cloak and white kid gloves and mustache and French beard When they locked him up he stood stock still and lit a cigarette as cool as ice Then he begun walkin around looking for a way to get out but there wasn t no way Then he seen me and over he comes and talks English right away Want to make a thousand francs soldier sez he in a quick whisper You re on sez I show your dough Them Flics has went to get the Commissaire for to frisk me sez he If they find this parcel on me I do twenty years in Noumea Five years kills anybody out there What do you want I should do sez I havin no love for no cops French or

Then he grabs me sudden and pulls open my collar God he was strong What s the matter with you says I Lemme go or I ll mash your mug flat Lemme see your identification disc he barks Bein in Paris for a bat I had exchanged with my bunkie Bill Hanson Let him look thinks I and he reads Bill s check If you fool me says he I ll folly ye and I ll do you in if it takes the rest of my life You understand Sure says I me tongue in me cheek Bong Allez vous en says he How the hell sez I do I get out of here You re a Yankee soldier The Flics don t know you were in here You go and kick on that door and make a holler So I done it good and a cop opens and swears at me but when he sees a Yankee soldier was locked in the wash room by mistake he lets me out you bet Clinch smiled a thin smile poured out three fingers of hooch What else asked Smith quietly Nothing much I didn t go to no roo Quinze Octobre But I don t never want to see that fella Quintana I ve been waiting till it s safe to sell what was in that packet Sell what What was in that packet replied Clinch thickly What was in it Sparklers since you re so nosey Diamonds And then some I dunno what they re called All I know is I ll croak Quintana if he even turns up askin for em He frisked somebody I frisked him I ll kill anybody who tries to frisk me Where do you keep them enquired Smith naively Clinch looked at him very drunk None o your dinged business he said very softly The dancing had become boisterous but not unseemly although all the men had been drinking too freely Smith closed the pantry bar at midnight by direction of Eve Now he came out into the ballroom and mixed affably with the company even dancing with Harvey Chase s sister once a slender hoyden all flushed and dishevelled with a tireless mania for dancing which seemed to intoxicate her She danced danced danced accepting any partner offered But Smith s skill enraptured her and she refused to let him go when her beau a late arrival one Charlie Berry slouched up to claim her Smith always trying to keep Clinch and Quintana s men in view took no part in the discussion but Berry thought he was detaining Lily Chase and pushed him aside Hold on young man exclaimed Smith sharply Keep your hands to yourself If your girl don t want to dance with you she doesn t have to Some of Quintana s gang came up to listen Berry glared at Smith Say he said I seen you before somewhere Wasn t you in Russia What are you talking about Yes you was You was an officer What you doing at Clinch s What s that growled Clinch shoving his way forward and shouldering the crowd aside Who s this man Mike demanded Berry Well who do you think he is asked Clinch thickly I think he s gettin the goods on you that s what I think yelled Berry G wan home Charlie returned Clinch G wan all o you The dance is over Go peaceable every one Stop that fiddle The music ceased The dance was ended they all understood that but there was grumbling and demands for drinks Clinch drunk but impassive herded them through the door out into the starlight There was scuffling horse play but no fighting The big Englishman Harry Beck asked for accommodations for his party over night Naw said Clinch g wan back to the Inn I can t bother with you folks to night And as the others Salzar Georgiades Picquet and Sanchez gathered about to insist Clinch pushed them all out of doors in a mass Get the hell out o here he growled and slammed the door He stood for a moment with head lowered drunk but apparently capable of reflection Eve came from the melodeon and laid one slim hand on his arm Go to bed girlie he said not looking at her You also dad No I got business with Hal Smith Passing Smith the girl whispered You look out for him and undress him Smith nodded gravely preoccupied with coming events and nerving himself to meet them He had no gun Clinch s big automatic bulged under his armpit When the girl had ascended the creaking stairs and her door above closed Clinch walked unsteadily to the door opened it fished out his pistol Come on out he said without turning Where enquired Smith Clinched turned lifted his square head and the deadly glare in his eyes left Smith silent You comin Sure said Smith quietly But Clinch gave him no chance to close in it was death even to swerve Smith walked slowly out into the starlight ahead of Clinch slowly forward in the luminous darkness Keep going came Clinch s quiet voice behind him And after they had entered the woods Bear to the right Smith knew now The low woods were full of sink holes They were headed for the nearest one On the edge of the thing they halted Smith turned and faced Clinch What s the idea he asked without a quaver Was you in Roosia Yes Was you an officer I was Then you re spyin You re a cop You re mistaken Ah don t hand me none like that You re a State Trooper or a Secret Service guy or a plain dirty cop And I m a going to croak you I m not in any service now Wasn t you an army officer Yes Can t an officer go wrong Soft stuff Don t feed it to me I told you too much anyway I was babblin drunk I m drunk now but I got sense D you think I ll run chances of sittin in State s Prison for the next ten years and leave Eve out here alone No I gotta shoot you Smith And I m a going to do it G wan and say what you want if you think there s some kind o god you can square before you croak If you go to the chair for murder what good will it do Eve asked Smith His lips were crackling dry he moistened them Sink holes don t talk said Clinch G wan and square yourself if you re the church kind Clinch said Smith unsteadily if you kill me now you re as good as dead yourself Quintana is here Say don t hand me that retorted Clinch Do you square yourself or no I tell you Quintana s gang were at the dance to night Picquet Salzar Georgiades Sard Beck Jose Sanchez the one who looks like a French priest Maybe he had a beard when you saw him in that cafe wash room What shouted Clinch in sudden fury What yeh talkin about you poor dumb dingo Yeh fixin to scare me What do you know about Quintana Are you one of Quintana s gang too Is that what you re up to hidin out at Star Pond Come on now out with it I ll have it all out of you now Hal Smith before I plug you He came lurching forward swinging his heavy pistol as though he meant to brain his victim but he halted after the first step or two and stood there a shadowy bulk growling enraged undecided And as Smith looked at him two shadows detached themselves from the trees behind Clinch silently silently glided behind struck in utter silence Down crashed Clinch black jacked his face in the ooze His pistol flew from his hand struck Smith s leg and Smith had it at the same instant and turned it like lightning on the murderous shadows Hands up Quick he cried at bay now and his back to the sink hole Pistol levelled he bent one knee pushed Clinch over on his back lest the ooze suffocate him Now he said coolly what do you bums want of Mike Clinch Who are you came a sullen voice This is none o your bloody business We want Clinch not you What do you want of Clinch Take your gun off us Answer or I ll let go at you What do you want of Clinch Money What do you think You re here to stick up Clinch enquired Smith Yes What s that to you What has Clinch done to you He stuck us up that s what Now are you going to keep out of this No We ain t going to hurt Clinch You bet you re not Where s the rest of your gang What gang Quintana s said Smith laughing A wild exhilaration possessed him His flanks and rear were protected by the sink hole He had Quintana s gang two of them over his pistol Turn your backs and sit down he said As the shadowy forms hesitated he picked up a stick and hurled it at them They sat down hastily hands up backs toward him You ll both die where you sit remarked Smith if you yell for help Clinch sighed heavily stirred groped on the damp leaves with his hands I say began the voice which Smith identified as Harry Beck s if you ll come in with us on this it will pay you young man No drawled Smith I ll go it alone It can t be done old dear You ll see if you try it on Who ll stop me Quintana Come urged Beck and be a good pal You can t manage it alone We ve got all night to make Clinch talk We know how too You ll get your share Oh stow it said Smith watching Clinch who was reviving He sat up presently and put both hands over his head Smith touched him silently on the shoulder and he turned his heavy square head in a dazed way Blood striped his visage He gazed dully at Smith for a little while then seeming to recollect the old glare began to light his pale eyes The next instant however Beck spoke again and Clinch turned in astonishment and saw the two figures sitting there with backs toward Smith and hands up Clinch stared at the squatting forms then slowly moved his head and looked at Smith and his levelled pistol We know how to make a man squeal said Harry Beck suddenly He ll talk We can make Clinch talk no fear Leave it to us old pal Are you with us He started to look around over his shoulder and Smith hurled another stick and hit him in the face Quiet there Harry he said What s my share if I go in with you One sixth same s we all get What s it worth asked Smith with a motion of caution toward Clinch If I say a million you ll tell me I lie But it s nearer three or you can have my share Is it a go You ll not hurt Clinch when he comes to We ll make him talk that s all It may hurt him some You won t kill him I swear by God Wait Isn t it better to shoot him after he squeals Here s a lovely sink hole handy Right o We ll make him talk first and then shove him in Are you with us If you turn your head I ll blow the face off you Harry said Smith cautioning Clinch to silence with a gesture All right Only you better make up your mind That cove is likely to wake up now at any time grumbled Beck Clinch looked at Smith The latter smiled leaned over and whispered Can you walk all right Clinch nodded Well we d better beat it Quintana s whole gang is in these woods somewhere hunting for you and they might stumble on us here at any moment And to the two men in front Lie down flat on your faces Don t stir don t speak or it s you for the sink hole Lie down I tell you That s it Don t move till I tell you to Clinch got up from where he was sitting cast one murderous glance at the prostrate forms then followed Smith noiselessly over the stretch of sphagnum moss When they reached the house they saw Eve standing on the steps in her night dress and bare feet holding a lantern Daddy she whimpered I was frightened I didn t know where you had gone Clinch put his arm around her turned his bloody face and looked at Smith It s this he said that I ain t forgetting young fella What you done for me you done for her I gotta live to make a lady of her That s why he added thickly I m much obliged to you Hal Smith Go to bed girlie You re bleeding dad Aw a twig scratched me I been in the woods with Hal G wan to bed He went to the sink and washed his face dried it kissed the girl and gave her a gentle shove toward the stairs Hal and I is sittin up talkin business he remarked bolting the door and all the shutters When the girl had gone Clinch went to a closet and brought back two Winchester rifles two shot guns and a box of ammunition Goin to see it out with me Hal Sure smiled Smith Aw right Have a drink No Aw right Where ll you set Anywhere Aw right Set over there They may try the back porch I ll jest set here a spell n then I ll kind er mosey round Plug the first fella that tries a shutter Hal You bet Clinch came over and held out his hand You said a face full that time when you says to me Clinch you says Eve is a lady I gotta fix her up I gotta be alive to do it That s why I m greatly obliged to yeh Hal He took his rifle and walked slowly toward the pantry You bet he muttered she is a lady so help me God EPISODE THREE ON STAR PEAK I Mike Clinch regarded the jewels taken from Jose Quintana as legitimate loot acquired in war He was prepared to kill anybody who attempted to take the gems from him At the very possibility his ruling passion blazed his mania to make of Eve Strayer a grand lady But now what he had feared for years had happened Quintana had found him Quintana after all these years had discovered the identity and dwelling place of the obscure American soldier who had robbed him in the wash room of a Paris cafe And Quintana was now in America here in this very wilderness tracking the man who had despoiled him Clinch in his shirt sleeves carrying a rifle came out on the log veranda and sat down to think it over He began to realise that he was likely to have trouble with a man as cold blooded and as dogged as himself Nor did he doubt that those with Quintana were desperate men On whom could he count On nobody unless he paid their hire None among the lawless men who haunted his backwoods hotel at Star Pond would lift a finger to help him Almost any among them would have robbed him murdered him probably if it were known that jewels were hidden in the house He could not trust Jake Kloon Leverett was as treacherous as only a born coward can be Sid Hone Harvey Chase Blommers Byron Hastings he knew them all too well to trust them a sullen unscrupulous pack partly cowardly always fierce as are any creatures that live furtively feed only by their wits and slink through life just outside the frontiers of law And yet one of this gang had stood by him Hal Smith the man he himself had been about to slay Clinch got up from the bench where he had been sitting and walked down to the pond where Hal Smith sat cleaning trout Hal he said I been figuring some Quintana don t dare call in the constables I can t afford to Quintana and I ve got to settle this on our own Smith slit open a ten inch trout stripped it flung the entrails out into the pond soused the fish in water and threw it into a milk pan Whose jewels were they in the beginning he enquired carelessly How do I know If you ever found out I don t want to I got them in the war anyway And it don t make no difference how I got em Eve s going to be a lady if I go to the chair for it So that s that Smith slit another trout gutted it flung away the viscera but laid back the roe Shame to take them in October he remarked but people must eat Same s me nodded Clinch I don t want to kill no one but Eve she s gotta be a lady and ride in her own automobile with the proudest Does Eve know about the jewels Clinch s pale eyes which had been roving over the wooded shores of Star Pond reverted to Smith I d cut my throat before I d tell her he said softly She wouldn t stand for it Hal when you said to me Eve s a lady by God you swallered the hull pie That s the answer A lady don t stand for what you and I don t bother about Suppose she learns that you robbed the man who robbed somebody else of these jewels Clinch s pale eyes were fixed on him Only you and me know he said in his pleasant voice Quintana knows His gang knows Clinch s smile was terrifying I guess she ain t never likely to know nothing Hal What do you purpose to do Mike Still hunt For Quintana I might mistake him for a deer Them accidents is likely too If Quintana catches you it will go hard with you Mike Sure I know He ll torture you to make you talk You think I d talk Hal Smith looked up into the light coloured eyes The pupils were pin points Then he went on cleaning fish Hal What If they get me but no matter they ain t a going to get me Were you going to tell me where those jewels are hidden Mike enquired the young man still busy with his fish He did not look around when he spoke Clinch s murderous gaze was fastened on the back of his head Don t go to gettin too damn nosey Hal he said in his always agreeable voice Smith soused all the fish in water again You d better tell somebody if you go gunning for Quintana Did I ask your advice You did not said the young man smiling All right Mind your business Smith got up from the water s edge with his pan of trout That s what I shall do Mike he said laughing So go on with your private war it s no button off my pants if Quintana gets you He went away toward the ice house with the trout Eve Strayer doing chamber work watched the young man from an upper room The girl s instinct was to like Smith but that very instinct aroused her distrust What was a man of his breeding and education doing at Clinch s dump Why was he content to hang around and do chores A man of his type who has gone crooked enough to stick up a tourist in an automobile nourishes higher though probably perverted ambitions than a dollar a day and board She heard Clinch s light step on the uncarpeted stair went on making up Smith s bed and smiled as her step father came into the room still carrying his rifle He had something else in his hand too a flat thin packet wrapped in heavy paper and sealed all over with black wax Girlie he said I want you should do a little errand for me this morning If you re spry it won t take long time to go there and get back to help with noon dinner Very well dad Go git your pants on girlie You want me to go into the woods I want you to go to the hole in the rocks under Star Peak and lay this packet in the hootch cache She nodded tucked in the sheets smoothed blanket and pillow with deft hands went out to her own room Clinch seated himself and turned a blank face to the window It was a sudden decision He realised now that he couldn t keep the jewels in his house War was on with Quintana The hotel would be the goal for Quintana and his gang And for Smith too if ever temptation overpowered him The house was liable to an attempt at robbery any night now any day perhaps It was no place for the packet he had taken from Jose Quintana Eve came in wearing grey shirt breeches and puttees Clinch gave her the packet What s in it dad she asked smilingly Don t you get nosey girlie Come here She went to him He put his left arm around her You like me some don t you girlie You know it dad All right You re all that matters to me since your mother went and died after a year That was crool girlie Only a year Well I ain t cared none for nobody since only you girlie He touched the packet with his forefinger If I step out that s yours But I ain t a going to step out Put it with the hootch You know how to move that keystone Yes dad And watch out that no game protector and none of that damn millionaire s wardens see you in the woods No nor none o these here fancy State Troopers You gotta watch out this time Eve It means everything to us to you girlie and to me Go tip toe Lay low coming and going Take a rifle Eve ran to her bed room and returned with her Winchester and belt You shoot to kill said Clinch grimly if anyone wants to stop you But lay low and you won t need to shoot nobody girlie G wan out the back way Hal s in the ice house II Slim and straight as a young boy in her grey shirt and breeches Eve continued on lightly through the woods her rifle over her shoulder her eyes of gentian blue always alert The morning turned warm she pulled off her soft felt hat shook out her clipped curls stripped open the shirt at her snowy throat where sweat glimmered like melted frost The forest was lovely in the morning sunlight lovely and still save for the blue jays for the summer birds had gone and only birds destined to a long Northern winter remained Now and then ahead of her she saw a ruffed grouse wandering in the trail These and a single tiny grey bird with a dreary note interminably repeated were the only living things she saw except here and there a summer battered butterfly of the Vanessa tribe flitting in some stray sunbeam The haunting odour of late autumn was in the air delicately acrid the scent of frost killed brake and ripening wild grasses of brilliant dead leaves and black forest loam pungent with mast from beech and oak Eve s tread was light on the moist trail her quick eyes missed nothing not the dainty imprint of deer fresh made nor the sprawling insignia of rambling raccoons nor the big barred owl huddled on a pine limb overhead nor where the swift gravelly reaches of the brook caught sunlight did she miss the swirl and furrowing and milling of painted trout on the spawning beds Once she took cover hearing something stirring but it was only a yearling buck that came out of the witch hazel to stare stamp then wheel and trot away displaying the danger signal In her cartridge pouch she carried the flat sealed packet which Clinch had trusted to her The sack swayed gently as she strode on slapping her left hip at every step and always her subconscious mind remained on guard and aware of it and now and then she dropped her hand to feel of the pouch and strap The character of the forest was now changing as she advanced The first tamaracks appeared slim silvery trunks crowned with the gold of autumn foliage outer sentinels of that vast maze of swamp and stream called Owl Marsh the stronghold and refuge of forest wild things sometimes the sanctuary of hunted men From Star Peak s left flank an icy stream clatters down to the level floor of the woods here and it was here that Eve had meant to quench her thirst with a mouthful of sweet water But as she approached the tiny ford warily she saw a saddled horse tied to a sapling and a man seated on a mossy log The trappings of horse the grey green uniform of the man left no room for speculation a trooper of the State Constabulary was seated there His cap was off his head rested on his palm Elbow on knee he sat there gazing at the water watching the slim fish perhaps darting up stream toward their bridal beds hidden far away at the headwaters A detour was imperative The girl from the shelter of a pine looked out cautiously at the trooper The sudden sight of him had merely checked her now the recognition of his uniform startled her heart out of its tranquil rhythm and set the blood burning in her cheeks There was a memory of such a man seared into the girl s very soul a man whose head and shoulders resembled this man s who had the same bright hair the same slim and powerful body and who moved too as this young man moved The trooper stirred lifted his head to relight his pipe The girl knew him Her heart stood still then heart and blood ran riot and she felt her knees tremble felt weak as she rested against the pine s huge trunk and covered her face with unsteady fingers Until the moment Eve had never dreamed what the memory of this man really meant to her never dreamed that she had capacity for emotion so utterly overwhelming Even now confusion shame fear were paramount All she wanted was to get away get away and still her heart s wild beating control the strange tremor that possessed her recover mind and sense and breath She drew her hand from her eyes and looked upon the man she had attempted to kill upon the young man who had wrestled her off her feet and handcuffed her and who had bathed her bleeding mouth with sphagnum and who had kissed her hands She was trembling so that she became frightened The racket of the brook in his ears safeguarded her in a measure She bent over nearly double her rifle at a trail and cautiously began the detour When at length the wide circle through the woods had been safely accomplished and Eve was moving out through the thickening ranks of tamarack her heart which seemed to suffocate her quieted and she leaned against a shoulder of rock strangely tired After a while she drew from her pocket his handkerchief and looked at it The square of cambric bore his initials J S Blood from her lip remained on it She had not washed out the spots She put it to her lips again mechanically A faint odour of tobacco still clung to it By every law of loyalty pride self respect she should have held this man her enemy Instead she held his handkerchief against her lips crushed it there suddenly closing her eyes while the colour surged and surged through her skin from throat to hair Then wearily she lifted her head and looked out into the grey and empty vista of her life where the dreary years seemed to stretch like milestones away away into an endless waste She put the handkerchief into her pocket shouldered her rifle moved on without looking about her a mistake which only the emotion of the moment could account for in a girl so habituated to caution for she had gone only a few rods before a man s strident voice halted her Halte la Crosse en air Drop that rifle came another voice from behind her You re covered Throw your gun on the ground She stood as though paralysed To the right and left she heard people trampling through the thicket toward her Down with that gun damn you repeated the voice breathless from running All around her men came floundering and crashing toward her through the undergrowth She could see some of them As she stooped to place her rifle on the dead leaves she drew the flat packet from her cartridge sack at the same time and slid it deftly under a rotting log Then calm but very pale she stood upright to face events The first man wore a red and yellow bandanna handkerchief over the lower half of his face pulled tightly across a bony nose He held a long pistol nearly parallel to his own body and when he came up to where she was standing he poked the muzzle into her stomach She did not flinch he said nothing she looked intently into the two ratty eyes fastened on her over the edge of his bandanna Five other men were surrounding her but they all wore white masks of vizard shape revealing chin and mouth They were different otherwise also wearing various sorts and patterns of sport clothes brand new and giving them an odd foreign appearance What troubled her most was the silence they maintained The man wearing the bandanna was the only one who seemed at all a familiar figure merely perhaps because he was American in build clothing and movement He took her by the shoulder turned her around and gave her a shove forward She staggered a step or two he gave her another shove and she comprehended that she was to keep on going Presently she found herself in a steep wet deer trail rising upward through a gully She knew that runway It led up Star Peak Behind her as she climbed she heard the slopping panting tread of men her wind was better than theirs she climbed lithely upward setting a pace which finally resulted in a violent jerk backward a savage wordless admonition to go more slowly As she climbed she wondered whether she should have fired an alarm shot on the chance of the State Trooper Stormont hearing it But she had thought only of the packet at the moment of surprise And now she wondered whether when freed she could ever again find that rotting log Up up always up along the wet gully deep with silt and frost splintered rock she toiled the heavy gasping of men behind her Twice she was jerked to a halt while her escort rested Once without turning she said unsteadily Who are you What have I done to you There was no reply What are you going to do to me she began again and was shaken by the shoulder until silent At last the vast arch of the eastern sky sprang out ahead where stunted spruces stood out against the sunshine and the intense heat of midday fell upon a bare table land of rock and moss and fern As she came out upon the level the man behind her took both her arms and pulled them back and somebody bandaged her eyes Then a hand closed on her left arm and so guided she stumbled and crept forward across the rocks for a few moments until her guide halted her and forced her into a sitting position on a smooth flat boulder She heard the crunching of heavy feet all around her whispering made hoarse by breath exhausted movement across rock and scrub retreating steps For an interminable time she sat there alone in the hot sun drenched to the skin in sweat listening thinking striving to find a reason for this lawless outrage After a long while she heard somebody coming across the rocks stiffened as she listened with some vague presentiment of evil Somebody had halted beside her After a pause she was aware of nimble fingers busy with the bandage over her eyes At first when freed the light blinded her By degrees she was able to distinguish the rocky crest of Star Peak with the tops of tall trees appearing level with the rocks from depths below Then she turned slowly and looked at the man who had seated himself beside her He wore a white mask over a delicate smoothly shaven face His soft hat and sporting clothes were dark grey evidently new And she noticed his hands long elegantly made smooth restless playing with a pencil and some sheets of paper on his knees As she met his brilliant eyes behind the mask his delicate thin lips grew tense in what seemed to be a smile or a soundless sort of laugh Veree happee he said to make the acquaintance Pardon my unceremony miss but onlee necissitee compels Are you perhaps a little rested Yes Ah Then if you permit we proceed with affairs of moment You will be sufficiently kind to write down what I say Yes He placed paper and pencil in Eve s hand Without demurring or hesitation she made ready to write her mind groping wildly for the reason of it all Write he said with his silent laugh which was more like the soundless snarl of a lynx unafraid To Mike Clinch my fathaire from his child Eve I am hostage held by Jose Quintana Pay what you owe him and I go free For each day delay he sends to you one finger which will be severed from my right hand Eve s slender fingers trembled she looked up at the masked man stared steadily into his brilliant eyes Proceed miss if you are so amiable he said softly She wrote on One finger for every day s delay The whole hand at the week s end The other hand then finger by finger Then alas the right foot Eve trembled Proceed he said softly She wrote If you agree you shall pay what you owe to Jose Quintana in this manner you shall place a stick at the edge of the Star Pond where the Star rivulet flows out Upon this stick you shall tie a white rag At the foot of the stick you shall lay the parcel which contains your indebt to Jose Quintana Failing this by to night one finger at sunset The man paused Eve waited dumb under the surging confusion in her brain A sort of incredulous horror benumbed her through which she still heard and perceived Be kind enough to sign it with your name said the man pleasantly Eve signed Then the masked man took the letter got up removed his hat I am Quintana he said I keep my word A thousand thanks and apologies miss I trust that your detention may be brief and not too disagreeable I place at your feet my humble respects He bowed put on his hat and walked quickly away And she saw him descend the rocks to the eastward where the peak slopes When Quintana had disappeared behind the summit scrub and rocks Eve slowly stood up and looked about her at the rocky pulpit so familiar There was only one way out Quintana had gone that way His men no doubt guarded it Otherwise sheer precipices confronted her She walked to the western edge where a sheet of slippery reindeer moss clothed the rock Below the mountain fell away to the valley where she had been made prisoner She looked out over the vast panorama of wilderness and mountain range on range stretching blue to the horizon She looked down into the depths of the valley where deep under the flaming foliage of October somewhere a State Trooper was sitting cheek on hand beside a waterfall or perhaps riding slowly through a forest which she might never gaze upon again There was a noise on the rocks behind her A masked man came out of the spruce scrub laid a blanket on the rocks placed a loaf of bread some cheese and a tin pail full of water upon it motioned her and went away through the dwarf spruces Eve walked slowly to the blanket She drank out of the tin pail Then she set aside the food lay down and buried her quivering face in her arms The sun was half way between zenith and horizon when she heard somebody coming and rose to a sitting posture Her visitor was Quintana He came up to her quite close stood with glittering eyes intent upon her After a moment he handed her a letter She could scarcely unfold it she trembled so Girlie for God s sake give that packet to Quintana and come on home I m near crazy with it all What the hell s anything worth beside you girlie I don t give a damn for nothing only you so come on quick Dad After a little while she lifted her eyes to Quintana So he said quietly you are the little she fox that has learned tricks already What do you mean Where is that packet I haven t it Where is it She shook her head slightly You had a packet he insisted fiercely Look here Regard and he spread out a penciled sheet in Clinch s hand Jose Quintana You win She s got that stuff with her Take your damn junk and let my girl go MIKE CLINCH Well said Quintana a thin strident edge to his tone My father is mistaken I haven t any packet The man s visage behind his mask flushed darkly Without warning or ceremony he caught Eve by the throat and tore open her shirt Then hissing and cursing and panting with his own violence he searched her brutally and without mercy flung her down and tore off her spiral puttees and even her shoes and stockings now apparently beside himself with fury puffing gasping always with a fierce nasal sort of whining undertone like an animal worrying its kill Cowardly beast she panted fighting him with all her strength filthy cowardly beast striking at him wrenching his grasp away snatching at the disordered clothing half stripped from her His hunting knife fell clattering and she fought to get it but he struck her with his open hand knocking her down at his feet and stood glaring at her with every tooth bared So he cried I give you ten minutes make up your mind tell me what you do with that packet He wiped the blood from his face where she had struck him You don t know Jose Quintana No You shall make his acquaintance Yes Eve got up on naked feet quivering from head to foot striving to button the grey shirt at her throat Where he demanded beside himself Her mute lips only tightened Ver well by God he cried I go make me some fire You like it eh We shall put one toe in the fire until it burn off Yes Eh How you like it Eh The girl s trembling hands continued busy with her clothing So he said hoarsely you remain dumb Well then in ten minutes you shall talk He walked toward her pushed her savagely aside and strode on into the spruce thicket The instant he disappeared Eve caught up the knife he had dropped knelt down on the blanket and fell to cutting it into strips The hunting knife was like a razor the feverish business was accomplished in a few moments the pieces knotted the cord strained in a desperate test over her knee And now she ran to the precipice where ten feet below the top of a great pine protruded from the gulf On the edge of the abyss was a spruce root It looked dead wedged deep between two rocks but with all her strength she could not pull it out Sobbing breathless she tied her blanket rope to this threw the other end over the cliff s edge and not giving herself time to think lay flat grasped the knotted line swung off Knot by knot she went down Half way her naked feet brushed the needles She looked over her shoulder behind and down Then teeth clenched she lowered herself steadily as she had learned to do in the school gymnasium down down until her legs came astride of a pine limb It bent swayed gave with her letting her sag to a larger limb below This she clasped letting go her rope Already from the mountain s rocky crest above she heard excited cries Once on her breakneck descent she looked up through the foliage of the pine and she saw far up against the sky a white masked face looking over the edge of the precipice But if it were Quintana or another of his people she could not tell And again looking down she began again the terrible descent An hour later Trooper Stormont of the State Constabulary sat his horse in amazement to see a ragged breathless boyish figure speeding toward him among the tamaracks her naked feet splashing through pool and mire and sphagnum Good heavens he exclaimed as she flung herself against his stirrup sobbing hysterical and clinging to his knee Take me back she stammered take me back to daddy I can t go on another step He leaned down swung her up to his saddle in front holding her cradled in his arms Lie still he said coolly you re all right now For another second he sat looking down at her at the dishevelled hair the gasping mouth at the rags clothing her and at the flat packet clasped convulsively to her breast Then he spoke in a low voice to his horse guiding left with one knee EPISODE FOUR A PRIVATE WAR I When State Trooper Stormont rode up to Clinch s with Eve Strayer lying in his arms Mike Clinch strode out of the motley crowd around the tavern laid his rifle against a tree and stretched forth his powerful hands to receive his stepchild He held her cradled looking down at her in silence as the men clustered around Eve he said hoarsely be you hurted The girl opened her sky blue eyes I m all right dad just tired I ve got your parcel safe To hell with the gol dinged parcel he almost sobbed did Quintana harm you No dad As he carried her to the veranda the packet fell from her cramped fingers Clinch kicked it under a chair and continued on into the house and up the stairs to Eve s bedroom Flat on the bed the girl opened her drowsy eyes again unsmiling Did that dirty louse misuse you demanded Clinch unsteadily G wan tell me girlie He knocked me down He went away to get fire to make me talk I cut up the blanket they gave me and made a rope Then I went over the cliff into the big pine below That was all dad Clinch filled a tin basin and washed the girl s torn feet When he had dried them he kissed them She felt his unshaven lips trembling heard him whimper for the first time in his life Why the hell didn t you give Quintana the packet he demanded What does that count for what does any damn thing count for against you girlie She looked up at him out of heavy lidded eyes You told me to take good care of it It s only a little truck I d laid by for you he retorted unsteadily a few trifles for to make a grand lady of you when the time s ripe Tain t worth a thorn in your little foot to me The hull gol dinged world full o money ain t worth that there stone bruise onto them little white feet o yourn Eve Look at you now my God look at you there all peaked an scairt an bleedin plum tuckered out n all ragged n dirty A blaze of fury flared in his small pale eyes And he hit you too did he that skunk Quintana done that to my little girlie did he I don t know if it was Quintana I don t know who he was dad she murmured drowsily Masked wa n t he Yes Clinch s iron visage twitched and quivered He gnawed his thin lips into control Girlie I gotta go out a spell But I ain t a leavin you alone here I ll git somebody to set up with you You jest lie snug and don t think about nothin till I come back Yes dad she sighed closing her eyes Clinch stood looking at her for a moment then he went downstairs heavily and out to the veranda where State Trooper Stormont still sat his saddle talking to Hal Smith On the porch a sullen crowd of backwoods riff raff lounged in silence awaiting events Clinch called across to Smith Hey Hal g wan up and set with Eve a spell while she s nappin Take a gun Smith said to Stormont in a low voice Do me a favour Jack You bet That girl of Clinch s is in real danger if left here alone But I ve got another job on my hands Can you keep a watch on her till I return Can t you tell me a little more Jim I will later Do you mind helping me out now All right Trooper Stormont swung out of his saddle and led his horse away toward the stable Hal Smith went into the bar where Clinch stood oiling a rifle G wan upstairs he muttered I got a private war on It s me or Quintana now You re going after Quintana inquired Smith carelessly I be And I want you should git your gun and set up by Evie And I want you should kill any living human son of a slut that comes botherin around this here hotel I m going after Quintana with you Mike B gosh you ain t You re a goin to keep watch here No Trooper Stormont has promised to stay with Eve You ll need every man to day Mike This isn t a deer drive Clinch let his rifle sag across the hollow of his left arm Did you beef to that trooper he demanded in his pleasant misleading way Do you think I m crazy retorted Smith Well what the hell They all know that some man used your girl roughly That s all I said to him keep an eye on Eve until we can get back And I tell you Mike if we drive Star Peak we won t be back till long after sundown Clinch growled I ain t never asked no favours of no State Trooper He did you a favour didn t he He brought your daughter in Yes n he d jail us all if he got anything on us Yes and he ll shoot to kill if any of Quintana s people come here and try to break in Clinch grunted peeled off his coat and got into a leather vest bristling with cartridge loops Trooper Stormont came in the back door carrying his rifle Some rough fellow been bothering your little daughter Clinch he inquired The child was nearly all in when she met me out by Owl Marsh clothes half torn off her back bare foot and bleeding She s a plucky youngster I ll say so Clinch If you think the fellow may come here to annoy her I ll keep an eye on her till you return Clinch went up to Stormont put his powerful hands on the young fellow s shoulders After a moment s glaring silence You look clean I guess you be too I wanta tell you I ll cut the guts outa any guy that lays the heft of a single finger onto Eve I d do so too if I were you said Stormont Would ye Well I guess you re a real man too even if you re a State Trooper growled Clinch G wan up She s a nappin If she wakes up you kinda talk pleasant to her You act kind pleasant and cosy She ain t had no ma You tell her to set snug and ca m Then you cook her a egg if she wants it There s pie too I cal late to be back by sundown Nearer morning remarked Smith Stormont shrugged I ll stay until you show up Clinch The latter took another rifle from the corner and handed it to Smith with a loop of ammunition Come on he grunted On the veranda he strode up to the group of sullen armed men who regarded his advent in expressionless silence Sid Hone was there and Harvey Chase and the Hastings boys and Cornelius Blommers You fellas comin inquired Clinch Where drawled Sid Hone Me an Hal Smith is cal kalatin to drive Star Peak It ain t a deer neither There ensued a grim interval Clinch s wintry smile began to glimmer Booze agents or game protectors Which asked Byron Hastings They both look like deer if a man gits mad enough Clinch s smile became terrifying I shell out five hundred dollars for every deer that s dropped on Star Peak to day he said And I hope there won t be no accidents and no mistakin no stranger for a deer he added wagging his great square head Them accidents is liable to happen remarked Hone reflectively After another pause Where s Jake Kloon inquired Smith Nobody seemed to know He was here when Mike called me into the bar insisted Smith Where d he go Then of a sudden Clinch recollected the packet which he had kicked under a veranda chair It was no longer there Any o you fellas seen a package here on the pyazza demanded Clinch harshly Jake Kloon he had somethin drawled Chase I supposed it was his lunch Mebbe twas too In the intense stillness Clinch glared into one face after another Boys he said in his softly modulated voice I kinda guess there s a rat amongst us I wouldn t like for to be that there rat no not for a billion hundred dollars No I wouldn t Becuz that there rat has bit my little girlie Eve like that there deer bit her up onto Star Peak No I wouldn t like for to be that there rat Fer he s a goin to die like a

the pond I kinda disremembered when you asked but I guess I seen them Sure said Sid Hone Now you mention it I seen em too Thinks I to m self they is pickin them blackberries down to the crick Yas I seen em Clinch tossed his rifle across his left shoulder Rats an deer he said pleasantly Them s the articles we re lookin for Only for God s sake be careful you don t mistake a man for em in the woods One or two men laughed On the edge of Owl Marsh Clinch halted in the trail and as his men came up he counted them with a cold eye Here s the runway and this here hazel bush is my station he said You fellas do the barkin You Sid Hone and you Corny start drivin from the west Harve you yelp em from the north by Lynx Brook Jim and Byron you get twenty minutes to go round to the eastward and drive by the Slide And you Hal Smith he looked around where n hell be you Hal Smith came up from the bog s edge Send em out he said in a low voice I ve got Jake s tracks in the bog Clinch motioned his beaters to their duty Twenty minutes he reminded Hone Chase and Blommers before you start drivin And to the Hastings boys If you shoot aim low for their bellies Don t leave no blood around Scrape it up We bury what we get He and Smith stood looking after the five slouching figures moving away toward their blind trails When all had disappeared Show me Jake s mark he said calmly Smith led him to the edge of the bog knelt down drew aside a branch of witch hopple A man s footprint was plainly visible on the mud That s Jake said Clinch slowly I know them half soled boots o hisn He lifted another branch There s another man s track The other is probably Leverett s Likely He s got thin feet I think I d better go after them said Smith reflectively They ll plug you you poor jackass two o them like that and one a settin up to watch out Hell Be you tired o bed an board Smith smiled Don t you worry Mike Why You think you re that smart Jest becuz you stuck up a tourist you think you re cock o the North Woods with them two foxes lyin out for to snap you up Hey Why you poor dumb thing Jake runs Canadian hootch for a livin and Leverett s a trap thief What could you do with a pair o foxes like that Catch em said Smith coolly You mind your business Mike As he shouldered his rifle and started into the marsh Clinch dropped a heavy hand on his shoulder but the young man shook it off Shut up he said sharply You ve a private war on your hands So have I I ll take care of my own What s your grievance demanded Clinch surprised Jake Kloon played a dirty trick on me When was that Not very long ago I hadn t heard said Clinch Well you hear it now don t you All right All right I m going after him As he started again across the marsh Clinch called out in a guarded voice Take good care of that packet if you catch them rats It belongs to Eve I ll take such good care of it replied Smith that its proper owner need not worry II The proper owner of the packet was at that moment on the Atlantic Ocean travelling toward the United States Four other pretended owners of the Grand Duchess Theodorica s jewels totally unconscious of anything impending which might impair their several titles to the gems were now gathered together in a wilderness within a few miles of one another Jose Quintana lay somewhere in the forests with his gang fiercely planning the recovery of the treasure of which Clinch had once robbed him Clinch squatted on his runway watching the mountain flank with murderous eyes It was no longer the Flaming Jewel which mattered His master passion ruled him now Those who had offered violence to Eve must be reckoned with first of all The hand that struck Eve Strayer had offered mortal insult to Mike Clinch As for the third pretender to the Flaming Jewel Jake Kloon he was now travelling in a fox s circle toward Drowned Valley that shaggy wilderness of slime and tamarack and depthless bog which touches the northwest base of Star Peak He was not hurrying having no thought of pursuit Behind him plodded Leverett the trap thief very very busy with his own ideas To Leverett s repeated requests that Kloon halt and open the packet to see what it contained Kloon gruffly refused What do we care what s in it he said We get ten thousand apiece over our rifles for it from them guys Ain t it a good enough job for you Maybe we make more if we take what s inside it for ourselves argued Leverett Let s take a peek anyway Naw I don t want no peek nor nothin The ten thousand comes too easy More might scare us Let that guy Quintana have what s his n All I ask is my rake off You allus was a dirty thieving mink Earl Let s give him his and take ours and git I m going to Albany to live You bet I don t stay in no woods where Mike Clinch dens They plodded on arguing toward their rendezvous with Quintana s outpost on the edge of Drowned Valley The fourth pretender to the pearls rubies and great gem called the Flaming Jewel stolen from the young Grand Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia by Jose Quintana was an unconscious pretender entirely innocent of the role assigned her by Clinch For Eve Strayer had never heard where the packet came from or what it contained All she knew was that her stepfather had told her that it belonged to her And the knowledge left her incurious III Eve slept the sleep of mental and physical exhaustion Reaction from fear brings a fatigue more profound than that which follows physical overstrain But the healthy mind like the healthy body disposes very thoroughly of toxics which arise from terror and exhaustion The girl slept profoundly calmly Her bruised young mind and body left her undisturbed There was neither restlessness nor fever Sleep swept her with its clean sweet tide cleansing the superb youth and health of her with the most wonderful balm in the Divine pharmacy She awoke late in the afternoon opened her flower blue eyes and saw State Trooper Stormont sitting by the window and gazing out Perhaps Eve s confused senses mistook the young man for a vision for she lay very still nor stirred even her little finger After a while Stormont glanced around at her A warm delicate colour stained her skin slowly evenly from throat to hair He got up and came over to the bed How do you feel he asked awkwardly Where is dad she managed to inquire in a steady voice He won t be back till late He asked me to stick around in case you needed anything The girl s clear eyes searched his Trooper Stormont Yes Eve Dad s gone after Quintana Is he the fellow who misused you I think so Who is he I don t know Is he your enemy or your stepfather s But the girl shook her head I can t discuss dad s affairs with with With a State Trooper smiled Stormont That s all right Eve You don t have to There was a pause Stormont stood beside the bed looking down at her with his diffident boyish smile And the girl gazed back straight into his eyes eyes she had so often looked into in her dreams I m to cook you an egg and bring you some pie he remarked still smiling Did dad say I am to stay in bed That was my inference Do you feel very lame and sore My feet burn You poor kid Would you let me look at them I have a first aid packet with me After a moment she nodded and turned her face on the pillow He drew aside the cover a little knelt down beside the bed Then he rose and went downstairs to the kitchen There was hot water in the kettle He fetched it back bathed her feet drew out from cut and scratch the flakes of granite grit and brier points that still remained there From his first aid packet he took a capsule dissolved it sterilized the torn skin then bandaged both feet with a deliciously cool salve and drew the sheets into place Eve had not stirred nor spoken He washed and dried his hands and came back drawing his chair nearer to the bedside Sleep if you feel like it he said pleasantly As she made no sound or movement he bent over to see if she had already fallen asleep And noticed that her flushed cheeks were wet with tears Are you suffering he asked gently No You are so wonderfully kind Why shouldn t I be kind he said amused and touched by the girl s emotion I tried to shoot you once That is why you ought to hate me He began to laugh Is that what you re thinking about I never can forget Nonsense We re quits anyway Do you remember what I did to you He was thinking of the handcuffs Then in her vivid blush he read what she was thinking And he remembered his lips on her palms He too now was blushing brilliantly at memory of that swift sudden rush of romantic tenderness which this girl had witnessed that memorable day on Owl Marsh In the hot uncomfortable silence neither spoke He seated himself after a while And after a while she turned on her pillow part way toward him Somehow they both understood that it was friendship which had subtly filled the interval that separated them since that amazing day I ve often thought of you he said as though they had been discussing his absence No hour of the waking day that she had not thought of him But she did not say so now After a little while Is yours a lonely life she asked in a low voice Sometimes But I love the forest Sometimes she said the forest seems like a trap that I can t escape Sometimes I hate it Are you lonely Eve As you are You see I know what the outside world is I miss it You were in boarding school and college Yes It must be hard for you here at Star Pond The girl sighed unconsciously There are days when I can scarcely stand it The wilderness would be more endurable if dad and I were all alone But even then You need young people of your own age educated companions I need the city mister Stormont I need all it can give I m starving for it That s all She turned on her pillow and he saw that she was smiling faintly Her face bore no trace of the tragic truth she had uttered But the tragedy was plain enough to him even without her passionless words of revolt The situation of this young educated girl aglow with youth fettered body and mind to the squalor of Clinch s dump was perfectly plain to anybody She said seeing his troubled expression I m sorry I spoke that way I knew how you must feel anyway It seems ungrateful she murmured I love my step father You ve proven that he remarked with a dry humour that brought the hot flush to her face again I must have been crazy that day she said It scares me to remember what I tried to do What a frightful thing if I had killed you How can you forgive me How can you forgive me Eve She turned her head I do Entirely Yes He said a slight emotion noticeable in his voice Well I forgave you before the darned gun exploded in our hands How could you she protested I was thinking all the while that you were acting as I d have acted if anything threatened my father Were you thinking of that Yes and also how to get hold of you before you shot me He began to laugh After a moment she turned her head to look at him and her smile glimmered responsive to his amusement But she shivered slightly too How about that egg he inquired I can get up Better keep off your feet What is there in the pantry You must be starved I could eat a little before supper time she admitted I forgot to take my lunch with me this morning It is still there in the pantry on the bread box wrapped up in brown paper just as I left it She half rose in bed supported on one arm her curly brown gold hair framing her face Two cakes of sugar milk chocolate in a flat brown packet tied with a string she explained smiling at his amusement So he went down to the pantry and discovered the parcel on the bread box where she had left it that morning before starting for the cache on Owl Marsh He brought it to her placed both pillows upright behind her stepped back gaily to admire the effect Eve with her parcel in her hands laughed shyly at his comedy Begin on your chocolate he said I m going back to fix you some bread and butter and a cup of tea When again he had disappeared the girl still smiling began to untie her packet unhurriedly slowly loosening string and wrapping Her attention was not fixed on what her slender fingers were about She drew from the parcel a flat morocco case with a coat of arms and crest stamped on it in gold black and scarlet For a few moments she stared at the object stupidly The next moment she heard Stormont s spurred tread on the stairs and she thrust the morocco case and the wrapping under the pillows behind her She looked up at him in a dazed way when he came in with the tea and bread He set the tin tray on her bureau and came over to the bedside Eve he said you look very white and ill Have you been hurt somewhere and haven t you admitted it She seemed unable to speak and he took both her hands and looked anxiously into the lovely pallid features After a moment she turned her head and buried her face in the pillow trembling now in overwhelming realization of what she had endured for the sake of two cakes of sugar milk chocolate hidden under a bush in the forest For a long while the girl lay there the feverish flush of tears on her partly hidden face her nervous hands tremulous restless now seeking his convulsively now striving to escape his clasp eloquent uncertain little hands that seemed to tell so much and yet were telling him nothing he could understand Eve dear he said are you in pain What is it that has happened to you I thought you were all right You seemed all right I am she said in a smothered voice You ll stay here with me won t you Of course I will It s just the reaction It s all over You re relaxing That s all dear You re safe Nothing can harm you now Please don t leave me After a moment I won t leave you I wish I might never leave you In the tense silence that followed her trembling ceased Then his heart heavy irregular began beating so that the startled pulses in her body awoke wildly responsive Deep emotions new unfamiliar were stirring awaking confusing them both In a sudden instinct to escape she turned and partly rose on one elbow gazing blindly about her out of tear marred eyes I want my room to myself she murmured in a breathless sort of way I want you to go out please A boyish flush burnt his face He got up slowly took his rifle from the corner went out closing the door and seated himself on the stairs And there on guard sat Trooper Stormont rigid unstirring hour after hour facing the first great passion of his life and stunned by the impact of its swift and unexpected blow In her chamber on the bed s edge sat Eve Strayer her deep eyes fixed on space Vague emotions exquisitely recurrent new born possessed her The whole world too all around her seemed to have become misty and golden and all pulsating with a faint still rhythm that indefinably thrilled her pulses to response Passion full armed springs flaming from the heart of man Woman is slow to burn And it was the delicate phantom of passion that Eve gazed upon there in her unpainted chamber her sun tanned fingers linked listlessly in her lap her little feet like bruised white flowers drooping above the floor Hour after hour she sat there dreaming staring at the tinted ghost of Eros rose hued near smiling unreal impalpable as the dusty sunbeam that slanted from her window gilding the boarded floor Three spectres gliding near paused to gaze at State Trooper Stormont on guard by the stairs Then they looked at the closed door of Eve s chamber Then the three spectres Fate Chance and Destiny whispering together passed on toward the depths of the sunset forest EPISODE FIVE

2309-167347-0006	train-other-500	as he slunk from the bagged trout brook or crawled away belly dragging and pockets full of snared grouse
none	none	 Always he had dreamed of the day when through some sudden bold and savage stroke he could deliver himself from a life of fear and live in a city grossly replete with the pleasures of satiation never again to see a tree or a lonely lake or the blue peaks 
2309-167347-0007	train-other-500	which always he had hated because they seemed to spy on him from their sky blue heights
none	none	 They were spying on him now as he moved lightly furtively at Jake Kloon s heels meditating once more that swift bold stroke which forever would free him from all care and fear He looked at the back of Kloon s massive head One shot would blow that skull into fragments he thought shivering 
2309-167347-0008	train-other-500	One shot from behind and twenty thousand dollars or if it proved a better deal the contents of the packet For if Quintana s bribery had dazzled them
none	none	 what effect might the contents of that secret packet have if revealed 
2309-167347-0009	train-other-500	Always in his mean and busy brain he was trying to figure to himself what that packet must contain And to make the bribe worth while Leverett had concluded that only a solid packet of thousand dollar bills could account for the twenty thousand offered
2309-167347-0010	train-other-500	There might easily be half a million in bills pressed together in that heavy flat packet Bills were absolutely safe plunder But Kloon had turned a deaf ear to his suggestions Kloon who never entertained ambitions beyond his hootch rake off
2309-167347-0011	train-other-500	whose miserable imagination stopped at a wretched percentage satisfied One shot There was the back of Kloon s bushy head One shot and fear which had shadowed him from birth was at an end forever
2309-167347-0012	train-other-500	Ended too privation the bitter rigour of black winters scorching days bodily squalor ills that such as he endured
none	none	 in a wilderness where like other creatures of the wild men stricken died or recovered by chance alone 
2309-167347-0013	train-other-500	A single shot would settle all problems for him But if he missed
none	none	 At the mere idea he trembled as he trotted on trying to tell himself that he couldn t miss 
2309-167347-0014	train-other-500	No use always the coward s if blocked him and the coward s rage fiercest of all fury ravaged him almost crazing him with his own impotence Tamaracks sphagnum crimson pitcher plants grew thicker
none	none	 wet woods set with little black pools stretched away on every side It was still nearly a mile from Drowned Valley when Jake Kloon halted in his tracks and seated himself on a narrow ridge of hard ground And Leverett came lightly up and after nosing the whole vicinity sat down cautiously where Kloon would have to turn partly around to look at him Where the hell do we meet up with Quintana growled Kloon tearing a mouthful from a gnawed tobacco plug and shoving the remainder deep into his trousers pocket 
2309-167347-0015	train-other-500	We gotta travel a piece yet Say Jake be you a man or be you a poor dumb critter what ain t got no spunk
none	none	 Kloon chewing on his cud turned and glanced at him Then he spat as answer If you got the spunk of a chipmunk you and me ll take a peek at that there packet 
2309-167347-0016	train-other-500	I bet you it s thousand dollar bills more n a billion million dollars likely Kloon s dogged silence continued Leverett licked his dry lips His rifle lay on his knees Almost imperceptibly he moved it moved it again
2309-167347-0017	train-other-500	froze stiff as Kloon spat then by infinitesimal degrees continued to edge the muzzle toward Kloon Jake Aw shut your head grumbled Kloon disdainfully You allus was a dirty rat
none	none	 you sneakin trap robber Enough s enough I ain t got no use for no billion million dollar bills Ten thousand ll buy me all I cal late to need till I m planted But you re like a hawg you ain t never had enough o nothin and you won t never git enough neither not if you wuz God a mighty you wouldn t Ten thousand dollars hain t nothin to a billion million Jake Kloon squirted a stream of tobacco at a pitcher plant and filled the cup Diverted and gratified by the accuracy of his aim he took other shots at intervals Leverett moved the muzzle of his rifle a hair s width to the left shivered moved it again Under his soggy sun tanned skin a pallor made his visage sickly grey 
2309-167347-0018	train-other-500	Jake No answer Say Jake No notice Jake I wanta take a peek at them bills Merely another stream of tobacco soiling the crimson pitcher I m I m desprit I gotta take a peek
none	none	 I gotta gotta 
2309-167347-0019	train-other-500	Something in Leverett s unsteady voice made Kloon turn his head You gol rammed fool he said
none	none	 what you doin with your The loud detonation of the rifle punctuated Kloon s inquiry with a final period The big soft nosed bullet struck him full in the face spilling his brains and part of his skull down his back and knocking him flat as though he had been clubbed Leverett stunned sat staring motionless clutching the rifle from the muzzle of which a delicate stain of vapour floated and disappeared through a rosy bar of sunshine 
2309-167347-0020	train-other-500	In the intense stillness of the place suddenly the dead man made a sound and the trap robber nearly fainted But it was only air escaping from the slowly collapsing lungs and Leverett
none	none	 ashy pale shaking got to his feet and leaned heavily against an oak tree 
2309-167347-0021	train-other-500	his eyes never stirring from the sprawling thing on the ground
none	none	 If it were a minute or a year he stood there he could never have reckoned the space of time 
2309-167347-0022	train-other-500	The sun s level rays glimmered ruddy through the woods A green fly appeared buzzing about the dead man Another zig zagged through the sunshine lacing it with streaks of greenish fire Others appeared whirling gyrating filling the silence with their humming
2309-167347-0023	train-other-500	And still Leverett dared not budge dared not search the dead and take from it that for which the dead had died A little breeze came by and stirred the bushy hair on Kloon s head and fluttered the ferns around him where he lay
2309-167347-0024	train-other-500	Two delicate pure white butterflies rare survivors of a native species driven from civilization into the wilderness by the advent of the foreign white fluttered in airy play over the dead man
none	none	 drifting away into the woodland at times yet always returning to wage a fairy combat above the heap of soiled clothing which once had been a man Then near in the ferns the withering fronds twitched and a red squirrel sprung his startling alarm 
2309-167347-0025	train-other-500	squeaking squealing chattering his opinion of murder and Leverett shaking with the shock
none	none	 wiped icy sweat from his face laid aside his rifle and took his first stiff step toward the dead man 
2309-167347-0026	train-other-500	But as he bent over he changed his mind turned
none	none	 reeling a little then crept slowly out among the pitcher plants 
2309-167347-0027	train-other-500	searching about him as though sniffing In a few minutes he discovered what he was looking for took his bearings carefully picked his way back over a leafy crust that trembled under his cautious tread He bent over Kloon
2309-167347-0028	train-other-500	and from the left inside coat pocket he drew the packet and placed it inside his own flannel shirt Then turning his back to the dead he squatted down and clutched Kloon s burly ankles as a man grasps the handles of a wheelbarrow to draw it after him
2309-167347-0029	train-other-500	Dragging rolling bumping over roots Jake Kloon took his last trail through the wilderness leaving a redder path than was left by the setting sun through fern and moss and wastes of pitcher plants
2309-167347-0030	train-other-500	Always as Leverett crept on pulling the dead behind him the floor of the woods trembled slightly and a black ooze wet the crust of withered leaves At the quaking edge of a little pool of water Leverett halted
2309-167347-0031	train-other-500	The water was dark but scarcely an inch deep over its black bed of silt Beside this sink hole the trap
none	none	 thief dropped Kloon Then he drew his hunting knife and cut a tall slim swamp maple 
2309-167347-0032	train-other-500	The sapling was about twenty feet in height Leverett thrust the butt of it into the pool Without any effort he pushed the entire sapling out of sight in the depthless silt He had to manoeuvre very gingerly to dump Kloon into the pool and keep out of it himself
none	none	 Finally he managed it To his alarm Kloon did not sink far He cut another sapling and pushed the body until only the shoes were visible above the silt These however were very slowly sinking now Bubbles rose 
2309-167347-0033	train-other-500	dully iridescent floated broke Strings of blood hung suspended in the clouding water Leverett went back to the little ridge and covered
none	none	 with dead leaves the spot where Kloon had lain There were broken ferns but he could not straighten them And there lay Kloon s rifle For a while he hesitated his habits of economy being ingrained but he remembered the packet in his shirt and he carried the rifle to the little pool and shoved it muzzle first driving it downward out of sight As he rose from the pool s edge somebody laid a hand on his shoulder That was the most real death that Leverett ever had died II A coward dies many times before Old Man Death really gets him 
2309-167347-0035	train-other-500	The swimming minutes passed his mind ceased to live for a space Then as through the swirling waters of the last dark whirlpool a dulled roar of returning consciousness filled his being Somebody was shaking him shouting at him
none	none	 Suddenly instinct resumed its function and he struggled madly to get away from the edge of the sink hole 
2309-167347-0036	train-other-500	fought his way blindly through tangled undergrowth toward the hard ridge No human power could have blocked the frantic creature thrashing toward solid ground But there Quintana held him in his wiry grip Fool Mule Crazee fellow
none	none	 What you do eh 
2309-167347-0037	train-other-500	For why you make jumps like rabbits Eh You expec Quintana Yes Alors
none	none	 Leverett in a state of collapse sagged back against an oak tree Quintana s nervous grasp fell from his arms and they swung dangling 
2309-167347-0038	train-other-500	What you do by that pond hole Eh I come and touch you and my God one would think I have stab you Such an ass
none	none	 The sickly greenish hue changed in Leverett s face as the warmer tide stirred from its stagnation He lifted his head and tried to look at Quintana Where Jake Kloon demanded the latter At that the weasel wits of the trap robber awoke to the instant crisis Blood and pulse began to jump He passed one dirty hand over his mouth to mask any twitching Where my packet eh inquired Quintana Jake s got it Leverett s voice was growing stronger His small eyes switched for an instant toward his rifle where it stood against a tree behind Quintana Where is he then this Jake repeated Quintana impatiently He got bogged Bogged What is that then He got into a sink hole What That s all I know said Leverett sullenly Him and me was travellin hell bent to meet up with you Jake he was for a short cut to Drowned Valley but no sez I gimme a good hard ridge an a long deetoor when there s sink holes into the woods What is it the talk you talk to me asked Quintana whose perplexed features began to darken Where is it my packet I m tellin you ain t I retorted the other raising a voice now shrill with the strain of this new crisis rushing so unexpectedly upon him I heard Jake give a holler What the hell s the trouble I yells Then he lets out a beller Save me he screeches I m into a sink hole The quicksand s got me sez he So I drop my rifle I did there she stands against that birch sapling and I run down into them there pitcher plants Whar be ye I yells Then I listens and don t hear nothin only a kina wallerin noise an a slobber like he was gulpin mud Then I foller them there sounds and I come out by that sink hole The water was a shakin all over it but Jake he had went down plum out o sight T want no use I cut a sapling an I poked down I was sick and scared like so when you come up over the moss not makin no noise an grabbed me God I guess you d jump too Quintana s dark tense face was expressionless when Leverett ventured to look at him Like most liars he realised the advisability of looking his victim straight in the eyes This he managed to accomplish sustaining the cold intensity of Quintana s gaze as long as he deemed it necessary Then he started toward his rifle Quintana blocked his way Where my packet Gol ram it Ain t I told you Jake had it in his pocket My packet Yaas yourn My packet it is down in thee sink ole You think I m lyin blustered Leverett trying to move around Quintana s extended arm The arm swerved and clutched him by the collar of his flannel shirt Wait my frien said Quintana in a soft voice You shall explain to me some things before you go Explain what you gol dinged Quintana shook him into speechlessness Listen my frien he continued with a terrifying smile I mus ask you what it was that gun shot which I hear while I await at Drown Vallee Eh Who fire a gun I ain t heard no gun replied Leverett in a strangled voice You did not shoot No No damn it all And Jake He did not fire No I tell yeh Ah Someone lies It is not me my frien No Let us examine your rifle Leverett made a rush for the gun Quintana slung him back against the oak tree and thrust an automatic pistol against his chin Han s up my frien he said gently up high up or someone will fire another shot you shall never hear So Now I search the other pocket So Still no packet Bah Not in the pants either Ah bah But wait Tiens What is this you hide inside your shirt I was jokin gasped Leverett I was jest a goin to give it to you Is that my packet Yes It was all in fun I wan t a going to steal it Quintana unbuttoned the grey wool shirt thrust in his hand and drew forth the packet for which Jake Kloon had died within the hour Suddenly Leverett s knees gave way and he dropped to the ground grovelling at Quintana s feet in an agony of fright Don t hurt me he screamed I didn t meant no harm Jake he wanted me to steal it I told him I was honest I fired a shot to scare him an he tuk an run off I wan t a goin to steal it off you so help me God I was lookin for you as God is my witness He got Quintana by one foot Quintana kicked him aside and backed away Swine he said calmly inspecting the whimpering creature who had started to crawl toward him He hesitated lifted his automatic then as though annoyed by Leverett s deafening shriek shrugged hesitated pocketed both pistol and packet and turned on his heel By the birch sapling he paused and picked up Leverett s rifle Something left a red smear on his palm as he worked the ejector It was blood Quintana gazed curiously at his soiled hand Then he stooped and picked up the empty cartridge case which had been ejected And as he stooped he noticed more blood on a fallen leaf With one foot daintily as a game cock scratches he brushed away the fallen leaves revealing the mess underneath After he had contemplated the crimson traces of murder for a few moments he turned and looked at Leverett with faint curiosity So he said in his leisurely emotionless way you have fight with my frien Jake for thee packet Yes Ver amusing He shrugged his indifference tossed the rifle to his shoulder and without another glance at the cringing creature on the ground walked away toward Drowned Valley unhurriedly III When Quintana disappeared among the tamaracks Leverett ventured to rise to his knees As he crouched there peering after Quintana a man came swiftly out of the forest behind him and nearly stumbled over him Recognition was instant and mutual as the man jerked the trap robber to his feet stifling the muffled yell in his throat I want that packet you picked up on Clinch s veranda said Hal Smith M my God stammered Leverett Quintana just took it off me He ain t been gone a minute You lie I ain t lyin Look at his foot marks there in the mud Quintana Yaas Quintana He tuk my gun too Which way whispered Smith fiercely shaking Leverett till his jaws wagged Drowned Valley Lemme loose I m chokin Smith pushed him aside You rat he said if you re lying to me I ll come back and settle your affair And Kloon s too Quintana shot Jake and stuck him into a sink hole snivelled Leverett breaking down and sobbing oh Gawd Gawd he s down under all that black mud with his brains spillin out But Smith was already gone running lightly along the string of footprints which led straight away across slime and sphagnum toward the head of Drowned Valley In the first clump of hard wood trees Smith saw Quintana He had halted and he was fumbling at the twine which bound a flat paper wrapped packet He did not start when Smith s sharp warning struck his ear Don t move I ve got you over my rifle Quintana Quintana s fingers had instantly ceased operations Then warily he lifted his head and looked into the muzzle of Smith s rifle Ah bah he said tranquilly There were three of you then Lay that packet on the ground My frien Drop it or I ll drop you Quintana carefully placed the packet on a bed of vivid moss Now your gun continued Smith Quintana shrugged and laid Leverett s rifle beside the packet Kneel down with your hands up and your back toward me said Smith My frien Down with you Quintana dropped gracefully into the humiliating attitude popularly indicative of prayerful supplication Smith walked slowly up behind him relieved him of two automatics and a dirk Stay put he said sharply as Quintana started to turn his head Then he picked up the packet with its loosened string slipped it into his side pocket gathered together the arsenal which had decorated Quintana and so loaded with weapons walked away a few paces and seated himself on a fallen log Here he pocketed both automatics shoved the sheathed dirk into his belt placed the captured rifle handy after examining the magazine and laid his own weapon across his knees You may turn around now Quintana he said amiably Quintana lowered his arms and started to rise Sit down said Smith Quintana seated himself on the moss facing Smith Now my gay and nimble thimble rigger said Smith genially while I take ten minutes rest we ll have a little polite conversation Or rather a monologue Because I don t want to hear anything from you He settled himself comfortably on the log Let me assemble for you Senor Quintana the interesting history of the jewels which so sparklingly repose in the packet in my pocket In the first place as you know Monsieur Quintana the famous Flaming Jewel and the other gems contained in this packet of mine belonged to Her Highness the Grand Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia Very interesting More interesting still along comes Don Jose Quintana and his celebrated gang of international thieves and steals from the Grand Duchess of Esthonia the Flaming Jewel and all her rubies emeralds and diamonds Yes Certainly said Quintana with a polite inclination of acknowledgment Bon Well then still more interesting to relate a gentleman named Clinch helps himself to these famous jewels How very careless of you mister Quintana Careless certainly assented Quintana politely Well said Smith laughing Clinch was more careless still The robber baron Sir Jacobus Kloon swiped as Froissart has it the Esthonian gems and under agreement to deliver them to you I suppose thought better of it and attempted to abscond Do you get me Herr Quintana Gewiss Yes and you got Jake Kloon I hear laughed Smith No Didn t you kill Kloon No Oh pardon The mistake was natural You merely robbed Kloon and Leverett You should have killed them Yes said Quintana slowly I should have It was my mistake Signor Quintana it is human for the human crook to err Sooner or later he always does it And then the Piper comes around holding out two itching palms mister Smith said Quintana pleasantly you are an unusually agreeable gentleman for a thief I regret that you do not see your way to an amalgamation of interests with myself As you say Quintana mea I am somewhat unusual For example what do you suppose I am going to do with this packet in my pocket Live replied Quintana tersely Live certainly laughed Smith but not on the proceeds of this coup de main Non pas I am going to return this packet to its rightful owner the Grand Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia And what do you think of that Quintana Quintana smiled You do not believe me inquired Smith Quintana smiled again Allons bon exclaimed Smith rising It s the unusual that happens in life my dear Quintana And now we ll take a little inventory of these marvellous gems before we part Sit very very still Quintana unless you want to lie stiller still I ll let you take a modest peep at the Flaming Jewel busily unwrapping the packet just one little peep Quintana He unwrapped the paper Two cakes of sugar milk chocolate lay within Quintana turned white then deeply heavily red Then he smiled in ghastly fashion Yes he said hoarsely as you have just said sir it is usually the unusual which happens in the world EPISODE SIX THE JEWEL AFLAME I Mike Clinch and his men drove Star Peak and drew a blanket covert There was a new shanty atop camp debris plenty of signs of recent occupation everywhere hot embers in which offal still smouldered bottles odorous of claret dregs and an aluminum culinary outfit unwashed as though Quintana and his men had departed in haste Far in the still valley below Mike Clinch squatted beside the runway he had chosen a cocked rifle across his knees The glare in his small pale eyes waned and flared as distant sounds broke the forest silence grew vague died out the fairy clatter of a falling leaf the sudden scurry of a squirrel a feathery rustle of swift wings in play or combat the soft crash of a rotten bough sagging earthward to enrich the soil that grew it And as Clinch squatted there murderously intent ever the fixed obsession burned in his fever brain stirring his thin lips to incessant muttering a sort of soundless invocation part chronicle part prayer O God A mighty in your big swell mansion up there all has went contrary with me sence you let that there damn millionaire Harrod come into this here forest He went and built unto hisself an habitation and he put up a wall of law all around me where I was earnin a lawful livin in Thy nice clean wilderness And now comes this here Quintana and robs my girlie I promised her mother I d make a lady of her little Eve I loved my wife O Lord Once she showed me a piece in the Bible I ain t never found it sence but it said And the woman she fled into the wilderness where there was a place prepared for her of God That s what you wrote into your own Bible O God You can t go back on it I seen it And now I wanta to ask What place did you prepare for my Eve What spot have you reference to You didn t mean my Dump did you Why Lord that ain t no place for no lady And now Quintana has went and robbed me of what I d saved up for Eve Does that go with Thee O Lord No it don t And it don t go with me neither I m a goin to git Quintana Then I m a goin to git them two minks that robbed my girlie I am Jake Kloon he done it in cahoots with Earl Leverett and Quintana set em on And they gotta die O Lord of Israel them there Egyptians is about to hop the twig I ain t aimin to be mean to nobody I buy hootch of them that runs it I eat mountain mutton in season and out I trade with law breakers I do But Lord I gotta get my girlie outa here and Harrod he walled me in with the chariots and spears of Egypt till I nigh went wild And now comes Quintana and here I be a lyin out to get him so s my girlie can become a lady same s them fine folks with all their butlers and automobiles and what not A far crash in the forest stilled his twitching lips and stiffened every iron muscle As he lifted his rifle Sid Hone came into the glade Yahoo Yahoo he called Where be you Mike Clinch slowly rose grasping his rifle his small grey eyes ablaze Where s Quintana he demanded H ain t you seen nobody No In the intense silence other sounds broke sharply in the sunset forest Harvey Chase s halloo rang out from the rocks above Blommers and the Hastings boys came slouching through the ferns Byron Hastings greeted Clinch with upflung gun Me and Jim heard a shot away out on Drowned Valley he announced Was you out that way Mike No One by one the men who had driven Star Peak lounged up in the red sunset light gathering around Clinch and wiping the sweat from sun reddened faces Someone s in Drowned Valley repeated Byron Them minks slid off n Star in a hurry I reckon judgin how they left their shanty Phew It stunk They had French hootch too Mebby Leverett and Kloon told em we was fixin to visit them suggested Blommers They didn t know said Clinch Where s Hal Smith inquired Hone Clinch made no reply Blommers silently gnawed a new quid from the remains of a sticky plug Well inquired Jim Hastings finally do we quit Mike or do we still hunt in Drowned Valley Not me at night remarked Blommers drily Not amongst them sink holes added Hone Suddenly Clinch turned and stared at him Then the deadly light from his little eyes shone on the others one by one Boys he said I gotta get Quintana I can t never sleep another wink till I get that man Come on Act up like gents all Let s go Nobody stirred Come on repeated Clinch softly But his lips shrank back twitching As they looked at him they saw his teeth All right all right growled Hone shouldering his rifle with a jerk The Hastings boys young and rash shuffled into the trail Blommers hesitated glanced askance at Clinch and instantly made up his mind to take a chance with the sink holes rather than with Clinch God A mighty Mike what be you aimin to do faltered Harvey I m aimin to stop the inlet and outlet to Drowned Valley Harve replied Clinch in his pleasant voice God is a goin to deliver Quintana into my hands All right What next Then continued Clinch I cal late to set down and wait How long Ask God boys I don t know All I know is that whatever is livin in Drowned Valley at this hour has gotta live and die there For it can t never live to come outen that there morass walkin onto two legs like a real man He moved slowly along the file of sullen men his rifle a trail in one huge fist Boys he said I got first There ain t no sink hole deep enough to drowned me while Eve needs me And my little girlie needs me bad After she gits what s her n then I don t care no more He looked up into the sky where the last ashes of sunset faded from the zenith Then I don t care he murmured Like s not I ll creep away like some shot up critter n kinda find some lone safe spot n kinda fix me f r a long nap I guess that ll be the way when Eve s a lady down to Noo York r som ers he added vaguely Then still looking up at the fading heavens he moved forward head lifted silent unhurried with the soundless stealthy and certain tread of those who walk unseeing and asleep II Clinch had not taken a dozen strides before Hal Smith loomed up ahead in the rosy dusk driving in Leverett before him An exclamation of fierce exultation burst from Clinch s thin lips as he flung out one arm indicating Smith and his clinking prisoner Who was that gol dinged catamount that suspicioned Hal I wa nt worried none neither Hal s a gent Mebbe he sticks up folks too but he s a gent And gents is honest or they ain t gents Smith came up at his easy tireless gait hustling Leverett along with prods from gun butt or muzzle as came handiest The prisoner turned a ghastly visage on Clinch who ignored him Got my packet Hal he demanded Smith poked Leverett with his rifle Tune up he said tell Clinch your story As a caged rat looks death in the face his ratty wits working like lightning and every atom of cunning and ferocity alert for attack or escape so the little mean eyes of Earl Leverett became fixed on Clinch like two immobile and glassy beads of jet G wan said Clinch softly spit it out Jake done it muttered Leverett thickly Done what Stole that there packet o yourn whatever there was into it Who put him up to it A fella called Quintana What was there in it for Jake inquired Clinch pleasantly Ten thousand How about you I told em I wouldn t touch it Then they pulled their guns on me and I was scared to squeal So that was the way asked Clinch in his even reassuring voice Leverett s eyes travelled stealthily around the circle of men then reverted to Clinch I dassn t touch it he said but I dassn t squeal I was huntin onto Drowned Valley when Jake meets up with me I got the packet he sez and I m a going to double criss cross Quintana I am and beat it Don t you wish you was whacks with me No sez I honesty is my policy no matter what they tell about me S help me God I ain t never robbed no trap and I ain t no skin thief whatever lies folks tell All I ever done was run a little hootch same s everybody He licked his lips furtively his cold bright eyes fastened on Clinch G wan Earl nodded the latter heave her up That s all I sez Good bye Jake An if you heed my warnin ill gotten gains ain t a going to prosper nobody That s what I said to Jake Kloon the last solemn words I spoke to that there man now in his bloody grave Hey demanded Clinch That s where Jake is repeated Leverett Why so help me I wa nt gone ten yards when bang goes a gun and I see this here Quintana come outen the bush I do and walk up to Jake and frisk him and Jake still a kickin the moss to slivers Yessir that s what I seen G wan Yessir N then Quintana he shoved Jake into a sink hole Thaswot I seen with my two eyes Yessir N then Quintana he run off n I jest set down in the trail I did n then Hal come up and acted like I had stole your packet he did n then I told him what Quintana done N Hal he takes after Quintana but I don t guess he meets up with him for he come back and ketched holt o me n he druv me in like I was a caaf he did N here I be The dusk in the forest had deepened so that the men s faces had become mere blotches of grey Smith said to Clinch That s his story Mike But I preferred he should tell it to you himself so I brought him along Did you drive Star Peak There wa nt nothin onto it said Clinch very softly Then of a sudden his shadowy visage became contorted and he jerked up his rifle and threw a cartridge into the magazine You dirty louse he roared at Leverett you was into this too a robbin my little Eve Run yelled somebody giving Leverett a violent shove into the woods In the darkness and confusion Clinch shouldered his way out of the circle and fired at the crackling noise that marked Leverett s course fired again lower and again as a distant crash revealed the frenzied flight of the trap robber After he had fired a fourth shot somebody struck up his rifle Aw said Jim Hastings that ain t no good You act up like a kid Mike Tain t so far to Ghost Lake n them Troopers might hear you After a silence Clinch spoke his voice heavy with reaction Into that there packet is my little girl s dower It s all I got to give her It s all she s got to make her a lady I ll kill any man that robs her or that helps rob her N that s that Are you going on after Quintana asked Smith I am N these fellas are a going with me N I want you should go back to my Dump and look after my girlie while I m gone How long are you going to be away I dunno There was a silence Then All right said Smith briefly He added Look out for sink holes Mike Clinch tossed his heavy rifle to his shoulder Let s go he said in his pleasant misleading way and I ll shoot the guts outa any fella that don t show up at roll call III For its size there is no fiercer animal than a rat Rat like rage possessed Leverett In his headlong flight through the dusk fear instead of quenching added to his rage and he ran on and on crashing through the undergrowth made wilder by the pain of vicious blows from branches which flew back and struck him in the dark Thorns bled him unseen logs tripped him he heard Clinch s bullets whining around him and he ran on beginning to sob and curse in a frenzy of fury fear and shame Shots from Clinch s rifle ceased the fugitive dropped into a heavy shuffling walk slavering gasping gesticulating with his weaponless fists in the darkness Gol ram ye I ll fix ye he kept stammering in his snarling jangling voice broken by sobs I ll learn ye yeh poor danged thing gol ram ye An unseen limb struck him cruelly across the face and a moose bush tripped him flat Almost crazed he got up yelling in his pain one hand wet and sticky from blood welling up from his cheek bone He stood listening infuriated vindictive but heard nothing save the panting animal sounds in his own throat He strove to see in the ghostly obscurity around him but could make out little except the trees close by But wood rats are never completely lost in their native darkness and Leverett presently discovered the far stars shining faintly through rifts in the phantom foliage above These heavenly signals were sufficient to give him his directions Then the question suddenly came which direction To his own shack on Stinking Lake he dared not go He tried to believe that it was fear of Clinch that made him shy of the home shanty but in his cowering soul he knew it was fear of another kind the deep superstitious horror of Jake Kloon s empty bunk the repugnant sight of Kloon s spare clothing hanging from its peg the dead man s shoes No he could not go to Stinking Lake and sleep And wake with the faint stench of sulphur in his throat And see the worm like leeches unfolding in the shallows and the big reddish water lizards livid as skinned eels wriggling convulsively toward their sunless lairs At the mere thought of his dead bunk mate he sought relief in vindictive rage stirred up the smouldering embers again cursed Clinch and Hal Smith violently searching in his inflamed brain some instant vengeance upon these men who had driven him out from the only place on earth where he knew how to exist the wilderness All at once he thought of Clinch s step daughter The thought instantly scared him Yet what a revenge to strike Clinch through the only creature he cared for in all the world What a revenge Clinch was headed for Drowned Valley Eve Strayer was alone at the Dump Another thought flashed like lightning across his turbid mind the packet Bribed by Quintana Jake Kloon lurking at Clinch s door had heard him direct Eve to take a packet to Owl Marsh and had notified Quintana Wittingly or unwittingly the girl had taken a packet of sugar milk chocolate instead of the priceless parcel expected Again carried in exhausted by a State Trooper Jake Kloon had been fooled and it was the packet of sugar milk chocolate that Jake had purloined from the veranda where Clinch kicked it For two cakes of chocolate Kloon had died For two cakes of chocolate he Earl Leverett had become a man slayer a homeless fugitive in peril of his life He stood licking his blood dried lips there in the darkness striving to hatch courage out of the dull fury eating at a coward s heart Somewhere in Clinch s Dump was the packet that would make him rich Here was his opportunity He had only to dare and pain and poverty and fear above all else fear would end forever When at last he came out to the edge of Clinch s clearing the dark October heavens were but a vast wilderness of stars Star Pond set to its limpid depths with the heavenly gems glittered and darkled with its million diamond incrustations The humped up lump of Clinch s Dump crouched like some huge and feeding night beast on the bank ringed by the solemn forest There was a kerosene lamp burning in Eve Strayer s rooms Another light a candle flickered in the kitchen Leverett crouching ran rat like down to the barn slid in between the ice house and corn crib crawled out among the wilderness of weeds and lay flat The light burned steadily from Eve s window IV From his form among frost blackened rag weeds the trap robber could see only the plastered ceiling of the bed chamber But the kerosene lamp cast two shadows on that tall shadows of human shapes that stirred at times The trap robber scared stiffened to immobility but his little eyes remained fastened on the camera obscura above All the cunning patience and murderous immobility of the rat were his Not a weed stirred under the stars where he lay with tiny unwinking eyes intent upon the shadows on the ceiling The shadows on the ceiling were cast by Eve Strayer and her State Trooper Eve sat on her bed s edge swathed in a lilac silk kimona delicate relic of school days Her bandaged feet crossed dangled above the rag rug on the floor her slim tanned fingers were interlaced over the book on her lap Near the door stood State Trooper Stormont spurred booted trig and trim an undecided and flushed young man fumbling irresolutely with the purple cord on his campaign hat The book on Eve s knees another relic of the past was Sigurd the Volsung Stormont had been reading to her they having found after the half shy tentatives of new friends a point d appui in literature And the girl admitting a passion for the poets invited him to inspect the bookcase of unpainted pine which Clinch had built into her bedroom wall Here it was he discovered mutual friends among the nobler Victorians surprised to discover Sigurd there and carrying it to her bedside looked leisurely through the half forgotten pages Would you read a little she ventured He blushed but did his best His was an agreeable boyish voice betraying taste and understanding Time passed quickly not so much in the reading but in the conversations intervening And now made uneasy by chance consultation with his wrist watch and being rather a conscientious young man he had risen and had informed Eve that she ought to go to sleep And she had denounced the idea almost fretfully Even if you go I shan t sleep till daddy comes she said Of course she added smiling at him out of gentian blue eyes if you are sleepy I shouldn t dream of asking you to stay I m not intending to sleep What are you going to do Take a chair on the landing outside your door What Certainly What did you expect me to do Eve Go to bed of course The beds in the guest rooms are all made up Your father didn t expect me to do that he said smiling I m not afraid as long as you re in the house she said She looked up at him again wistfully Perhaps he was restless bored sitting there beside her half the day and already half the night Men of that kind active nervous young men accustomed to the open can t stand caging I want you to go out and get some fresh air she said It s a wonderful night Go and walk a while And if you feel like coming back to me Will you sleep No I ll wait for you Her words were natural and direct but in their simplicity there seemed a delicate sweetness that stirred him I ll come back to you he said Then in his response the girl in her turn became aware of something beside the simple words a vague charm about them that faintly haunted her after he had gone away down the stairs That was the man she had once tried to kill At the sudden and terrible recollection she shivered from curly head to bandaged feet Then she trembled a little with the memory of his lips against her bruised hands bruised by handcuffs which he had fastened upon her She sat very very still now huddled on the bed s edge scarcely breathing For the girl was beginning to dare formulate the deepest of any thoughts that ever had stirred her virgin mind and body If it was love then it had come suddenly and strangely It had come on that day at the very moment when he flung her against the tree and handcuffed her that terrible instant if it were love Or what was it that so delicately overwhelmed her with pleasure in his presence in his voice in the light firm sound of his spurred tread on the veranda below Friendship A lonely passion for young and decent companionship The clean youth of him in contrast to the mangy surly louts who haunted Clinch s Dump was that the appeal Listening there where she sat clasping the book she heard his steady tread patrolling the veranda caught the faint fragrance of his brier pipe in the still night air I think I think it s love she said under her breath But he couldn t ever think of me always listening to his spurred tread below After a while she placed both bandaged feet on the rug It hurt her but she stood up walked to the open window She wanted to look at him just a moment By chance he looked up at that instant and saw her pale face like a flower in the starlight Why Eve he said you ought not to be on your feet Once she said you weren t so particular about my bruises Her breathless little voice coming down through the starlight thrilled him Do you remember what I did he asked Yes You bruised my hands and made my mouth bleed I did penance for your hands Yes you kissed them What possessed her what irresponsible exhilaration was inciting her to a daring utterly foreign to her nature She heard herself laugh knew that she was young pretty capable of provocation And in a sudden breathless sort of way an overwhelming desire seized her to please to charm to be noticed by such a man whatever on afterthought he might think of the step child of Mike Clinch Stormont had come directly under her window and stood looking up I dared not offer further penance he said The emotion in his voice stirred her but she was still laughing down at him She said You did offer further penance you offered your handkerchief So as that was all you offered as reparation for my lips Eve I could have taken you into my arms You did And threw me down among the spruces You really did everything that a contrite heart could suggest Good heavens said that rather matter of fact young man I don t believe you have forgiven me after all I have everything except the handkerchief Then I m coming up to complete my penance I ll lock my door Would you I ought to But if you are in great spiritual distress and if you really and truly repent and if you humbly desire to expiate your sin by doing penance And hesitated Do you so desire Yes I do Humbly Contritely Yes Very well Say Mea culpa mea maxima culpa Mea maxima culpa he said so earnestly looking up into her face that she bent lower over the sill to see him Let me come up Eve he said She strove to laugh gazing down into his shadowy face but suddenly the desire had left her and all her gaiety left her too suddenly leaving only a still excitement in her breast You you knew I was just laughing she said unsteadily You understood didn t you I don t know After a silence I didn t mean you to take me seriously she said She tried to laugh It was no use And as she leaned there on the sill her heart frightened her with its loud beating Will you let me come up Eve No answer Would you lock your door What do you think I d do she asked tremulously You know I don t Are you so sure I know what I d do I don t think either of us know our own minds I seem to have lost some of my wits Somehow If you are not going to sleep let me come up I want you to take a walk down by the pond And while you re walking there all by yourself I want you to think very clearly very calmly and make up your mind whether I should remain awake to night or whether when you return I ought to be asleep and and my door bolted After a long pause All right he said in a low voice V She saw him walk away saw his shadowy well built form fade into the starlit mist An almost uncontrollable impulse set her throat and lips quivering with desire to call to him through the night I do love you I do love you Come back quickly quickly Fog hung over Star Pond edging the veranda rising in frail shreds to her window The lapping of the water sounded very near An owl was very mournful in the hemlocks The girl turned from the window looked at the door for a moment then her face flushed and she walked toward a chair and seated herself leaving the door unbolted For a little while she sat upright alert as though a little frightened After a few moments she folded her hands and sat unstirring with lowered head awaiting Destiny It came noiselessly And so swiftly that the rush of air from her violently opened door was what first startled her For in the same second Earl Leverett was upon her in his stockinged feet one bony hand gripping her mouth the other flung around her pinning both arms to her sides The packet he panted quick yeh dirty little cat r I ll break yeh head off n yeh damn neck She bit at the hand that he held crushed against her mouth He lifted her bodily flung her onto the bed and twisting sheet and quilt around her swathed her to the throat Still controlling her violently distorted lips with his left hand and holding her so one knee upon her he reached back unsheathed his hunting knife and pricked her throat till the blood spurted Now gol ram yeh he whispered fiercely where s Mike s packet Yell and I ll hog stick yeh fur fair Where is it you dum thing He took his left hand from her mouth The distorted scarlet lips writhed back displaying her white teeth clenched Where s Mike s bundle he repeated hoarse with rage and fear You rat she gasped At that he closed her mouth again and again he pricked her with his knife cruelly The blood welled up onto the sheets Now by God he said in a ghastly voice answer or I ll hog stick yeh next time Where is it Where where She only showed her teeth in answer Her eyes flamed Where Quick Gol ding yeh I ll shove this knife in behind your ear if you don t tell Go on Where is it It s in this Dump som ers I know it is don t lie You want that I should stick you good That what you want you dirty little dump slut Well then gol ram yeh I ll fix yeh like Quintana was aimin at He slit the sheet downward from her imprisoned knees seized one wounded foot and tried to slash the bandages I ll cut a coupla toes off n yeh he snarled I ll hamstring yeh fur keeps struggling to mutilate her while she flung her helpless and entangled body from side to side and bit at the hand that was almost suffocating her Unable to hold her any longer he seized a pillow to bury the venomous little head that writhed biting under his clutch As he lifted it he saw a packet lying under it By God he panted As he seized it she screamed for the first time Jack Jack Stormont and fairly hurled her helpless little body at Leverett striking him full in the face with her head Half stunned still clutching the packet he tried to stab her in the stomach but the armour of bed clothes turned the knife although his violence dashed all breath out of her Sick with the agony of it speechless she still made the effort and as he stumbled to his feet and turned to escape she struggled upright choking blood running from the knife pricks in her neck With the remnant of her strength and still writhing and gasping for breath she tore herself from the sheets and blankets reeled across the room to where Stormont s rifle stood threw in a cartridge dragged herself to the window Dimly she saw a running figure in the night mist flung the rifle across the window sill and fired Then she fired again or thought she did There were two shots Eve came Stormont s sharp cry what the devil are you trying to do to me His cry terrified her the rifle clattered to the floor The next instant he came running up the stairs bare headed heavy pistol swinging and halted horrified at sight of her Eve My God he whispered taking her blood wet body into his arms Go after Leverett she gasped He s robbed daddy He s running away out there somewhere Where did he hurt you Eve my little Eve Oh go go she wailed I m not hurt He only pricked me with his knife I m not hurt I tell you Go after him Take your pistol and follow him and kill him Oh she cried hysterically twisting and sobbing in his arms don t lose time here with me Don t stand here while he s running away with dad s money And Oh oh oh she sobbed collapsing in his arms and clinging to him convulsively as he carried her to her tumbled bed and laid her there He said I couldn t risk following anybody now after what has happened to you I can t leave you alone here Don t cry Eve I ll get your man for you I promise Don t cry dear It was all my fault for leaving this room even for a minute No no no It s my fault I sent you away Oh I wish I hadn t I wish I had let you come back when you wanted to I was waiting for you I left the door unbolted for you When it opened I thought it was you And it was Leverett it was Leverett Stormont s face grew very white What did he do to you Eve Tell me darling What did he do to you Dad s money was under my pillow she wailed Leverett tried to make me tell where it was I wouldn t and he hurt me How He pricked me with his knife When I screamed for you he tried to choke me with the pillow Didn t you hear me scream Yes I came on the jump It was too late she sobbed too late He saw the money packet under my pillow and he snatched it and ran Somehow I found your rifle and fired I fired twice Her only bullet had torn his campaign hat from his head But he did not tell her Let me see your neck he said bending closer She bared her throat making a soft vague complaint like a hurt bird lay there whimpering under her breath while he bathed the blood away with lint sterilised the two cuts from his emergency packet and bound them He was still bending low over her when her blue eyes unclosed on his That is the second time I ve tried to kill you she whispered I thought it was Leverett I d have died if I had killed you There was a silence Lie very still he said huskily I ll be back in a moment to rebandage your feet and make you comfortable for the night I can t sleep she repeated desolately Dad trusted his money to me and I ve let Leverett rob me How can I sleep I ll bring you something to make you sleep I can t I promise you you will sleep Lie still He rose went away downstairs and out to the barn where his campaign hat lay in the weed drilled through by a bullet There was something else lying there in the weeds a flat muddy shoeless shape sprawling grotesquely in the foggy starlight One hand clutched a hunting knife the other a packet Stormont drew the packet from the stiff fingers then turned the body over and flashing his electric torch examined the ratty visage what remained of it for his pistol bullet had crashed through from ear to cheek bone almost obliterating the trap robber s features Stormont came slowly into Eve s room and laid the packet on the sheet beside her Now he said there is no reason for you to lie awake any longer I ll fix you up for the night Deftly he unbandaged bathed dressed and rebandaged her slim white feet little wounded feet so lovely so exquisite that his hand trembled as he touched them They re doing fine he said cheerily You ve half a degree of fever and I m going to give you something to drink before you go to sleep He poured out a glass of water dissolved two tablets supported her shoulders while she drank in a dazed way looking always at him over the glass Now he said go to sleep I ll be on the job outside your door until your daddy arrives How did you get back dad s money she asked in an odd emotionless way as though too weary for further surprises I ll tell you in the morning Did you kill him I didn t hear your pistol I ll tell you all about it in the morning Good night Eve As he bent over her she looked up into his eyes and put both arms around his neck It was her first kiss given to any man except Mike Clinch After Stormont had gone out and closed the door she lay very still for a long while Then instinctively she touched her lips with her fingers and at the contact a blush clothed her from brow to ankle The Flaming Jewel in its morocco casket under her pillow burned with no purer fire than the enchanted flame glowing in the virgin heart of Eve Strayer of Clinch s Dump Thus they lay together two lovely flaming jewels burning softly steadily through the misty splendour of the night Under a million stars Death sprawled in squalor among the trampled weeds Under the same high stars dark mountains waited and there was a silvery sound of waters stirring somewhere in the mist EPISODE SEVEN CLINCH S DUMP I When Mike Clinch bade Hal Smith return to the Dump and take care of Eve Smith already had decided to go there Somewhere in Clinch s Dump was hidden the Flaming Jewel Now was his time to search for it There were two other reasons why he should go back One of them was that Leverett was loose If anything had called Trooper Stormont away Eve would be alone in the house And nobody on earth could forecast what a coward like Leverett might attempt But there was another and more serious reason for returning to Clinch s Clinch blood mad was headed for Drowned Valley with his men to stop both ends of that vast morass before Quintana and his gang could get out It was evident that neither Clinch nor any of his men although their very lives depended upon familiarity with the wilderness knew that a third exit from Drowned Valley existed But the nephew of the late Henry Harrod knew When Jake Kloon was a young man and Darragh was a boy Kloon had shown him the rocky submerged game trail into Drowned Valley Doubtless Kloon had used it in hootch running since If ever he had told anybody else about it probably he had revealed the trail to Quintana And that was why Darragh or Hal Smith finally decided to return to Star Pond because if Quintana had been told or had discovered that circuitous way out of Drowned Valley he might go straight to Clinch s Dump And supposing Stormont was still there how long could one State Trooper stand off Quintana s gang No sooner had Clinch and his motley followers disappeared in the dusk than Smith unslung his basket pack fished out a big electric torch flashed it tentatively and then reslinging the pack and taking his rifle in his left hand he set off at an easy swinging stride His course was not toward Star Pond it was at right angles with that trail For he was taking no chances Quintana might already have left Drowned Valley by that third exit unknown to Clinch Smith s course would now cut this unmarked trail trodden only by game that left no sign in the shallow mountain rivulet which was the path The trail lay a long way off through the night But if Quintana had discovered and taken that trail it would be longer still for him twice as long as the regular trail out For a mile or two the forest was first growth pine and sufficiently open so that Smith might economise on his torch He knew every foot of it As a boy he had carried a jacob staff in the Geological Survey Who better than the forest roaming nephew of Henry Harrod should know this blind wilderness The great pines towered on every side lofty and smooth to the feathery canopy that crowned them under the high stars There was no game here no water nothing to attract anybody except the devastating lumberman But this was a five thousand acre patch of State land The ugly whine of the steam saw would never be heard here On he walked at an easy swinging stride flashing his torch rarely feeling no concern about discovery by Quintana s people It was only when he came into the hardwoods that the combined necessity for caution and torch perplexed and worried him Somewhere in here began an outcrop of rock running east for miles Only stunted cedar and berry bushes found shallow nourishment on this ridge When at last he found it he travelled upon it more slowly constantly obliged to employ the torch After an hour perhaps his feet splashed in shallow water That was what he was expecting The water was only an inch or two deep it was ice cold and running north Now he must advance with every caution For here trickled the thin flow of that rocky rivulet which was the other entrance and exit penetrating that immense horror of marsh and bog and depthless sink hole known as Drowned Valley For a long while he did not dare to use his torch but now he was obliged to He shined the ground at his feet elevated the torch with infinite precaution throwing a fan shaped light over the stretch of sink he had suspected and feared It flanked the flat wet path of rock on either side Here Death spread its slimy trap at his very feet Then as he stood taking his bearings with burning torch far ahead in the darkness a light flashed went out flashed twice more and was extinguished Quintana Smith s wits were working like lightning but instinct guided him before his brain took command He levelled his torch and repeated the three signal flashes Then in darkness he came to swift conclusion There were no other signals from the unknown The stony bottom of the rivulet was his only aid In his right hand the torch hung almost touching the water At times he ventured sufficient pressure for a feeble glimmer then again trusted to his sense of contact For three hundred yards counting his strides he continued on Then in total darkness he pocketed the torch slid a cartridge into the breech of his rifle slung the weapon pulled out a handkerchief and tied it across his face under the eyes Now he drew the torch from his pocket levelled it sent three quick flashes out into darkness Instantly close ahead three blinding flashes broke out For Hal Smith it all had become a question of seconds Death lay depthless on either hand ahead Death blocked the trail in silence Out of the dark some unseen rifle might vomit death in his very face at any moment He continued to move forward After a little while his ear caught a slight splash ahead Suddenly a glare of light enveloped him Is it you Harry Beck Instinct led again while wits worked madly Harry Beck is two miles back on guard Where is Sard The silence became terrible Once the glaring light in front moved then become fixed There was a light splashing Instantly Smith realised that the man in front had set his torch in a tree crotch and was now cowering somewhere behind a levelled weapon His voice came presently He Drap a that a gun damn quick Smith bent leisurely and laid his rifle on a mossy rock Now You there Why you want Sard Eh I ll tell Sard not you retorted Smith coolly You listen to me whoever you are I m from Sard s office in New York I m Abrams The police are on their way here to find Quintana How I know Eh Why shall I believe that You tell a me queeck or I blow a your damn head off Quintana will blow a your head off unless you take me to Sard drawled Smith A movement might have meant death but he calmly rummaged for a cigarette lighted it blew a cloud insolently toward the white glare ahead Then he took another chance I guess you re Nick Salzar aren t you Si I am Salzar Who the dev are you I m Eddie Abrams Sard s lawyer My business is to find my client If you stop me you ll go to prison the whole gang of you Sard Quintana Picquet Sanchez Georgiades and Harry Beck and you After a dead silence Maybe you ll go to the chair too It was the third chance he took There was a dreadful stillness in the woods Finally came a slight series of splashes the crunch of heavy boots on rock For why you com a here eh demanded Salzar in a less aggressive manner What a da matt eh Well said Smith if you ve got to know there are people from Esthonia in New York If you understand that Christi When do they arrive A week ago Sard s place is in the hands of the police I couldn t stop them They ve got his safe and all his papers City State and Federal officers are looking for him The Constabulary rode into Ghost Lake yesterday Now don t you think you d better lead me to Sard Cristi exclaimed Salzar Sard he is a mile ahead with the others Damn Damn Me how should I know what is to be done Me I have my orders from Quintana What I do eh Cristi What to do What you say I should do eh Abrams A new fear had succeeded the old one that was evident and Salzar came forward into the light of his own fixed torch a well knit figure in slouch hat grey shirt and grey breeches and wearing a red bandanna over the lower part of his face He carried a heavy rifle He came on sturdily splashing through the water and walked up to Smith his rifle resting on his right shoulder For me he said excitedly long time I have worry in this a damn wood Si Where you say those carbinieri Eh At Ghost Lake Your signature is in the hotel ledger Cristi You know where Clinch is You know too He is on the way to Drowned Valley Damn I knew it Quintana also You know where is Quintana And Sard I tell a you They march ver fast to the Dump of Clinch Si And there they would discover these a beeg a dimon these a Flame Jewel Si Now you tell a me what I do Smith said slowly If Quintana is marching on Clinch s he s marching into a trap Salzar blanched above his bandanna The State Troopers are there said Smith They ll get him sure Cristi faltered Salzar then they are gobble Quintana Sard everybody Si Smith considered the man You can save your skin anyway You can go back and tell Harry Beck Then both of you can beat it for Drowned Valley He picked up his rifle stood a moment in troubled reflection If I could overtake Quintana I d do it he said I think I ll try If I can t he s done for You tell Harry Beck that Eddie Abrams advises him to beat it for Drowned Valley Suddenly Salzar tore the bandanna from his face flung it down and stamped on it What I tell Quintana he yelled his features distorted with rage I don t a like no not me no I tell a heem stay at those Ghost a Lake and watch thees a fellow Clinch Si Not for me thees a wood No I spit upon it I curse like hell I tell Quintana I don t a like Now eet is trouble that comes and we lose a out Damn Damn Me I find me Beck You shall say to Jose Quintana how he is a damfool Me I am finish me Nick Salzar You hear me Abrams I am through I go He glared at Smith started to move came back and took his torch made a violent gesture with it which drenched the woods with goblin light You stop a Quintana maybe You tell a heem he is the bigg a fool You tell a heem Nick Salzar is no damn fool No Adios my frien Abrams I beat it I save my skin Once more Salzar turned and headed for Drowned Valley Where Clinch would not fail to kill him The man was going to his death And it was Smith who sent him Suddenly it came to Smith that he could not do this thing that this man had no chance that he was slaying a human being with perfect safety to himself and without giving him a chance Salzar he called sharply The man halted and looked around Come back Salzar hesitated turned finally slouched toward him Smith laid aside his pack and rifle and as Salzar came up he quietly took his weapon from him and laid it beside his own What a da matt demanded Salzar astonished Why you taka my gun Smith measured him They were well matched Set your torch in that crotch he said Salzar puzzled and impatient demanded to know why Smith took both torches set them opposite each other and drew Salzar into the white glare Now he said you dirty desperado I am going to try to kill you clean Look out for yourself For a second Salzar stood rooted in blank astonishment I m one of Clinch s men said Smith but I can t stick a knife in your back at that Now take care of yourself if you can His voice died in his throat Salzar was on him clawing biting kicking striving to strangle him to wrestle him off his feet Smith reeled staggering under the sheer rush of the man almost blinded by blows clutched bewildered in Salzar s panther grip For a moment he writhed there searching blindly for his enemy s wrist striving to avoid the teeth that snapped at his throat stifled by the hot stench of the man s breath in his face I keel you I keel you Damn Damn panted Salzar in convulsive fury as Smith freed his left arm and struck him in the face Now on the narrow wet and slippery strip of rock they swayed to and fro murderously interlocked their heavy boots splashing battling with limb and body Twice Salzar forced Smith outward over the sink trying to end it but could not free himself Once too he managed to get at a hidden knife drag it out and stab at head and throat but Smith caught the fist that wielded it forced back the arm held it while Salzar screamed at him lunging at his face with bared teeth Suddenly the end came Salzar s body heaved upward sprawled for an instant in the dazzling glare hurtled over Smith s head and fell into the sink with a crashing splash Frantically he thrashed there spattering and floundering in darkness He made no outcry Probably he had landed head first In a moment only a vague heaving came from the unseen ooze Smith exhausted drenched with sweat leaned against a tamarack sickened After all sound had ceased he straightened up with an effort Presently he bent and recovered Salzar s red bandanna and his hat lifted his own rifle and pack and struggled into the harness Then kicking Salzar s rifle overboard he unfastened both torches pocketed one and started on in a flood of ghostly light He was shaking all over and the torch quivered in his hand He had seen men die in the Great War He had been near death himself But never before had he been near death in so horrible a form The sodden noises in the mud the deadened flopping of the sinking body mud plastered hands beating frantically on mud spattering agonising in darkness My God he breathed anything but that anything but that II Before midnight he struck the hard forest Here there was no trail at all only spreading outcrop of rock under dying leaves He could see a few stars Cautiously he ventured to shine his compass close to the ground He was still headed right The ghastly sink country lay behind him Ahead of him somewhere in darkness but how far he did not know Quintana and his people were moving swiftly on Clinch s Dump It may have been an hour later two hours perhaps when from far ahead in the forest came a sound the faint clink of a shod heel on rock Now Smith unslung his pack placed it between two rocks where laurel grew Salzar s red bandanna was still wet but he tied it across his face leaving his eyes exposed The dead man s hat fitted him His own hat and the extra torch he dropped into his basket pack Ready now he moved swiftly forward trailing his rifle And very soon it became plain to him that the people ahead were moving without much caution evidently fearing no unfriendly ear or eye in that section of the wilderness Smith could hear their tread on rock and root and rotten branch or swishing through frosted fern and brake or louder on newly fallen leaves At times he could even see the round white glare of a torch on the ground see it shift ahead lighting up tree trunks spread out fanlike into a wide misty glory then vanish as darkness rushed in from the vast ocean of the night Once they halted at a brook Their torches flashed it he heard them sounding its depths with their gun butts Smith knew that brook It was the east branch of Star Brook the inlet to Star Pond Far ahead above the trees the sky seemed luminous It was star lustre over the pond turning the mist to a silvery splendour Now the people ahead of him moved with more caution crossing the brook without splashing and their boots made less noise in the woods To keep in touch with them Smith hastened his pace until he drew near enough to hear the low murmur of their voices They were travelling in single file he had a glimpse of them against the ghostly radiance ahead Indeed so near had he approached that he could hear the heavy laboured breathing of the last man in the file some laggard who dragged his feet plodding on doggedly panting muttering Probably the man was Sard Already the forest in front was invaded by the misty radiance from the clearing Through the trees starlight glimmered on water The perfume of the open land grew in the night air the scent of dew wet grass the smell of still water and of sedgy shores Lying flat behind a rotting log Smith could see them all now spectral shapes against the light There were five of them at the forest s edge They seemed to know what was to be done and how to do it Two went down among the ferns and stunted willows toward the west shore of the pond two sheered off to the southwest shoulder deep in blackberry and sumac The fifth man waited for a while then ran down across the open pasture Scarcely had he started when Smith glided to the wood s edge crouched and looked down Below stood Clinch s Dump plain in the starlight every window dark To the west the barn loomed huge with its ramshackle outbuildings straggling toward the lake Straight down the slope toward the barn ran the fifth man of Quintana s gang and disappeared among the out buildings Smith crept after him through the sumacs and at the foot of the slope squatted low in a clump of rag weed So close to the house was he now that he could hear the dew rattling on the veranda roof He saw shadowy figures appear one after another and take stations at the four corners of the house The fifth man was somewhere near the out buildings very silent about whatever he had on hand The stillness was absolute save for the drumming dew and a faint ripple from the water s edge Smith crouched listened searched the starlight with intent eyes and waited Until something happened he could not solve the problem before him He could be of no use to Eve Strayer and to Stormont until he found out what Quintana was going to do He could be of little use anyway unless he got into the house where two rifles might hold out against five There was no use in trying to get to Ghost Lake for assistance He felt that whatever was about to happen would come with a rush It would be all over before he had gone five minutes No the only thing to do was to stay where he was As for his pledge to the little Grand Duchess that was always in his mind Sooner or later somehow he was going to make good his pledge He knew that Quintana and his gang were here to find the Flaming Jewel Had he not encountered Quintana his own errand had been the same For Smith had started for Clinch s prepared to reveal himself to Stormont and then masked to the eyes and to save Eve from a broken heart and Clinch from States Prison he had meant to rob the girl at pistol point It was the only way to save Clinch the only way to save the pride of this blindly loyal girl For the arrest of Clinch meant ruin to both and Smith realised it thoroughly A slight sound from one of the out houses a sort of wagon shed attracted his attention Through the frost blighted rag weeds he peered intently listening After a few moments a faint glow appeared in the shed There was a crackling noise The glow grew pinker III Inside Clinch s house Eve awoke with a start Her ears were filled with a strange rushing crackling noise A rosy glare danced and shook outside her windows As she sprang to the floor on bandaged feet a shrill scream burst out in the ruddy darkness unearthly horrible and there came a thunderous battering from the barn The girl tore open her bedroom door Jack she cried in a terrified voice The barn s on fire Good God he said my horse He had already sprung from his chair outside her door Now he ran downstairs and she heard bolt and chain clash at the kitchen door and his spurred boots land on the porch Oh she whimpered snatching a blanket wrapper from a peg and struggling into it Oh the poor horse Jack Jack I m coming to help Don t risk your life I m coming I m coming Terror clutched her as she stumbled downstairs on bandaged feet As she reached the door a great flare of light almost blinded her Jack And at the same instant she saw him struggling with three masked men in the glare of the wagon shed afire His rifle stood in the corridor outside her door With one bound she was on the stairs again There came the crash and splinter of wood and glass from the kitchen and a man with a handkerchief over his face caught her on the landing Twice she wrenched herself loose and her fingers almost touched Stormont s rifle she fought like a cornered lynx tore the handkerchief from her assailant s face recognised Quintana hurled her very body at him eyes flaming small teeth bared Two other men laid hold In another moment she had tripped Quintana and all four fell rolling over and over down the short flight of stairs landing in the kitchen still fighting Here in darkness she wriggled out somehow leaving her blanket wrapped in their clutches In another instant she was up the stairs again only to discover that the rifle was gone The red glare from the wagon house lighted her bedroom she sprang inside and bolted the door Her chamois jacket with its loops full of cartridges hung on a peg She got into it seized her rifle and ran to the window just as two masked men pushing Stormont before them entered the house by the kitchen way Her own door was resounding with kicks and blows shaking shivering under the furious impact of boot and rifle butt She ran to the bed thrust her hand under the pillow pulled out the case containing the Flaming Jewel and placed it in the breast pocket of her shooting jacket Again she crept to the window Only the wagon house was burning Somebody however had led Stormont s horse from the barn and had tied it to a tree at a safe distance It stood there trembling its beautiful nervous head turned toward the burning building The blows upon her bedroom door had ceased there came a loud trampling the sound of excited voices Quintana s sarcastic tones clear dominant Dios The police Why you bring me this gendarme What am I to do with a gentleman of the Constabulary eh Do you think I am fool enough to cut his throat Well Senor Gendarme what are you doing here in the Dump of Clinch Then Stormont s voice clear and quiet What are you doing here If you ve a quarrel with Clinch he s not here There s only a young girl in this house So said Quintana Well that is what I expec my frien It is thees lady upon whom I do myse f the honour to call Eve listening heard Stormont s rejoinder still calm and very grave The man who lays a finger on that young girl had better be dead He s as good as dead the moment he touches her There won t be a chance for him Nor for any of you if you harm her Calm youse f my frien said Quintana I demand of thees young lady only that she return to me the property of which I have been rob by Monsieur Clinch I knew nothing of any theft Nor does she Pardon Senor Clinch knows and I know His tone changed offensively Senor Gendarme am I permit to understan that you are a frien of thees young lady a heart frien per aps I am her friend said Stormont bluntly Ah said Quintana then you shall persuade her to return to me thees packet of which Monsieur Clinch has rob me There was a short silence then Quintana s voice again I know thees packet is concel in thees house Peaceably if possible I would recover my property If she refuse Another pause Well inquired Stormont coolly Ah It is ver painful to say Alas Senor Gendarme I mus have my property If she refuse then I mus sever one of her pretty fingers An if she still refuse I sever her pretty fingers one by one until You know what would happen to you interrupted Stormont in a voice that quivered in spite of himself I take my chance Senor Gendarme she is within that room If you are her frien you shall advise her to return to me my property After another silence Eve he called sharply She placed her lips to the door Yes Jack He said There are five masked men out here who say that Clinch robbed them and they are here to recover their property Do you know anything about this I know they lie My father is not a thief I have my rifle and plenty of ammunition I shall kill every man who enters this room For a moment nobody stirred or spoke Then Quintana strode to the bolted door and struck it with the butt of his rifle You in there he said in a menacing voice you listen once to me You open your door and come out I give you one minute He struck the door again One minute senorita or I cut from your frien here the hand from his right arm There was a deathly silence Then the sound of bolts The door opened Slowly the girl limped forward still wearing the hunting jacket over her night dress Quintana made her an elaborate and ironical bow slouch hat in hand another masked man took her rifle Senorita said Quintana with another sweep of his hat I ask pardon that I trouble you for my packet of which your father has rob me for ver long time Slowly the girl lifted her blue eyes to Stormont He was standing between two masked men Their pistols were pressed slightly against his stomach Stormont reddened painfully It was not for myself that I let you open your door he said They would not have ventured to lay hands on me Ah said Quintana with a terrifying smile you would not have been the first gendarme who had accorded me his hand Two of the masked men laughed loudly Outside in the rag weed patch Smith rose stole across the grass to the kitchen door and slipped inside Now senorita said Quintana gaily my packet if you please and we leave you to the caresses of your faithful gendarme who should thank God that he still possesses two good hands to fondle you Alons Come then My packet One of the masked men said Take her downstairs and lock her up somewhere or she ll shoot us from her window Lead out that gendarme too added Quintana grasping Eve by the arm Down the stairs tramped the men forcing their prisoners with them In the big kitchen the glare from the burning out house fell dimly the place was full of shadows Now said Quintana I take my property and my leave Where is the packet hidden She stood for a moment with drooping head amid the sombre shadows then slowly she drew the emblazoned morocco case from her breast pocket What followed occurred in the twinkling of an eye for as Quintana extended his arm to grasp the case a hand snatched it a masked figure sprang through the doorway and ran toward the barn Somebody recognised the hat and red bandanna Salzar he yelled Nick Salzar A traitor by God shouted Quintana Even before he had reached the door his pistol flashed twice deafening all in the semi darkness choking them with stifling fumes A masked man turned on Stormont forcing him back into the pantry at pistol point Another man pushed Eve after him slammed the pantry door and bolted it Through the iron bars of the pantry window Stormont saw a man wearing a red bandanna tied under his eyes run up and untie his horse and fling himself astride under a shower of bullets As he wheeled the horse and swung him into the clearing toward the foot of Star Pond his seat and horsemanship were not to be mistaken He was gone now the gallop stretching into a dead run and Quintana s men still following shooting hallooing in the starlight like a pack of leaping shapes from hell But Quintana had not followed far When he had emptied his automatic he halted Something about the transaction suddenly checked his fury stilled it summoned his brain into action For a full minute he stood unstirring every atom of intelligence in terrible concentration Presently he put his left hand into his pocket fitted another clip to his pistol turned on his heel and walked straight back to the house Between the two locked in the pantry not a word had passed Stormont still peered out between the iron bars striving to catch a glimpse of what was going on Eve crouched at the pantry doors her face in her hands listening Suddenly she heard Quintana s step in the kitchen Cautiously she turned the pantry key from inside Stormont heard her and instantly came to her At the same moment Quintana unbolted the door from the outside and tried to open it Come out he said coldly or it will not go well with you when my men return You ve got what you say is your property replied Stormont What do you want now I tell you what I want ver damn quick Who was he thees man who rides with my property on your horse away Eh Because it was not Nick Salzar No Salzar can not ride thees way No Alors I can t tell you who he was replied Stormont That s your affair not ours No Ah Ver well then I shall tell you Senor Flic He was one of yours I understan It is a trap a cheat what you call a plant Thees man who rode your horse he is disguise Yes He also is a gendarme Yes You think I let a gendarme rob me I got you where I want you now You shall write your gendarme frien that he return to me my property one day s time or I send him by parcel post two nice fresh out right hands your sweetheart s and your own Stormont drew Eve s head close to his This man is blood mad or out of his mind I d better go out and take a chance at him before the others come back But the girl shook her head violently caught him by the arm and drew him toward the mouth of the tile down which Clinch always emptied his hootch when the Dump was raided But now it appeared that the tile which protruded from the cement floor was removable In silence she began to unscrew it and he seeing what she was trying to do helped her Together they lifted the heavy tile and laid it on the floor You open thees door shouted Quintana in a paroxysm of fury I give you one minute Then by God I kill you both Eve lifted a screen of wood through which the tile had been set Under it a black hole yawned It was a tunnel made of three foot aqueduct tiles and it led straight into Star Pond two hundred feet away Now as she straightened up and looked silently at Stormont they heard the trample of boots in the kitchen voices the bang of gun stocks Does that drain lead into the lake whispered Stormont She nodded Will you follow me Eve She pushed him aside indicating that he was to follow her As she stripped the hunting jacket from her a hot colour swept her face But she dropped on both knees crept straight into the tile and slipped out of sight As she disappeared Quintana shouted something in Portuguese and fired at the lock With the smash of splintering wood in his ears Stormont slid into the smooth tunnel In an instant he was shooting down a polished toboggan slide and in another moment was under the icy water of Star Pond Shocked blinded fighting his way to the surface he felt his spurred boots dragging at him like a ton of iron Then to him came her helping hand I can make it he gasped But his clothing and his boots and the icy water began to tell on him in mid lake Swimming without effort beside him watching his every stroke presently she sank a little and glided under him and a little ahead so that his hands fell upon her shoulders He let them rest so aware now that it was no burden to such a swimmer Supple and silent as a swimming otter the girl slipped lithely through the chilled water which washed his body to the nostrils and numbed his legs till he could scarcely move them And now of a sudden his feet touched gravel He stumbled forward in the shadow of overhanging trees and saw her wading shoreward a dripping silvery shape on the shoal Then as he staggered up to her breathless where she was standing on the pebbled shore he saw her join both hands cup shape and lift them to her lips And out of her mouth poured diamond sapphire and emerald in a dazzling stream and among them one great flashing gem blazing in the starlight the Flaming Jewel Like a naiad of the lake she stood white slim silent the heaped gems glittering in her snowy hands her face framed by the curling masses of her wet hair Then slowly she turned her head to Stormont These are what Quintana came for she said Could you put them into your pocket EPISODE EIGHT CUP AND LIP I Two miles beyond Clinch s Dump Hal Smith pulled Stormont s horse to a walk He was tremendously excited With naive sincerity he believed that what he had done on the spur of the moment had been the only thing to do By snatching the Flaming Jewel from Quintana s very fingers he had diverted that vindictive bandit s fury from Eve from Clinch from Stormont and had centred it upon himself More than that he had sown the seeds of suspicion among Quintana s own people They never could discover Salzar s body Always they must believe that it was Nicolas Salzar and no other who so treacherously robbed them and who rode away in a rain of bullets shaking the emblazoned morocco case above his masked head in triumph derision and defiance At the recollection of what had happened Hal Smith drew bridle and sitting his saddle there in the false dawn threw back his handsome head and laughed until the fading stars overhead swam in his eyes through tears of sheerest mirth For he was still young enough to have had the time of his life Nothing in the Great War had so thrilled him For in what had just happened there was humour There had been none in the Great Grim Drama Still Smith began to realise that he had taken the long long chance of the opportunist who rolls the bones with Death He had kept his pledge to the little Grand Duchess It was a clean job It was even good drama The picturesque angle of the affair shook Hal Smith with renewed laughter As a moving picture hero he thought himself the funniest thing on earth From the time he had poked a pistol against Sard s fat paunch to this bullet pelted ride for life life had become one ridiculously exciting episode after another He had come through like the hero in a best seller Lacking only a heroine If there had been any heroine it was Eve Strayer Drama had gone wrong in that detail So perhaps after all it was real life he had been living and not drama Drama for the masses must have a definite beginning and ending Real life lacks the latter In life nothing is finished It is always a premature curtain which is yanked by that doddering old stage hand Johnny Death Smith sat his saddle thinking beginning to be sobered now by the inevitable reaction which follows excitement and mirth as relentlessly as care dogs the horseman He had had a fine time save for the horror of the Rocktrail He shuddered Anyway at worst he had not shirked a clean deal in that ghastly game It was God s mercy that he was not lying where Salzar lay ten feet twenty a hundred deep perhaps in immemorial slime He shook himself in his saddle as though to be rid of the creeping horror and wiped his clammy face Now in the false dawn a blue jay awoke somewhere among the oaks and filled the misty silence with harsh grace notes Then reaction setting in like a tide stirred more sombre depths in the heart of this young man He thought of Riga and of the Red Terror of murder at noon day and outrage by night He remembered his only encounter with a lovely child once Grand Duchess of Esthonia then a destitute refugee in silken rags What a day that had been Only one day and one evening And never had he been so near in love in all his life That one day and evening had been enough for her to confide to an American officer her entire life s history Enough for him to pledge himself to her service while life endured And if emotion had swept every atom of reason out of his youthful head there in the turmoil and alarm there in the terrified riotous city jammed with refugees reeking with disease half frantic from famine and the filthy rising flood of war if really it all had been merely romantic impulse ardour born of overwrought sentimentalism nevertheless what he had pledged that day to a little Grand Duchess in rags he had fulfilled to the letter within the hour As the false dawn began to fade he loosened hunting coat and cartridge sling drew from his shirt bosom the morocco case It bore the arms and crest of the Grand Duchess Theodorica of Esthonia His fingers trembled slightly as he pressed the jewelled spring It opened on an empty casket In the sudden shock of horror and astonishment his convulsive clutch on the spring started a tiny bell ringing Then under his very nose the empty tray slid aside revealing another tray underneath set solidly with brilliants A rainbow glitter streamed from the unset gems in the silken tray Like an incredulous child he touched them They were magnificently real In the centre lay blazing the great Erosite gem the Flaming Jewel itself Priceless diamonds sapphires emeralds ringed it In his hands he held nearly four millions of dollars Gingerly he balanced the emblazoned case fascinated Then he replaced the empty tray closed the box thrust it into the bosom of his flannel shirt and buttoned it in Now there was little more for this excited young man to do He was through with Clinch Hal Smith hold up man and dish washer at Clinch s Dump had ended his career The time had now arrived for him to vanish and make room for James Darragh Because there still remained a very agreeable role for Darragh to play And he meant to eat it up as Broadway has it For by this time the Grand Duchess of Esthonia Ricca as she was called by her companion Valentine the pretty Countess Orloff Strelwitz must have arrived in New York At the big hunting lodge of the late Henry Harrod now inherited by Darragh there might be a letter perhaps a telegram the cue for Hal Smith to vanish and for James Darragh to enter play his brief but glittering part and Darragh s sequence of pleasing meditations halted abruptly To walk out of the life of the little Grand Duchess did not seem to suit his ideas indefinite and hazy as they were so far He lifted the bridle from the horse s neck divided curb and snaffle thoughtfully touched the splendid animal with heel and knee As he cantered on into the wide forest road that led to his late uncle s abode curiosity led him to wheel into a narrower trail running east along Star Pond and from whence he could take a farewell view of Clinch s Dump He smiled to think of Eve and Stormont there together and now in safety behind bolted doors and shutters He grinned to think of Quintana and his precious crew blood crazy baffled probably already distrusting one another yet running wild through the night like starving wolves galloping at hazard across a famine stricken waste Only wait till Stormont makes his report he thought grinning more broadly still Every State Trooper north of Albany will be after Senor Quintana Some hunting And if he could understand Mike Clinch might thank his stars that what I ve done this night has saved him his skin and Eve a broken heart He drew his horse to a walk now for the path began to run closer to Star Pond skirting the pebbled shallows in the open just ahead Alders still concealed the house across the lake but the trail was already coming out into the starlight Suddenly his horse stopped short trembling its ears pricked forward Darragh sat listening intently for a moment Then with infinite caution he leaned over the cantle and gently parted the alders On the pebbled beach full in the starlight stood two figures one white and slim the other dark The arm of the dark figure clasped the waist of the white and slender one Evidently they had heard his horse for they stood motionless looking directly at the alders behind which his horse had halted To turn might mean a shot in the back as far as Darragh knew He was still masked with Salzar s red bandanna He raised his rifle slid a cartridge into the breech pressed his horse forward with a slight touch of heel and knee and rode slowly out into the star dusk What Stormont saw was a masked man riding his own horse with menacing rifle half lifted for a shot What Eve Strayer thought she saw was too terrible for words And before Stormont could prevent her she sprang in front of him covering his body with her own At that the horseman tore off his red mask Eve Jack Stormont What the devil are you doing over here Stormont walked slowly up to his own horse laid one unsteady hand on its silky nose kept it there while dusty velvet lips mumbled and caressed his fingers I knew it was a cavalryman he said quietly I suspected you Jim It was the sort of crazy thing you were likely to do I don t ask you what you re up to where you ve been what your plans may be If you needed me you d have told me But I ve got to have my horse for Eve Her feet are wounded She s in her night dress and wringing wet I ve got to set her on my horse and try to take her through to Ghost Lake Darragh stared at Stormont at the ghostly figure of the girl who had sunk down on the sand at the lake s edge Then he scrambled out of the saddle and handed over the bridle Quintana came back said Stormont I hope to reckon with him some day I believe he came back to harm Eve We got out of the house We swam the lake I d have gone under except for her In his distress and overwhelming mortification Darragh stood miserable mute irresolute Stormont seemed to understand What you did Jim was well meant he said I understand Eve will understand when I tell her But that fellow Quintana is a devil You can t draw a herring across any trail he follows I tell you Jim this fellow Quintana is either blood mad or just plain crazy Somebody will have to put him out of the way I ll do it if I ever find him Yes Your people ought to do that Or if you like I ll volunteer I ve a little business to transact in New York first Jack your tunic and breeches are soaked I ll be glad to chip in something for Eve Wait a moment He stepped into cover drew the morocco box from his grey shirt shoved it into his hip pocket Then he threw off his cartridge belt and hunting coat pulled the grey shirt over his head and came out in his undershirt and breeches with the other garments hanging over his arm Give her these he said She can button the coat around her waist for a skirt She d better go somewhere and get out of that soaking wet night dress Eve crouched on the sand trying to wring out and twist up her drenched hair looked up at Stormont as he came toward her holding out Darragh s dry clothing You d better do what you can with these he said trying to speak carelessly He says you d better chuck what you re wearing She nodded in flushed comprehension Stormont walked back to his horse his boots slopping water at every stride I don t know any place nearer than Ghost Lake Inn he said except Harrod s That s where we re going Jack said Darragh cheerfully That s your place isn t it It is But I don t want Eve to know it I think it better she should not know me except as Hal Smith for the present anyway You ll see to that won t you As you wish Jim Only if we go to your own house We re not going to the main house She wouldn t anyway Clinch has taught that girl to hate the very name of Harrod hate every foot of forest that the Harrod game keepers patrol She wouldn t cross my threshold to save her life I don t understand but it s all right whatever you say Jim I ll tell you the whole business some day But where I m going to take you now is into a brand new camp which I ordered built last spring It s within a mile of the State Forest border Eve won t know that it s Harrod property I ve a hatchery there and the State lets me have a man in exchange for free fry When I get there I ll post my man It will be a roof for to night anyway and breakfast in the morning whenever you re ready How far is it Only about three miles east of here That s the thing to do then said Stormont bluntly He dropped one sopping wet sleeve over his horse s neck taking care not to touch the saddle He was thinking of the handful of gems in his pocket and he wondered why Darragh had said nothing about the empty case for which he had so recklessly risked his life What this whole business was about Stormont had no notion But he knew Darragh That was sufficient to leave him tranquil and perfectly certain that whatever Darragh was doing must be the right thing to do Yet Eve had swum Star Pond with her mouth filled with jewels When she had handed the morocco box to Quintana Stormont now realised that she must have played her last card on the utterly desperate chance that Quintana might go away without examining the case Evidently she had emptied the case before she left her room He recollected that during all that followed Eve had not uttered a single word He knew why now How could she speak with her mouth full of diamonds A slight sound from the shore caused him to turn Eve was coming toward him in the dusk moving painfully on her wounded feet Darragh s flannel shirt and his hunting coat buttoned around her slender waist clothed her The next instant he was beside her lifting her in both arms As he placed her in the saddle and adjusted one stirrup to her bandaged foot she turned and quietly thanked Darragh for the clothing And that was a brave thing you did she added to risk your life for my father s property Because the morocco case which you saved proved to be empty does not make what you did any the less loyal and gallant Darragh gazed at her astounded took the hand she stretched out to him held it with a silly expression on his features Hal Smith she said with perceptible emotion I take back what I once said to you on Owl Marsh No man is a real crook by nature who did what you have done That is faithfulness unto death the supreme offer loyalty Her voice broke she pressed Darragh s hand convulsively and her lip quivered Darragh with the morocco case full of jewels buttoned into his hip pocket stood motionless mutely swallowing his amazement What in the world did this girl mean talking about an empty case But this was no time to unravel that sort of puzzle He turned to Stormont who as perplexed as he had been listening in silence Lead your horse forward he said I know the trail All you need do is to follow me And shouldering his rifle he walked leisurely into the woods the cartridge belt sagging en bandouliere across his woollen undershirt II When Stormont gently halted his horse it was dawn and Eve sagging against him with one arm around his neck sat huddled up on her saddle fast asleep In a birch woods on the eastern slope of the divide stood the log camp dimly visible in the silvery light of early morning Darragh cautioning Stormont with a slight gesture went forward mounted the rustic veranda and knocked at a lighted window A man already dressed came and peered out at him then hurried to open the door I didn t know you Captain Darragh he began but fell silent under the warning gesture that checked him I ve a guest outside She s Clinch s step daughter Eve Strayer She knows me by the name of Hal Smith Do you understand Yes sir Cut that out too I m Hal Smith to you also State Trooper Stormont is out there with Eve Strayer He was a comrade of mine in Russia I m Hal Smith to him by mutual agreement Now do you get me Ralph Sure Hal Go on spit it out They both grinned You re a hootch runner said Darragh This is your shack The hatchery is only a blind That s all you have to know Ralph So put that girl into my room and let her sleep till she wakes of her own accord Stormont and I will take two of the guest bunks in the L And for heaven s sake make us some coffee when you make your own But first come out and take the horse They went out together Stormont lifted Eve out of the saddle She did not wake Darragh led the way into the log house and along a corridor to his own room Turn down the sheets whispered Stormont And when the bed was ready Can you get a bath towel Jim Darragh fetched one from the connecting bath room Wrap it around her wet hair whispered Stormont Good heavens I wish there were a woman here I wish so too said Darragh she s chilled to the bone You ll have to wake her She can t sleep in what she s wearing it s almost as damp as her hair He went to the closet and returned with a man s morning robe as soft as fleece Somehow or other she s got to get into that he said There was a silence Very well said Stormont reddening If you ll step out I ll manage He looked Darragh straight in the eyes I have asked her to marry me he said When Stormont came out a great fire of birch logs was blazing in the living room and Darragh stood there his elbow on the rough stone mantel shelf Stormont came straight to the fire and set one spurred boot on the fender She s warm and dry and sound asleep he said I ll wake her again if you think she ought to swallow something hot At that moment the fish culturist came in with a pot of steaming coffee This is my friend Ralph Wier said Darragh I think you d better give Eve a cup of coffee And to Wier Fill a couple of hot water bags old chap We don t want any pneumonia in this house When breakfast was ready Eve once more lay asleep with a slight dew of perspiration on her brow Darragh was half starved Stormont ate little Neither spoke at all until satisfied they rose ready for sleep At the door of his room Stormont took Darragh s offered hand understanding what it implied Thanks Jim Hers is the loveliest character I have ever known If I weren t as poor as a homeless dog I d marry her to morrow I ll do it anyway I think I can t let her go back to Clinch s Dump After all said Darragh smiling if it s only money that worries you why not talk about a job to me Stormont flushed heavily That s rather wonderful of you Jim Why You re the best officer I had Why the devil did you go into the Constabulary without talking to me Stormont s upper lip seemed inclined to twitch but he controlled it and scowled at space Go to bed you darned fool said Darragh carelessly You ll find dry things ready Ralph will take care of your uniform and boots Then he went into his own quarters to read two letters which conforming to arrangements made with missus Ray the day he had robbed Emanuel Sard were to be sent to Trout Lodge to await his arrival Both written from the Ritz bore the date of the day before the first he opened was from the Countess Orloff Strelwitz Dear Captain Darragh You are so wonderful Your messenger with the ten thousand dollars which you say you already have recovered from those miscreants who robbed Ricca came aboard our ship before we landed It was a godsend we were nearly penniless and oh so shabby Instantly my friend we shopped Ricca and I Fifth Avenue enchanted us All misery was forgotten in the magic of that paradise for women Yet spendthrifts that we naturally are we were not silly enough to be extravagant Ricca was wild for American sport clothes I also Yet only two gowns apiece excepting our sport clothes And other necessaries Don t you think we were economical Furthermore dear Captain Darragh we are hastening to follow your instructions We are leaving to day for your chateau in the wonderful forest of which you told us that never to be forgotten day in Riga Your agent is politeness consideration and kindness itself We have our accommodations We leave New York at midnight Ricca is so excited that it is difficult for her to restrain her happiness God knows the child has seen enough unhappiness to quench the gaiety of anybody Well all things end Even tears Even the Red Terror shall pass from our beloved Russia For after all Monsieur God still lives VALENTINE P S Ricca has written to you I have read the letter I have let it go uncensored Darragh went to the door of his room Ralph Ralph he called And when Wier hurriedly appeared What time does the midnight train from New York get into Five Lakes A little before nine You can make it in the flivver can t you Yes if I start now All right Two ladies You re to bring them to the house not here missus Ray knows about them And get back here as soon as you can He closed his door again sat down on the bed and opened the other letter His hand shook as he unfolded it He was so scared and excited that he could scarcely decipher the angular girlish penmanship To dear Captain Darragh our champion and friend It is difficult for me Monsieur to express my happiness and my deep gratitude in the so cold formality of the written page Alas sir it will be still more difficult to find words for it when again I have the happiness of greeting you in proper person Valentine has told you everything she warns me and I am therefore somewhat at a loss to know what I should write to you Yet I know very well what I would write if I dare It is this that I wish you to know although it may not pass the censor that I am most impatient to see you Monsieur Not because of kindness past nor with an unworthy expectation of benefits to come But because of friendship the deepest sincerest of my WHOLE LIFE Is it not modest of a young girl to say this Yes surely all the world which was once en regle formal artificial has been burnt out of our hearts by this so frightful calamity which has overwhelmed the world with fire and blood If ever on earth there was a time when we might venture to express with candour what is hidden within our minds and hearts it would seem Monsieur that the time is now True I have known you only for one day and one evening Yet what happened to the world in that brief space of time and to us Monsieur brought us together as though our meeting were but a blessed reunion after the happy intimacy of many years I speak Monsieur for myself May I hope that I speak also for you With a heart too full to thank you and with expectations indescribable but with courage always for any event I take my leave of you at the foot of this page Like death I trust my adieu is not the end but the beginning It is not farewell it is a greeting to him whom I most honour in all the world And would willingly obey if he shall command And otherwise all else that in his mind and heart he might desire THEODORICA It was the most beautiful love letter any man ever received in all the history of love And it had passed the censor III It was afternoon when Darragh awoke in his bunk stiff sore confused in mind and battered in body However when he recollected where he was he got out of bed in a hurry and jerked aside the window curtains The day was magnificent a sky of royal azure overhead and everywhere the silver pillars of the birches supporting their splendid canopy of ochre orange and burnt gold Wier hearing him astir came in How long have you been back Did you meet the ladies with your flivver demanded Darragh impatiently I got to Five Lakes station just as the train came in The young ladies were the only passengers who got out I waited to get their two steamer trunks and then I drove them to Harrod Place How did they seem Ralph worn out worried ill Wier laughed No sir they looked very pretty and lively to me They seemed delighted to get here They talked to each other in some foreign tongue Russian I should say at least it sounded like what we heard over in Siberia Captain It was Russian You go on and tell me while I take another hot bath Wier followed him into the bath room and vaulted to a seat on the deep set window sill When they weren t talking Russian and laughing they talked to me and admired the woods and mountains I had to tell them everything they wanted to see buffalo and Indians And when I told them there weren t any enquired for bears and panthers We saw two deer on the Scaur and a woodchuck near the house I thought they d jump out of the flivver He began to laugh at the recollection No sir they didn t act tired and sad they said they were crazy to get into their knickerbockers and go to look for you Where did you say I was asked Darragh drying himself vigorously Out in the woods somewhere The last I saw of them missus Ray had their hand bags and Jerry and Tom were shouldering their trunks I m going up there right away interrupted Darragh excitedly Good heavens Ralph I haven t any clothes here have I No sir But those you wore last night are dry Confound it I meant to send some decent clothes here All right get me those duds I wore yesterday and a bite to eat I m in a hurry Ralph He ate while dressing disgustedly arraying himself in the grey shirt breeches and laced boots which weather water rock and brier had not improved In a pathetic attempt to spruce up he knotted the red bandanna around his neck and pinched Salzar s slouch hat into a peak I look like a hootch running Wop he said Maybe I can get into the house before I meet the ladies You look like one of Clinch s bums remarked Wier with native honesty Darragh chagrined went to his bunk pulled the morocco case from under the pillow and shoved it into the bosom of his flannel shirt That s the main thing anyway he thought Then turning to Wier he asked whether Eve and Stormont had awakened It appeared that Trooper Stormont had saddled up and cantered away shortly after sunrise leaving word that he must hunt up his comrade Trooper Lannis at Ghost Lake They re coming back this evening added Wier He asked you to look out for Clinch s step daughter She s all right here Can t you keep an eye on her Ralph I m stripping trout sir I ll be around here to cook dinner for her when she wakes up Darragh glanced across the brook at the hatchery It was only a few yards away He nodded and started for the veranda That ll be all right he said Nobody is coming here to bother her And don t let her leave Ralph till I get back Very well sir But suppose she takes it into her head to leave Darragh called back gaily She can t she hasn t any clothes And away he strode in the gorgeous sunshine of a magnificent autumn day all the clean and vigorous youth of him afire in anticipation of a reunion which the letter from his lady love had transfigured into a tryst For in that amazing courtship of a single day he never dreamed that he had won the heart of that sad white faced hungry child in rags silken tatters still stained with the blood of massacre the very soles of her shoes still charred by the embers of her own home Yet that is what must have happened in a single day and evening Life passes swiftly during such periods Minutes lengthen into days hours into years The soul finds itself Then mind and heart become twin prophets clairvoyant concerning what hides behind the veil comprehending with divine clair audience what the Three Sisters whisper there hearing even the whirr of the spindle the very snipping of the Eternal Shears The soul finds itself the mind knows itself the heart perfectly understands He had not spoken to this young girl of love The blood of friends and servants was still rusty on her skirt s ragged hem Yet that night when at last in safety she had said good bye to the man who had secured it for her he knew that he was in love with her And at such crises the veil that hides hearts becomes transparent At that instant he had seen and known Afterward he had dared not believe that he had known But hers had been a purer courage As he strode on the comprehension of her candour her honesty the sweet bravery that had conceived created and sent that letter thrilled this young man until his heavy boots sprouted wings and the trail he followed was but a path of rosy clouds over which he floated heavenward About half an hour later he came to his senses with a distinct shock Straight ahead of him on the trail and coming directly toward him moved a figure in knickers and belted tweed Flecked sunlight slanted on the stranger s cheek and burnished hair dappling face and figure with moving golden spots Instantly Darragh knew and trembled But Theodorica of Esthonia had known him only in his uniform As she came toward him lovely in her lithe and rounded grace only friendly curiosity gazed at him from her blue eyes Suddenly she knew him went scarlet to her yellow hair then white and tried to speak but had no control of the short rosy upper lip which only quivered as he took her hands The forest was dead still around them save for the whisper of painted leaves sifting down from a sunlit vault above Finally she said in a ghost of a voice My friend If you accept his friendship Friendship is to be shared Ours mingled on that day Your share is as much as pleases you All you have to give me then Take it all I have Her blue eyes met his with a little effort All courage is an effort Then that young man dropped on both knees at her feet and laid his lips to her soft hands In trembling silence she stood for a moment then slowly sank on both knees to face him across their clasped hands So in the gilded cathedral of the woods pillared with silver and azure domed the betrothal of these two was sealed with clasp and lip Awed a little fearful she looked into her lover s eyes with a gaze so chaste so oblivious to all things earthly that the still purity of her face seemed a sacrament and he scarcely dared touch the childish lips she offered But when the sacrament of the kiss had been accomplished she rested one hand on his shoulder and rose and drew him with her Then his moment came he drew the emblazoned case from his breast opened it and in silence laid it in her hands The blaze of the jewels in the sunshine almost blinded them That was his moment The next moment was Quintana s Darragh hadn t a chance Out of the bushes two pistols were thrust hard against his stomach Quintana s face was behind them He wore no mask but the three men with him watched him over the edges of handkerchiefs over the sights of levelled rifles too The youthful Grand Duchess had turned deadly white One of Quintana s men took the morocco case from her hands and shoved her aside without ceremony Quintana leered at Darragh over his levelled weapons My frien Smith he exclaimed softly So it is you then who have twice try to rob me of my property Ah You recollec Yes How you have rob me of a pacquet which contain only some chocolate Darragh s face was burning with helpless rage My frien Smith repeated Quintana do you recollec what it was you say to me Yes How often it is the onexpected which so usually happen You are quite correc l ami Smith It has happen He glanced at the open jewel box which one of the masked men held then like lightning his sinister eyes focussed on Darragh So he said it was also you who rob me las night of my property What you do to Nick Salzar eh Killed him said Darragh dry lipped nerved for death I ought to have killed you too when I had the chance But I m white you see At the insult flung into his face over the muzzles of his own pistols Quintana burst into laughter Ah You should have shot me You are quite right my frien I mus say you have behave ver foolish He laughed again so hard that Darragh felt his pistols shaking against his body So you have kill Nick Salzar eh continued Quintana with perfect good humour My frien I am oblige to you for what you do You are surprise Eh It is ver simple my frien Smith What I want of a man who can be kill Eh Of what use is he to me Voila He laughed patted Darragh on the shoulder with one of his pistols You now you could be of use Why Because you are a better man than was Nick Salzar He who kills is better than the dead Then swiftly his dark features altered My frien Smith he said I have come here for my property not to kill I have recover my property Why shall I kill you To say that I am a better man Yes perhaps But also I should be oblige to say that also I am a fool Yaas A poor damfool Without shifting his eyes he made a motion with one pistol to his men As they turned and entered the thicket Quintana s intent gaze became murderous If I mus kill you I shall do so Otherwise I have sufficient trouble to keep me from ennui My frien I am going home to enjoy my property If you live or die it signifies nothing to me No Why for the pleasure of killing you should I bring your dirty gendarmes on my heels He backed away to the edge of the thicket venturing one swift and evil glance at the girl who stood as though dazed Listen attentively he said to Darragh One of my men remains hidden very near He is a dead shot His aim is at your sweetheart s body You understan Yes Ver well You shall not go away for one hour time After that he took off his slouch hat with a sweeping bow you may go to hell Behind him the bushes parted closed Jose Quintana had made his adieux EPISODE NINE THE FOREST AND mister SARD I When at last Jose Quintana had secured what he had been after for years his troubles really began In his pocket he had two million dollars worth of gems including the Flaming Jewel But he was in the middle of a wilderness ringed in by hostile men and obliged to rely for aid on a handful of the most desperate criminals in Europe Those openly hostile to him had a wide net spread around him wide of mesh too perhaps and it was through a mesh he meant to wriggle but the net was intact from Canada to New York Canadian police and secret agents held it on the north this he had learned from Jake Kloon long since East west and south he knew he had the troopers of the New York State Constabulary to deal with and in addition every game warden and fire warden in the State Forests a swarm of plain clothes men from the Metropolis and the rural constabulary of every town along the edges of the vast reservation Just who was responsible for this enormous conspiracy to rob him of what he considered his own legitimate loot Quintana did not know Sard s attorney Eddie Abrams believed that the French police instigated it through agents of the United States Secret Service Of one thing Quintana was satisfied Mike Clinch had nothing to do with stirring up the authorities Law breakers of his sort don t shout for the police or invoke State or Government aid As for the status of Darragh or Hal Smith as he supposed him to be Quintana took him for what he seemed to be a well born young man gone wrong Europe was full of that kind To Quintana there was nothing suspicious about Hal Smith On the contrary his clever recklessness confirmed that polished bandit s opinion that Smith was a gentleman degenerated into a crook It takes an educated imagination for a man to do what Smith had done to him If the common crook has any imagination at all it never is educated Another matter worried Jose Quintana he was not only short on provisions but what remained was cached in Drowned Valley and Mike Clinch and his men were guarding every outlet to that sinister region excepting only the rocky and submerged trail by which he had made his exit That was annoying it cut off provisions and liquor from Canada for which he had arranged with Jake Kloon For Kloon s hootch runners now would be stopped by Clinch and not one among them knew about the rocky trail in All these matters were disquieting enough but what really and most deeply troubled Quintana was his knowledge of his own men He did not trust one among them Of international crookdom they were the cream Not one of them but would have murdered his fellow if the loot were worth it and the chances of escape sufficient There was no loyalty to him none to one another no honour among thieves and it was Jose Quintana who knew that only in romance such a thing existed No he could not trust a single man Only hope of plunder attached these marauders to him and merely because he had education and imagination enough to provide what they wanted Anyone among them would murder and rob him if opportunity presented Now how to keep his loot how to get back to Europe with it was the problem that confronted Quintana after robbing Darragh And he determined to settle part of that question at once About five miles from Harrod Place within a hundred rods of which he had held up Hal Smith Quintana halted seated himself on a rotting log and waited until his men came up and gathered around him For a little while in utter silence his keen eyes travelled from one visage to the next from Henri Picquet to Victor Georgiades to Sanchez to Sard His intent scrutiny focussed on Sard lingered If there were anybody he might trust a little way it would be Sard Then a polite untroubled smile smoothed the pale dark features of Jose Quintana Bien messieurs the coup has been success Yes Ver well in turn then en accord with our custom I shall dispose myse f to listen to your good advice He looked at Henri Picquet smiled and nodded invitation to speak Picquet shrugged For me mon capitaine eet ees ver simple We are five Therefore divide into five ze gems After zat each one for himself to make his way out Nick Salzar and Harry Beck are in the Drowned Valley interrupted Quintana Picquet shrugged again Sanchez laughed saying If they are there it is their misfortune Also we others are in a hurry Picquet added Also five shares are sufficient division It is propose then that we abandon our comrades Beck and Salzar to the rifle of Mike Clinch Why not demanded Georgiades sullenly we shall have worse to face before we see the Place de l Opera There remains also Eddie Abrams remarked Quintana Crooks never betray their attorney Everybody expressed a willingness to have the five shares of plunder properly assessed to satisfy the fee due to mister Abrams Ver well nodded Quintana are you satisfy messieurs to divide an disperse Sard said heavily that they ought to stick together until they arrived in New York Sanchez sneered accusing Sard of wanting a bodyguard to escort him to his own home In this accursed forest he insisted five of us would attract attention where one alone with sufficient stealth can slip through into the open country Two by two is better said Picquet You Sanchez shall travel alone if you desire Divide the gems first growled Georgiades and then let each do what pleases him That nodded Quintana is also my opinion It is so settle Attention Two pistols were in his hands as by magic With a slight smile he laid them on the moss beside him He then spread a large white handkerchief flat on the ground and from his pockets he poured out the glittering cascade Yet like a feeding panther every sense remained alert to the slightest sound or movement elsewhere and when Georgiades grunted from excess emotion Quintana s right hand held a pistol before the grunt had ceased It was a serious business this division of loot every reckless visage reflected the strain of the situation Quintana both pistols in his hands looked down at the scintillating heap of jewels I estimate two and one quartaire million of dollaires he said simply It has been agree that I accep for me the erosite gem known as The Flaming Jewel In addition messieurs it has been agree that I accep for myse f one part in five of the remainder A fierce silence reigned Every wolfish eye was on the leader He smiled rested his pair of pistols on either knee Is there he asked softly any gentleman who shall objec Who demanded Georgiades hoarsely is to divide for us It is for such purpose explained Quintana suavely that my frien Emanuel Sard has arrive Monsieur Sard is a brokaire of diamon s as all know ver well Therefore it shall be our frien Sard who will divide for us what we have gain to day by our industry The savage tension broke with a laugh at the word chosen by Quintana to express their efforts of the morning Sard had been standing with one fat hand flat against the trunk of a tree Now at a nod from Quintana he squatted down and with the same hand that had been resting against the tree he spread out the pile of jewels into a flat layer As he began to divide this into five parts still using the flat of his pudgy hand something poked him lightly in the ribs It was the muzzle of one of Quintana s pistols Sard ghastly pale looked up His palm sticky with balsam gum quivered in Quintana s grasp I was going to scrape it off he gasped The tree was sticky Quintana with the muzzle of his pistol detached half a dozen diamonds and rubies that clung to the gum on mister Sard s palm Wash he said drily Sard sweating with fear washed his right hand with whiskey from his pocket flask and dried it for general inspection My God he protested tremulously it was accidental gentlemen Do you think I d try to get away with anything like that Quintana coolly shoved him aside and with the barrel of his pistol he pushed the flat pile of gems into five separate heaps Only he and Georgiades knew that a magnificent diamond had been lodged in the muzzle of his pistol The eyes of the Greek flamed with rage at the trick but he awaited the division before he should come to any conclusion Quintana coolly picked out The Flaming Jewel and pocketed it Then to each man he indicated the heap which was to be his portion A snarling wrangle instantly began Sanchez objecting to rubies and demanding more emeralds and Picquet complaining violently concerning the smallness of the diamonds allotted him Sard s trained eyes appraised every allotment Without weighing and lacking time and paraphernalia for expert examination he was inclined to think the division fair enough Quintana got to his feet lithely For me he said it is finish With my frien Sard I shall now depart Messieurs I embrace and salute you A bientot in Paris if it be God s will Donc au revoir les amis et a la bonheur Allons Each for himself and gar aux flics Sard seized with a sort of still terror regarded Quintana with enormous eyes Torn between dismay of being left alone in the wilderness and a very natural fear of any single companion he did not know what to say or do En masse the gang were too distrustful of one another to unite on robbing any individual But any individual might easily rob a companion when alone with him Why why can t we all go together he stammered It is safer surer I go with Quintana and you interrupted Georgiades smilingly his mind on the diamond in the muzzle of Quintana s pistol I do not invite you said Quintana But come if it pleases you I also prefer to come with you others growled Sanchez To roam alone in this filthy forest does not suit me Picquet shrugged his shoulders turned on his heel in silence They watched him moving away all alone eastward When he had disappeared among the trees Quintana looked inquiringly at the others Eh bien non alors snarled Georgiades suddenly There are too many in your trupeau mon capitaine Bonne chance He turned and started noisily in the direction taken by Picquet They watched him out of sight listened to his careless trample after he was lost to view When at length the last distant sound of his retreat had died away in the stillness Quintana touched Sard with the point of his pistol Go first he said suavely For God s sake be a little careful of your gun I am my dear frien It is of you I may become careless You will mos kin ly face south and you will be kin sufficient to start immediate Tha s what I mean I thank you Now my frien Sanchez Tha s correc You shall follow my frien Sard ver close Me I march in the rear So we shall pass to the eas of thees Star Pon then between the cross road an Ghos Lake an then we shall repose an one of us en vidette shall discover if the Constabulary have patrol beyon Allons March II Guided by Quintana s directions the three had made a wide detour to the east steering by compass for the cross roads beyond Star Pond In a dense growth of cedars on a little ridge traversing wet land Quintana halted to listen Sard and Sanchez supposing him to be at their heels continued on pushing their way blindly through the cedars clinging to the hard ridge in terror of sink holes But their progress was very slow and they were still in sight fighting a painful path amid the evergreens when Quintana suddenly squatted close to the moist earth behind a juniper bush At first except for the threshing of Sard and Sanchez through the massed obstructions ahead there was not a sound in the woods After a little while there was a sound very very slight No dry stick cracked no dry leaves rustled no swish of foliage no whipping sound of branches disturbed the intense silence But presently came a soft swift rhythm like the pace of a forest creature in haste a discreetly hurrying tread which was more a series of light earth shocks than sound Quintana kneeling on one knee lifted his pistol He already felt the slight vibration of the ground on the hard ridge The cedars were moving just beyond him now He waited until through the parted foliage a face appeared The loud report of his pistol struck Sard with the horror of paralysis Sanchez faced about with one spring snarling a weapon in either hand In the terrible silence they could hear something heavy floundering in the bushes choking moaning thudding on the ground Sanchez began to creep back Sard more dead than alive crawled at his heels Presently they saw Quintana waist deep in juniper looking down at something And when they drew closer they saw Georgiades lying on his back under a cedar the whole front of his shirt from chest to belly a sopping mess of blood There seemed no need of explanation The dead Greek lay there where he had not been expected and his two pistols lay beside him where they had fallen Sanchez looked stealthily at Quintana who said softly Bien sure In his left side pocket I believe Sanchez laid a cool hand on the dead man s heart then satisfied rummaged until he found Georgiades share of the loot Sard hurriedly displaying a pair of clean but shaky hands made the division When the three men had silently pocketed what was allotted to each Quintana pushed curiously at the dead man with the toe of his shoe Peste he remarked I had place for security a ver large diamon in my pistol barrel Now it is within the interior of this gentleman He turned to Sanchez I sell him to you One sapphire Yes Sanchez shook his head with a slight sneer We wait if you want your diamond mon capitaine Quintana hesitated then made a grimace and shook his head No he said he has swallow Let him digest Allons March But after they had gone on two hundred yards perhaps Sanchez stopped Well inquired Quintana Then with a sneer I now recollec that once you have been a butcher in Madrid Suit your tas e l ami Sanchez Sard gazed at Sanchez out of sickened eyes You keep away from me until you ve washed yourself he burst out revolted Don t you come near me till you re clean Quintana laughed and seated himself Sanchez with a hang dog glance at him turned and sneaked back on the trail they had traversed Before he was out of sight Sard saw him fish out a Spanish knife from his hip pocket and unclasp it Almost nauseated he turned on Quintana in a sort of frightened fury Come on he said hoarsely I don t want to travel with that man I won t associate with a ghoul My God I m a respectable business man Yaas drawled Quintana tha s what I saw always myse f my frien Sard he is ver respec able an I trus him like I trus myse f However after a moment Quintana got up from the fallen tree where he had been seated As he passed Sard he looked curiously into the man s frightened eyes There was not the slightest doubt that Sard was a coward You shall walk behin me remarked Quintana carelessly If Sanchez fin us it is well if he shall not that also is ver well We go now Sanchez made no effort to find them They had been gone half an hour before he had finished the business that had turned him back After that he wandered about hunting for water a rivulet a puddle anything But the wet ground proved wet only on the surface moss Sanchez needed more than damp moss for his toilet Casting about him hither and thither for some depression that might indicate a stream he came to a heavily wooded slope and descended it There was a bog at the foot With his fouled hands he dug out a basin which filled up full of reddish water discoloured by alders But the water was redder still when his toilet ended As he stood there examining his clothing and washing what he could of the ominous stains from sleeve and shoe very far away to the north he heard a curious noise a far faint sound such as he never before had heard If it were a voice of any sort there was nothing human about it Probably some sort of unknown bird Perhaps a bird of prey That was natural considering the attraction that Georgiades would have for such creatures If it were a bird it must be a large one he thought Because there was a certain volume to the cry Perhaps it was a beast after all Some unknown beast of the forest Sanchez was suddenly afraid Scarcely knowing what he was doing he began to run along the edge of the bog First growth timber skirted it running was unobstructed by underbrush With his startled ears full of the alarming and unknown sound he ran through the woods under gigantic pines which spread a soft green twilight around him He was tired or thought he was but the alarming sounds were filling his ears now the entire forest seemed full of them echoing in all directions coming in upon him from everywhere so that he knew not in which direction to run But he could not stop Demoralised he darted this way and that terror winged his feet the air vibrated above and around him with the dreadful unearthly sounds The next instant he fell headlong over a ledge struck water felt himself whirled around in the icy rushing current rolled over tumbled through rapids blinded deafened choked swept helplessly in a vast green wall of water toward something that thundered in his brain an instant then dashed it into roaring chaos Half a mile down the turbulent outlet of Star Pond where a great sheet of green water pours thirty feet into the tossing foam below and spinning dipping diving bobbing up like a lost log after the drive the body of Senor Sanchez danced all alone in the wilderness spilling from soggy pockets diamonds sapphires rubies emeralds into crystal caves where only the shadows of slim trout stirred Very far away to the eastward Quintana stood listening clutching Sard by one sleeve to silence him Presently he said My frien somebody is hunting with houn s in this fores Maybe they are not hunting us Maybe But for me I shall seek running water Go you your own way Houp Vamose He turned westward but he had taken scarcely a dozen strides when Sard came panting after him Don t leave me gasped the terrified diamond broker I don t know where to go Quintana faced him abruptly with a terrifying smile and glimmer of white teeth and shoved a pistol into the fold of fat beneath Sard s double chin You hear those dogs Yes Ver well I also Run now I say to you run ver damn quick He Houp Allez vous en Beat eet He struck Sard a stinging blow on his fleshy ear with the pistol barrel and Sard gave a muffled shriek which was more like the squeak of a frightened animal My God Quintana he sobbed Then Quintana s eyes blazed murder and Sard turned and ran lumbering through the thicket like a stampeded ox crashing on amid withered brake white birch scrub and brier not knowing whither he was headed crazed with terror Quintana watched his flight for a moment then pistol swinging he ran in the opposite direction eastward speeding lithely as a cat down a long wooded slope which promised running water at the foot Sard could not run very far He could scarcely stand when he pulled up and clung to the trunk of a tree More dead than alive he embraced the tree gulping horribly for air every fat incrusted organ labouring his senses swimming As he sagged there gripping his support on shaking knees by degrees his senses began to return He could hear the dogs now vaguely as in a nightmare But after a little while he began to believe that their hysterical yelping was really growing more distant Then this man whose every breath was an outrage on God prayed He prayed that the hounds would follow Quintana come up with him drag him down worry him tear him to shreds of flesh and clothing He listened and prayed alternately After a while he no longer prayed but concentrated on his ears Surely surely the diabolical sound was growing less distinct It was changing direction too But whether in Quintana s direction or not Sard could not tell He was no woodsman He was completely turned around He looked upward through a dense yellow foliage but all was grey in the sky very grey and still and there seemed to be no traces of the sun that had been shining He looked fearfully around trees trees and more trees No break no glimmer nothing to guide him teach him He could see perhaps fifty feet no further In panic he started to move on That is what fright invariably does to those ignorant of the forest Terror starts them moving Sobbing frightened almost witless he had been floundering forward for over an hour and had made circle after circle without knowing when by chance he set foot in a perfectly plain trail Emotion overpowered him He was too overcome to stir for a while At length however he tottered off down the trail oblivious as to what direction he was taking animated only by a sort of madness horror of trees an insane necessity to see open ground get into it and lie down on it And now directly ahead he saw clear grey sky low through the trees The wood s edge He began to run As he emerged from the edge of the woods waist deep in brush and weeds wide before his blood shot eyes spread Star Pond Even in his half stupefied brain there was memory enough left for recognition He remembered the lake His gaze travelled to the westward and he saw Clinch s Dump standing below stark silent the doors swinging open in the wind When terror had subsided in a measure and some of his trembling strength returned he got up out of the clump of rag weeds where he had lain down and earnestly nosed the unpainted house listening with all his ears There was not a sound save the soughing of autumn winds and the delicate rattle of falling leaves in the woods behind him He needed food and rest He gazed earnestly at the house Nothing stirred there save the open doors swinging idly in every vagrant wind He ventured down a little way near enough to see the black cinders of the burned barn and close enough to hear the lake waters slapping the sandy shore If he dared And after a long while he ventured to waddle nearer slinking through brush and frosted weed creeping behind boulders edging always closer and closer to that silent house where nothing moved except the wind blown door And now at last he set a furtive foot upon the threshold stood listening tip toed in peered here and there sidled to the dining room peered in When at length Emanuel Sard discovered that Clinch s Dump was tenantless he made straight for the pantry Here was cheese crackers an apple pie half a dozen bottles of home brewed beer He loaded his arms with all they could carry stole through the dance hall out to the veranda which overlooked the lake Here hidden in the doorway he could watch the road from Ghost Lake and survey the hillside down which an intruder must come from the forest And here Sard slaked his raging thirst and satiated the gnawing appetite of the obese than which there is no crueller torment to an inert liver and distended paunch Munching guzzling watching Sard squatted just within the veranda doorway anxiously considering his chances He knew where he was At the foot of the lake and eastward he had been robbed by a highwayman on the forest road branching from the main highway Southwest lay Ghost Lake and the Inn Somewhere between these two points he must try to cross the State Road After that comparative safety For the miles that still would lie between him and distant civilisation seemed as nothing to the horror of that hell of trees He looked up now at the shaggy fringing woods shuddered opened another bottle of beer In all that panorama of forest swale and water the only thing that had alarmed him at all by moving was something in the water When first he noticed it he almost swooned for he took it to be a swimming dog In his agitation he had risen to his feet and then the swimming creature almost frightened Sard out of his senses for it tilted suddenly and went down with a report like the crack of a pistol However when Sard regained control of his wits he realised that a swimming dog doesn t dive and doesn t whack the water with its tail He dimly remembered hearing that beavers behaved that way Watching the water he saw the thing out there in the lake again swimming in erratic circles its big dog like head well out of the water It certainly was no dog A beaver maybe Whatever it was Sard didn t care any longer Idly he watched it Sometimes when it swam very near he made a sudden motion with his fat arm and crack with a pistol shot report down it dived But always it reappeared What had a creature like that to do with him Sard watched it with failing interest thinking of other things of Quintana and the chances that the dogs had caught him of Sanchez the Ghoul hoping that dire misfortune might overtake him too of the dead man sprawling under the cedar tree all sopping crimson Faugh Shivering Sard filled his mouth with apple pie and cheese and pulled the cork from another bottle of home brewed beer III About that time a mile and a half to the southward James Darragh came out on the rocky and rushing outlet to Star Pond Over his shoulder was a rifle and all around him ran dogs big powerful dogs built like foxhounds but with the rough wiry coats of Airedales even rougher of ear and features The dogs half a dozen or so in number seemed very tired All ran down eagerly to the water and drank and slobbered and panted lolling their tongues and slaking their thirst again and again along the swirling edge of a deep trout pool Darragh s rifle lay in the hollow of his left arm his khaki waistcoat was set with loops full of cartridges From his left wrist hung a raw hide whip Now he laid aside his rifle and whip took from the pocket of his shooting coat three or four leather dog leashes went down among the dogs and coupled them up They followed him back to the bank above Here he sat down on a rock and inspected his watch He had been seated there for ten minutes possibly with his tired dogs lying around him when just above him he saw a State Trooper emerge from the woods on foot carrying a rifle over one shoulder Jack he called in a guarded voice Trooper Stormont turned caught sight of Darragh made a signal of recognition and came toward him Darragh said Your mate Trooper Lannis is down stream I ve two of my own game wardens at the cross roads two more on the Ghost Lake Road and two foresters and an inspector out toward Owl Marsh Stormont nodded looked down at the dogs This isn t the State Forest said Darragh smiling Then his face grew grave How is Eve he asked She s feeling better replied Stormont I telephoned to Ghost Lake Inn for the hotel physician I was afraid of pneumonia Jim Eve had chills last night But doctor Claybourn thinks she s all right So I left her in care of your housekeeper missus Ray will look out for her You haven t told Eve who I am have you No I ll tell her myself to night I don t know how she ll take it when she learns I m the heir to the mortal enemy of Mike Clinch I don t know either said Stormont There was a silence the State Trooper looked down at the dogs What are they Jim Otter hounds said Darragh a breed of my own But that s all they are capable of hunting I guess he added grimly Stormont s gaze questioned him Darragh said After I telephoned you this morning that a guest of mine at Harrod Place and I had been stuck up and robbed by Quintana s outfit what did you do Jack I called up Bill Lannis first said Stormont then the doctor After he came missus Ray arrived with a maid Then I went in and spoke to Eve Then I did what you suggested I crossed the forest diagonally toward The Scaur zig zagged north turned by the rock hog back south of Drowned Valley came southeast circled west and came out here as you asked me to Almost on the minute nodded Darragh You saw no signs of Quintana s gang None Well said Darragh I left my two guests at Harrod Place to amuse each other got out three couple of my otter hounds and started them as I hoped and supposed on Quintana s trail What happened inquired Stormont curiously Well I don t know I think they were following some of Quintana s gang for a while anyway After that God knows deer hare cotton tail I don t know They yelled their bally heads off I on the run they re slow dogs you know and whatever they were after either fooled them or there were too many trails I made a mistake that s all These poor beasts don t know anything except an otter I just hoped they might take Quintana s trail if I put them on it Well said Stormont it can t be helped now I told Bill Lannis that we d rendezvous at Clinch s Dump All right nodded Darragh Let s keep to the open my dogs are leashed couples They had been walking for twenty minutes possibly exchanging scarcely a word and they were now nearing the hilly basin where Star Pond lay when Darragh said abruptly I m going to tell you about things Jack You ve taken my word so far that it s all right Naturally said Stormont simply The two men who had been brother officers in the Great War glanced at each other slightly smiling Here it is then said Darragh When I was on duty in Riga for the Intelligence Department I met two ladies in dire distress whose mansion had been burned and looted supposedly by the Bolsheviki They were actually hungry and penniless the only clothing they possessed they were wearing These ladies were the Countess Orloff Strelwitz and a young girl Theodorica Grand Duchess of Esthonia I did what I could for them After a while in the course of other duty I found out that the Bolsheviki had had nothing to do with the arson and robbery but that the crime had been perpetrated by Jose Quintana s gang of international crooks masquerading as Bolsheviki Stormont nodded I also came across similar cases he remarked Well this was a flagrant example Quintana had burnt the chateau and had made off with over two million dollars worth of the little Grand Duchess s jewels among them the famous Erosite gem known as The Flaming Jewel I ve heard of it There are only two others known Well I did what I could with the Esthonian police who didn t believe me But a short time ago the Countess Orloff sent me word that Quintana really was the guilty one and that he had started for America I ve been after him ever since But Jack until this morning Quintana did not possess these stolen jewels Clinch did What Clinch served over seas in a Forestry Regiment In Paris he robbed Quintana of these jewels That s why I ve been hanging around Clinch Stormont s face was flushed and incredulous Then it lost colour as he thought of the jewels that Eve had concealed the gems for which she had risked her life He said But you tell me Quintana robbed you this morning He did The little Grand Duchess and the Countess Orloff Strelwitz are my guests at Harrod Place Last night I snatched the case containing these gems from Quintana s fingers This morning as I offered them to the Grand Duchess Quintana coolly stepped between us His voice became bitter and his features reddened with rage poorly controlled By God Jack I should have shot Quintana when the opportunity offered Twice I ve had the chance The next time I shall kill him any way I can Legitimately Of course said Stormont gravely But his mind was full of the jewels which Eve had What and whose were they if Quintana again had the Esthonian gems in his possession Had you recovered all the jewels for the Grand Duchess he asked Darragh Every one Jack Quintana has done me a terrible injury I shan t let it go I mean to hunt that man to the end Stormont terribly perplexed nodded A few minutes later as they came out among the willows and alders on the northeast side of Star Pond Stormont touched his comrade s arm Look at that enormous dog otter out there in the lake Grab those dogs They ll strangle each other cried Darragh quickly That s it unleash them Jack and let them go he was struggling with the other two couples while speaking And now the hounds unleashed lifted frantic voices The very sky seemed full of the discordant tumult wood and shore reverberated with the volume of convulsive and dissonant baying Damn it said Darragh disgusted that s what they ve been trailing all the while across woods that devilish dog otter yonder And I had hoped they were on Quintana s trail A mass rush and scurry of crazed dogs nearly swept him off his feet and both men caught a glimpse of a large bitch otter taking to the lake from a ledge of rock just beyond Now the sky vibrated with the deafening outcry of the dogs some taking to water others racing madly along shore Crack The echo of the dog otter s blow on the water came across to them as the beast dived Well I m in for it now muttered Darragh starting along the bank toward Clinch s Dump to keep an eye on his dogs Stormont followed more leisurely IV A few minutes before Darragh and Stormont had come out on the farther edge of Star Pond Sard who had heard from Quintana about the big drain pipe which led from Clinch s pantry into the lake decided to go in and take a look at it He had been told all about its uses how Clinch in the event of a raid by State Troopers or Government enforcement agents could empty his contraband hootch into the lake if necessary and even could slide a barrel of ale or a keg of rum intact into the great tile tunnel and recover the liquor at his leisure Also and grimly Quintana had admitted that through this drain Eve Strayer and the State Trooper Stormont had escaped from Clinch s Dump So now Sard full of curiosity went back into the pantry to look at it for himself Almost instantly the idea occurred to him to make use of the drain for his own safety and comfort Why shouldn t he sleep in the pantry lock the door and in case of intrusion other exits being unavailable why shouldn t he feel entirely safe with such an avenue of escape open For swimming was Sard s single accomplishment He wasn t afraid of the water he simply couldn t sink Swimming was the only sport he ever had indulged in He adored it Also the mere idea of sleeping alone amid that hell of trees terrified Sard Never had he known such horror as when Quintana abandoned him in the woods Never again could he gaze upon a tree without malignant hatred Never again did he desire to lay eyes upon even a bush The very sight now of the dusky forest filled him with loathing Why should he not risk one night in this deserted house sleep well and warmly feed well drink his bellyfull of Clinch s beer before attempting the dead line southward where he was only too sure that patrols were riding and hiding on the lookout for the fancy gentlemen of Jose Quintana s selected company of malefactors Well here in the snug pantry were pies crullers bread cheeses various dried meats tinned vegetables ham bacon fuel and range to prepare what he desired Here was beer too and doubtless ardent spirits if he could nose out the hidden demijohns and bottles He peered out of the pantry window at the forest shuddered cursed it and every separate tree in it cursed Quintana too wishing him black mischance No it was settled He d take his chance here in the pantry And there must be a mattress somewhere upstairs He climbed the staircase cautiously discovered Clinch s bedroom took the mattress and blankets from the bed dragged them to the pantry Could any honest man be more tight and snug in this perilous world of the desperate and undeserving Sard thought not But one matter troubled him the lock of the pantry door had been shattered To remedy this he moused around until he discovered some long nails and a claw hammer When he was ready to go to sleep he d nail himself in And in the morning he d pry the door loose That was simple Sard chuckled for the first time since he had set eyes upon the accursed region And now the sun came out from behind a low bank of solid grey cloud and fell upon the countenance of Emanuel Sard It warmed his parrot nose agreeably it cheered and enlivened him Not for him a night of terrors in that horrible forest which he could see through the pantry window A sense of security and of well being pervaded Sard to his muddy shoes He even curled his fat toes in them with animal contentment A little snack before cooking a heavily satisfactory dinner Certainly So he tucked a couple of bottles of beer under one arm a loaf of bread and a chunk of cheese under the other and waddled out to the veranda door And at that instant the very heavens echoed with that awful tumult which had first paralysed then crazed him in the woods Bottles bread cheese fell from his grasp and his knees nearly collapsed under him In the bushes on the lake shore he saw animals leaping and racing but in his terror he did not recognise them for dogs Then suddenly he saw a man close to the house running and another man not far behind That he understood and it electrified him into action It was too late to escape from the house now He understood that instantly He ran back through the dance hall and dining room to the pantry but he dared not let these intruders hear the noise of hammering In an agony of indecision he stood trembling listening to the infernal racket of the dogs and waiting for the first footstep within the house No step came But chancing to look over his shoulder he saw a man peering through the pantry window at him Ungovernable terror seized Sard Scarcely aware what he was about he seized the edges of the big drain pipe and crowded his obese body into it head first He was so fat and heavy that he filled the tile To start himself down he pulled with both hands and kicked himself forward tortoise like down the slanting tunnel sticking now and then dragging himself on and downward Now he began to gain momentum he felt himself sliding not fast but steadily There came a hitch somewhere his heavy body stuck on the steep incline Then as he lifted his bewildered head and strove to peer into the blackness in front he saw four balls of green fire close to him in darkness He began to slide at the same instant and flung out both hands to check himself But his palms slid in the slime and his body slid after He shrieked once as his face struck a furry obstruction where four balls of green fire flamed horribly and a fury of murderous teeth tore his face and throat to bloody tatters as he slid lower lower settling through crimson dyed waters into the icy depths of Star Pond Stormont down by the lake called to Darragh who appeared on the veranda Oh Jim Both otters crawled into the drain I think your dogs must have killed one of them under water There s a big patch of blood spreading off shore Yes said Darragh something has just been killed somewhere Jack Yes Pull both your guns and come up here quick EPISODE TEN THE TWILIGHT OF MIKE I When Quintana turned like an enraged snake on Sard and drove him to his destruction he would have killed and robbed the frightened diamond broker had he dared risk the shot He had intended to do this anyway sooner or later But with the noise of the hunting dogs filling the forest Quintana was afraid to fire Yet even then he followed Sard stealthily for a few minutes afraid yet murderously desirous of the gems confused by the tumult of the hounds timid and ferocious at the same time and loath to leave his fat perspiring and demoralised victim But the racket of the dogs proved too much for Quintana He sheered away toward the South leaving Sard floundering on ahead unconscious of the treachery that had followed furtively in his panic stricken tracks About an hour later Quintana was seen challenged chased and shot at by State Trooper Lannis Quintana ran And what with the dense growth of seedling beech and oak and the heavily falling birch and poplar leaves Lannis first lost Quintana and then his trail The State Trooper had left his horse at the cross roads near the scene of Darragh s masked exploit where he had stopped and robbed Sard and now Lannis hastened back to find and mount his horse and gallop straight into the first growth timber Through dim aisles of giant pine he spurred to a dead run on the chance of cutting Quintana from the eastward edge of the forest and forcing him back toward the north or west where patrols were more than likely to hold him The State Trooper rode with all the reckless indifference and grace of the Western cavalryman and he seemed to be part of the superb animal he rode part of its bone and muscle its litheness its supple power part of its vertebrae and ribs and limbs so perfect was their bodily company ordination Rifle and eyes intently alert the rider scarce noticed his rushing mount and if he guided with wrist and knee it was instinctive and as though the horse were guiding them both And now far ahead through this primeval stand of pine sunshine glimmered warning of a clearing And here Trooper Lannis pulled in his horse at the edge of what seemed to be a broad flat meadow vividly green But it was the intense arsenical green of hair fine grass that covers with its false velvet those quaking bogs where only a thin crust like skin of root fibre and vegetation cover infinite depths of silt The silt had no more substance than a drop of ink colouring the water in a tumbler Sitting his fast breathing mount Lannis searched this wide flat expanse of brilliant green Nothing moved on it save a great heron picking its deliberate way on stilt like legs It was well for Quintana that he had not attempted it Very cautiously Lannis walked his horse along the hard ground which edged this marsh on the west Nowhere was there any sign that Quintana had come down to the edge among the shrubs and swale grasses Beyond the marsh another trooper patrolled and when at length he and Lannis perceived each other and exchanged signals the latter wheeled his horse and retraced his route at an easy canter satisfied that Quintana had not yet broken cover Back through the first growth he cantered his rifle at a ready carefully scanning the more open woodlands and so came again to the cross roads And here stood a State Game Inspector with a report that some sort of beagle pack was hunting in the forest to the northwest and very curious to investigate So it was arranged that the Inspector should turn road patrol and the Trooper become the rover There was no sound of dogs when Lannis rode in on the narrow spotted trail whence he had flushed Quintana into the dense growth of saplings that bordered it His horse made little noise on the moist layer of leaves and forest mould he listened hard for the sound of hounds as he rode heard nothing save the chirr of red squirrels the shriek of a watching jay or the startling noise of falling acorns rapping and knocking on great limbs in their descent to the forest floor Once very very far away westward in the direction of Star Pond he fancied he heard a faint vibration in the air that might have been hounds baying He was right And at that very moment Sard was dying horribly among two trapped otters as big and fierce as the dogs that had driven them into the drain But Lannis knew nothing of that as he moved on mounted along the spotted trail now all a yellow glory of birch and poplar which made the woodland brilliant as though lighted by yellow lanterns Somewhere among the birches between him and Star Pond was Harrod Place And the idea occurred to him that Quintana might have ventured to ask food and shelter there Yet that was not likely because Trooper Stormont had called him that morning on the telephone from the Hatchery Lodge No the only logical retreat for Quintana was northward to the mountains where patrols were plenty and fire wardens on duty in every watch tower Or the fugitive could make for Drowned Valley by a blind trail which Stormont informed him existed but which Lannis never had heard of However to reassure himself Lannis rode as far as Harrod Place and found game wardens on duty along the line Then he turned west and trotted his mount down to the hatchery where he saw Ralph Wier the Superintendent standing outside the lodge talking to his assistant George Fry When Lannis rode up on the opposite side of the brook he called across to Wier You haven t seen anything of any crooked outfit around here have you Ralph I m looking for that kind See here said the Superintendent I don t know but George Fry may have seen one of your guys Come over and he ll tell you what happened an hour ago Trooper Lannis pivotted his horse and put him to the brook with scarcely any take off and the splendid animal cleared the water like a deer and came cantering up to the door of the lodge Fry s boyish face seemed agitated he looked up at the State Trooper with the flush of tears in his gaze and pointed at the rifle Lannis carried If I d had that he said excitedly I d have brought in a crook you bet Where did you see him inquired Lannis Jest west of the Scaur about an hour and a half ago Wier and me was stockin the head of Scaur Brook with fingerlings There s more good water two miles of it to the east and all it needed was a fish ladder around Scaur Falls So I toted in cement and sand and grub last week and I built me a shanty on the Scaur and I been laying up a fish way around the falls So that s how I come there He clicked his teeth and darted a furious glance at the woods By God he said I was such a fool I didn t take no rifle All I had was an axe and a few traps I wasn t going to let the mink get our trout whatever you fellows say he added defiantly and law or no law Get along with your story young man interrupted Lannis you can spill the rest out to the Commissioner All right then This is the way it happened down to the Scaur I was eating lunch by the fish stairs looking up at em and kind of planning how to save cement and not thinking about anybody being near me when something made me turn my head You know how it is in the woods I kinda felt somebody near And by cracky there stood a man with a big black automatic pistol and he had a bead on my belly Well said I what s troubling you and your gun my friend I was that astonished He was a slim built powerful guy with a foreign face and voice and way He wanted to know if he had the honour as he put it to introduce himself to a detective or game constable or a friend of Mike Clinch I told him I wasn t any of these and that I worked in a private hatchery and he called me a liar Young Fry s face flushed and his voice began to quiver That s the way he misused me and he backed me into the shanty and I had to sit down with both hands up Then he filled my pack basket with grub and took my axe and strapped my kit onto his back And talking all the time in his mean sneery foreign way and I guess he thought he was funny for he laughed at his own jokes He told me his name was Quintana and that he ought to shoot me for a rat but wouldn t because of the stink Then he said he was going to do a quick job that the police were too cowardly to do that he was a going to find Mike Clinch down to Drowned Valley and kill him and if he could catch Mike s daughter too he d spoil her face for life The boy was breathing so hard and his rage made him so incoherent that Lannis took him by the shoulder and shook him What next demanded the Trooper impatiently Tell your story and quit thinking how you were misused He told me to stay in the shanty for an hour or he d do for me good cried Fry Once I got up and went to the door and there he stood by the brook wolfing my lunch with both hands I tell you he cursed and drove me like a dog inside with his big pistol my God like a dog Then the next time I took a chance he was gone And I beat it here to get me a rifle The boy broke down and sobbed He drove me around like a dog he did You leave that to me interrupted Lannis sharply And to Wier You and George had better get a gun apiece That fellow might come back here or go to Harrod Place if we starve him out Wier said to Fry Go up to Harrod Place and tell Jansen your story and bring back two forty five seventy s And quit snivelling You may get a shot at him yet Lannis had already ridden down to the brook Now he jumped his horse across pulled up called back to Wier I think our man is making for Drowned Valley all right My mate Stormont telephoned me that some of his gang are there and that Mike Clinch and his gang have them stopped on the other side Keep your eye on Harrod Place And away he cantered into the North Behind the curtains of her open window Eve Strayer lying on her bed had heard every word Crouched there beside her pillow she peered out and saw Trooper Lannis ride away saw the Fry boy start toward Harrod Place on a run saw Ralph Wier watch them out of sight and then turn and re enter the lodge Wrapped in Darragh s big blanket robe she got off the bed and opened her chamber door as Wier was passing through the living room Please I d like to speak to you a moment she called Wier turned instantly and came to the partly open door I want to know she said where I am Ma am What is this place It s a hatchery Whose Ma am Whose lodge is this Does it belong to Harrod Place We re h hootch runners Miss stammered Wier mindful of instructions but making a poor business of deception I and Hal Smith we run a Easy One and we strip trout for a blind and sell to Harrod Place Hal and I Who is Hal Smith she asked Ma am The girl s flower blue eyes turned icy Who is the man who calls himself Hal Smith she repeated Wier looked at her red and dumb Is he a Trooper in plain clothes she demanded in a bitter voice Is he one of the Commissioner s spies Are you one too Wier gazed miserably at her unable to formulate a convincing lie She flushed swiftly as a terrible suspicion seized her Is this Harrod property Is Hal Smith old Harrod s heir Is he My God Miss He is Listen Miss She flung open the door and came out into the living room Hal Smith is that nephew of old Harrod she said calmly His name is Darragh And you are one of his wardens And I can t stay here Do you understand Wier wiped his hot face and waited The cat was out there was a hole in the bag and he knew there was no use in such lies as he could tell He said All I know Miss is that I was to look after you and get you whatever you want I want my clothes Ma am My clothes she repeated impatiently I ve got to have them Where are they ma am asked the bewildered man At the same moment the girl s eyes fell on a pile of men s sporting clothing garments sent down from Harrod Place to the Lodge lying on a leather lounge near a gun rack Without a glance at Wier Eve went to the heap of clothing tossed it about selected cords two pairs of woollen socks grey shirt puttees shoes flung the garments through the door into her own room followed them and locked herself in When she was dressed the two heavy pairs of socks helping to fit her feet to the shoes she emptied her handful of diamonds sapphires and emeralds including the Flaming Jewel into the pockets of her breeches Now she was ready She unlocked her door and went out scarcely limping at all now Wier gazed at her helplessly as she coolly chose a rifle and cartridge belt at the gun rack Then she turned on him as still and dangerous as a young puma Tell Darragh he d better keep clear of Clinch s she said Tell him I always thought he was a rat Now I know he s one She plunged one slim hand into her pocket and drew out a diamond Here she said insolently This will pay your gentleman for his gun and clothing She tossed the gem onto a table where it rolled glittering For heaven s sake Miss burst out Wier horrified but she cut him short He may keep the change she said We re no swindlers at Clinch s Dump Wier started forward as though to intercept her Eve s eyes flamed And he stood still She wrenched open the door and walked out among the silver birches At the edge of the brook she stood a moment coolly loading the magazine of her rifle Then with one swift glance of hatred flung at the place that Harrod s money had built she sprang across the brook tossed her rifle to her shoulder and passed lithely into the golden wilderness of poplar and silver birch II Quintana on a fox trot along the rock trail into Drowned Valley now thoroughly understood that it was the only sanctuary left him for the moment Egress to the southward was closed to the eastward also and he was too wary to venture westward toward Ghost Lake No the only temporary safety lay in the swamps of Drowned Valley And there he decided as he jogged along if worse came to worst and starvation drove him out he d settle matters with Mike Clinch and break through to the north He meant to settle matters with Mike Clinch anyway He was not afraid of Clinch not really afraid of anybody It had been the dogs that demoralised Quintana He d had no experience with hunting hounds did not know what to expect how to manoeuvre If only he could have seen these beasts that filled the forest with their hob goblin outcries if he could have had a good look at the creatures who gave forth that weird crazed melancholy volume of sound Bon he said coolly to himself It was a crisis of nerves which I experience Yes I should have shot him that fat Sard Yes Only those damn dog And now he shall die an rot that fat Sard all by himse f parbleu like one big dead thing all alone in the wood A puddle of guts full of diamonds Ah mon dieu a million francs in gems that shine like festering stars in this damn wood till the world end Ah bah nome de dieu de Halte la came a sharp voice from the cedar fringe in front A pause then recognition and Henri Picquet walked out on the hard ridge beyond and stood leaning on his rifle and looking sullenly at his leader Quintana came forward carelessly a disagreeable expression in his eyes and on his narrow lips and continued on past Picquet The latter slouched after his leader who had walked over to the lean to before which a pile of charred logs lay in cold ashes As Picquet came up Quintana turned on him with a gesture toward the extinguished fire It is cold like hell he said Why do you not have some fire Not for me non growled Picquet and jerked a dirty thumb in the direction of the lean to And there Quintana saw a pair of muddy boots protruding from a blanket It is Harry Beck yes he inquired Then something about the boots and the blanket silenced him He kept his eyes on them for a full minute then walked into the lean to The blanket also covered Harry Beck s features and there was a stain on it where it outlined the prostrate man s features making a ridge over the bony nose After a moment Quintana looked around at Picquet So He is dead Yes Picquet shrugged Since noon mon capitaine Comment How shall I know It was the fire perhaps green wood or wet it is no matter now I said to him Pay attention Henri your wood makes too much smoke To me he reply I shall go to hell Well there was too much smoke for me I arise to search for wood more dry when crack they begin to shoot out there He waved a dirty hand toward the forest Bon said I Clinch he have seen your damn smoke What shall I care he make reply Henri Beck to me Clinch he shall shoot and be damn to him I cook me my dejeuner all the same I make representations to that Johnbull he say to me that I am a frog and other injuries while he lay yet more wood on his sacre fire Then crack crack crack and zing gg whee ee come the big bullets of Clinch and his voyous yonder Bon I say me I make my excuse to retire Then Henri Beck he laugh and say Hop it frog And that is all he has find time to say when crack spat Bien droit he has it tenez mon capitaine here over the left eye Like a beef surprise he go over crash thump And like a beef that dies the air bellows out from his big lungs Picquet looked down at the dead comrade in a sort of weary compassion for such stupidity So he pass this ros biff goddam Johnbull Me I roll him in there Je ne sais pas pourquoi Then I put out the fire and leave Quintana let his sneering glance rest on the dead a moment and his thin lip curled immemorial contempt for the Anglo Saxon Then he divested himself of the basket pack which he had stolen from the Fry boy Alors he said calmly it has been Mike Clinch who shoot my frien Beck Bien He threw a cartridge into the breech of his rifle adjusted his ammunition belt en bandouliere carelessly Then in a quiet voice My frien Picquet the time has now arrive when it become ver necessary that we go from here away Donc I shall now go kill me my frien Mike Clinch Picquet unastonished gave him a heavy bovine look of inquiry Quintana said softly Me I have enough already of this damn woods Why shall we starve here when there lies our path He pointed north his arm remained outstretched for a while Clinch he is there growled Picquet Also our path l ami Henri And behind us they hunt us now with dogs Picquet bared his big white teeth in fierce surprise Dogs he repeated with a sort of snarl That is how they now hunt us my frien like they hunt the hare in the Cote d Or Me I shall now reconnoitre that way And he looked where he was pointing into the north with smouldering eyes Then he turned calmly to Picquet An you l ami At orders mon capitaine C est bien Venez They walked leisurely forward with rifles shouldered following the hard ridge out across a vast and flooded land where the bark of trees glimmered with wet mosses After a quarter of a mile the ridge broadened and split into two one hog back branching northeast They however continued north About twenty minutes later Picquet creeping along on Quintana s left and some sixty yards distant discovered something moving in the woods beyond and fired at it Instantly two unseen rifles spoke from the woods ahead Picquet was jerked clear around lost his balance and nearly fell Blood was spurting from his right arm between elbow and shoulder He tried to lift and level his rifle his arm collapsed and dangled broken and powerless his rifle clattered to the forest floor For a moment he stood there in plain view dumb deathly white then he began screaming with fury while the big soft nosed bullets came streaming in all around him His broken arm was hit again His screaming ceased he dragged out his big clasp knife with his left hand and started running toward the shooting As he ran his mangled arm flopping like a broken wing Byron Hastings stepped out from behind a tree and coolly shot him down at close quarters Then Quintana s rifle exploded twice very quickly and the Hastings boy stumbled sideways and fell sprawling He managed to rise to his knees again he even was trying to stand up when Quintana taking his time deliberately began to empty his magazine into the boy riddling him limb and body and head Down once more he still moved his arms Sid Hone reached out from behind a fallen log to grasp the dying lad s ankle and draw him into shelter but Quintana reloaded swiftly and smashed Hone s left hand with the first shot Then Jim Hastings kneeling behind a bunch of juniper fired a high velocity bullet into the tree behind which Quintana stood but before he could fire again Quintana s shot in reply came ripping through the juniper and tore a ghastly hole in the calf of his left leg striking a blow that knocked young Hastings flat and paralysed as a dead flounder A mile to the north blocking the other exit from Drowned Valley Mike Clinch Harvey Chase Cornelius Blommers and Dick Berry stood listening to the shooting B gosh blurted out Chase it sounds like they was goin through Mike B gosh it does Clinch s little pale eyes blazed but he said in his soft agreeable voice Stay right here boys Like as not some of em will come this way The shooting below ceased Clinch s nostrils expanded and flattened with every breath as he stood glaring into the woods Harve he said presently you an Corny go down there an kinda look around And you signal if I m wanted G wan both o you Git They started running heavily but their feet made little noise on the moss Berry came over and stood near Clinch For ten minutes neither man moved Clinch stared at the woods in front of him The younger man s nervous glance flickered like a snake s tongue in every direction and he kept moistening his lips with his tongue Presently two shots came from the south A pause a rattle of shots from hastily emptied magazines G wan down there Dick said Clinch You ll be alone Mike Au right You do like I say git along quick Berry walked southward a little way He had turned very white under his tan Gol ding ye shouted Clinch take it on a lope or I ll kick the pants off n ye Berry began to run carrying his rifle at a trail For half an hour there was not a sound in the forests of Drowned Valley except in the dead timber where unseen woodpeckers hammered fitfully at the ghosts of ancient trees Always Clinch s little pale eyes searched the forest twilight in front of him not a falling leaf escaped him not a chipmunk And all the while Clinch talked to himself his lips moved a little now and then but uttered no sound All I want God should do he repeated again and again is to just let Quintana come my way Tain t for because he robbed my girlie Tain t for the stuff he carries onto him No God tain t them things But it s what that there skunk done to my Evie O God be you listenin He hurt her Quintana did That s it He misused her God if you had seen my girlie s little bleeding feet That s the reason Tain t the stuff I can work I can save for to make my Evie a lady same

sell em more n a bottle o beer before this here prohybishun set us all crazy Tain t right O God don t hold a little hootch agin me when all I want of you is to let Quintana The slightest noise behind him He waited turned slowly Eve stood there Hell died in his pale eyes as she came to him rested silently in his gentle embrace returned his kiss laid her flushed sweet cheek against his unshaven face Dad darling Yes my baby You re watching to kill Quintana But there s no use watching any longer Have the boys below got him he demanded They got one of his gang Byron Hastings is dead Jim is badly hurt Sid Hone too not so badly Where s Quintana Dad he s gone But it don t matter See here She dug her slender hand into her breeches pocket and pulled out a little fistful of gems Clinch his powerful arm closing her shoulders looked dully at the jewels You see dad there s no use killing Quintana These are the things he robbed you of Tain t them that matter I m glad you got em I allus wanted you should be a great lady girlie Them s the tickets of admission You put em in your pants I gotta stay here a spell Dad Take them He took them smiled shoved them into his pocket What is it girlie he asked absently his pale eyes searching the woods ahead I ve just told you she said that the boys went in as far as Quintana s shanty There was a dead man there too but Quintana has gone Clinch said not removing his eyes from the forest If any o them boys has let Quintana crawl through I ll kill him too G wan home girlie I gotta mosey I gotta kinda loaf around f r a spell Dad I want you to come back with me You go home you hear me Eve Tell Corny and Dick Berry to hook it for Owl Marsh and stop the Star Peak trails both on em Can Sid and Jimmy walk Jim can t Well let Harve take him on his back You go too You help fix Jimmy up at the house He s a little fella Jimmy Hastings is Harve can tote him And you go along Dad Quintana says he means to kill you What is the use of hurting him You have what he took I gotta have more n he took But even that ain t enough He couldn t pay for all he ever done to me girlie I m aimin to draw on him on sight Clinch s set visage relaxed into an alarming smile which flickered faded died in the wintry ferocity of his eyes Dad G wan home he interrupted harshly You want that Hastings boy to bleed to death She came up to him not uttering a word yet asking him with all the tenderness and eloquence of her eyes to leave this blood trail where it lay and hunt no more He kissed her mouth infinitely tender smiled then again prim and scowling G wan home you little scut an do what I told ye or by God I ll cut a switch that ll learn ye good Never a word now On yer way G wan Twice she turned to look back The second time Clinch was slowly walking into the woods straight ahead of him She waited saw him go in waited After a while she continued on her way When she sighted the men below she called to Blommers and Dick Berry Dad says you re to stop Star Peak trail by Owl Marsh Jimmy Hastings sat on a log crying and looking down at his dead brother over whose head somebody had spread a coat Blommers had made a tourniquet for Jimmy out of a bandanna and a peeled stick The girl examined it loosened it for a moment twisted it again and bade Harvey Chase take him on his back and start for Clinch s The boy began to sob that he didn t want his brother to be left out there all alone but Chase promised to come back and bring him in before night Sid Hone came up haggard from pain and loss of blood resting his mangled hand in the sling of his cartridge belt Berry and Blommers were already starting across toward Owl Marsh and the latter passing by asked Eve where Mike was He went into Drowned Valley by the upper outlet she said He ll never find no one in them logans an sinks muttered Chase squatting to hoist Jimmy Hastings to his broad back I guess he ll be over Star Peak side by sundown nodded Blommers Eve watched him slouching off into the woods followed sullenly by Berry Then she looked down at the dead man in silence Be you ready Eve grunted Chase She turned with a heavy heart to the home trail but her mind was passionately with Clinch in the spectral forests of Drowned Valley III And Clinch s mind was on her All else his watchfulness his stealthy advance all the alertness of eye and ear all the subtlety the cunning the infinite caution were purely instinctive mechanics Somewhere in this flooded twilight of gigantic trees was Jose Quintana Knowing that he dismissed that fact from his mind and turned his thoughts to Eve Sometimes his lips moved They usually did when he was arguing with God or calling his Creator s attention to the justice of his case His two cases each to him a cause celebre the matter of Harrod the affair of Quintana Many a time he had pleaded these two causes before the Most High But now his thoughts were chiefly concerned with Eve with the problem of her future his master passion this daughter of the dead wife he had loved He sighed unconsciously halted Well Lord he concluded in his wordless way my girlie has gotta have a chance if I gotta go to hell for it That s sure as shootin Amen At that instant he saw Quintana Recognition was instant and mutual Neither man stirred Quintana was standing beside a giant hemlock His pack lay at his feet Clinch had halted always the mechanics close to a great ironwood tree Probably both men knew that they could cover themselves before the other moved a muscle Clinch s small light eyes were blazing Quintana s black eyes had become two slits Finally You dirty skunk drawled Clinch in his agreeably misleading voice by Jesus Christ I got you now Ah h said Quintana thees has happen ver nice like I expec Always I say myse f yet a little patience Jose an one day you shall meet thees fellow Clinch who has rob you I am ver thankful to the good God He had made the slightest of movements instantly both men were behind their trees Clinch in the ferocious pride of woodcraft laughed exultingly filled the dim and spectral forest with his roar of laughter Quintana he called out you re a going to cash in Savvy You re a going to hop off An first you gotta hear why Tain t for the stuff Naw I hooked it off n you you hooked it off n me now I got it again That s all square No tain t that grudge you green livered whelp of a cross bred still born slut No It s becuz you laid the heft o your dirty little finger onto my girlie N now you gotta hop Quintana s sinister laughter was his retort Then You damfool Clinch he said I got in my pocket what you rob of me Now I kill you and then I feel ver well I go home live like some kings yes But you he sneered you shall not go home never no more No You shall remain in thees damn wood like ver dead old rat that is all wormy He I got a million dollaire five million franc in my pocket You shall learn what it cost to rob Jose Quintana Unnerstan You liar said Clinch contemptuously I got them jools in my pants pocket Quintana s derisive laugh cut him short I give you thee Flaming Jewel if you show me you got my gems in you pants pocket I ll show you Lay down your rifle so s I see the stock First you my frien Mike said Quintana cautiously Clinch took his rifle by the muzzle and shoved the stock into view so that Quintana could see it without moving To his surprise Quintana did the same then coolly stepped a pace outside the shelter of his hemlock stump You show me now he called across the swamp Clinch stepped into view dug into his pocket and cupping both hands displayed a glittering heap of gems I wanted you should know who s gottem he said before you hop It ll give you something to think over in hell Quintana s eyes had become slits again Neither man stirred Then So you are buzzard eh Clinch You feed on dead man s pockets eh You find Sard somewhere an you feed He held up the morocco case emblazoned with the arms of the Grand Duchess of Esthonia and shook it at Clinch In there is my share Not all Ver quick now I take yours too Clinch vanished and so did his rifle and Quintana s first bullet struck the moss where the stock had rested You black crow jeered Clinch laughing I need that empty case of yours And I m going after it But it s because your filthy claw touched my girlie that you gotta hop Twilight lay over the phantom wood touching with pallid tints the flooded forest So far only that one shot had been fired Both men were still manoeuvring always creeping in circles and always lining some great tree for shelter Now the gathering dusk was making them bolder and swifter and twice already Clinch caught the shadow of a fading edge of something that vanished against the shadows too swiftly for a shot Now Quintana keeping a tree in line brushed with his lithe back a leafless moose bush that stood swaying as he avoided it Instantly a stealthy hope seized him he slipped out of his coat spread it on the bush set the naked branches swaying and darted to his tree Waiting he saw that the grey blot his coat made in the dusk was still moving a little just vibrating a little bit in the twilight He touched the bush with his rifle barrel then crouched almost flat Suddenly the red crash of a rifle lit up Clinch s visage for a fraction of a second And Quintana s bullet smashed Clinch between the eyes After a long while Quintana ventured to rise and creep forward Night too came creeping like an assassin amid the ghostly trees So twilight died in the stillness of Drowned Valley and the pall of night lay over all things living and dead alike EPISODE ELEVEN THE PLACE OF PINES I The last sound that Mike Clinch heard on earth was the detonation of his own rifle Probably it was an agreeable sound to him He lay there with a pleasant expression on his massive features His watch had fallen out of his pocket Quintana shined him with an electric torch picked up the watch Then holding the torch in one hand he went through the dead man s pockets very thoroughly When Quintana had finished both trays of the flat morocco case were full of jewels And Quintana was full of wonder and suspicion Unquietly he looked upon the dead upon the glittering contents of the jewel box but always his gaze reverted to the dead The faintest shadow of a smile edged Clinch s lips Quintana s lips grew graver He said slowly like one who does his thinking aloud What is it you have done to me l ami Clinch Are there truly then two sets of precious stones two Flaming Jewels two gems of Erosite like there never has been in all thees worl excep only two more Or is one set false Have I here one set of paste facsimiles My frien Clinch why do you lie there an smile at me so ver funny like you are amuse I am wondering what you may have done to me my frien Clinch For a while he remained kneeling beside the dead Then Ah bah he said pocketing the morocco case and getting to his feet He moved a little way toward the open trail stopped came back stood his rifle against a tree For a while he was busy with his sharp Spanish clasp knife whittling and fitting together two peeled twigs A cross was the ultimate result Then he placed Clinch s hands palm to palm upon his chest laid the cross on his breast and shined the result with complacency Then Quintana took off his hat L ami Mike he said you were a man Adios Quintana put on his hat The path was free The world lay open before Jose Quintana once more the world his hunting ground But he thought uneasily what is it that I bring home this time How much is paste My God how droll that smile of Clinch Which is the false his jewels or mine Dieu que j etais bete Me who have not suspec that there are two trays within my jewel box I unnerstan It is ver simple In the top tray the false gems Ah Paste on top to deceive a thief Alors Then what I have recover of Clinch is the real Nom de Dieu How should I know His smile is so ver funny I think thees dead man make mock of me all inside himse f So in darkness prowling south by west shining the trail furtively and loaded rifle ready Quintana moved with stealthy unhurried tread out of the wilderness that had trapped him and toward the tangled border of that outer world which led to safe obscure uncharted labyrinths old world mazes immemorial hunting grounds haunted by men who prey The night had turned frosty Quintana wet to the knees and very tired moved slowly not daring to leave the trail because of sink holes However the trail led to Clinch s Dump and sooner or later he must leave it What he had to have was a fire he realised that Somewhere off the trail in big timber if possible he must build a fire and master this deadly chill that was slowly paralysing all power of movement He knew that a fire in the forest particularly in big timber could be seen only a little way He must take his chances with sink holes and find some spot in the forest to build that fire Who could discover him except by accident Who would prowl the midnight wilderness At thirty yards the fire would not be visible And as for the odour well he d be gone before dawn Meanwhile he must have that fire He could wait no longer He cut a pole first Then he left the trail where a little spring flowed west and turned to the right shining the forest floor as he moved and sounding with his pole every wet stretch of moss every strip of mud every tiniest glimmer of water At last he came to a place of pines first growth giants towering into night and looking up saw stars infinitely distant where perhaps those things called souls drifted like wisps of vapour When the fire took Quintana s thin dark hands had become nearly useless from cold He could not have crooked finger to trigger For a long time he sat close to the blaze slowly massaging his torpid limbs but did not dare strip off his foot gear Steam rose from puttee and heavy shoe and from the sodden woollen breeches Warmth slowly penetrated There was little smoke the big dry branches were dead and bleached and he let the fire eat into them without using his axe Once or twice he sighed Oh my God in a weary demi voice as though the content of well being were permeating him Later he ate and drank languidly looking up at the stars speculating as to the possible presence of Mike Clinch up there Ah the dirty thief he murmured nevertheless a man Quel homme Mais bete a faire pleurer Je l ai bien triche moi Ha Quintana smiled palely as he thought of the coat and the gently swaying bush of the red glare of Clinch s shot of the death echo of his own shot Then uneasy he drew out the morocco case and gazed at the two trays full of gems The jewels blazed in the firelight He touched them moved them about picked up several and examined them testing the unset edges against his under lip as an expert tests jade But he couldn t tell there was no knowing He replaced them closed the case pocketed it When he had a chance he could try boiling water for one sort of trick He could scratch one or two Sard would know He wondered whether Sard had got away not concerned except selfishly However there were others in Paris whom he could trust at a price Quintana rested both elbows on his knees and framed his dark face between both bony hands What a chase Clinch had led him after the Flaming Jewel And now Clinch lay dead in the forest faintly smiling At what In a very low passionless voice Quintana cursed monotonously as he gazed into the fire In Spanish French Portuguese Italian he cursed Clinch After a little while he remembered Clinch s daughter and he cursed her elaborately thoroughly wishing her black mischance awake and asleep living or dead Darragh too he remembered in his curses and did not slight him And the trooper Stormont ah he should have killed all of them when he had the chance And those two Baltic Russians also the girl duchess and her friend Why on earth hadn t he made a clean job of it Over caution A wary disinclination to stir up civilization by needless murder But after all old maxims old beliefs old truths are the best God knows The dead don t talk And that s the wisest wisdom of all If murmured Quintana fervently God gives me further opportunity to acquire a little property to comfort me in my old age I shall leave no gossiping fool to do me harm with his tongue No I kill And though they raise a hue and cry dead tongues can not wag and I save myse f much annoyance in the end He leaned his back against the trunk of a massive pine Presently Quintana slept after his own fashion that is to say looking closely at him one could discover a glimmer under his lowered eyelids And he listened always in that kind of sleep As though a shadowy part of him were detached from his body and mounted guard over it The inaudible movement of a wood mouse venturing into the firelit circle awoke Quintana Again a dropping leaf amid distant birches awoke him Such things And so he slept with wet feet to the fire and his rifle across his knees and dreamed of Eve and of murder and that the Flaming Jewel was but a mass of glass At that moment the girl of whose white throat Quintana was dreaming and whining faintly in his dreams stood alone outside Clinch s Dump rifle in hand listening fighting the creeping dread that touched her slender body at times seemed to touch her very heart with frost Clinch s men had gone on to Ghost Lake with their wounded and dead where there was fitter shelter for both All had gone on nobody remained to await Clinch s home coming except Eve Strayer Black Care that tireless squire of dames had followed her from the time she had left Clinch facing the spectral forests of Drowned Valley An odd unusual dread weighted her heart something in emotions that she never before had experienced in time of danger In it there was the deathly unease of premonition But of what it was born she did not understand perhaps of the strain of dangers passed of the shock of discovery concerning Smith s identity with Darragh Darragh the hated kinsman of Harrod the abhorred Fiercely she wondered how much her lover knew about this miserable masquerade Was Stormont involved in this deception Stormont the object of her first girl s passion Stormont for whom she would have died Wretched perplexed fiercely enraged at Darragh deadly anxious concerning Clinch she had gone about cooking supper The supper kept warm on the range still awaited the man who had no more need of meat and drink Of the tragedy of Sard Eve knew nothing There were no traces save in the disorder in the pantry and the bottles and chair on the veranda Who had visited the place excepting those from whom she and Stormont had fled did not appear She had no idea why her step father s mattress and bed quilt lay in the pantry Her heart heavy with ceaseless anxiety Eve carried mattress and bed clothes to Clinch s chamber re made his bed wandered through the house setting it in order then in the kitchen seated herself and waited until the strange dread that possessed her drove her out into the starlight to stand and listen and stare at the dark forest where all her dread seemed concentrated It was not yet dawn but the girl could endure the strain no longer With electric torch and rifle she started for the forest almost running at first then among the first trees moving with caution and in silence along the trail over which Clinch should long since have journeyed homeward In soft places when she ventured to flash her torch foot prints cast curious shadows and it was hard to make out tracks so oddly distorted by the light Prints mingled and partly obliterated other prints She identified her own tracks leading south and guessed at the others pointing north and south where they had carried in the wounded and had gone back to bring in the dead But nowhere could she discover any impression resembling her step father s that great firm stride and solid imprint which so often she had tracked through moss and swale and which she knew so well Once when she got up from her knees after close examination of the muddy trail she became aware of the slightest taint in the night air stood with delicate nostrils quivering advanced still conscious of the taint listening wary every stealthy instinct alert She had not been mistaken somewhere in the forest there was smoke Somewhere a fire was burning It might not be very far away it might be distant Whose fire Her father s Would a hunter of men build a fire The girl stood shivering in the darkness There was not a sound Now keeping her cautious feet in the trail by sense of touch alone she moved on Gradually as she advanced the odour of smoke became more distinct She heard nothing saw nothing but there was a near reek of smoke in her nostrils and she stopped short After a little while in the intense silence of the forest she ventured to touch the switch of her torch very cautiously In the faint pale lustre she saw a tiny rivulet flowing westward from a spring and beside it in the mud imprints of a man s feet The tracks were small narrow slimmer than imprints made by any man she could think of Under the glimmer of her torch they seemed quite fresh contours were still sharp some ready to crumble and water stood in the heels A little way she traced them saw where their maker had cut a pole peeled it saw farther on where this unknown man had probed in moss and mud peppered some particularly suspicious swale with a series of holes as though a giant woodcock had been boring there Who was this man wandering all alone at night off the Drowned Valley trail and probing the darkness with a pole She knew it was not her father She knew that no native none of her father s men would behave in such a manner Nor could any of these have left such narrow almost delicate tracks As she stole along dimly shining the tracks lifting her head incessantly to listen and peer into the darkness her quick eye caught something ahead something very slightly different from the wall of black obscurity a vague hint of colour the very vaguest tint scarcely perceptible at all But she knew it was firelight touching the trunk of an unseen tree Now soundlessly over damp pine needles she crept The scent of smoke grew strong in nostril and throat the pale tint became palely reddish All about her the blackness seemed palpable seemed to touch her body with its weight but ahead a ruddy glow stained two huge pines And presently she saw the fire burning low but redly alive And after a long long while she saw a man He had left the fire circle His pack and belted mackinaw still lay there at the foot of a great tree But when finally she discovered him he was scarcely visible where he crouched in the shadow of a tree trunk with his rifle half lowered at a ready Had he heard her It did not seem possible Had he been crouching there since he made his fire Why had he made it then for its warmth could not reach him there And why was he so stealthily watching silent unstirring crouched in the shadows She strained her eyes but distance and obscurity made recognition impossible And yet somehow every quivering instinct within her was telling her that the crouched and shadowy watcher beyond the fire was Quintana And every concentrated instinct was telling her that he d kill her if he caught sight of her her heart clamoured it her pulses thumped it in her ears Had the girl been capable of it she could have killed him where he crouched She thought of it but knew it was not in her to do it And yet Quintana had boasted that he meant to kill her father That was what terribly concerned her And there must be a way to stop that danger some way to stop it short of murder a way to render this man harmless to her and hers No she could not kill him this way Except in extremes she could not bring herself to fire upon any human creature And yet this man must be rendered harmless somehow somehow ah As the problem presented itself its solution flashed into her mind Men of the wilderness knew how to take dangerous creatures alive To take a dangerous and reasoning human was even less difficult because reason makes more mistakes than does instinct Stealthily without a sound the girl crept back through the shadows over the damp pine needles until peering fearfully over her shoulder she saw the last ghost tint of Quintana s fire die out in the terrific dark behind Slowly still she moved until her sensitive feet felt the trodden path from Drowned Valley Now with torch flaring she ran carrying her rifle at a trail Before her here and there little night creatures fled a humped up raccoon dazzled by the glare a barred owl still struggling with its wood rat kill She ran easily an agile tireless young thing part of the swiftness and silence of the woods part of the darkness the sinuous celerity the ominous hush of wide still places part of its very blood and pulse and hot sweet breath Even when she came out among the birches by Clinch s Dump she was breathing evenly and without distress She ran to the kitchen door but did not enter On pegs under the porch a score or more of rusty traps hung She unhooked the largest wound the chain around it tucked it under her left arm and started back When at last she arrived at the place of pines again and saw the far spectral glimmer of Quintana s fire the girl was almost breathless But dawn was not very far away and there remained little time for the taking alive of a dangerous man Where two enormous pines grew close together near a sapling she knelt down and with both hands scooped out a big hollow in the immemorial layers of pine needles Here she placed her trap It took all her strength and skill to set it to fasten the chain around the base of the sapling pine And now working with only the faintest glimmer of her torch she covered everything with pine needles It was not possible to restore the forest floor the place remained visible a darker rougher patch on the bronzed carpet of needles beaten smooth by decades of rain and snow No animal would have trodden that suspicious space But it was with man she had to deal a dangerous but reasoning man with few and atrophied instincts and with no experience in traps and therefore in no dread of them Before she started she had thrown a cartridge into the breech of her rifle Now she pocketed her torch and seated herself between the two big pines and about three feet behind the hidden trap Dawn was not far away She looked upward through high pine tops where stars shone and saw no sign of dawn But the watcher by the fire beyond was astir now in the imminence of dawn and evidently meant to warm himself before leaving Eve could hear him piling dry wood on the fire the light on the tree trunks grew redder a pungent reek of smoke was drawn through the forest aisles She sniffed it listened and watched her rifle across her knees Eve never had been afraid of anything She was not afraid of this man If it came to combat she would have to kill It never entered her mind to fear Quintana s rifle Even Clinch was not as swift with a rifle as she Only Stormont had been swifter thank God She thought of Stormont sat there in the terrific darkness loving him her heart of a child tremulous with adoration Then the memory of Darragh pushed in and hot hatred possessed her Always in her heart she had distrusted the man Instinct had warned her A spy What evil had he worked already Where was her father Evidently Quintana had escaped him at Drowned Valley Quintana was yonder by his fire preparing to flee the wilderness where men hunted him But where was Clinch Had this sneak Darragh betrayed him Was Clinch already in the clutch of the State Troopers Was he in jail At the thought the girl felt slightly faint then a rush of angry blood stung her face in the darkness Except for game and excise violations the stories they told about Clinch were lies He had nothing to fear nothing to be ashamed of Harrod had driven him to lawlessness the Government took away what was left him to make a living He had to live What if he did break laws made by millionaire and fanatic What of it He had her love and her respect and her deep deep pity And these were enough for any girl to fight for Dawn spread a silvery light above the pines but Quintana s fire still reddened the tree trunks and she could hear him feeding it at intervals Finally she saw him He came out on the edge of the ruddy ring of light and stood peering around at the woods where already a vague greyness was revealing nearer trees When finally he turned his back and looked at his fire Eve rose and stood between the two big pines Behind one of them she placed her rifle It was growing lighter in the woods She could see Quintana in the fire ring and outside saw him go to the spring rivulet lie flat drink then on his knees wash face and hands in the icy water It became plain to her that he was nearly ready to depart She watched him preparing And now she could see him plainly and knew him to be Quintana and no other He had a light basket pack He put some articles into it stretched himself and yawned pulled on his hat hoisted the pack and fastened it to his back stood staring at the fire for a long time then with a sudden upward look at the zenith where a slight flush stained a cloud he picked up his rifle At that moment Eve called to him in a clear and steady voice The effect on Quintana was instant he was behind a tree before her voice ceased Hallo Hi You over there she called again This is Eve Strayer I m looking for Clinch He hasn t been home all night Have you seen him After a moment she saw Quintana s head watching her not at the shoulder height of a man but close to the ground and just above the tree roots Hey she cried What s the matter with you over there I m asking you who you are and if you ve seen my father After a while she saw Quintana coming toward her circling creeping swiftly from tree to tree As he flitted through the shadows the trees between which she was standing hid her from him a moment Instantly she placed her rifle on the ground and kicked the pine needles over it As Quintana continued his encircling manoeuvres Eve apparently perplexed walked out into the clear space putting the concealed trap between her and Quintana who now came stealthily toward her from the rear It was evident that he had reconnoitred sufficiently to satisfy himself that the girl was alone and that no trick no ambuscade threatened him And now from behind a pine and startlingly near her came Quintana moving with confident grace yet holding his rifle ready for any emergency Eve s horrified stare was natural she had not realised that any man could wear so evil a smile Quintana stopped short a dozen paces away The dramatic in him demanded of the moment its full value He swept off his hat with a flourish bowed deeply where he stood Ah he cried gaily the happy encounter Senorita God is too good to us And it was but a moment since my thoughts were of you I swear it It was not fear it was a sort of slow horror of this man that began to creep over the girl She stared at his brilliant eyes at his thick mouth too red shuddered slightly But the toe of her right foot touched the stock of her rifle under the pine needles She held herself under control So it s you she said unsteadily I thought our people had caught you Quintana laughed Charming child he said it is I who have caught your people And now my God I catch you It is ver funny Is it not She looked straight into Quintana s black eyes but the look he returned sent the shamed blood surging into her face By God he said between his white even teeth by God Staring at her he slowly disengaged his pack let it fall behind him on the pine needles rested his rifle on it slipped out of his mackinaw and laid that across his rifle always keeping his brilliant eyes on her His lips tightened the muscles in his dark face grew tense his eyes became a blazing insult For an instant he stood there unencumbered a wiry graceful shape in his woollen breeches leggings and grey shirt open at the throat Then he took a step toward her And the girl watched him fascinated One pace two a third a fourth the girl s involuntary cry echoed the stumbling crash of the man thrashing clawing scrambling in the clenched jaws of the bear trap amid a whirl of flying pine needles He screamed once tried to rise turned blindly to seize the jaws that clutched him and suddenly crouched loose jointed cringing like a trapped wolf the true fatalist among our lesser brothers Eve picked up her rifle She was trembling violently Then mastering her emotion she walked over to the pack placed Quintana s rifle and mackinaw in it coolly hoisted it to her shoulders and buckled it there Over her shoulder she kept an eye on Quintana who crouched where he had fallen unstirring his deadly eyes watching her She placed the muzzle of her rifle against his stomach rested it so holding it with one hand and her finger at the trigger At her brief order he turned out both breeches pockets She herself stooped and drew the Spanish clasp knife from its sheath at his belt took a pistol from the holster another out of his hip pocket Reaching up and behind her she dropped these into the pack Maybe she said slowly your ankle is broken I ll send somebody from Ghost Lake to find you But whether you ve a broken bone or not you ll not go very far Quintana After I m gone you ll be able to free yourself But you can t get away You ll be followed and caught So if you can walk at all you d better go in to Ghost Lake and give yourself up It s that or starvation You ve got a watch Don t stir or touch that trap for half an hour And that s all As she moved away toward the Drowned Valley trail she looked back at him His face was bloodless but his black eyes blazed If ever you come into this forest again she said my father will surely kill you To her horror Quintana slowly grinned at her Then still grinning he placed the forefinger of his left hand between his teeth and bit it Whatever he meant by the gesture it seemed unclean horrible and the girl hurried on seized with an overwhelming loathing through which a sort of terror pulsated like evil premonition in a heavy and tortured heart Straight into the fire of dawn she sped A pale primrose light glimmered through the woods trees bushes undergrowth turned a dusky purple Already the few small clouds overhead were edged with fiery rose Then of a sudden a shaft of flame played over the forest The sun had risen Hastening she searched the soft path for any imprint of her father s foot And even in the vain search she hoped to find him at home hurried on burdened with two rifles and a pack still all nervous and aquiver from her encounter with Quintana Surely surely she thought if he had missed Quintana in Drowned Valley he would not linger in that ghastly place he d come home call in his men take counsel perhaps Mist over Star Pond was dissolving to a golden powder in the blinding glory of the sun The eastern window panes in Clinch s Dump glittered as though the rooms inside were all on fire Down through withered weeds and scrub she hurried ran across the grass to the kitchen door which swung ajar under its porch Dad she called Dad Only her own frightened voice echoed in the empty house She climbed the stairs to his room The bed lay undisturbed as she had made it He was not in any of the rooms there were no signs of him Slowly she descended to the kitchen He was not there The food she had prepared for him had become cold on a chilled range For a long while she stood staring through the window at the sunlight outside Probably since Quintana had eluded him he d come home for something to eat Surely now that Quintana had escaped Clinch would come back for some breakfast Eve slipped the pack from her back and laid it on the kitchen table There was kindling in the wood box She shook down the cinders laid a fire soaked it with kerosene lighted it filled the kettle with fresh water In the pantry she cut some ham and found eggs condensed milk butter bread and an apple pie After she had ground the coffee she placed all these on a tray and carried them into the kitchen Now there was nothing more to do until her father came and she sat down by the kitchen table to wait Outside the sunlight was becoming warm and vivid There had been no frost after all or at most merely a white trace in the shadow on a fallen plank here and there but not enough to freeze the ground And in the sunshine it all quickly turned to dew and glittered and sparkled in a million hues and tints like gems like that handful of jewels she had poured into her father s joined palms yesterday there at the ghostly edge of Drowned Valley At the memory and quite mechanically she turned in her chair and drew Quintana s basket pack toward her First she lifted out his rifle examined it set it against the window sill Then one by one she drew out two pistols loaded the murderous Spanish clasp knife an axe a fry pan and a tin pail and the rolled up mackinaw Under these the pack seemed to contain nothing except food and ammunition staples in sacks and a few cans lard salt tea such things The cartridge boxes she piled up on the table the food she tossed into a tin swill bucket About the effects of this man it seemed to her as though something unclean lingered She could scarcely bear to handle them threw them from her with disgust The garment also the heavy brown and green mackinaw she disliked to touch To throw it out doors was her intention but as she lifted the coat it unrolled and some things fell from the pockets to the kitchen table money keys a watch a flat leather case She looked stupidly at the case It had a coat of arms emblazoned on it Still stupidly and as though dazed she laid one hand on it drew it to her opened it The Flaming Jewel blazed in her face amid a heap of glittering gems Still she seemed slow to comprehend as though understanding were paralysed It was when her eyes fell upon the watch that her heart seemed to stop Suddenly her stunned senses were lighted as by an infernal flare Under the awful blow she swayed upright to her feet sick with fright her eyes fixed on her father s watch It was still ticking She did not know whether she cried out in anguish or was dumb under it The house seemed to reel around her under foot too When she came to her senses she found herself outside the house running with her rifle already entering the woods But inside the barrier of trees something blocked her way stopped her a man her man Eve In God s name he said as she struggled in his arms but she fought him and strove to tear her body from his embrace They ve killed Dad she panted Quintana killed him I didn t know oh I didn t know and I let Quintana go Oh Jack Jack he s at the Place of Pines I m going there to shoot him Let me go he s killed Dad I tell you He had Dad s watch and the case of jewels they were in his pack on the kitchen table Eve Let me go Eve He held her rigid a moment in his powerful grip compelled her dazed half crazed eyes to meet his own You must come to your senses he said Listen to what I say they are bringing in your father Her dilated blue eyes never moved from his We found him in Drowned Valley at sunrise said Stormont quietly The men are only a few rods behind me They are carrying him out Her lips made a word without sound Yes said Stormont in a low voice There was a sound in the woods behind them Stormont turned Far away down the trail the men came into sight Then the State Trooper turned the girl very gently and placed one arm around her shoulders Very slowly they descended the hill together His equipment was shining in the morning sun and the sun fell on Eve s drooping head turning her chestnut hair to fiery gold An hour later Trooper Stormont was at the Place of Pines There was nothing there except an empty trap and the ashes of the dying fire beyond EPISODE TWELVE HER HIGHNESS INTERVENES I Toward noon the wind changed and about one o clock it began to snow Eve exhausted lay on the sofa in her bedroom Her step father lay on a table in the dance hall below covered by a sheet from his own bed And beside him sat Trooper Stormont waiting It was snowing heavily when mister Lyken the little undertaker from Ghost Lake arrived with several assistants a casket and what he called swell trimmings Long ago Mike Clinch had selected his own mortuary site and had driven a section of iron pipe into the ground on a ferny knoll overlooking Star Pond In explanation he grimly remarked to Eve that after death he preferred to be planted where he could see that Old Harrod s ghost didn t trespass Here two of mister Lyken s able assistants dug a grave while the digging was still good for if Mike Clinch was to lie underground that season there might be need of haste no weather prophet ever having successfully forecast Adirondack weather Eve exhausted by shock and a sleepless night was spared the more harrowing details of the coroner s visit and the subsequent jaunty activities of mister Lyken and his efficient assistants She had managed to dress herself in a black wool gown intending to watch by Mike but Stormont s blunt authority prevailed and she lay down for an hour s rest The hour lengthened into many hours the girl slept heavily on her sofa under blankets laid over her by Stormont All that dark snowy day she slept mercifully unconscious of the proceedings below In its own mysterious way the news penetrated the wilderness and out of the desolation of forest and swamp and mountain drifted the people who somehow existed there a few shy half wild young girls a dozen silent lank men two or three of Clinch s own people who stood silently about in the falling snow and lent a hand whenever requested One long shanked youth cut hemlock to line the grave others erected a little fence of silver birch around it making of the enclosure a plot A gaunt old woman from God knows where aided mister Lyken at intervals a pretty sulky eyed girl with her slovenly red headed sister cooked for anybody who desired nourishment When Mike was ready to hold the inevitable reception everybody filed into the dance hall mister Lyken was master of ceremonies Trooper Stormont stood very tall and straight by the head of the casket Clinch wore a vague indefinable smile and his best clothes that same smile which had so troubled Jose Quintana Light was fading fast in the room when the last visitor took silent leave of Clinch and rejoined the groups in the kitchen where were the funeral baked meats Eve still slept Descending again from his reconnaissance Trooper Stormont encountered Trooper Lannis below Has anybody picked up Quintana s tracks inquired the former Not so far An Inspector and two State Game Protectors are out beyond Owl Marsh The Troopers from Five Lakes are on the job and we have enforcement men along Drowned Valley from The Scaur to Harrod Place Does Darragh know Yes He s in there with Mike He brought a lot of flowers from Harrod Place The two troopers went into the dance hall where Darragh was arranging the flowers from his greenhouses Stormont said quietly All right Jim but Eve must not know that they came from Harrod s Darragh nodded How is she Jack All in Do you know the story Yes Mike went into Drowned Valley early last evening after Quintana He didn t come back Before dawn this morning Eve located Quintana set a bear trap for him and caught him with the goods What goods demanded Darragh sharply Well she got his pack and found Mike s watch and jewelry in it What jewelry The jewels Quintana was after But that was after she d arrived at the Dump here leaving Quintana to get free of the trap and beat it That s how I met her half crazed going to find Quintana again We d found Mike in Drowned Valley and were bringing him out when I ran into Eve I brought her back here and called Ghost Lake They haven t picked up Quintana s tracks so far After a silence Too bad this snow came so late remarked Trooper Lannis But we ought to get Quintana anyway Darragh went over and looked silently at Mike Clinch I liked you he said under his breath It wasn t your fault And it wasn t mine Mike I ll try to square things Don t worry He came back slowly to where Stormont was standing near the door Jack he said you can t marry Eve on a Trooper s pay Why not quit and take over the Harrod estate You and I can go into business together later if you like After a pause That s rather wonderful of you Jim said Stormont but you don t know what sort of business man I d make I know what sort of officer you made I m taking no chance And I ll make my peace with Eve or somebody will do it for me Is it settled then Thanks said Trooper Stormont reddening They clasped hands Then Stormont went about and lighted the candles in the room Clinch s face again revealed was still faintly amused at something or other The dead have much to be amused at As Darragh was about to go Stormont said We re burying Clinch at eleven to morrow morning The Ghost Lake Pilot officiates I ll come if it won t upset Eve said Darragh She won t notice anybody I fancy remarked Stormont He stood by the veranda and watched Darragh take the Lake Trail through the snow Finally the glimmer of his swinging lantern was lost in the woods and Stormont mounted the stairs once more stood silently by Eve s open door realised she was still heavily asleep and seated himself on a chair outside her door to watch and wait All night long it snowed hard over the Star Pond country and the late grey light of morning revealed a blinding storm pelting a white robed world Toward ten o clock Stormont on guard noticed that Eve was growing restless Downstairs the flotsam of the forest had gathered again mister Lyken was there in black gloves the Reverend Laomi Smatter had arrived in a sleigh from Ghost Lake Both were breakfasting heavily The pretty sulky faced girl fetched a tray and placed Eve s breakfast on it and Trooper Stormont carried it to her room She was awake when he entered He set the tray on the table She put both arms around his neck Jack she murmured her eyes tremulous with tears Everything has been done he said Will you be ready by eleven I ll come for you She clung to him in silence for a while At eleven he knocked on her door She opened it She wore her black wool gown and a black fur turban Some of her pallor remained traces of tears and bluish smears under both eyes But her voice was steady Could I see Dad a moment alone Of course She took his arm they descended the stairs There seemed to be many people about but she did not lift her eyes until her lover led her into the dance hall where Clinch lay smiling his mysterious smile Then Stormont left her alone there and closed the door In a terrific snow storm they buried Mike Clinch on the spot he had selected in order that he might keep a watchful eye upon the trespassing ghost of old man Harrod It blew and stormed and stormed and the thin nasal voice of reverend Smatter was utterly lost in the wind The slanting lances of snow drove down on the casket building a white mound over the flowers blotting the hemlock boughs from sight There was no time to be lost now the ground was freezing under a veering and bitter wind out of the west mister Lyken s talented assistants had some difficulty in shaping the mound which snow began to make into a white and flawless monument The last slap of the spade rang with a metallic jar across the lake where snow already blotted the newly forming film of ice the human denizens of the wilderness filtered back into it one by one reverend Smatter got into his sleigh plainly concerned about the road mister Lyken betrayed unprofessional haste in loading his wagon with his talented assistants and starting for Ghost Lake A Game Protector or two put on snow shoes when they departed Trooper Lannis led out his horse and Stormont s and got into the saddle I d better get these beasts into Ghost Lake while I can he said You ll follow on snow shoes won t you Jack I don t know I may need a sleigh for Eve She can t remain here all alone I ll telephone the Inn Darragh in blanket outfit a pair of snow shoes on his back a rifle in his mittened hand came trudging up from the lake He and Stormont watched Lannis riding away with the two horses He ll make it all right but it s time he started said the latter Darragh nodded Some storm Where is Eve In her room What is she going to do Jack Marry me as soon as possible She wants to stay here for a few days but I can t leave her here alone I think I ll telephone to Ghost Lake for a sleigh Let me talk to her said Darragh in a low voice Do you think you d better at such a time I think it s a good time It will divert her mind anyway I want her to come to Harrod Place She won t said Stormont grimly She might Let me talk to her Do you realise how she feels toward you Jim I do indeed And I don t blame her But let me tell you Eve Strayer is the most honest and fair minded girl I ever knew Except one I ll take a chance that she ll listen to me Sooner or later she will be obliged to hear what I have to tell her But it will be easier for her for everybody if I speak to her now Let me try Jack Stormont hesitated looked at him nodded Darragh stood his rifle against the bench on the kitchen porch They entered the house slowly And met Eve descending the stairs The girl looked at Darragh astonished then her pale face flushed with anger What are you doing in this house she demanded unsteadily Have you no decency no shame Yes he said I am ashamed of what my kinsman has done to you and yours That is partly why I am here You came here as a spy she said with hot contempt You lied about your name you lied about your purpose You came here to betray Dad If he d known it he would have killed you Yes he would have But do you know why I came here Eve I ve told you And you are wrong I didn t come here to betray Mike Clinch I came to save him Do you suppose I believe a man who has lied to Dad she cried I don t ask you to Eve I shall let somebody else prove what I say I don t blame you for your attitude God knows I don t blame Mike Clinch He stood up like a man to Henry Harrod All I ask is to undo some of the rotten things that my uncle did to you and yours And that is partly why I came here The girl said passionately Neither Dad nor I want anything from Harrod Place or from you Do you suppose you can come here after Dad is dead and pretend you want to make amends for what your uncle did to us Eve said Darragh gravely I ve made some amends already You don t know it but I have You may not believe it but I liked your father He was a real man Had anybody done to me what Henry Harrod did to your father I d have behaved as your father behaved I d never have budged from this spot I d have hunted where I chose I d have borne an implacable hatred against Henry Harrod and Harrod Place and every soul in it The girl silenced looked at him without belief He said I am not surprised that you distrust what I say But the man you are going to marry was a junior officer in my command I have no closer friend than Jack Stormont Ask him whether I am to be believed Astounded the girl turned a flushed incredulous face to Stormont He said You may trust Darragh as you trust me I don t know what he has to say to you dear But whatever he says will be the truth Darragh said gravely Through a misunderstanding your father came into possession of stolen property Eve He did not know it had been stolen I did But Mike Clinch would not have believed me if I had told him that the case of jewels in his possession had been stolen from a woman Quintana stole them By accident they came into your father s possession I learned of this I had promised this woman to recover her jewels I came here for that purpose Eve And for two reasons first because I learned that Quintana also was coming here to rob your father of these gems second because when I knew your father and knew you I concluded that it would be an outrage to call on the police It would mean prison for Clinch misery and ruin for you Eve So I tried to steal the jewels to save you both He looked at Stormont who seemed astonished To whom do these jewels belong Jim demanded the trooper To the young Grand Duchess of Esthonia Do you remember that I befriended her over there Yes Do you remember that the Reds were accused of burning her chateau and looting it Yes I remember Well it was Quintana and his gang of international criminals who did that said Darragh drily And to Eve By accident this case of jewels emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Grand Duchess of Esthonia came into your father s possession That is the story Eve There was a silence The girl looked at Stormont flushed painfully looked at Darragh Then without a word she turned ascended the stairs and reappeared immediately carrying the leather case Thank you mister Darragh she said simply and laid the case in his hand But said Darragh I want you to do a little more Eve The owner of these gems is my guest at Harrod Place I want you to give them to her yourself I I can t go to Harrod Place stammered the girl Please don t visit the sins of Henry Harrod on me Eve I don t But but that place After a silence If Eve feels that way began Stormont awkwardly I couldn t become associated with you in business Jim I d rather sell Harrod Place than lose you retorted Darragh almost sharply I want to go into business with you Jack if Eve will permit me She stood looking at Stormont the heightened colour playing in her cheeks as she began to comprehend the comradeship between these two men Slowly she turned to Darragh offered her hand I ll go to Harrod Place she said in a low voice Darragh s quick smile brightened the sombre gravity of his face Eve he said when I came over here this morning from Harrod Place I was afraid you would refuse to listen to me I was afraid you would not even see me And so I brought with me somebody to whom I felt certain you would listen I brought with me a young girl a poor refugee from Russia once wealthy to day almost penniless Her name is Theodorica Once she was Grand Duchess of Esthonia But this morning a clergyman from Five Lakes changed her name To such friends as you and Jack she is Ricca Darragh now and she s having a wonderful time on her new snow shoes He took Eve by one hand and Stormont by the other and drew them to the kitchen door and kicked it open Through the swirling snow over on the lake slope at the timber edge a graceful boyish figure in scarlet and white wool moved swiftly over the drifts with all the naive delight of a child with a brand new toy As Darragh strode out into the open the distant figure flung up one arm in salutation and came racing over the drifts her brilliant scarf flying All aglow and a trifle breathless she met Darragh just beyond the veranda rested one mittened hand on his shoulder while he knelt and unbuckled her snow shoes stepped lightly from them and came forward to Eve with out stretched hand and a sudden winning gravity in her lovely face We shall be friends surely she said in her quick winning voice because my husband has told me and I am so grieved for you and I need a girl friend Holding both Eve s hands her mittens dangling from her wrist she looked into her eyes very steadily Slowly Eve s eyes filled more slowly still Ricca kissed her on both cheeks framed her face in both hands kissed her lightly on the lips Then still holding Eve s hands she turned and looked at Stormont I remember you now she said You were with my husband in Riga She freed her right hand and held it out to Stormont He had the grace to kiss it and did it very well for a Yankee Together they entered the kitchen door and turned into the dining room on the left where were chairs around the plain pine table Darragh said The new mistress of Harrod Place has selected your quarters Eve They adjoin the quarters of her friend the Countess Orloff Strelwitz Valentine begged me said Ricca smiling She is going to be lonely without me All hours of day and night we were trotting into one another s rooms She looked gravely at Eve You will like Valentine and she will like you very much As for me I already love you She put one arm around Eve s shoulders How could you even think of remaining here all alone Why I should never close my eyes for thinking of you dear Eve s head drooped she said in a stifled voice I ll go with you I want to I m very tired We had better go now said Darragh Your things can be brought over later If you ll dress for snow shoeing Jack can pack what clothes you need Are there snow shoes for him too Eve turned tragically to her lover In Dad s closet she said choking then turned and went up the stairs still clinging to Ricca s hand and drawing her with her Stormont followed entered Clinch s quarters and presently came downstairs again carrying Clinch s snow shoes and a basket pack He seated himself near Darragh After a silence Your wife is beautiful Jim Her character seems to be even more beautiful She s like God s own messenger to Eve And you re rather wonderful yourself Nonsense said Darragh I ve given my wife her first American friend and I ve done a shrewd stroke of business in nabbing the best business associate I ever heard of You re crazy but kind I hope I ll be some good One thing I ll never get over what you ve done for Eve in this crisis There ll be no crisis Jack Marry and hook up with me in business That solves everything Lord what a life Eve has had But you ll make it all up to her all this loneliness and shame and misery of Clinch s Dump Stormont touched his arm in caution Eve and Ricca came down the stairs the former now in the grey wool snow shoe dress and carrying her snow shoes black gown and toilet articles Stormont began to stow away her effects in the basket pack Darragh went over to her and took her hand I m so glad we are to be friends he said It hurt a lot to know you held me in contempt But I had to go about it that way Eve nodded Then suddenly recollecting Oh she exclaimed reddening I forgot the jewel case It s under my pillow She turned and sped upstairs and reappeared almost instantly carrying the jewel case Breathless flushed thankful and happy in the excitement of restitution she placed the leather case in Ricca s hands My jewels cried the girl astounded Then with a little cry of delight she placed the case upon the table stripped open the emblazoned cover and emptied the two trays All over the table rolled the jewels flashing scintillating ablaze with blinding light And at the same instant the outer door crashed open and Quintana covered them with Darragh s rifle Now by Christ he shouted who stirs a finger shall go to God in one jump You my gendarme frien you my frien Smith turn your damn backs han s up high tha s the way now ladies back away there get back or I kill sure by Jesus I kill you like I would some white little mice With incredible quickness he stepped forward and swept the jewels into one hand filled the pocket of his trousers caught up every stray stone and pocketed them You gendarme he cried in a menacing voice you think you shall follow in my track Yes I blow your damn head off if you stir before the hour After that well follow and be damn Even as he spoke he stepped outside and slammed the door and Darragh and Stormont leaped for it Then the loud detonation of Quintana s rifle was echoed by the splintering rip of bullets tearing through the closed door and both men halted in the face of the leaden hail Eve ran to the pantry window and saw Quintana in somebody s stolen lumber sledge lash a big pair of horses to a gallop and go floundering past into the Ghost Lake road As he sped by in a whirl of snow he fired five times at the house then rising and swinging his whip he flogged the frantic horses into the woods In the dining room Stormont red with rage and shame and having found his rifle in the corridor outside Eve s bedroom was trying to open the shutters for a shot and Darragh empty handed searched the house frantically for a weapon Eve terribly excited came from the pantry He s gone she cried furiously He s in somebody s lumber sledge with a pair of horses and he s driving west like the devil Stormont ran to the tap room telephone cranked it and warned the constabulary at Five Lakes Good God he exclaimed turning to Darragh scarlet with mortification what a ghastly business I never dreamed he was within miles of Clinch s It s the most shameful thing that ever happened to me What could anybody do under that rifle said Eve hotly That beast would have murdered the first person who stirred Darragh exasperated and dreadfully humiliated looked miserably at his brand new wife Eve and Stormont also looked at her She had come forward from the rear of the stairway where Quintana had brutally driven her Now she stood with one hand on the empty leather jewel case looking at everybody out of pretty bewildered eyes To Darragh in a perplexed unsteady voice Is it the same bandit who robbed us before Yes Quintana he said wretchedly Rage began to redden his features Ricca he said I promised I d find your jewels I promise you again that I ll never drop this business until your gems and the Flaming Jewel are in your possession But Jim I swear it he exclaimed violently I m not such a stupid fool as I seem Dear she protested excitedly you have done what you promised My gems are in my possession I believe She caught up the emblazoned case stripped out the first tray then the second and flung them aside Then searching with the delicate tip of her forefinger in the empty case she suddenly pressed the bottom hard thumb middle finger and little finger forming the three apexes of an equilateral triangle There came a clear tiny sound like the ringing of the alarm in a repeating watch Very gently the false bottom of the case detached itself and came away in the palm of her hand And there each embedded in its own shaped compartment of chamois lay the Esthonian jewels the true ones deep hidden always doubly guarded by two sets of perfect imitations lining the two visible trays above And in the centre blazed the Erosite gem the magnificent Flaming Jewel a glory of living blinding fire Nobody stirred or spoke Darragh blinked at the crystalline blaze as though stunned Then the young girl who had once been Her Serene Highness Theodorica Grand Duchess of Esthonia looked up at her brand new husband and laughed Did you really suppose it was these that brought me across the ocean Did you suppose it was a passion for these that filled my heart Did you think it was for these that I followed you She laughed again turned to Eve You understand Tell him that if he had been in rags I would have followed him like a gypsy They say there is gypsy blood in us God knows I think perhaps there is a little of it in all real women Still laughing she placed her hand lightly upon her heart In all women perhaps a Flaming Jewel imbedded here Her eyes tender and mocking met his she lifted the jewel case closed it and placed it in his hands Now she said you have everything in your possession and we are safe we are quite safe now my jewels and I Then she went to Eve and rested both hands on her shoulders Shall we put on our snow shoes and go home Stormont flung open the bullet splintered door Outside in the snow he dropped on both knees to buckle on Eve s snow shoes Darragh was performing a like office for his wife and the State Trooper being unobserved took Eve s slim hands and kissed them looking up at her where he was kneeling Her pale face blushed as it had that day in the woods on Owl Marsh so long so long ago when this man s lips first touched her hands As their eyes met both remembered Then she smiled at her lover with the shy girl s soul of her gazing out at him through eyes as blue as the wild blind gentians that grow among the ferns and mosses of Star Pond Far away in the northwestern forests Quintana still lashed his horses through the primeval pines Triumphant reckless resourceful dangerous he felt that now nothing could stop him nothing bar his way to freedom Out of the wilderness lay his road and his destiny out of it he must win his way by strategy by cunning by violence creep out lie his way out shoot his way out it scarcely mattered He was going out He was going back to life once more Who could forbid him Who stop him Who deny him now when in his pockets he held all that was worth living for the keys to power to pleasure the key to everything on earth In fierce exultation he slapped the glass jewels in his pocket and laughed aloud The keys to the world he cried Let him stop me and take them who is a better man than I Then his long whip whistled and he cursed his horses Then of a sudden close by in the snowy road ahead he saw a State Trooper on snow shoes saw the upflung arm warning him screamed curses at his horses flogged them forward to crush this thing to death that dared menace him this object that suddenly rose up out of nowhere to snatch from him the keys of the world For a moment the State Trooper looked after the runaway horses There was no use following they d have to run till they dropped Then he lowered the levelled rifle from his shoulder looked grimly at the limp thing which had tumbled from the sledge into the snowy road and which sprawled there crimsoning the spotless flakes that fell upon it THE END Novels by ROBERT W CHAMBERS THE FLAMING JEWEL THE TREE OF HEAVEN THE LITTLE RED FOOT THE MOONLIT WAY THE SLAYER OF SOULS IN
