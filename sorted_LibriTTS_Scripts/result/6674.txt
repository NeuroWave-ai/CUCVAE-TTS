UMBRELLA CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY Can it be possibly believed by the present eminently practical generation that a busy people like the English whose diversified occupations so continually expose them to the chances and changes of a proverbially fickle sky had ever been ignorant of the blessings bestowed on them by that dearest and truest friend in need and in deed the UMBRELLA Can you gentle reader for instance realise to yourself the idea of a man not possessing such a convenience for rainy weather Why so much unmerited ridicule should be poured upon the head or handle of the devoted Umbrella it is hard to say What is there comic in an Umbrella Plain useful and unpretending if any of man s inventions ever deserved sincere regard the Umbrella is we maintain that invention Only a few years back those who carried Umbrellas were held to be legitimate butts They were old fogies careful of their health and so on but now a days we are wiser Everybody has his Umbrella It is both cheaper and better made than of old who then so poor he cannot afford one To see a man going out in the rain umbrella less excites as much mirth as ever did the sight of those who first wiser than their generation availed themselves of this now universal shelter Yet still a touch of the amusing clings to the Gamp as it is sarcastically called What says Douglas Jerrold on the subject There are three things that no man but a fool lends or having lent is not in the most helpless state of mental crassitude if he ever hopes to get back again These three things my son are BOOKS UMBRELLAS and MONEY I believe a certain fiction of the law assumes a remedy to the borrower but I know of no case in which any man being sufficiently dastard to gibbet his reputation as plaintiff in such a suit ever fairly succeeded against the wholesome prejudices of society Umbrellas may be hedged about by cobweb statutes I will not swear it is not so there may exist laws that make such things property but sure I am that the hissing contempt the loud mouthed indignation of all civilised society would sibilate and roar at the bloodless poltroon who should engage law on his side to obtain for him the restitution of a lent Umbrella Strange to say it is a fact melancholy enough but for all that too true that our forefathers scarce seventy years agone meekly endured the pelting of the pitiless storm without that protection vouchsafed to their descendants by a kind fate and talented inventors The fact is the Umbrella forms one of the numerous conveniences of life which seem indispensable to the present generation because just so long a time has passed since their introduction that the contrivances which in some certain degree previously supplied their place have passed into oblivion We feel the convenience we possess without being always aware of the gradations which intervened between it and the complete inconvenience of being continually unsheltered from the rain without any kind friend from whom to seek the protection so ardently desired Fortunately a very simple process will enable the reader to realise the fact in its full extent he need only walk about in a pelting shower for some hours without an Umbrella or when the weight of a cloak would be insupportable and at the same time remember that seventy years ago a luxury he can now purchase in almost every street was within the reach of but very few while omnibuses and cabs were unknown But apart from considerations of comfort we may safely claim very much higher qualities as appertaining to the Umbrella We may even reckon it among the causes that have contributed to lengthen the average of human life and hold it a most effective agent in the great increase which took place in the population of England between the years seventeen fifty and eighteen fifty as compared with the previous century The Registrar General in his census report forgot to mention this fact but there appears to us not the slightest doubt that the introduction of the Umbrella at the latter part of the former and commencement of the present century must have greatly conduced to the improvement of the public health by preserving the bearer from the various and numerous diseases superinduced by exposure to rain But perhaps we are a little harsh on our worthy ancestors they may have possessed some species of protection from the rain on which they prided themselves as much as we do on our Umbrellas and regarded the new fangled invention as they no doubt termed it as something exceedingly absurd coxcombical and unnecessary while we who are in possession of so many life comforts of which those of the good old times were supremely ignorant among these we give the Umbrella brevet rank can afford to smile at such ebullitions as we have come across in those books of the day we have consulted and to which we shall presently have an opportunity of referring We can happily estimate the value of such a friend as the Umbrella the silent companion of our walks abroad a companion incomparably superior to those slimy waterproof abominations so urgently recommended to us for at the least the Umbrella cannot be accused of injuring the health as they have been as it appears with very good reason In fact so long as the climate of England remains as it is so long will Umbrellas hold their ground in public esteem and we do not believe that the clerk of the weather will allow himself to be bribed into any alteration at least for trade considerations Another remarkable proof of the utility of the Umbrella may be found in the universality of its use It has asserted its sway from Indus to the Pole and is to be met with in every possible variety from the Napoleon blue silk of the London exquisite to the coarse red or green cotton of the Turkish rayah Throughout the Continent it forms the peaceful armament of the peasant and no more curious sight can be imagined than the wide uncovered market place of some quaint old German town during a heavy shower when every industrial covers himself or herself with the aegis of a portable tent and a bright array of brass ferrules and canopies of all conceivable hues which cotton can be made to assume without losing its one quality of fast colour flash on the spectator s vision The advantages of the Umbrella being thus recognised it must be confessed that it has hitherto been treated in a most ungrateful and step motherly fashion We fly to the Umbrella when the sky is overcast it affords us shelter in the hour of need and the service is forgotten as soon as the necessity is relieved We make abominable jokes upon the Umbrella we borrow it without compunction from any confiding friend though with the full intention of never returning it in fact it has often been a matter of surprise to us that any one ever does buy an Umbrella for where can the old Umbrellas go to Although that question has often been asked concerning the fate of pins the fact as regards the former looking at their size is more curious and yet for all that we treat it with shameful neglect as if ashamed of a crime we have committed and anxious to conceal the evidences of our guilt Let us then strive to afford such reparation as in our power lies by giving a slight description of THE UMBRELLA AND ITS HISTORY making up for any deficiencies of our pen by the assistance of the artist s pencil CHAPTER II THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE UMBRELLA The Umbrella is derived from a stately family that of the Parasol the legitimate use of the Umbrella though sufficiently obvious being almost ignored in those countries whence it derives its being since it was as a protection against the scorching heat of the sun that it was first used The Parasol then or Umbrella since for all practical purposes the two are really identical dates from the earliest ages some commentators on the Bible fancying they can discover it in places where a shade protecting from the sun is mentioned This is not unlikely but it is certain that the Parasol has been in use from a very early period Chinese history goes a very long way back inasmuch as it places the invention of these elegant machines many thousand years anterior to the Mosaic date of the world s creation Their antiquity among the Hindoos is more satisfactorily proved by the following passage from the dramatic poem of S akuntala the date of which is supposed to be the sixth century of the Christian era The cares of supporting the nation harass the sovereign while he is cheered with a view of the people s welfare as a huge Umbrella of which a man bears the staff in his own hand fatigues while it shades him The sovereign like a branching tree bears on his head the scorching sunbeams while the broad shade allays the fever of those who seek shelter under him The origin of the Parasol is wrapped in considerable obscurity Some profound investigators have supposed that large leaves tied to the branching extremities of a bough suggested the first idea of the invention Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent which remains in form unaltered to the present day doctor Morrison however tells us that the tradition existing in China is that the San which signifies a shade for sun and rain originated in standards and banners waving in the air As this is a case in which we may quote the line Who shall decide when doctors disagree we may with safety assume that all are in the right and that the Parasol owed its origin to all or any of the above mentioned fortuitous circumstances In the Ninevite sculptures the Umbrella or Parasol appears frequently Layard gives a picture of a bas relief representing a king in his chariot with an attendant holding an Umbrella over his head It has a curtain hanging down behind but is otherwise exactly like those in use at the present time the stretchers and sliding runner being plainly represented To quote the words of that indefatigable traveller The Umbrella or Parasol the emblem of royalty so universally accepted by eastern nations was generally carried over the king in time of peace and sometimes even in time of war In shape it resembled very closely those in common use but it is always open in the sculptures It was edged with tassels and was usually ornamented at the top by a flower or some other ornament On the later bas reliefs a long piece of embroidered linen or silk falling from one side like a curtain appears to screen the king completely from the sun The parasol was reserved exclusively for the monarch and is never represented as borne over any other person In Egypt again the Parasol is found in various shapes In some instances it is depicted as a flabellum a fan of palm leaves or coloured feathers fixed on a long handle resembling those now carried behind the Pope in processions Sir Gardner Wilkinson in his work on Egypt has an engraving of an Ethiopian princess travelling through Upper Egypt in a chariot a kind of Umbrella fastened to a stout pole rises in the centre bearing a close affinity to what are now termed chaise Umbrellas To judge from Wilkinson s account the Umbrella was generally used throughout Egypt partly as a mark of distinction but more on account of its useful than its ornamental qualities The same author is rather doubtful whether in the picture given by him of a military chief in his chariot the frame which an attendant holds up behind the rider is a shield or a screen but the latter is the more probable supposition as it has all the appearance of an Umbrella without the usual handle In some paintings on a temple wall an Umbrella is held over the figure of a god carried in procession and altogether we may perhaps consider it decided beyond dispute that the Umbrella in its modern shape was used in Egypt Footnote To silence captious critics who may find fault with the designs of our artist we may once for all remark that an idealised conception of the figures only is given The style of the ancient draughtsmen was by no means so perfect that we who live in a more civilised age should be entirely fettered by their conceptions and the records of ancient life are not nearly full enough to justify any one who may Assert that the pictures in our pages are not as accurate as those in the British Museum Anyhow what they ought to have been rather than what the ancient were our artist has striven to delineate In Persia the Parasol is repeatedly found in the carved work of Persepolis and Sir John Malcolm has an article on the subject in his History of Persia In some sculptures of a very Egyptian character by the way the figure of a king appears attended by a slave who carries over his head an Umbrella with stretchers and runner complete In other sculptures on the rock at Takht i Bostan supposed to be not less than twelve centuries old a deer hunt is represented at which a king looks on seated on a horse and having an Umbrella borne over his head by an attendant This combination of business and comfort forcibly reminds us of a certain wet day in Carlsruhe where we witnessed from the window of the Hotel d Angleterre a stout martial looking national guardsman marching to the exercising ground with an Umbrella over his head and a maid servant diligently tramping through the mud behind him bearing his musket As in Assyria so in most other Eastern countries this use of the Parasol carried with it a peculiar and honourable significance The tradition relating to its origin in China has been already alluded to and we can trace notices of its use a very long way back indeed According to doctor Morrison Umbrellas and Parasols are referred to in books printed about A D three hundred but their use has been traced still further back than this A very ancient book of Chinese ceremonies called Tcheou Li or The Rites of Tcheou directs that upon the imperial cars the dais should be placed The figure of this dais contained in the Chinese edition of Tcheou Li and the particular description of it given in the explanatory commentary of Lin hi ye both identify it with an Umbrella The latter describes the dais to be composed of twenty eight arcs which are equivalent to the whalebone ribs of the modern instrument and the staff supporting the covering to consist of two parts the upper being a rod three eighteenths of a Chinese foot in circumference and the lower a tube six tenths in circumference into which the upper half is capable of sliding In the second Tartar invasion of China the emperor s son was taken prisoner by the Tartar chief and made to carry his Umbrella when he went out hunting Starting from the royal significance attached to the Umbrella came a feeling of veneration for it very different from the contempt with which we are now a days too apt to regard it It was represented by many ancient nations as shading their gods In the Hindoo mythology Vishnu is said to have paid a visit to the infernal regions with his Umbrella over his head One would think that in few places could an Umbrella have been less appropriate but doubtless Vishnu knew what he was about and had his own reasons for carrying his Parapluie under his arm Perhaps like missus Gamp he could not be separated from it So much for the ancient history of our subject in the East We may now go on to countries about which we know a little more than of ancient China and Assyria In Greece as Becker tells us in his Charicles the Parasol was an indispensable adjunct to a lady of fashion It had also its religious signification In the Scirophoria the feast of Athene Sciras a white Parasol was borne by the priestesses of the goddess from the Acropolis to the Phalerus In the feasts of Dionysius in that at Alea in Arcadia where he was exposed under an Umbrella and elsewhere the Umbrella was used and in an old has relief the same god is represented as descending ad inferos with a small Umbrella in his hand like Vishnu before mentioned There was also another festival in which they appeared though without any mystical signification In the Panathenaea the daughters of the Metceci or foreign residents carried Parasols over the heads of Athenian women as a mark of inferiority tas parthenons ton metoikon skiadaephorein en tais rompais aenankazon OElian V H vi one Footnote They compelled the maidens of the Metceci to act as umbrella bearers in the processions Its use seems to have been confined to women In Pausanias there is a description of a tomb near Pharae a Greek city On the tomb was the figure of a woman themapaina de autae prosestaeke skiadeion pherousa Pausanias lib vii cap twenty two Section six Footnote And by her stood a female slave bearing a parasol Aristophanes seems to mention it among the common articles of female use aemin men gar son eti kai nun tantion o kanon oi kalathiokoi to skiadeion Aristophanes Thesmoph eight hundred twenty one Footnote For now our loom is safe our weaving

gunaixin autos Athenaeus lib xii cap forty six Section five hundred thirty four Footnote He carries an ivory parasol as women do Plutarch makes Aristides speak of Xerxes as sitting under a canopy or Umbrella looking at the sea fight kathaeenos hupd skiadi chrysae Plut Therm c sixteen p one hundred twenty Footnote Sitting under a golden canopy and of Cleopatra in like manner upo skiadi chrysopasto Plut Anton c twenty six p nine hundred twenty seven Footnote Under a gold wrought canopy From Greece it is probable that the use of the Parasol passed to Rome where it seems to have been commonly used by women while it was the custom even for effeminate men to defend themselves from the heat by means of the Umbraculum formed of skin or leather and capable of being lowered at will We find frequent reference to the Umbrella in the Roman Classics and it appears that it was not unlikely a post of honour among maid servants to bear it over their mistresses Allusions to it are tolerably frequent in the poets Virgil s Munimen ad imbres Footnote A shelter for the shower probably has nothing to do with Umbrellas but more definite mention of them is not wanting Ovid speaks of Hercules carrying the Parasol of Omphale Aurea pellebant rapidos umbracula soles Quae tamen Herculeae sustinuere manus Ov Fast lib ii one thirty one I Footnote A golden umbrella warded off the keen sun which even the hands of Hercules have borne Martial speaks of a servant carrying the Parasol Umbellam lusca Lygde feras Dominae Mart lib xi ch seventy three Footnote Mayst thou Lygde be parasol carrier for a publind mistress Juvenal mentions an Umbrella as a present En cui tu viridem umbellam cui succina mittas Juv ix fifty Footnote See to whom it is sent a green umbrella and amber ornaments Ovid advises a lover to make himself agreeable by holding his mistress s Parasol Ipse tene distenta suis umbracula virgis Ov Ars Am ii two hundred nine Footnote Yourself hold up the umbrella spread out by its rods This shows that the Umbrella was of much the same construction as ours A very common use for it was in the theatre whenever from wind or other cause the velarium or huge awning stretched over the building always open to the air could not be put up Accipe quae nimios vincant umbracula soles Sit licet et ventus te tua vela tegont Mart lib xiv Ep twenty eight Footnote Take this which may shield you from the sun s excessive rays So may your own sail shield you even should the breeze blow By tua vela is to be understood your own Umbrella And elsewhere the same writer gives the advice Ingrediare viam coelo licet usque sereno Ad subitas nunquam scortea desit aquas Man lib xiv Ep one hundred thirty Footnote Though with a bright sky you begin your journey let this cloak ever be at hand in case of unexpected showers It will be noticed from the above extracts that the Umbrella does not appear to have been used among the Romans as a defence from rain and this is curious enough for we know that the theatres were protected by the velarium or awning which was drawn across the arena whenever a sudden shower came on strange that this self evident application of the Umbrella should not have occurred to a nation generally so ingenious in the invention of every possible luxury Possibly the expense bestowed in the decoration of the umbraculum was a reason for its not being applied to what we cannot but regard as its legitimate use After the founding of Constantinople the custom of great people carrying an Umbrella seems to have arisen but in Rome it appears only to have been used as a luxury never as a mark of distinction Pliny speaks of Umbrellas made of palm leaves but from other sources we may gather that the Romans at all events in the days of the empire lavished as much splendour on their Umbrella as on all the articles of their dress Ovid as above quoted speaks of an Umbrella inwrought with gold and Claudian in the same way has Neu defensura calorem Aurea submoveant rapidos umbracula soles Claud lib viii De iv cons Honorii one three hundred forty Footnote Nor to protect you from the heat let the golden umbrella ward off the keen sun s rays From this we may conclude that the carrying an Umbrella was in some sort a mark of effeminacy In another place carrying the Umbrella is alluded to as one of the duties of a slave Jam non umbracula tollunt Virginibus et cetera Footnote Now they do not carry girls parasols Gorius says that the Umbrella came to Rome from the Etruscans and certainly it appears not infrequently on Etruscan vases as also on later gems One gem figured by Pacudius shows an Umbrella with a bent handle sloping backwards Strabo describes a sort of screen or Umbrella worn by Spanish women but this is not like a modern Umbrella Very many curious facts are connected with the use of the Umbrella throughout the East where it was nearly everywhere one of the insignia of royalty or at least of high rank M de la Loubere who was Envoy Extraordinary from the French King to the King of Siam in sixteen eighty seven and sixteen eighty eight wrote an account entitled a New Historical Relation of the Kingdom of Siam which was translated in sixteen ninety three into English According to his account the use of the Umbrella was granted to some only of the subjects by the king An Umbrella with several circles as if two or three umbrellas were fastened on the same stick was permitted to the king alone the nobles carried a single Umbrella with painted cloths hanging from it The Talapoins who seem to have been a sort of Siamese monks had Umbrellas made of a palm leaf cut and folded so that the stem formed a handle The same writer describes the audience chamber of the King of Siam In his quaint old French he says Pour tout meuble il n y a que trois para sol un devant la fenetre a neuf ronds deux a sept ronds aux deux cotez de la fenetre Le para sol est en ce Pais la ce que le Dais est en celui ci Tavernier in his Voyage to the East says that on each side of the Mogul s throne were two Umbrellas and also describes the hall of the King of Ava as decorated with an Umbrella The Mahratta princes who reigned at Poonah and Sattara had the title of Ch hatra pati Lord of the Umbrella Ch hatra or chata has been suggested as the derivation of satrapaes exatrapaes in Theopompus and it seems a probable derivation enough The chata of the Indian and Burmese princes is large and heavy and requires a special attendant who has a regular position in the royal household In Ava it seems to have been part of the king s title that he was King of the white elephant and Lord of the twenty four Umbrellas Persons of rank in the Mahratta court who were not permitted the right of carrying an Umbrella used a screen a flat vertical disc called AA ab gir carried by an attendant Even now the Umbrella has not lost its emblematic meaning In eighteen fifty five the King of Burmah directed a letter to the Marquis of Dalhousie in which he styles himself His great glorious and most excellent Majesty who reigns over the kingdoms of Thunaparanta Tampadipa and all the great Umbrella wearing chiefs of the Eastern countries c Thus we see that the same signification which was attached to the Umbrella by the ancient people of Nineveh still remains connected with it even in our own time In the Great Exhibition of eighteen fifty one was the splendid Umbrella belonging to his Highness the Maharajah of Najpoor The ribs and stretchers sixteen in number divided the Umbrella into as many segments covered with silk exquisitely embroidered with gold and silver ornaments The upper part of the design was complete in each department but at the lower it was formed into a graceful running border to which a fringe was attached The handle was hollow and formed of thick silver plates In Bengal it appears that no distinction is attached to the Umbrella since the poorer classes there use a chata or small Umbrella made of leaves of the Licerata peltata These are of conical form and have numerous ribs and stretchers The higher class in Assam use a similar Umbrella In China the use of the Umbrella does not appear to have been confined as in India and Persia to royalty but it was always as it is now a mark of high rank though not exclusively so There seems to have been no particular rule about it but it carried with it some peculiar distinction for on one occasion at least we hear of twenty four Umbrellas being carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting Here it is what it appears to be in no other Eastern country a defence against rain rather than sun and while the richer people do not go out much while it is wet the poorer classes wear a dress that protects them from the weather In the rainy season for instance a Chinese boatman wears a coat of straw and a hat of straw and bamboo Such a dress of course renders an Umbrella superfluous and it matters little to the wearer how hard the rain may pelt Nevertheless great numbers of Umbrellas are exported from China to India the Indian Archipelago and even South America In the eighteen fifty one Exhibition two only were shown Of them the report says They present nothing remarkable beyond the great number of ribs which amount to forty two The ribs are formed of wood and instead of being embraced by the fork of the stretcher as in the case of European Umbrellas they have a groove cut out in the middle of their lengths into which the stretcher is secured by a stud of wood The head of each rib fits into a notch formed in the ring of wood which is fastened on to the top of the stick there being a separate notch for each rib The slide is of wood and has forty two notches namely one for each stretcher which like the ribs is formed of wood The covering of the Umbrellas exhibited is of oiled paper coarsely painted But the use of the Umbrella travelled westward and with it the custom of regarding it as a mark of dignity Amongst the Arabs the Umbrella was a mark of distinction Niebuhr who travelled in Southern Arabia describes a procession of the Iman of Sanah In it the Iman and each of the princes of his numerous family caused a madalla or large Umbrella to be carried by his side and it is a privilege which in this country is appropriated to princes of the blood just as the Sultan of Constantinople permits none but his vizier to have his caique or gondola covered behind to keep him from the heat of the sun The same writer goes on to say that many independent chiefs of Yemen carried madallas as a mark of their independence In Morocco according to a passage quoted by a writer in the Penny Magazine from the Travels of Ali Bey the emperor alone and his family are allowed to use it The retinue of the Sultan was composed of a troop of from fifteen to twenty men on horseback About a hundred steps behind them came the Sultan who was mounted on a mule with an officer bearing his Umbrella who rode by his side also on a mule The Umbrella is a distinguishing sign of the sovereign of Morocco Nobody but himself his sons or his brothers dare to make use of it In Turkey the Umbrella is common A vestige of the reverence once attached to it remains in the custom of compelling everybody who passes the palace where the Sultan is residing to lower his Umbrella as a mark of respect And at all events some years back before the Crimean war had introduced so many Europeans to Constantinople any one neglecting to pay the required reverence stood in considerable danger of a lively reminder from the sentry on duty Before concluding this chapter it may not be out of place to make a few remarks as to the origin of the word Umbrella as we have done regarding the thing itself The English name is borrowed from the Italian Ombrella The Latin term Umbella is applied by botanists to those blossoms which are clustered at the extremities of several spokes radiating from the common stem like the metallic props of the Umbrella The name as is seen does not give the slightest idea of the use of the article designated as is often the case with words we practical folk employ and we might well take a lesson from our cousins German or French who have invented distinct names for the weapon used to ward off the rays of the sun and that employed against rain namely Regenschirm parapluie Sonnenschirm parasol These are better than our names even though both the French words labour under the disadvantage of being hybrids half Greek and half Latin Such then is the ancient history of the Umbrella as far as our research has enabled us to trace it and indeed we are now not a little surprised at the result of those labours which have enabled us to discover so much CHAPTER III THE UMBRELLA IN ENGLAND As a canopy of state Umbrellas were generally used in the south of Europe they are found in the ceremonies of the Byzantine Church they were borne over the Host in procession and formed part of the Pontifical regalia A mediaeval gem represents a bishop attended by a cross bearer and a servant who carries behind him an Umbrella In the Basilican churches of Rome is suspended a large Umbrella and the cardinal who took his title from the church has the privilege of having an Umbrella carried over his head on solemn processions It is not altogether impossible that the cardinal s hat may be derived from this Umbrella The origin of this custom of hanging an Umbrella in the Basilican churches is plain enough The judge sitting in the basilica would have it as part of his insignia of office On the judgment hall being turned into a church the Umbrella remained and in fact occupied the place of the canopy over thrones and the like in our own country Beatiano an Italian herald says that a vermilion Umbrella in a field argent symbolises dominion References crop up now and then throughout the middle age records to Umbrellas but the extreme paucity of such allusions goes to show that they were not in common use In an old romance The Blonde of Oxford a jester makes fun of a nobleman for being out in the rain without his cloak Were I a rich man says he I would bear my house about with me By this very valiant joke he meant as he afterwards explained that the nobleman should wear a cloak not that he ought not to forget his Umbrella So it is clear we find that our forefathers depended on their cloaks not on their Umbrellas for protection against storms Careful research has enabled us to light on a solitary instance of an ancient English Umbrella for Wright in his Domestic Manners of the English gives a drawing from the Harleian MS No six hundred three which represents an Anglo Saxon gentleman walking out attended by his servant the servant carrying an Umbrella with a handle that slopes backwards so as to bring the Umbrella over the head of the person in front It probably therefore could not be shut up but otherwise it looks like an ordinary Umbrella and the ribs are represented distinctly Whether this earliest Jonas Hanway the reputed first importer of the Umbrella of whom more hereafter was peculiarly sybaritic in his notions or whether like the mammoth of Siberia he is the one remaining instance of a former umbrelliferous race must at least for the present remain undecided The general use of the Parasol in France and England was adopted probably from China about the middle of the seventeenth century At that period pictorial representations of it are frequently found some of which exhibit the peculiar broad and deep canopy belonging to the large Parasol of the Chinese Government officials borne by native attendants John Evelyn in his Diary for the twenty second June sixteen sixty four mentions a collection of rarities shown him by one Thompson a Catholic priest sent by the Jesuits of Japan and China to France Among the curiosities were fans like those our ladies use but much larger and with long handles strangely carved and filled with Chinese characters which is evidently a description of the Parasol In the title page of Evelyn s Kalendarium Hortense also published in the same year we find a black page represented bearing a closed Umbrella or Sunshade It is again evident that the Parasol was more an article of curiosity than use at this period from the fact that it is mentioned as such in the catalogue of the Museum Tradescantium or Collection of Rarities preserved at South Lambeth by London by John Tradescant In Coryat s Crudities a very rare and highly interesting work published in sixteen eleven about a century and a half prior to the general introduction of the Umbrella into England we find the following curious passage After talking of fans he goes on to say And many of them doe carry other fine things of a far greater price that will cost at the least a duckat which they commonly call in the Italian tongue umbrellas that is things which minister shadow veto them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne These are made of leather something answerable to the forme of a little cannopy hooped in the inside with divers little wooden hoopes that extend the umbrella in a pretty large cornpasse They are used especially by horsemen who carry them in their hands when they ride fastening the end of the handle upon one of their thighs and they impart so large a shadow unto them that it keepeth the heate of the sunne from the upper parts of their bodies Reference to the same custom of riders in Italy using umbrellas is made in Florio s Worlde of Wordes fifteen ninety eight where we find Ombrella a fan a canopie also a festoon or cloth of State for a prince also a kind of round fan or shadowing that they use to ride with in sommer in Italy a little shade In Cotgrave s Dictionary of the French and English Tongues the French Ombrelle is translated An umbrello a fashion of round and broad fanne wherewith the Indians and from them our great ones preserve themselves from the heat of a scorching sunne and hence any little shadow fanne or thing wherewith women hide their faces fro the sunne In Fynes Moryson s Itinerary sixteen seventeen we find a similar allusion to the habit of carrying Umbrellas in hot countries to auoide the beames of the sunne Their employment says the author is dangerous because they gather the heate into a pyramidall point and thence cast it down perpendicularly upon the head except they know how to carry them for auoyding that danger This is certainly a fact not generally known to those who use Parasols too recklessly Poesis Rediviva by John Collop M D sixteen fifty six mentions Umbrellas Michael Drayton writing about sixteen twenty speaks of a pair of doves which are to watch over the person addressed in his verses Of doves I have a dainty pair Which when you please to take the air About your head shall gently hover Your clear brow from the sun to cover And with their nimble wings shall fan you That neither cold nor heat shall tan you And like umbrellas with their feathers Shall shield you in all sorts of weathers Beaumont and Fletcher have an allusion to the umbrella sixteen forty Now are you glad now is your mind at ease Now you have got a shadow an umbrella To keep the scorching world s opinion From your fair credit Rule a Wife and Have a Wife Act iii sc I Ben Jonson too once mentions it date sixteen sixteen speaking of a mishap which befel a lady at the Spanish Court And there she lay flat spread as an umbrella The Devil is an Ass Act iv SC I Of the fact that Umbrellas were known and used in Italy long prior to their introduction into France we find a confirmation in old Montaigne who observes lib iii cap ix Les Ombrelles de quoy depuis les anciens Remains l Italie se sert chargent plus le bras qu ils ne deschargent la teste Kersey s Dictionary seventeen oh eight describes an Umbrella as a screen commonly used by women to keep off rain The absence of almost all allusion to the Umbrella by the wits of the seventeenth century while the muff fan c receive so large a share of attention is a further proof that it was far from being recognised as an article of convenient luxury at that day The clumsy shape probably prevented its being generally used In one of Dryden s plays we find the line I can carry your umbrella and fan your Ladyship Gay addressing a gentleman in his Trivia or the Art of Walking the Streets of London seventeen twelve says Be thou for every season justly dress d Nor brave the piercing frost with open breast And when the bursting clouds a deluge pour Let thy surtout defend the gaping shower And again That garment best the winter s rage defends Whose shapeless form in ample plaits depends By various names in various countries known Yet held in all the true surtout alone Be thine of kersey tine though small the cost Then brave unwet the rain unchilled the frost These passages lead us to the belief that the Umbrella was not used by gentlemen for a long time after its merits had been recognised by the fair sex The following lines from the same author have often been quoted Good housewives all the winter s rage despise Defended by the riding hood s disguise Or underneath the umbrella s oily shed Safe through the wet on clinking pattens tread Let Persian dames th umbrellas rich display To guard their beauties from the sunny ray Or sweating slaves support the shady load When Eastern monarchs show their state abroad Britain in winter only knows its aid To guard from chilly showers the walking maid Trivia B one Dean Swift also in the Tatler No two hundred twenty eight in describing a City shower thus alludes to the common use of the Umbrella by women Now in contiguous drops the floods come down Threatening with deluge the devoted town To shops in crowds the draggled females fly Pretend to cheapen goods but nothing buy The Templar spruce while every spout s abroach Stays till tis fair yet seems to call a coach The tucked up sempstress walks with hasty strides While streams run down her oiled umbrella s sides About this time the custom obtained of keeping an Umbrella in the halls of great houses to be used in passing from the door to the carriage At coffee houses too the same was done That the use of the Umbrella was considered far too effeminate for man is seen from the following advertisement from the Female Tatler for December twelfth seventeen oh nine The young gentleman borrowing the Umbrella belonging to Wills Coffee house in Cornhill of the mistress is hereby advertised that to be dry from head to foot on the like occasion he shall be welcome to the maid s pattens Defoe s description of Robinson Crusoe s Umbrella is of course familiar to all our readers He makes his hero say that he had seen Umbrellas used in Brazil where they were found very useful in the great heats that were there and that he constructed his own instrument in imitation of them I covered it with skins he adds the hair outwards so that it cast off the rain like a pent house and kept off the sun so effectually that I could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than I could before in the coolest We may also add that from this description the original heavy Umbrellas obtained the name of Robinson which they retained for many years both here and in France In the Memoir of Ambrose Barnes published for the Surtees Society under date seventeen eighteen appears an entry Umbrella for the Church s use twenty fives A similar entry is also found in the churchwarden s accounts for the parochial chapelry of Burnley Surrey for A D seventeen sixty Paid for Umbrella two l ten s six d Both these Umbrellas were in all likelihood intended for the use of clergymen at funerals in the churchyard as was that alluded to in Hone s Year Book eighteen twenty six which was kept for the same purpose in a country church This last had an awning of green oiled canvas such as common Umbrellas were made of forty years ago Bailey s Encyclopaedia seventeen thirty six has Umbrello a sort of wooden frame covered with cloth put over a window to keep out the sun also a screen carried over the head to defend from sun or rain Also Parasol a little umbrella to keep off sun There is at Woburn Abbey a picture painted about seventeen thirty of the Duchess of Bedford with a black servant behind her who holds an Umbrella over her and a sketch of the same period attached to a song called The Generous Repulse shows a lady seated on a flowery bank holding a Parasol with a long handle over her head while she gently checks the ardour of her swain and consoles him by the following touching strain Thy vain pursuit fond youth give o er What more alas can Flavia do Thy worth I own thy fate deplore All are not happy that are true But if revenge can ease thy pain I ll soothe the ills I cannot cure Tell thee I drag a hopeless chain And all that I inflict endure Rather cold consolation but an unexceptionable and moral sentiment The idea therefore that the Duchess of Rutland devised Parasols in eighteen twenty six for the first time is obviously incorrect whatever her grace may have done towards rendering them fashionable Captain Cook in one of his voyages saw some of the natives of the South Pacific Islands with Umbrellas made of palm leaves We have thus seen that the use both of the Umbrella and Parasol was not unknown in England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century That it was not very common is evident from the fact that General then Lieut Colonel Wolfe writing from Paris in seventeen fifty two speaks of the people there using Umbrellas for the sun and rain and wonders that a similar practice does not obtain in England Just about the same time they do seem to have come into general use and that pretty rapidly as people found their value and got over the shyness natural to a first introduction Jonas Hanway the founder of the Magdalen Hospital has the credit of being the first man who had the courage to carry one habitually in London since it is recorded in the life of that venerable philanthropist the friend of chimney sweeps and sworn foe to tea that he was the first man who ventured to dare public reproach and ridicule by carrying an Umbrella He probably felt the benefit of one during his travels in Persia where they were in constant use as a protection against the sun and it is also said that he was in ill health when he first made use of it It was more than likely however that Jonas Hanway s neatness in dress and delicate complexion led him on his return from abroad to appreciate a luxury hitherto only confined to the ladies mister Pugh who wrote his life gives the following description of his personal appearance which may be regarded as a gem in its way In his dress as far as was consistent with his ideas of health and ease he accommodated himself to the prevailing fashion As it was frequently necessary for him to appear in polite circles on unexpected occasions he usually wore dress clothes with a large French bag His hat ornamented with a gold button was of a size and fashion to be worn as well under the arm as on the head When it rained a small parapluie defended his face and wig As Hanway died in seventeen eighty six and he is said to have carried an Umbrella for thirty years the date of its first use by him may be set down at about seventeen fifty For some time Umbrellas were objects of derision especially from the hackney coachmen who saw in their use an invasion on the vested rights of the fraternity just as hackney coaches had once been looked upon by the watermen who thought people should travel by river not by road John Macdonald perhaps the only footman always excepting the great mister James Yellowplush who ever wrote a memoir of himself relates that in seventeen seventy he used to be greeted with the shout Frenchman Frenchman why don t you call a coach whenever he went out with his fine silk umbrella newly brought from Spain Records of the Umbrella s first appearance in other English works have also been preserved In Glasgow according to the narrative in Cleland s Statistical Account of Glasgow the late mister John Jamieson surgeon returning from Paris brought an Umbrella with him which was the first seen in this city The doctor who was a man of great humour took pleasure in relating to me how he was stared at with his Umbrella In Edinburgh doctor Spens is said to have been the first to carry one In Bristol a red Leghorn Umbrella appeared about seventeen eighty according to a writer in Notes and Queries and created there no small sensation The trade between Bristol and Leghorn may account for this Some five and thirty years ago it is said that an old lady was living in Taunton who recollected when there were only two Umbrellas in the town one of which belonged to the clergyman When he went to church he used to hang the Umbrella up in the porch to the edification and delight of his parishioners Horace Walpole tells how doctor Shebbeare who was prosecuted for seditious writings in seventeen fifty eight stood in the pillory having a footman holding an umbrella to keep off the rain For permitting this indulgence to a malefactor Beardman the under sheriff was punished It is difficult to conceive how the Umbrella could come into general use owing to the state in which the streets of London were up to a comparatively recent period The same amusing author to whom we owe the description of Jonas Hanway gives the following account of them at the time his work was published It is not easy to convey to a person who has not seen the streets of London before they were uniformly paved a tolerable idea of their inconvenience and uncleanliness the signs extending on both sides of the way into the streets at unequal distances from the houses that they might not intercept each other greatly obstructed the view and what is of more consequence in a crowded city prevented the free circulation of the air The footpaths were universally incommoded even when they were so narrow as only to admit one person passing at a time by a row of posts set on edge next the carriage way He whose urgent business would not permit of his keeping pace with the gentleman of leisure before him turned out between the two posts before the door of some large house into the carriage way When he perceived danger moving toward him he wished to return within the protection of the row of posts but there was commonly a rail continued from the top of one post to that of another sometimes for several houses together in which case he was obliged to run back to the first inlet or climb over or creep under the railing in attempting which he might be fortunate if he escaped with no other injury than what proceeded from dirt if intimidated by the danger he escaped he afterwards kept within the boundary of the posts and railing he was obliged to put aside the travellers before him whose haste was less urgent than his and these resisting made his journey truly a warfare The French are reproached even to a proverb for the neglect of the convenience of foot passengers in their metropolis by not providing a separate path for them but great as is the exposure to dirt in Paris for want of a footpath which their many porte cocheres seem likely for ever to prevent in the more important article of danger the City of London was at this period at least on a par How comfortless must be the sensations of an unfortunate female stopped in the street on a windy day under a large old sign loaded with lead and iron in full swing over her head and perhaps a torrent of rain and dirty water falling near from a projecting spout ornamented with the mouth and teeth of a dragon These dangers and distresses are now at an end and we may think of them as a sailor does of a storm which has subsided but the advantages derived from the present uniformity and cleanliness can be known only in their full extent by comparing them with the former inconveniences When to this description is added the fact that the hoop petticoat and another article of dress monopolised the whalebone it will be seen how much had to be got over before an Umbrella could be carried out by the citizens of London as a walking staff with satisfactory assurance of protection in case of a shower The earliest English Umbrellas we must also remember were made of oiled silk very clumsy and difficult to open when wet the stick and furniture were heavy and inconvenient and the article very expensive At the end of the century allusions to the Umbrella are not infrequent Cowper in his Task seventeen eighty twice mentions it but seems to mean a Parasol We bear our shades about us self deprived Of other screen the thin umbrella spread And range an Indian waste without a tree B i And again Expect her soon with footboy at her heels No longer blushing for her awkward load Her train and her umbrella all her care B iv The reverend G C Renouard writing in eighteen fifty to Notes and Queries says In the hall of my father s house at Stamford in Lincolnshire there was when I was a child the wreck of a large green silk umbrella apparently of Chinese manufacture brought by my father from Scotland somewhere between seventeen seventy and seventeen eighty and as I have often heard the first umbrella seen at Stamford I well remember also an amusing description given by the late mister Warry so many years consul at Smyrna of the astonishment and envy of his mother s neighbours at Sawbridgeworth in Hants where his father had a country house when he ran home and came back with an umbrella which he had just brought from Leghorn to shelter them from a pelting shower which detained them in the church porch after the service on one summer Sunday From mister Warry s age at the time he mentioned this and other circumstances in his history I conjecture that it occurred not later than seventeen seventy five or seventeen seventy six As Sawbridgeworth is so near London it is evident that even then umbrellas were at that time almost unknown Since this date however the Umbrella has come into general use and in consequence numerous improvements have been effected in it The transition to the present portable form is due partly to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter and also to the many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework chiefly by French and English manufacturers many of which were patented and to which we purpose presently to allude CHAPTER IV 
2587-160609-0000	train-other-500	THE STORY OF THE PARACHUTE In giving an account of the Umbrella it would not be right to omit mentioning another and far from legitimate use in which it has been employed by notoriety hunting artistes we allude to the Parachute
2587-160609-0001	train-other-500	and a short narration of its origin and progress may not be uninteresting to our readers The Parachute commonly in use is nothing more or less than a huge Umbrella presenting a surface of sufficient dimension to experience from the air
2587-160609-0002	train-other-500	a resistance equal to the weight of descent in moving through the fluid at a velocity not exceeding that of the shock which a person can sustain without danger or injury It is made of silk or cotton
2587-160609-0003	train-other-500	To the outer edge cords are fastened of about the same length as the diameter of the machine twenty four to twenty eight feet
none	none	 A centre cord is attached to the apex 
2587-160609-0004	train-other-500	and meets the cords from the margin acting in fact as the stick of the Umbrella The machine is thus kept expanded during descent The car is fastened to the centre cord
none	none	 and the whole attached to the balloon in such a manner 
2587-160609-0005	train-other-500	that it may be readily and quickly detached either by cutting a string or pulling a trigger Consequently in the East where the Umbrella has been from the earliest ages in familiar use
none	none	 it appears to have been occasionally employed by vaulters 
2587-160609-0006	train-other-500	to enable them to jump safely from great heights Father Loubere in his curious account of Siam relates that a person famous in that country for his dexterity used to divert the King and Court by the extraordinary leaps he took
2587-160609-0007	train-other-500	having two Umbrellas with long slender handles fastened to his girdle In seventeen eighty three
none	none	 M le Normand demonstrated the utility of the Parachute by lifting himself down from the windows of a high house at Lyons 
2587-160609-0008	train-other-500	His idea was that it might be made a sort of fire escape
none	none	 Blanchard was the first person who constructed a Parachute 
2587-160609-0009	train-other-500	to act as a safety guard to the aeronaut in case of any accident During an excursion he made from Lille in seventeen eighty five when he traversed without stopping a distance of three hundred miles he let down a Parachute with a basket fastened to it
2587-160609-0010	train-other-500	containing a dog This he suffered to fall from a great height and it reached the ground in safety The first Parachute descent from a balloon however was made by Jacques Garnerin
none	none	 on the twenty second of October seventeen ninety seven 
2587-160609-0011	train-other-500	in the Park of Monceau De la Lande the celebrated astronomer has furnished a detailed and highly interesting account of this foolish experiment Garnerin resided in London
none	none	 during the short peace of eighteen oh two and made two ascents with his balloon in the second of which he let himself fall at an amazing height with a Parachute of twenty three feet diameter He started from an enclosure near North Audley Street 
2587-160609-0013	train-other-500	and descended after having been seven or eight minutes in the air After cutting himself away he floated over Marylebone and Somers Town and fell in a field near saint Pancras Old Church The oscillation was so great
none	none	 that he was thrown out of the Parachute 
2587-160609-0014	train-other-500	and narrowly escaped death He seemed a good deal frightened and said that the peril was too great for endurance One of the stays of the machine having given way his danger was increased
2587-160609-0015	train-other-500	The next person who tried this dangerous experiment was his niece Eliza Garnerin who descended several times in safety Her Parachute had a large orifice in the top in order to check the oscillation
none	none	 and this appears to have been tolerably successful 
2587-160609-0016	train-other-500	The next experimentalist was a person of the name of Cocking who ended his days in a manner unworthy his talents through a series of lamentable mistakes His Parachute was constructed on the opposite principle of a wedge like form
2587-160609-0017	train-other-500	and was intended to cleave through the air instead of offering a resistance to it It has not yet been proved that the principle was wrong but the defect lay in the weakness of the materials employed in the formation of the Parachute
2587-160609-0018	train-other-500	On the twenty ninth July eighteen thirty seven mister Cocking ascended in his new Parachute attached to the Great Nassau Balloon mister Cocking liberated himself from the balloon the Parachute collapsed and fell at a frightful rate
2587-160609-0019	train-other-500	into a field near Lea where poor Cocking was found with an awful wound on his right temple He never spoke but died almost immediately afterwards It is much to be regretted that the descent was ever allowed to take place
2587-160609-0020	train-other-500	The aeronauts themselves were for some time in a state of imminent peril Immediately the Parachute was cut away the balloon ascended with frightful velocity owing to the ascending power it necessarily gained by being freed from a weight of nearly five hundred pounds
2587-160609-0021	train-other-500	and had it not been that its occupants applied their mouths to the air bags previously provided they must have been suffocated by the escaping gas When the re action took place the balloon had lost its buoyancy and fell rather than descended to the ground
none	none	 mister Hampton was the next person who attempted the experiment 
2587-160609-0022	train-other-500	and made three descents in a Parachute in succession without injury Undeterred by the awful fate of his predecessor this gentleman determined on making a Parachute descent which should prove the correctness of the theory
2587-160609-0023	train-other-500	and the Montpellier Gardens at Cheltenham were selected as the scene of the exploit
none	none	 Owing to the censure which was attached to the proprietors of the Vauxhall Gardens 
2587-160609-0024	train-other-500	for permitting docking s ascent the owners of the Gardens at Cheltenham would not suffer the experiment to be made
none	none	 and mister Hampton was obliged to have recourse to stratagem 
2587-160609-0025	train-other-500	As he was permitted to display his Parachute in the manner he intended to use it the idea suddenly flashed across his mind that he could carry out his long nursed wishes He suddenly cut the rope which kept him down and went off
2587-160609-0026	train-other-500	to the astonishment of the spectators the last cheering sound that reached him being He will be killed to a dead certainty After attaining an altitude of nearly two miles mister Hampton proceeded to cut the rope that held him attached to the balloon
none	none	 He paused for a second or two 
2587-160609-0027	train-other-500	as he remembered that it would soon be life or death with him but at length drew his knife across the rope The first feelings he experienced were both unpleasant and alarming his eyes and the top of his head appeared to be forced upwards
2587-160609-0028	train-other-500	but this passed off in a few seconds and his feelings subsequently became pleasant rather than disagreeable
none	none	 So steady and slow was the descent that the Parachute appeared to be stationary 
2587-160609-0029	train-other-500	mister Hampton remembered that a bag of ballast was fastened beneath the car he stooped over and upset the sand he also noted by his watch the time he occupied in descending The earth seemed coming up to him rapidly
2587-160609-0030	train-other-500	the Parachute indicated its approach to terra firma by a slight oscillation and he presently struck the ground in the centre of a field where he was first welcomed by a sheep which stared at this visitor from the clouds in utter amazement
2587-160609-0031	train-other-500	mister Hampton repeated the experiment twice in London though on both occasions with considerable danger to himself the first time falling on a tree in Kensington Gardens the second on a house which threw him out of the basket
2587-160609-0032	train-other-500	After this experiment there was a lull in the Parachute folly until some twenty years ago
none	none	 when Madame Poitevin startled the Metropolis from its propriety 
2587-160609-0033	train-other-500	by her perilous escapes both in life and limb
none	none	 Although considerable ingenuity was displayed in the plan of expanding the Parachute by the sudden discharge of gas from the balloon still the very fact of a woman being exposed to such danger by her husband will we trust hereafter prevent Englishmen from countenancing such an exhibition by their presence CHAPTER V UMBRELLA STORIES 
2762-160610-0000	train-other-500	Who could for a moment suppose that so important an article as the Umbrella would be without its lighter as well as its more serious history Umbrellas are still we regret to say regarded rather in a comic than a serious light
2762-160610-0001	train-other-500	so if any of the following anecdotes seem to treat of Umbrellas in too mocking or frivolous a vein it is the fault of the bad taste of the British public not ours
none	none	 who have merely compiled However we may commence with a very neat little French riddle Quel est l objet que l on recherche le plus quand on s en degoute A mysterious inquiry and all sorts of horrible but needful abominations occur to the mind in answer But the answer is not so bad after all Change the spelling without altering the pronunciation and you get quand on sent des gouties and lo you have it at once le Parapluie the faithful friend whose presence we most desire when we wish least for the necessity of it the burden of our fine days the shelter of our wet ones Or again would you like a verse or two on the same subject Pour etrenne on veut a l envie Du frais et du neuf et du beau Je dis que c est un parapluie Que l on doit donner en cas d eau The author of these two jeux de mots unhappily we do not know or we would thank him for them The English poet of the Umbrella has yet to be born 
2762-160610-0002	train-other-500	The next story relates to the early history of the Umbrella in Scotland and may probably be referred to the time when good doctor Jamieson was walking about Glasgow with his new fangled sheltering apparatus which he had brought with him
2762-160610-0003	train-other-500	on his return from Paris As it was the first ever seen in that city it attracted universal attention and a vast amount of impudence from the horrid boys The following anecdote then
none	none	 which we borrow from a Scotch paper most probably refers to the same period or thereabouts When Umbrellas were first marched into Blairgowrie they were sported only by the minister and the laird 
2762-160610-0004	train-other-500	and were looked upon by the common class of people as a perfect phenomenon One day Daniel M
none	none	 went to Colonel McPherson at Blairgowrie House 
2762-160610-0005	train-other-500	when about to return a shower came on and the colonel politely offered him the loan of an Umbrella which he gladly accepted and Daniel with his head two or three inches higher than usual marched off
none	none	 Not long after he had left however the colonel again saw Daniel posting towards him with all possible haste still o ertopped by his cotton canopy silk Umbrellas were out of the question in those days which he held out saluting him with Hae hae Kornil this ll never do there s nae a door in all my house that ll tak it in my very barn door winna tak it in In the veracious History of Sandford and Merton if our memory serves us aright 
2762-160610-0006	train-other-500	there is an instance quoted of remarkable presence of mind relating to an Umbrella and its owner The members of a comfortable pic nic party were cosily assembled in some part of India when an unbidden
2762-160610-0007	train-other-500	and most unwelcome guest made his appearance in the shape of a huge Bengal tiger Most persons would naturally have sought safety in flight and not stayed to hob and nob with this denizen of the jungle
2762-160610-0008	train-other-500	not so however thought a lady of the party who inspired by her innate courage or the fear of losing her dinner perhaps by both combined seized her Umbrella and opened it suddenly in the face of the tiger
2762-160610-0009	train-other-500	as he stood wistfully gazing upon brown curry and foaming Allsop The astonished brute turned tail and fled and the lady saved her dinner Not many years ago the Umbrella was employed in an equally curious manner
2762-160610-0010	train-other-500	though not so successfully as in the former instance In the campaign of seventeen ninety three General Bournonville who was sent with four commissioners by the National Convention
2762-160610-0011	train-other-500	to the camp of the Prince of Saxe Coburg was detained as a prisoner with his companions and confined in the fortress of Olmuetz In this situation he made a desperate attempt to regain his liberty
2762-160610-0012	train-other-500	Having procured an Umbrella he leaped with it from a window forty feet above the ground but being a very heavy man it did not prove sufficient to let him down in safety He struck against an opposite wall
2762-160610-0013	train-other-500	fell into a ditch and broke his leg and worse than all was carried back to his prison One of the most remarkable instances on record in which the Umbrella was the agency of a man s life being saved occurred
2762-160610-0014	train-other-500	according to his own statement to our old friend Colonel Longbow Of course our kind readers know him as well as we do for not to do so would be to argue yourselves unknown At any Continental watering place
2762-160610-0015	train-other-500	Longbow or one of his family for it is a large one can be met with He is indeed a wonderful man on intimate terms with all the crowned heads of Europe and proves his intimacy by always speaking of them by their Christian names

2762-160610-0017	train-other-500	the other day we happened to meet the Colonel and he speedily contrived to discover that we were on the point of going to dine and so invited him to share our humble meal as a graceful way of making a virtue of necessity for had we not done so
none	none	 he would have had no hesitation in inviting himself 
2762-160610-0018	train-other-500	During dinner conversation of course turned upon one all engrossing subject the war and the Colonel proceeded to give us his experiences of former wars including his adventures in the Crimea
2762-160610-0019	train-other-500	and the miraculous escape he owed to an Umbrella It appeared that he had gone out with his friend Lord Levant on a yachting excursion in the Mediterranean and they eventually found their way into the Black Sea
none	none	 Stress of weather compelled them to put into the little port of Yalta on the north coast where they went on shore The Colonel on the Lucretian principle of Suave mari magno c proceeded the next morning to the verge of the precipice 
2762-160610-0020	train-other-500	to observe the magnificent prospect of a sea running mountains high As it was raining at the time he put up a huge gingham Umbrella he happened to find in the hotel Suddenly however a furious blast of wind drove across the cliff
2762-160610-0021	train-other-500	and lifted the Colonel bodily in the air Away he flew far out to sea the Umbrella acting as a Parachute to let him fall easy
none	none	 Now to most men this would only have been a choice of evils a progress from Scylla to Charybdis not so to our Colonel 
2762-160610-0022	train-other-500	On coming up to the surface after his first dip he found that swimming would not save him so he quietly emptied out the water contained in the Umbrella seated himself upon it and sailed triumphantly into the harbour like Arion on his dolphin
none	none	 Our face on hearing this anecdote must have betrayed the scepticism we felt for the Colonel proceeded to a corner of the room and produced the identical Umbrella Of course such a proof was irresistible 
2762-160610-0023	train-other-500	and we were compelled to do penance for our unbelief by lending the gallant Colonel a sovereign for the Bank was closed We thought the anecdote cheap at the price There is a story told of one of our City bankers
2762-160610-0024	train-other-500	that he owed an excellent wife to the interposition of an Umbrella It appears that on returning home one day in a heavy shower of rain he found a young lady standing in his doorway Politeness induced him to invite her to take shelter under his roof
2762-160610-0025	train-other-500	and eventually to offer her the loan of an Umbrella Of course the gallant banker called for it the next day and the acquaintance thus accidentally made soon ripened into mutual affection This species of Umbrella courtship
2762-160610-0026	train-other-500	has been immortalised in more than one song none of which however are quite worth quoting A worthy little Frenchman of our acquaintance was ordered by his medical man to take a course of shower baths
2762-160610-0027	train-other-500	Such things being unknown to him in his fatherland he of course found the first essay remarkably unpleasant but with native ingenuity he soon discovered a remedy On our asking him how he liked the hydropathic system he replied

and its near relation the Umbrella as far as our space permits us to treat of this interesting subject All that remains for us to do is to give an account of the principal improvements effected in the Umbrella during later years It is certain that France was some way ahead of us with regard to the use of Umbrellas for they were comparatively common there before they were at all known l autre cote de la Manche This was but natural considering that they were as we have seen used in Italy and consequently the folk of southern France would not be likely to be far behind their neighbours in availing themselves of the protection from the sun whether or no they had sufficient genius to shelter themselves from the rain by the aid of an Umbrella In France Parasols and Umbrellas used to be amongst the articles made by the corporate body of Boursiers M Natalis Rondot quotes from the Journal du Citoyen of seventeen fifty four the price of Parasols It ranged from sevens three d to seventeens six d according to the construction and to whether they were made to fold up or not In Diderot and D Alembert s Encyclopedic is figured an Umbrella which is described as follows in the excellent introduction to the Abridgements of Specifications relating to Umbrellas lately published by the Commissioners of Patents The ribs bear about the same proportion as in modern umbrellas as regards length to the stick but the stretchers are much shorter being less than a quarter of the length of the ribs They are double each rib having a pair joined one on each side of the rib at the same point The ribs are joined at the top by being strung on a ring as in old English umbrellas but the runner is made of precisely similar construction to the modern runner and seems almost identical with that described in Caney s Specification patent No five thousand seven hundred sixty one A D eighteen twenty nine Ribs and sticks are jointed the latter in two places There is no catch to hold the umbrella closed but this upper catch is the ordinary bent wire one The upper joint of the stick is made with a screw the lower of a hinge with a slide as in a modern parasol The slide has a catch resembling the ordinary runner catch At the top is a ring for carrying or suspending the umbrella Such was the old French Umbrella and that used in England was of much the same sort The old French folding Parasol is thus described in the Report of the Jurors for the Exhibition of eighteen fifty one The folding parasol was constructed with jointed ribs so as to fold back and was likewise self opening The rod was a metallic tube and contained a spiral spring which acted upon and pressed upwards an inner rod To this inner rod were jointed the stretchers which in this construction were placed above the ribs instead of below as in the ordinary form beside which they were much shorter so as to admit of their being concealed by the covering By the elasticity of the spiral spring contained in the hollow stem the inner rod was pressed outwards and lifted the stretchers and by their means raised the ribs also so that in its ordinary or natural state the umbrella was always open and would continue so unless constrained to remain closed by a catch On releasing the catch it consequently sprang open In order that it might be easily closed four cords were attached to four of the ribs and passed to the handle and a loop embracing these cords passed down by the side of the handle and enabled the possessor to close his umbrella without difficulty From the authority already quoted we learn that whalebone was employed for the ribs and that their number varied with their length for example when twenty four inches long the number employed was eight when twenty five inches nine and when twenty six twenty eight and thirty inches ten were used Calico was employed to cover umbrellas and silk to cover parasols The use of parasols was common in Lyons at that period seventeen eighty six they were carried by men as well as women they were rose coloured white and of other colours and were so light as to be carried without inconvenience The Encyclopedic Methodique gives some interesting particulars as to the manufacture of Parasols and Umbrellas at the end of the eighteenth century From it it appears that the ribs were occasionally made of metal On etend cette couverture portative par le moyen de quelques brins de baleine ou de fils de cuivre ou de fer qui la soutiennent This is interesting as showing that metal ribs are not a very modern invention The following statement of the comparative weights and sizes of Umbrellas was prepared by M Farge for the French Exposition of eighteen forty nine Umbrellas Length of ribs Weight of inches Lb oz sixteen forty five thirty one one two three eight one two seventeen forty twenty nine one thirteen seventeen eighty twenty eight three four one eight one two eighteen forty twenty seven one two zero thirteen one four eighteen forty nine twenty seven zero eight three four From eighteen oh eight to eighteen forty eight eighty patents were taken out in France for inventions three of importation and forty one for improvements in Umbrellas In England after their first introduction the manufacture of Umbrellas increased rapidly The first patent is dated seventeen eighty and was taken up by Mark Bull for A machine for supporting an Umbrella which may be fixt to any saddle or wheel d carriage being far more compleat than any hitherto invented The invention is described in the following words There is a ball and socket of steel or iron or any other metal or composition The ball moves in any direction and is fixed by one two three or more points which are forced against it either by a screw or spring The ball is made with small cavities to receive the points which press against it In order to secure it the more effectually in the ball there is a hole which receives the one end of the staff of the umbrella which is secured in it either by a spring or screw or a sliding or a spring bolt The umbrella may be taken away from the staff and either put under the seat of the saddle or fix d before the rider The staff may be made whole or in two pieces the one to slide within the other in order to raise or lower the umbrella and be fix d either by a spring or screw They are fix d in the head of the saddle and cover d by a top without making the saddle appear in the least different to what they are now made The next is of the date of seventeen eighty six and was taken out by John Beale for An umbrella with joints flat springs and stops worm springs and bolts slip bolts screws slip rivet and cross stop and square slips and the manner in which the same are performed is particularly described in the several plans figures or drawings annexed The drawings referred to are not easily intelligible from the briefness of the explanation attached but show an Umbrella with a jointed handle opening by a spring In the next year seventeen eighty seven we find an advertisement put out by Thomas Folgham of Cheapside stating that he has a great assortment of his much approved pocket and portable umbrellas which for lightness elegance and strength far exceed anything of the kind ever imported or manufactured in this kingdom All kinds of common umbrellas prepared in a particular way that will never stick together A description of the Umbrellas which in all probability mister Thomas Folgham made we extract from the source mentioned above The early Umbrellas were made of oiled silk or glazed cotton cloth and were very cumbrous and inconvenient To judge from a picture of Hanway and from the other old pictures mentioned above they were small with a very long handle They were not used for walking and consequently instead of the ferrule had a ring at the top by which they were hung up The stretchers were of cane and the ribs of cane or whalebone Instead of the present top notch and runner both ribs and stretchers were simply strung on a ring of wire and the inequality of the friction and the weakness of such an arrangement cause the Umbrella to be always getting out of order The ribs and stretchers were jointed together very roughly by a pin passing through the rib on which the forked end of the stretcher hinged The first improvement in this respect was by Caney patent No five thousand seven hundred sixty one A D eighteen twenty nine who invented a top notch and runner in which each rib or stretcher has a separate hinge The top notch was made of a notched wheel or disc into each slot of which an axis fixed on the top of the stretchers worked The runner was made on a similar principle At the point of the rib where the stretcher joined it Caney fixed a middle bit consisting of a small fork in which the end of the stretcher was hinged This construction was much stronger and the forked ends of the stretchers were thus prevented from wearing out the cover as before With modifications more or less important this construction is the same as that now in general use The principal object of all those who have devoted their attention to the task has been to reduce the weight of the Umbrella without at the same time diminishing its strength In its primitive form the ribs were formed of whalebone which possessed very grave inconveniences in the first place it was cumbersome to a degree lost its elasticity after any continuous exposure to rain and if dried without very great care was extremely liable to crack In the next place the price was very high and consequently the masses remained unrepresented in the Umbrella market The most important improvement dates from the introduction of steel instead of whalebone which took place about thirty years ago for although a few Umbrellas were occasionally made and used of this material prior to that time it had not come into general use Amongst other improvements have been the following The tips are now made in one piece with the rib instead of being made of bone japanned metal or other material and then fastened on The long six inch runners have given way to the short one two inches long and the ferrules are also much shorter than formerly To keep the Umbrella closed the old fashioned plan was a ring fastened by a string A tape and cotton superseded this and in its turn gave way to the elastic now in use Sliding caps to fit over the ends of the ribs and hold the Umbrella closed have been invented but until quite recently do not seem to have come much into use Simple as the construction of an Umbrella may appear there have been altogether upwards of three hundred patents taken out for various improvements in their manufacture in addition to numerous alterations which have been registered according to the Act Vic six seven Cap sixty five With very few exceptions the inventors have not been repaid the cost of their patents This has arisen partly from the delicacy of their mechanical construction unfitted for the rough usage to which Umbrellas are exposed but chiefly in consequence of the increased cost of manufacture not being compensated by the improvements effected The introduction of steel vice whalebone was opposed by the trade and the public in general like many other great improvements and it required several years in order to convince purchasers that steel would not only last much longer than whalebone but would not be so liable to break provided it was properly made and tempered The misfortune was that at the outset a great number of inferior articles were introduced and consequently the public naturally lost confidence and it demanded great exertions on the part of the more respectable members of the trade ere the merits of the new invention were recognised At present it is generally allowed that a good steel rib Umbrella can be as easily procured as a carefully tempered razor or sword A Swiss watch spring maker named Sanguinede had discovered a secret of tempering steel which gave it great strength and he had made some very light umbrellas but they were immensely dear On his death the secret died with him and mister Fox set to work to discover a method which should combine strength and lightness mister Fox s Paragon frame simple in its construction half the weight of whalebone but equally strong is admitted to be the greatest improvement yet introduced in the manufacture of an Umbrella The ribs are made in the form of a trough with flat sides by which shape the greatest amount of strength is obtained The same principle as is well known has been successfully applied in the construction of the Great Tubular Bridge over the Menai Straits from which mister Fox took the idea The weight of the Umbrella having been thus reduced the next question was whether some amendment could not be made in the covering material For a long time Umbrellas were only covered with two materials silk and cotton and the want of some substance which would resist the greater friction and consequent wear than an Umbrella invariably undergoes formed a subject of anxious attention to the writer of this little book Several materials were tried without success until a fabric called Alpaca made of the wool of the Chilian and Peruvian sheep presented itself and for this a patent was immediately taken out Of its merits it becomes us not to speak but we may be permitted to quote the following remarks from the Grand Jury Report of the Great Exhibition of eighteen fifty one SANGSTER WILLIAM AND JOHN Prize Medal for Silk Parasols and Umbrellas of excellent quality and for their application of Alpaca cloth to the coverings of Parasols and Umbrellas To the above flattering testimonial the following remarks were appended Alpaca cloth is made of undyed wool of the Peruvian and Chili sheep and it is therefore is not liable to fade nor is it acted upon by salt water hence Alpaca Parasols and Umbrellas are much used at watering places The demand for the Paragon Umbrella is so great that the patentee is able to supply them at a price not much exceeding the ordinary sorts The frames are guaranteed for two years but in consequence of the superior quality of the article the number found to require repair is much less than the average of other kinds In the course of the two years succeeding their introduction upwards of fifty thousand Paragon Umbrellas mere sold Nor was the progress of the Alpaca Umbrella less cheering Though the material is in some respects inferior to silk it has been found to wear so much longer and to cost so much less that its use is now becoming general among that numerous class with whom economy and an Umbrella are equally indispensable The sale of Alpaca Umbrellas in the year eighteen fifty four amounted to upwards of forty five thousand Since this time W J S have sold under their patent Umbrellas to the number of nearly four millions These facts we will leave to our readers to draw their own inference from but the very kind reception which the Alpaca Umbrellas have hitherto received justifies us in asserting that no material has yet been brought forward which has so thoroughly fulfilled the required conditions The weight of the Umbrella has also been diminished and last not least the price has decreased in a corresponding ratio This latter fact is of the very greatest importance when we remember the immense quantity of Parasols and Umbrellas manufactured during the year in London and estimated at the enormous value of five hundred thousand Pounds In addition a very great number are made in Manchester and Birmingham To those who wish to keep their Umbrellas safe and sound we may commend the following extract from Cassell s Household Guide Umbrellas are articles which generally suffer more from careless treatment than from legitimate wear and tear an Umbrella when properly treated will last twice as long as one that is not so used When wet an Umbrella should neither be distended to dry which will strain the ribs and covering and prevent its ever afterwards folding up neatly nor at once rolled and tied up which would tend to rust the frame and rot the textile fabric neither should it if of silk be carelessly thrust into an Umbrella stand nor allowed to rest against a wall which would probably discolour and certainly crease the silk injuriously It should be shut but not tied up and hung from the handle with the point downwards till it is nearly but not quite dry It should then be neatly and carefully rolled up and tied In walking with an Umbrella the hands should be confined to the handle and not allowed to grasp the silk otherwise that portion which is held will become greased and discoloured and the material will be frayed out round the tips which are points where there is always much stress and where if will always have a tendency to give way When not in use the Umbrella should be protected from dust and injury of any kind by its silk or oilcloth case When dirty alpaca umbrellas are best cleaned with a clothes brush but brushing is useless for those of silk Ordinary dirt may be removed from a silk umbrella by means of a clean sponge and cold water or if the soil should be so tenacious that this will not remove it a piece of linen rag dipped in spirits of wine or unsweetened gin will generally effect the desired end Having thus given our readers all the information on the subject in our power even down to the last quoted paragraph which may teach them how to preserve their Umbrellas we may wish them a hearty farewell hoping they may long live to use these promoters of comfort and of health and that they may always be as well shielded by fate from the metaphorical tempests of life as they are from its physical storms by a good modern Umbrella FINIS End of Project Gutenberg s Umbrellas and their History by William Sangster END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UMBRELLAS AND THEIR HISTORY This file
