none	none	Is it for yourself Tom Er no that is not exactly and Tom Swift the young inventor of airships and submarines blushed slightly Ah I see It s for your housekeeper missus Baggert Well I think she would like a pin of this sort True it s rather expensive but No it isn t for missus Baggert mister Track and Tom seemed a bit embarrassed No Well then Tom of course it s none of my affair except to sell you a good stone But if this brooch is for a young lady I can t recommend anything nicer Do you think you will take this or do you prefer to look at some others Oh I think this will do mister Track I guess I ll take Tom s words were interrupted by a sudden action on the part of the jeweler mister Track ran from behind the showcase and hastened toward the front door Did you see him Tom he cried I wonder which way he went Who asked the lad following the shopkeeper That man He s been walking up and down in front of my place for the last ten minutes ever since you ve been in here in fact and I don t like his looks What did he do Nothing much except to stare in here as if he was sizing my place up Sizing it up

none	none	Getting the lay of the land so he or some confederate could commit a robbery maybe A robbery Do you think that man was a thief I don t know that he was Tom and yet a jeweler has to be always on the watch and that isn t a joke either Tom Swift Swindlers and thieves are always on the alert for a chance to rob a jewelry store and they work many games I didn t notice any particular man looking in here said Tom who still held the diamond brooch in his hand Well I did went on the jeweler I happened to glance out of the window when you were looking at the pins and I saw his eyes staring in here in a suspicious manner He may have a confederate with him and when you re gone one may come in and pretend to want to look at some diamonds Then when I m showing him some the other man will enter engage my attention and the first man will slip out with a diamond ring or pin It s often done You seem to have it all worked out mister Track observed the lad with a smile

none	none	do you know but what I m in with a gang of thieves and that I m only pretending to want to buy a diamond pin Oh I guess I haven t known you Tom Swift ever since you were big enough to toddle not to be sure about what you re up to But I certainly didn t like the looks of that man However let s forget about him He seems to have gone down the street and after all perhaps I was mistaken Just wait until I show you a few more styles before you decide The young lady may like one of these and the jeweler went to another showcase and took out some more trays of brooches What makes you think she s a young lady mister Track asked the lad Oh it s easy guessing Tom We jewelers are good readers of character I can size up a young fellow coming in here to buy an engagement or a wedding ring as soon as he enters the door I suppose you ll soon be in the market for one of those Tom if all the reports I hear about you are true you and a certain Mary Nestor I er I think I don t care for any of these pins spoke Tom quickly with a blush I like the first lot best I think I ll take the one I had in my hand when that man alarmed you Ha That s odd What did I do with it Tom looked about on the showcase and glanced down on the floor He had mislaid the brooch but the jeweler with a laugh lifted it out of a tray a moment later I saw you lay it down he said We jewelers have to be on the watch Here it is I ll just put it in a box and With an exclamation mister Track gave a hasty glance toward his big show window Tom looked up and saw a man s face peering in At the sight of it he too uttered a cry of surprise The next instant the man outside knocked on the glass apparently with a piece of metal making a sharp sound As soon as he heard it the jeweler once more sprang from behind the showcase and leaped for the door crying There s the thief He s trying to cut a hole through my show window and reach in and get something It s an old trick I ll get the police Tom you stay here on guard and before the lad could utter a protest the jeweler had opened the door and was speeding down the street in the gathering darkness Tom stared about him in some bewilderment He was left alone in charge of a very valuable stock of jewelry the owner of which was racing after a supposed thief crying Police Help Thieves Stop him somebody This is a queer go mused Tom I wonder who that man was He looked like somebody I know and yet I can t seem to place his face I wonder if he was trying to rob the place Maybe there s another one a confederate around here This thought rather alarmed Tom so he went to the door and looked up and down the street He could see no suspicious characters but in the direction in which the jeweler was running there was a little throng of people following mister Track after the man who had knocked on the window I wish I was there instead of here mused the lad Still I can t leave or a thief might come in Perhaps that was the game and one of the gang is hanging around hoping the store will be deserted so he can enter and take what he likes Tom had read of such cases and he at once resolved that he would not only remain in the jewelry shop but that he would lock the door which he at once proceeded to do Then he breathed easier The town of Shopton in the outskirts of which Tom lived with his father and where the scene above narrated took place was none too well lighted at night and the lad had his doubts about the jeweler catching the oddly acting man especially as the latter had a good start But some one may head him off reasoned Tom Though if they do catch him I don t see what they can prove against him Hello here I am carrying this diamond pin around I might lose it Guess I ll put it back on the tray He replaced in the proper receptacle one of the pins he had been examining when the excitement occurred I wonder if Mary will like that he said softly I hope she does Perhaps it would be better if she could come here herself and pick out one Tom s musing was suddenly interrupted by a sharp tattoo on the glass door of the jewelry shop With a start he looked up to see staring in on him the face of the man who had been there before the man of whom the jeweler was even then in chase

8580_287364_000058_000001	train-clean-100	Why 
none	none	why stammered Tom The man knocked again Tom Tom Swift he called Don t you know me Know you you repeated the lad Yes don t you remember Earthquake Island how we were nearly killed there don t you remember mister Jenks mister Jenks Tom was so startled that he could only repeat words after the strange man who was talking to him from outside the glass door Yes mister Jenks was the reply 
8498_287359_000061_000001	train-clean-360	mister Barcoe Jenks 
none	none	who makes diamonds I saw you in the store about to buy a diamond I wanted to tell you not to I ll give you a better diamond than you can buy I just arrived in this place I must have a private talk with you Come out I ll share a wonderful secret with you A flood of memory came to Tom He did recall the very strange man who walked around Earthquake Island where Tom and some friends had been marooned recently walked about with a pocketful of what he said were diamonds Now Barcoe Jenks was here I must see you privately Tom Swift went on mister Jenks as he once more tapped on the glass Don t waste money buying diamonds when you and I can make better ones Where can I have a talk with you I mister Jenks suddenly looked down the dimly lighted street They re coming back he cried I don t want to be seen I ll call at your house later to night be on the watch for me until then good by He waved his hand and was gone in an instant Tom stood staring at the glass door He hardly knew whether to believe it or not perhaps it was all a dream He pinched himself to make sure that he was awake Very substantial flesh met his thumb and finger and he felt the pain I m awake all right he murmured But Barcoe Jenks here and still talking that nonsense about his manufactured diamonds I think he must be crazy I wonder Once more the lad s musing was interrupted He heard a murmur of excited voices outside the store on the street Then the door of the jewelry shop was tried mister Track s face was pressed against the glass Open the door Let me in Tom he called I ve caught the thief and as the lad unlocked the portal he saw that the jeweler held by the arm a ragged lad Ah you scoundrel I ve caught you cried the diamond merchant shaking the small chap while Tom looked on more mystified than ever CHAPTER II A MIDNIGHT VISIT While mister Track the jeweler and several citizens attracted by the chase after the supposed thief are crowded into the store anxious to hear explanations of the strange affair I will take the opportunity to tell you something of Tom Swift the lad who is to figure in this story Many of you have already made his acquaintance when he has been speeding about in his airship or fast electric runabout and to others we will state that our hero first made his bow to the public in the book called Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle the initial volume of this series In that story there was related how Tom made the acquaintance of an odd individual named mister Wakefield Damon who was continually blessing himself some part of his anatomy or his possessions mister Damon was riding a motor cycle and it started to climb a tree to his pain and fright Afterward Tom purchased the machine and had many adventures on it including a chase after a gang of men who had stolen a valuable patent model belonging to mister Swift mister Swift and his son were both inventors They lived together in a fine house in the suburbs of Shopton New York and with them dwelt missus Baggert the housekeeper for Tom s mother was dead and also Garret Jackson an expert engineer who aided the young inventor and his father in perfecting many machines There was also another semi member of the household to wit Eradicate Sampson an eccentric colored man who owned a mule called Boomerang Eradicate did odd jobs around the place and the mule assisted his owner that is when the mule felt like it In the second volume of the series entitled Tom Swift and His Motor Boat there was related the incidents following a pursuit after a gang of unprincipled men who sought to get possession of some of mister Swift s patents and it was while in this boat that Tom his father and a friend Ned Newton rescued from Lake Carlopa a mister John Sharp who fell from his burning balloon mister Sharp was a skilled aeronaut and after his recovery he joined Tom in building a big airship called the Red Cloud Tom s adventures in this craft are set down in detail in the third volume of the series called Tom Swift and His Airship Not only did he and mister Sharp and mister Damon make a great trip but they captured some bank robbers and incidentally cleared themselves from the imputation of having looted the vault of seventy five thousand dollars which charge was fostered by a certain mister Foger and his son Andy who was Tom s enemy Not satisfied with having conquered the air Tom and his father set to work to gain a victory over the ocean They built a boat that could navigate under water and in the fourth book of the series called Tom Swift and His Submarine Boat you will find an account of how they went under the ocean to secure a sunken treasure and the fight they had with their enemies who sought to get it away from them They went through many perils not the least of which was capture by a foreign warship In the fifth book entitled Tom Swift and His Electric Runabout there was told the story of a wonderfully speedy electric automobile the young inventor constructed and how he made a great race in it and saved from ruin a bank in which his father and mister Damon were interested Tom s ability as an inventor had by this time become well known One day as related in a volume called Tom Swift and His Wireless Message he received a letter from a mister Hosmer Fenwick of Philadelphia asking his aid in perfecting an airship which the resident of the Quaker City had built but which would not work In his small monoplane the Butterfly Tom and mister Damon went to Philadelphia as mister Damon was acquainted with mister Fenwick Tom carefully inspected the Whizzer which was the name of mister Fenwick s airship and after some difficulties succeeded in getting the electric craft in shape to make a flight Tom mister Damon and mister Fenwick started to make a trip to Cape May in the Whizzer but were caught in a terrific storm and blown out to sea The wind became a hurricane the airship was disabled and wrecked in mid air When it fell to earth it landed on one of the small West Indian islands but what was the terror of the three castaways to find that the island was subject to earthquake shocks But the earth tremors were not the only surprise in store for Tom and his two friends On the island they found five men and two ladies who by strange chance had been stranded there when the yacht Resolute owned by mister George Hosbrook was wrecked in the same storm that disabled the airship mister Hosbrook a millionaire was taking a party of friends to the West Indies When the castaways among whom were mister and missus Amos Nestor parents of Mary Nestor a girl of whom Tom was very fond found that there was danger of the island being destroyed in an earthquake they were in despair There seemed no way of being rescued as the island was out of the line of regular ship travel Tom however was resourceful With the electrical apparatus from the wrecked airship he built a wireless plant and sent messages for help broadcast over the ocean They were finally heard and answered by an operator on board the steamer Camberanian which came on under forced draught and rescued Tom and his friends It was only just in time for no sooner had they gotten aboard the steamer in lifeboats than the whole island was destroyed by an earthquake shock But Tom the parents of Mary Nestor mister Damon mister Fenwick and all the others got safely home Among the survivors from the yacht Resolute was a mister Barcoe Jenks who now most unexpectedly had confronted Tom through the glass window of the jewelry store mister Jenks was a peculiar man Tom discovered this on Earthquake Island mister Jenks carried with him some stones which he said were diamonds He asserted that he had made them but Tom did not know whether or not to believe this When it seemed that the castaways would not be saved mister Jenks offered Tom a large sum in these same diamonds for some plan whereby he might escape the earthquakes mister Jenks said there was a certain secret in connection with the manufactured diamonds that he had to solve that he had been defrauded of his rights and that a certain Phantom Mountain figured in it But Tom at that time paid little attention to mister Jenks talk The time was to come however when he would attach much importance to it When this story opens Tom was more interested in mister Barcoe Jenks than in any one else and was wondering what he wanted to see him about The young inventor could not quite understand how mister Track the jeweler could come back with a lad he suspected of being a thief when the person who had acted so suspiciously and who had knocked on the glass was the queer man mister Jenks Yes Tom I caught him the jeweler went on I chased after him and nabbed him It was hard work too for I m not a good runner Now you little rascal tell me why you tried to rob my store and the diamond merchant shook the lad roughly I I didn t try to rob your store was the timid answer Well perhaps you didn t exactly but your confederates did Why did you rap on the glass and why were you staring in so intently I wasn t lookin in Well if it wasn t you it was some one just like you But why did you run when I raced down the street I I don t know and the lad began to snivel I I jest ran that s all cause I see everybody else runnin an I thought there was a fire Ha That s a likely story You ran because you are guilty I m going to hand you over to the police Did he get anything mister Track asked one of the men who had joined the jeweler in the chase No I can t say that he did He didn t get a chance Tom Swift was in here at the time But this fellow was only waiting for a chance to steal or else to aid his confederates But if he didn t take anything I don t see how you can have him arrested went on the man On suspicion that s how asserted mister Track Will some one get me a constable I wouldn t call a constable said Tom quietly
8498_287357_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not 
none	none	Because that isn t the person who looked in your window How do you know Tom Because that person came back while you were out I saw him You saw him Did he try to steal any of my diamonds Tom No I guess he doesn t need any Why not There was wonder in the jeweler s tone Why he claims he can make all he wants Make diamonds So he says Why he must be crazy and mister Track laughed Perhaps he is admitted Tom I m only telling you what he says He s the person who acted so suspiciously He came back here I m telling you while you were running down the street and spoke to me Oh then you know him The jeweler s voice was suspicious I didn t at first admitted Tom But when he said he was mister Barcoe Jenks I remembered that I had met him when I was cast away on Earthquake Island And he says he can make diamonds asked mister Track What did he want of you and the jeweler looked at Tom quizzically He wanted to have a talk with me replied the lad and when he saw me in your store he tried to attract my attention by knocking on the glass That s a queer way to do declared mister Track What did he want I don t know exactly answered Tom not caring to go into details just then But I m sure mister Track that you ve got the wrong person there That lad never looked in the window nor knocked on the glass That s right I didn t asserted the captive The jeweler looked doubtful Why did you run he asked I told you I thought there was a fire That s right I don t believe he s the fellow you want put in another man I was standing on the corner near White s grocery store and I noticed this lad That was before I heard you yelling and saw you coming and then I joined in the chase I guess the man you were after got away Track He did asserted Tom He came back here a little while ago and he ran away just now as he heard you coming Where did he go asked the jeweler eagerly I don t know answered Tom Only you ve got the wrong lad here Well perhaps I have admitted the diamond merchant You can go youngster but next time don t run if you re not guilty I thought there was a fire repeated the lad as he hurriedly slipped through the crowd in the store and disappeared down the dark street Well I guess the excitement s all over and anyhow you weren t robbed Track said a stout man as he left the store The others soon followed and Tom and the jeweler were once more alone in the shop Can you tell me something about this man Tom asked mister Track eagerly So he really makes diamonds Who is he I d rather not tell just now replied the young inventor I don t take much stock in him myself I think he s visionary He may think he has made diamonds and he may have made some stones that look like them I m very skeptical If you could bring me some Tom I could soon tell whether they were real or not Can you The lad shook his head I don t expect to see mister Jenks again he said He talked rather wildly about waiting to meet me but that man is odd crazy perhaps and I don t imagine I ll see him He s harmless but he s eccentric Well there was quite some excitement for a time I should say there was I thought it was a plan to rob me and the jeweler began putting away the diamond pins In fact the excitement so filled the minds of himself and Tom that neither of them thought any more of the object of the lad s visit and the young inventor departed without purchasing the pin he had come after It was not until he was out on the street walking toward his home that the matter came back to his mind I declare he exclaimed I didn t get that pin for Mary after all Well never mind I have a week until her birthday and I can get it to morrow He walked rapidly toward home for the weather looked threatening and Tom had no umbrella He was musing on the happenings of the evening when he reached his house His father was out as was Garret Jackson the engineer and missus Baggert the housekeeper was entertaining a lady in the sitting room so as Tom was rather tired he went directly to his own room and a little later got into bed It was shortly after midnight when he was awakened by hearing a rattling on the window of his room The reason he was able to fix the time so accurately was because as soon as he awakened he pressed a little electric button and it illuminated the face of a small clock on his bureau The hands pointed to five minutes past twelve Humph That sounds like hail exclaimed Tom as he arose and looked out of the casement I wonder if any of the skylights of the airship shed are open There might be some damage Guess I d better go out and take a look He had mentally reasoned this far before he had looked out and when he saw that the moon was brightly shining in a clear sky he was a bit surprised Why that wasn t hail he murmured It isn t even raining I wonder what it was He was answered a moment later for a shower of fine gravel from the walk flew up and clattered against the glass With a start Tom looked down and saw a dark figure standing under an apple tree Hello Who s there called the lad after he had raised the sash It s I mister Jenks was the surprising answer mister Jenks repeated Tom Yes Barcoe Jenks of Earthquake Island You here What do you want Can you come down
8580_287363_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 What for 
none	none	Tom Swift I ve something very important to tell you was the answer in a low voice yet which carried to Tom s ears perfectly Do you want to make a fortune for yourself and for me How Tom was beginning to think more and more that mister Jenks was crazy How By helping me to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain where the diamonds are made
8498_287359_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you 
none	none	Wait a minute I ll come down answered Tom and he began to grope for his clothes in the dim light of the little electric lamp What was the secret of Phantom Mountain What did mister Jenks really want Could he make diamonds Tom asked himself these questions as he hastily dressed to go down to his midnight visitor 
8498_287357_000011_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER III A STRANGE STORY
8498_287357_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Well mister Jenks began Tom when he had descended to the garden and greeted the man who had acted so strangely on Earthquake Island this is rather an odd time for a visit 
8498_287357_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I realize that Tom Swift was the answer and the lad noticed that the man spoke much more calmly than he had that evening at the jewelry shop 
8498_287357_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 I realize that but I have to be cautious in my movements 
none	none	Why
8498_287357_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Because there are enemies on my track 
8498_287357_000015_000001	train-clean-360	If they thought I was seeking aid to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain my life might pay the forfeit 
8498_287357_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you in earnest mister Jenks 
none	none	I certainly am and while I must apologize for awakening you at this unseemly hour and for the mysterious nature of my visit if you will let me tell my story you will see the need of secrecy
8498_287357_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I don t mind being awakened answered Tom good naturedly but I will be frank with you mister Jenks 
8498_287357_000018_000001	train-clean-360	I hardly can believe what you have stated to me several times that you know how diamonds can be made 
8498_287357_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I can prove it to you was the quiet answer 
8498_287357_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know 
none	none	For centuries men have tried to discover the secret of transmuting base metals into gold and how to make diamonds by chemical means 
8498_287357_000020_000002	train-clean-360	But they have all been failures 
8498_287357_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 All except this process the process used at Phantom Mountain insisted the queer man 
8498_287357_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you want to hear my story 
8498_287357_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I have no objections 
8498_287357_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Then let me warn you went on mister Jenks that if you do hear it you will be so fascinated by it that I am sure you will want to cast your lot in with mine and aid me to get my rights and solve the mystery And I also want to warn you that if you do there is a certain amount of danger connected with it 
8498_287357_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I m used to danger answered Tom quietly 
8498_287357_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Let me hear your story But first explain how you came to come here and why you acted so strangely at the jewelry store 
8498_287357_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Willingly 
8498_287357_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I tried to attract your attention at the store because I saw that you were going to buy a diamond and I didn t want you to 
none	none	Why not
8498_287357_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I want to present you with a beautiful stone that will answer your purpose as well or better than any one you could buy 
8498_287357_000027_000001	train-clean-360	That will prove my story better than any amount of words or argument 
8498_287357_000027_000002	train-clean-360	But I could not attract your attention without also attracting that of the jeweler He became suspicious gave chase and I thought it best to vanish 
8498_287357_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I hope no one was made to suffer for what may have been my imprudence 
8498_287357_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 No the lad whom mister Track caught was let go 
8498_287357_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But how did you happen to come to Shopton 
8498_287357_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 To see you 
8498_287357_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I got your address from the owner of the yacht Resolute 
8498_287357_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I knew that if there was one person who could aid me to recover my rights it would be you Tom Swift 
8498_287357_000029_000003	train-clean-360	Will you help me 
8498_287357_000029_000006	train-clean-360	Will you come 
8498_287357_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Will you come with me to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain 
8498_287357_000029_000005	train-clean-360	If we go it will have to be in an airship for in no other way I think can we come upon the place as it is closely guarded 
none	none	Will you come 
8498_287357_000029_000007	train-clean-360	I will pay you well 
8498_287357_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps I had better hear your story said the young inventor 
8498_287357_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 But first let me suggest that we move farther away from the house 
8498_287357_000030_000002	train-clean-360	My father or mister Jackson or the housekeeper may hear us talking and it may disturb them 
8498_287357_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Come with me to my private shop and Tom led the way to a small building where he did experimental work 
8498_287357_000030_000004	train-clean-360	He unlocked the door with a key he carried turned on the lights which were run by a storage battery and motioned mister Jenks to a seat 
8498_287357_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Now I ll hear your story said Tom 
8498_287357_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll make it as short as possible went on the queer man 
8498_287357_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 To begin with it is now several years ago since a poorly dressed stranger applied to me one night for money enough to get a meal and a bed to sleep in 
8498_287357_000032_000002	train-clean-360	I was living in New York City at the time and this was midnight as I was returning home from my club 
8498_287357_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I was touched by the man s appearance and gave him some money 
8498_287357_000033_000001	train-clean-360	He asked for my card saying he would repay me some day 
8498_287357_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I gave it to him little thinking I would hear from the man again 
8498_287357_000033_000003	train-clean-360	But I did 
8498_287357_000033_000004	train-clean-360	He called at my apartments about a week later saying he had secured work as an expert setter of diamonds and wanted to repay me 
8498_287357_000033_000005	train-clean-360	I did not want to take his money but the fact that such a sorry looking specimen of manhood as he had been when I aided him was an expert handler of gems interested me 
8498_287357_000033_000006	train-clean-360	I talked with the man and he made a curious statement 
8498_287357_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 This man who gave his name as Enos Folwell said he knew a place where diamonds could be made partly in a scientific manner and partly by the forces of nature 
8498_287357_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I laughed at him but he told me so many details that I began to believe him 
8498_287357_000034_000002	train-clean-360	He said he and some other friends of his who were diamond cutters had a plant in the midst of the Rocky Mountains where they had succeeded in making several small but very perfect diamonds 
8498_287357_000034_000003	train-clean-360	They had come to the end of their rope though so to speak because they could not afford to buy the materials needed 
none	none	Folwell said that he and his companions had temporarily separated had left the mountain where they made diamonds and agreed to meet there later when they had more money with which to purchase materials 
8498_287357_000034_000005	train-clean-360	They had all agreed to go out into civilization and work for enough funds to enable them to go on with their diamond making 
8498_287357_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I hardly knew whether to believe the man or not but he offered proof He had several small but very perfect diamonds with him and he gave them to me to have tested in any way I desired 
8498_287357_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I promised to look into the matter and as I was quite wealthy as in fact I am now and if I found that the stones he gave me were real I said I might invest some money in the plant 
none	none	Were the diamonds good asked Tom who was beginning to be interested
8498_287357_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 They were stones of the first water though small 
8498_287357_000038_000001	train-clean-360	An expert gem merchant to whom I took them said he had never seen any diamonds like them and he wanted to know where I got them 
8498_287357_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Of course I did not tell him 
8498_287357_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 To make a long story short I saw Folwell again told him to communicate with his companions and to tell them that I would agree to supply the cash needed if I could share in the diamond making 
8498_287357_000039_000001	train-clean-360	To this they agreed and after some weeks spent in preparation a party of us set out for Phantom Mountain 
8498_287357_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Phantom Mountain interrupted Tom 
8498_287357_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Where is it 
8498_287357_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know exactly it s somewhere in the Rockies but the exact location is a mystery 
8498_287357_000041_000001	train-clean-360	That is why I need your help 
8498_287357_000041_000002	train-clean-360	You will soon understand the reason 
8498_287357_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Well as I said myself Folwell and the others who were not exactly prepossessing sort of men started west 
8498_287357_000041_000004	train-clean-360	When we got to a small town called Indian Ridge near Leadville Colorado the men insisted that I must now proceed in secret and consent to be blindfolded as they were not yet ready to reveal the secret of the place where they made the diamonds 
8498_287357_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not want to agree to this but they insisted and I gave in foolishly perhaps 
none	none	At any rate I was blindfolded one night placed in a wagon and we drove off into the mountains 
8498_287357_000042_000002	train-clean-360	After traveling for some distance I was led still blindfolded up a steep trail 
8498_287357_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 When the bandage was taken off my eyes I saw that I was in a large cave 
8498_287357_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The men were with me and they apologized for the necessity that caused them to blindfold me 
none	none	They said they were ready to proceed with the making of diamonds but I must promise not to seek to discover the secret until they gave me permission nor was I to attempt to leave the cave 
8498_287357_000043_000003	train-clean-360	I had to agree 
8498_287357_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Next they demanded that I give them a large sum which I had promised when they showed me conclusively that they could make diamonds 
8498_287357_000044_000001	train-clean-360	I refused to do this until I had seen some of the precious stones and they agreed that this was fair but said I would have to wait a few days 
8498_287357_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I waited and all that while I was virtually a prisoner in the cave 
none	none	All I could learn was that it was in the midst of a great range near the top and that one of the peaks was called Phantom Mountain Why I did not learn until later
8498_287357_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 At last one night during a terrific thunder storm the leader of the diamond makers Folwell announced that I could now see the stones made The men had been preparing their chemicals for some days previous 
8498_287357_000046_000001	train-clean-360	I was taken into a small chamber of the cave and there saw quite a complicated apparatus 
8498_287357_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Part of it was a great steel box with a lever on it 
8498_287357_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 We will let you make some diamonds for yourself Folwell said to me and he directed me to pull the lever of the box at a certain signal The signal came just as a terrific crash of thunder shook the very mountain inside of which we were 
none	none	The box of steel got red hot and when it cooled off it was opened and was given a handful of white stones Were they diamonds asked Tom eagerly 
8498_287357_000049_000000	train-clean-360	mister Jenks held out one hand 
8498_287357_000049_000001	train-clean-360	In the palm glittered a large stone ostensibly a diamond 
8498_287357_000049_000002	train-clean-360	In the rays of the moon it showed all the colors of the rainbow a beautiful gem 
8498_287357_000049_000003	train-clean-360	 That is one of the stones I made or rather that I supposed I had made went on mister Jenks 
8498_287357_000049_000004	train-clean-360	 It is one of several I have but they have not all been cut and polished as has this one 
8498_287357_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Naturally I was much impressed by what I saw and after I had made certain tests which convinced me that the stones in the steel box were diamonds I paid over the money as I had promised 
8498_287357_000050_000001	train-clean-360	That was my undoing 
none	none	How
8498_287357_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 As soon as the men got the cash they had no further use for me 
8498_287357_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The next I remember is eating a rude meal while we discussed the future of making diamonds 
8498_287357_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I knew nothing more until I found myself back in the small hotel at Indian Ridge whence I had gone some time previous with the men to the cave in the mountain 
8498_287357_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 What happened asked Tom much surprised by the unexpected outcome of the affair 
8498_287357_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I had been tricked that was all 
8498_287357_000054_000001	train-clean-360	As soon as the men had my money they had no further use for me 
8498_287357_000054_000002	train-clean-360	They did not want me to learn the secret of their diamond making and they drugged me carried me away from the cave and left me in the hotel 
8498_287357_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t you try to find the cave again 
8498_287357_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I did but without avail 
8498_287357_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I spent some time in the Rockies but no one could tell where Phantom Mountain was in fact few had heard of it and I was nearly lost searching for it 
8498_287357_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I came back East determined to get even 
none	none	I had given the men a very large sum of money and in exchange they had given me several diamonds 
8498_287357_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Probably the stones are worth nearly as much as the money I invested but I was cheated for I was promised an equal share in the profits 
8498_287357_000057_000003	train-clean-360	These were denied me and I was tricked 
8498_287357_000057_000004	train-clean-360	I determined to be revenged or at least to discover the secret of making diamonds 
8498_287357_000057_000005	train-clean-360	It is my right 
8498_287357_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 I agree with you spoke Tom 
8498_287357_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 But up to the time I met you on Earthquake Island I could form no plan for discovering Phantom Mountain and learning the secret of the diamond makers went on mister Jenks 
none	none	I carried the gems about with me as you doubtless saw when we were on the island 
8498_287357_000059_000002	train-clean-360	But I knew I needed an airship in which to fly over the mountains and pick out the location of the cave where the diamonds are made 
8498_287357_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 But how can you locate it if you were blindfolded when you were taken there mister Jenks 
8498_287357_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I forgot to tell you that on our journey into the mountains and just before I was carried into the cave I managed to raise one corner of the bandage 
8498_287357_000061_000001	train-clean-360	I caught a glimpse of a very peculiarly shaped cliff it is like a great head standing out in bold relief against the moonlight when I saw it 
none	none	That head of rock is near the cave 
8498_287357_000061_000003	train-clean-360	It may be the landmark by which we can locate Phantom Mountain 
8498_287357_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps admitted the young inventor 
8498_287357_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 What I want to know is this went on mister Jenks 
8498_287357_000063_000001	train-clean-360	 Will you go with me on this quest go in your airship to discover the secret of the diamond makers 
8498_287357_000063_000002	train-clean-360	If you will I will share with you whatever diamonds we can discover or make besides paying all expenses 
8498_287357_000063_000003	train-clean-360	Will you go Tom Swift 
8498_287357_000064_000000	train-clean-360	The young inventor did not know what to answer 
8498_287357_000064_000001	train-clean-360	How far was mister Jenks to be trusted 
8498_287357_000064_000002	train-clean-360	Were the stones he had real diamonds 
8498_287357_000064_000003	train-clean-360	Was his story fantastical as it sounded true 
8498_287357_000064_000004	train-clean-360	Would it be safe for Tom to go 
8498_287357_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The lad asked himself these questions 
8498_287357_000065_000001	train-clean-360	mister Jenks saw his hesitation 
8498_287357_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Here said the strange man I will prove what I say 
none	none	Take this diamond 
8498_287357_000066_000002	train-clean-360	I intended it for you anyhow for what you did for me on Earthquake Island 
8498_287357_000066_000003	train-clean-360	Take it and and give it to the person for whom you were about to purchase a diamond to night 
8498_287357_000066_000004	train-clean-360	But first of all take it to a gem expert and get his opinion 
none	none	That will prove the truth of what I say Tom Swift and I feel sure that you will cast your lot in with mine and help me to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain and aid me to get my rights from the diamond makers 
8498_287358_000000_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER IV ANDY FOGER GETS A FRIGHT
8498_287358_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Tom Swift considered a few minutes 
8498_287358_000001_000001	train-clean-360	On the face of it the proposition appealed to him 
none	none	He had been home some time now after his adventures on Earthquake Island and he was beginning to long for more excitement 
8498_287358_000001_000003	train-clean-360	The search for the mysterious mountain and the cave of the diamond makers might offer a new field for him 
8498_287358_000001_000004	train-clean-360	But there came to him a certain distrust of mister Jenks 
8498_287358_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t like to doubt your word began Tom slowly but you know mister Jenks that some of the greatest chemists have tried in vain to make diamonds or at best they have made only tiny ones 
8498_287358_000002_000001	train-clean-360	To think that any man or set of men made real diamonds as large as the ones you have doesn t seem well and Tom hesitated 
8498_287358_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean you can hardly believe me asked mister Jenks 
8498_287358_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess that s it assented Tom 
8498_287358_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t blame you a bit exclaimed the odd man 
8498_287358_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 In fact I didn t believe it when they told me they could make diamonds 
8498_287358_000005_000002	train-clean-360	But they proved it to me 
8498_287358_000005_000003	train-clean-360	I m ready now to prove it to you 
8498_287358_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you what I ll do 
8498_287358_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Here s this one stone cut ready for setting 
8498_287358_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Here s another uncut and mister Jenks drew from his pocket what looked like a piece of crystal 
8498_287358_000006_000003	train-clean-360	 Take them to any jeweler he resumed to the one in whose place I saw you to night 
8498_287358_000006_000004	train-clean-360	I ll abide by the verdict you get and I ll come here to morrow night and hear what you have to say 
none	none	Why do you come at night asked Tom thinking there was something suspicious in that
8498_287358_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Because my life might be in danger if I was seen talking to you and showing you diamonds in the daytime especially just now 
8498_287358_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Why at this particular time 
8498_287358_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 For the reason that the diamond makers are on my trail 
8498_287358_000010_000001	train-clean-360	As long as I remained quiet after their shabby treatment of me and did not try to discover their secret they were all right 
8498_287358_000010_000002	train-clean-360	But after I realized that I had been cheated out of my rights and when I began to make an investigation with a view to discovering their secret whereabouts I received mysterious and anonymous warnings to stop 
8498_287358_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 But I did not 
8498_287358_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I came East and tried to get help to discover the cave of the diamond makers but I was unsuccessful 
8498_287358_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I needed an airship as I said and no person who could operate one would agree to go with me on the quest 
8498_287358_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Again I received a warning to drop all search for the diamond makers but I persisted and about a week ago I found I was being shadowed 
8498_287358_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Shadowed by whom asked Tom 
none	none	By a man I never remember seeing but who I have no doubt is one of the diamond making gang
8498_287358_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think he means you harm 
8498_287358_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sure of it 
none	none	That is the reason I have to act so in secret and come to see you at night 
8498_287358_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I don t want those scoundrels to find out what I am about to do 
8498_287358_000015_000003	train-clean-360	On my return from Earthquake Island I again endeavored to interest an airship man in my plan but he evidently thought me insane Then I thought of you as I had done before but I was afraid you too would laugh at my proposition 
8498_287358_000015_000004	train-clean-360	However I decided to come here and I did 
none	none	It seemed almost providential that my first view of you was in a jewelry shop looking at diamonds 
8498_287358_000015_000006	train-clean-360	I took it as a good omen 
8498_287358_000015_000007	train-clean-360	Now it remains with you 
8498_287358_000015_000008	train-clean-360	May I call here to morrow night and get your answer 
8498_287358_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Tom Swift made up his mind quickly 
8498_287358_000016_000001	train-clean-360	After all it would be easy enough to find out if the diamonds were real 
8498_287358_000016_000002	train-clean-360	If they were he could then decide whether or not to go with mister Jenks on the mysterious quest 
8498_287358_000016_000003	train-clean-360	So he answered 
8498_287358_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll consider the matter mister Jenks 
8498_287358_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I ll meet you here to morrow night 
8498_287358_000017_000002	train-clean-360	In the meanwhile for my own satisfaction I ll let an expert look at these stones 
8498_287358_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Get the greatest diamond expert in the world and he ll pronounce them perfect predicted the odd man 
8498_287358_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Now I ll bid you goodnight and be going 
8498_287358_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I ll be here at this time to morrow 
none	none	As mister Jenks turned aside there was a movement among the trees in the orchard and a shadowy figure was seen hurrying away
8498_287358_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Who s that asked the diamond man in a hoarse whisper 
8498_287358_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you see that Tom Swift 
8498_287358_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Some one was here listening to what I said 
8498_287358_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps it was the man who has been shadowing me 
8498_287358_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I think not 
8498_287358_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I guess it was Eradicate Sampson a colored man who does work for us said Tom 
8498_287358_000021_000002	train-clean-360	 Is that you Rad he called 
none	none	Yais sah Massa Tom heah I is answered the voice of the negro but it came from an entirely different direction than that in which the shadowy figure had been seen
8498_287358_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are you Rad called the young inventor 
none	none	Right heah was the reply and the colored man came from the direction of the stable I were jest out seein if mah mule Boomerang were all right 
8498_287358_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Sometimes he s restless an don t sleep laik he oughter 
8498_287358_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Then that wasn t you over in the orchard asked Tom in some uneasiness 
none	none	No sah I ain t been in de orchard I were sleepin in mah shack till jest a few minutes ago when I got up an went in t see Boomerang I had a dream dat some coon were tryin t steal him an it sort ob sturbed me laik
8498_287358_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 If it wasn t your man it was some one else said mister Jenks decidedly 
8498_287358_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll have a look exclaimed Tom 
8498_287358_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Here Rad come over and scurry among those trees 
8498_287358_000028_000002	train-clean-360	We just saw some one sneaking around 
none	none	I ll sure do dat cried the colored man Mebby it were somebody arter Boomerang I ll find em
8498_287358_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe it was any one after the mule murmured mister Jenks but it certainly was some one more likely some one after me 
8498_287358_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The three made a hasty search among the trees but the intruder had vanished leaving no trace 
8498_287358_000031_000001	train-clean-360	They went out into the road which the moon threw into bold relief along its white stretch but there was no figure scurrying away 
8498_287358_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Whoever it was is gone spoke Tom 
8498_287358_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 You can go back to bed Rad for the colored man of late had been sleeping in a shack on the Swift premises 
8498_287358_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 And I guess it s time for me to go too added mister Jenks 
8498_287358_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll be here to morrow night Tom and I hope your answer will be favorable 
8498_287358_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Tom did not sleep well the remainder of the night for his fitful slumbers were disturbed by dreams of enormous caves filled with diamonds with dark shadowy figures trying to put him into a red hot steel box 
none	none	Once he awakened with a start and put his hand under his pillow to feel if the two stones mister Jenks had given him were still there 
8498_287358_000034_000002	train-clean-360	They had not been disturbed 
8498_287358_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Tom made up his mind to find out if the stones were really diamonds before saying anything to his father about the chance of going to seek Phantom Mountain 
none	none	And the young inventor wished to get the opinion of some other jeweler than mister Track at least at first
8498_287358_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Though if this one proves to be a good gem I ll have mister Track set it in a brooch and give it to Mary for her birthday decided the young inventor 
8498_287358_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Guess I ll take a run over to Chester in the Butterfly and see what one of the jewelers there has to say 
8498_287358_000037_000000	train-clean-360	In addition to his big airship Red Cloud Tom owned a small swift monoplane which he called Butterfly 
8498_287358_000037_000001	train-clean-360	This had been damaged by Andy Foger just before Tom left on the trip that ended at Earthquake Island but the monoplane had been repaired and Andy had left town not having returned since 
8498_287358_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Telling his father that he was going off on a little business trip which he often did in his aeroplane Tom with the aid of mister Jackson the engineer wheeled the Butterfly out of its shed 
8498_287358_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Adjusting the mechanism and seeing that it was in good shape Tom took his place in one of the two seats for the monoplane would carry two mister Jackson then spun the propellers and with a crackle and roar the motor started 
8498_287358_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Over the ground ran the dainty little aeroplane until having momentum enough Tom tilted the wing planes and the machine sailed up into the air 
8498_287358_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Rising about a thousand feet and circling about several times to test the wind currents Tom headed his craft toward Chester a city about fifty miles from Shopton 
8498_287358_000040_000001	train-clean-360	In his pocket snugly tucked away were the two stones mister Jenks had given him 
8498_287358_000041_000000	train-clean-360	It was not long before Tom saw looming up in the distance the church spires and towering factory chimneys of Chester for his machine was a speedy one and could make ninety miles an hour when driven 
8498_287358_000041_000001	train-clean-360	But now a slower speed satisfied our hero 
8498_287358_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll just drop down outside of the city he reasoned for too much of a crowd gathers when I land in the street 
8498_287358_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Besides I might frighten horses and then too it s hard to get a good start from the street I ll leave it in some barn until I want to go back 
8498_287358_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Tom sent his craft down in order to pick out a safe place for a landing 
none	none	He was then over the suburbs of the city and was following the line of a straight country road
8498_287358_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Looks like a good place there he murmured 
8498_287358_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll shut off the motor and vol plane down 
8498_287358_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Suiting the action to the word Tom shut off his power 
8498_287358_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The little craft dipped toward the ground but the lad threw up the forward planes and caught a current of air that sent him skimming along horizontally 
none	none	As he got nearer to the ground he saw the figure of a lad riding a bicycle along the country highway 
8498_287358_000046_000001	train-clean-360	Something about the figure struck Tom as being familiar and he recognized the cyclist a moment later 
8498_287358_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 It s Andy Foger said Tom in a whisper 
none	none	I wondered where he had been keeping himself since he damaged the Butterfly 
8498_287358_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Evidently he doesn t dare venture back to Shopton 
8498_287358_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Well here s where I give him a scare 
8498_287358_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Tom s monoplane was making no more noise now than a soaring bird 
8498_287358_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He was gliding swiftly toward the earth and with the plan in his mind of administering some sort of punishment to the bully he aimed the machine directly at him 
8498_287358_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Nearer and nearer shot the monoplane as quietly as a sheet of paper might fall 
8498_287358_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Andy pedaled on never looking up nor behind him A moment later as Tom threw up his headplanes to make his landing more easy and just as he swooped down at one side of the cyclist our hero let out a most alarming yell right into Andy s ear 
8498_287358_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Now I ve got you he shouted 
8498_287358_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll teach you to slash my aeroplane Come with me 
8498_287358_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Andy gave one look at the white bird like apparatus that had flown up beside him so noiselessly and being too frightened to recognize Tom s voice must have thought that he had been overtaken by some supernatural visitor 
8498_287358_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Andy gave a yell like an Indian about to do a stage scalping act and fairly dived over the handlebars of his bicycle sprawling in a heap on the dusty road 
none	none	I guess that will hold you for a while observed Tom grimly as he put on the ground brake and brought his monoplane to a stop not far from the fallen rider CHAPTER V A MYSTERIOUS MAN 
8498_287359_000001_000000	train-clean-360	For several minutes Andy Foger did not arise 
8498_287359_000001_000001	train-clean-360	He remained prostrate in the dust and Tom observing him thought perhaps the bully might have been seriously injured 
8498_287359_000001_000002	train-clean-360	But a little later Andy cautiously raised his head and inquired in a frightened voice 
8498_287359_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it is it gone 
8498_287359_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Is what gone asked Tom grimly 
none	none	At the sound of his voice Andy looked up
8498_287359_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 Was that you Tom Swift he demanded 
8498_287359_000004_000002	train-clean-360	 Did you knock me off my wheel 
8498_287359_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 My monoplane and I together did was the reply or rather we didn t 
8498_287359_000005_000001	train-clean-360	It was the nervous reaction caused by your fright and the knowledge that you had done wrong that made you jump over the handlebars 
8498_287359_000005_000002	train-clean-360	That s the scientific explanation 
8498_287359_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 You you did it stammered Andy getting to his feet 
8498_287359_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He wasn t hurt much Tom thought 
8498_287359_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Have it your own way resumed our hero 
8498_287359_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Did you think it was a hob goblin in a chariot of fire after you Andy 
8498_287359_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Huh 
8498_287359_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Never mind what I thought 
8498_287359_000008_000002	train-clean-360	I ll have you arrested for this 
none	none	Will you 
8498_287359_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Delighted as the boys say 
8498_287359_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Hop in my airship and I ll take you right into town 
none	none	And when I get you there I ll make a charge of malicious mischief against you for breaking the propeller of the Butterfly and slashing her wings 
8498_287359_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I ve mended her up however so she goes better than ever and I can take you to the police station in jig time 
8498_287359_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Want to come Andy 
8498_287359_000010_000000	train-clean-360	This was too much for the bully 
8498_287359_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He knew that Tom would have a clear case against him and he did not dare answer 
8498_287359_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Instead he shuffled over to where his wheel lay picked it up and rode slowly off 
8498_287359_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Good riddance murmured Tom 
8498_287359_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He looked about and saw that he was near a house in the rear of which was a good sized barn 
8498_287359_000011_000002	train-clean-360	 Guess I ll ask if I can leave the Butterfly there he murmured and ringing the doorbell he was greeted by a man 
8498_287359_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll pay you if you ll let me store my machine in the barn a little while until I go into the city and return spoke the lad 
8498_287359_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed you re welcome to leave it there without pay was the answer I m interested in airships and I ll consider it a favor if you ll let me look yours over while it s here 
8498_287359_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Tom readily agreed and a few minutes later he had caught a trolley going into the city 
8498_287359_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He was soon in one of the largest jewelry stores of Chester 
none	none	I d like to get an expert opinion as to whether or not those stones are diamonds spoke Tom to the polite clerk who came up to wait on him and our hero handed over the two gems which mister Jenks had given him I m willing to pay for the appraisement of course the young inventor added as he saw the clerk looking rather doubtfully at him for Tom had on a rough suit which he always donned when he flew in his monoplane I ll turn them over to our mister Porter a gem expert said the clerk Please be seated 
8498_287359_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The young man disappeared into a private office with the stones and Tom waited 
8498_287359_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He wondered if he was going to have his trouble for his pains Presently two elderly gentlemen came from the little room on the glass door of which appeared the word Diamonds 
8498_287359_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Who brought these stones in asked one of the men evidently the proprietor from the deference paid him by the clerk 
none	none	The latter motioned to Tom
8498_287359_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you kindly step inside here requested the elderly man 
8498_287359_000019_000001	train-clean-360	When the door was closed Tom found himself in a room which was mostly taken up with a bench for the display of precious stones a few chairs and some lights arranged peculiarly while various scales and instruments stood on a table 
8498_287359_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You wished an opinion on on these queried the proprietor of the place 
8498_287359_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Tom noticed at once that the word diamonds was not used 
8498_287359_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I wanted to find out if they were of any value he said 
8498_287359_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Are they diamonds 
8498_287359_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you mind stating where you got them asked the other of the two men 
8498_287359_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that necessary inquired the lad 
none	none	I came by them in a legitimate manner if that s what you mean and I can satisfy you on that point I am willing to pay for any information you may give me as to their value
8498_287359_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh it isn t that the proprietor hastened to assure him 
8498_287359_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 But these are diamonds of such a peculiar kind so perfect and without a flaw that I wondered from what part of the world they came 
8498_287359_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Then they are diamonds asked Tom eagerly 
8498_287359_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 The finest I have ever tested declared the other man evidently mister Porter the gem expert 
8498_287359_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 They are a joy to look at mister Roberts he went on turning to the proprietor 
8498_287359_000026_000002	train-clean-360	 If it is possible to get a supply of them you would be justified in asking half as much again as we charge for African or Indian diamonds 
8498_287359_000026_000003	train-clean-360	The Kimberly products are not to be compared to these and he looked at the two stones in his hand the one cut and sparkling brilliantly the other in a rough state 
8498_287359_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you care to state where these diamonds came from asked mister Roberts looking critically at Tom 
8498_287359_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I had rather not answered the lad 
8498_287359_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 It is enough for me to know that they are diamonds 
8498_287359_000028_000002	train-clean-360	How much is your charge 
8498_287359_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing was the unexpected answer 
8498_287359_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 We are very glad to have had the opportunity of seeing such stones 
8498_287359_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Is there any chance of getting any more 
8498_287359_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps answered Tom as he accepted the gems which the expert held out to him 
8498_287359_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Then might we speak for a supply went on mister Roberts eagerly 
8498_287359_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 We will pay you the full market price 
8498_287359_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the value of these stones asked Tom 
8498_287359_000033_000000	train-clean-360	mister Roberts looked at his gem expert 
none	none	It is difficult to say was the answer of the man who had handed Tom the gems
8498_287359_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 They are so far superior to the usual run of diamonds that I feel justified in saying that the cut one would bring fifteen hundred dollars anywhere 
8498_287359_000034_000002	train-clean-360	In fact I would offer that for it 
8498_287359_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The other is larger though what it would lose in cutting would be hard to say 
8498_287359_000034_000004	train-clean-360	I should say it was worth two thousand dollars as it is now 
8498_287359_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Thirty five hundred dollars for these two stones exclaimed Tom 
8498_287359_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 They are worth every cent of it declared mister Roberts 
8498_287359_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you want to sell 
8498_287359_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Tom shook his head 
8498_287359_000037_000001	train-clean-360	He could scarcely believe the good news 
8498_287359_000037_000002	train-clean-360	mister Jenks had told the truth 
8498_287359_000037_000003	train-clean-360	Now the young inventor could go with him to seek the diamond makers 
8498_287359_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you get any more of these went on mister Roberts 
8498_287359_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I think so that is I don t know I am going to try answered the lad 
8498_287359_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Then if you succeed I wish you would sell us some fairly begged the proprietor of the store 
8498_287359_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I will promised Tom but he little knew what lay before him or perhaps he would not have made that promise 
8498_287359_000041_000001	train-clean-360	He thanked the diamond merchant for his kindness and arranged to have the cut stone set in a pin for Miss Nestor 
8498_287359_000041_000002	train-clean-360	The uncut gem Tom took away with him 
none	none	Thinking of many things and wondering how best to start in his airship Red Cloud for the mysterious Phantom Mountain Tom hurried back to where he had left the monoplane wheeled it out and was soon soaring through the air toward Shopton
8498_287359_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I ll go with mister Jenks he decided as he prepared for a landing in the open space near his aeroplane shed 
8498_287359_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 It will be a risky trip perhaps but I ve taken risks before 
8498_287359_000043_000002	train-clean-360	When mister Jenks comes to night I ll tell him I ll help him to get his rights and discover the secret of the diamond makers 
8498_287359_000044_000000	train-clean-360	As Tom was wheeling the Butterfly into the shed Eradicate came out to help him 
none	none	Dere s a general man here to see yo Massa Tom said the colored man
8498_287359_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is it 
none	none	I dunno He keep askin ef yo de lad what done bust up Earthquake Island an send lightnin flashes up to de sky an all sech questions laik dat
8498_287359_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t mister Damon is it Rad 
none	none	He hasn t been around in some time
8498_287359_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 No Massa Tom it ain t him 
none	none	I knows dat blessin man good an proper I jest wish he d bless mah mule Boomerang some day an take some oh de temper out ob him No sah it ain t Massa Damon De general man s in de airship shed waitin fo you
8498_287359_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 In the airship shed 
8498_287359_000050_000001	train-clean-360	No strangers are allowed in there Rad 
none	none	I knows it Massa Tom but he done persisted his se f inter it an he wouldn t come out when I told him an your pa an mister Jackson ain t home
8498_287359_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll see about this exclaimed Tom striding to the large shed where the Red Cloud was kept 
8498_287359_000052_000001	train-clean-360	As he entered it he saw a man looking over the wonderful craft 
none	none	Did you want to see me asked Tom sharply for he did not like strangers prowling around
8498_287359_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 I did and I apologize for entering here but I am interested in airships and I thought you might want to hire a pilot 
8498_287359_000054_000001	train-clean-360	I am in need of employment and I have had considerable to do with balloons and aeroplanes but never with an airship like this which combines the two features 
none	none	Do you wish to hire any one No I don t replied Tom sharply for he did not like the looks of the man
8498_287359_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I was told that you did was the rather surprising answer 
8498_287359_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Who told you 
none	none	The man looked all around the shed before replying as if fearful of being overheard Then stepping close to Tom he whispered
8498_287359_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Jenks told me 
8498_287359_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Jenks Tom could not conceal his astonishment 
none	none	Yes mister Barcoe Jenks 
8498_287359_000061_000002	train-clean-360	But I did not come here to merely ask you for employment 
8498_287359_000061_000003	train-clean-360	I would like to hire out to you but the real object of my visit was to say this to you 
8498_287359_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The man approached still closer to Tom and in a lower voice and one that could scarcely be heard he fairly hissed 
none	none	Don t go with Barcoe Jenks to seek the diamond makers Then before Tom could put out a hand to detain him had the lad so wished the man turned suddenly and fairly ran from the shed CHAPTER VI mister DAMON IS ON HAND The young inventor stood almost spellbound for a few moments Then recovering himself he made a dash for the door through which the mysterious man had disappeared Tom saw him sprinting down the road and was half minded to take after him but a cooler thought warned him that he had better not He may be one of those men who are on mister Jenks trail reasoned Tom in which case it might not be altogether safe to attempt to stop him and make him explain Or he may be a lunatic and in that case it wouldn t be altogether healthy to interfere with him I ll just let him go and tell mister Jenks about him when he comes to night But I must warn Rad never to let him in here again He might damage the airship Calling to the colored man Tom pointed to the stranger who was almost out of sight down the road and said earnestly Rad do you see that fellow I sho do Massa Tom but I sorter has t strain my eyes t do it He s goin laik my mule Boomerang does when he s comm home t dinnah That s right Rad Well never let that man set foot inside our fence again If he comes and I m home call me If I m away call dad or mister Jackson and if you re here alone drive him away somehow I will Massa Tom exclaimed the colored man earnestly an if I can t do it alone I ll get Boomerang t help Once let dat ar mule git his heels on a pusson an dat pusson ain t goin t come bodderin around any mo that is not right away I believe you Rad Well keep a lookout for him and don t let him in and with that Tom entered the house to think over matters They were beginning to assume an aspect he did not altogether like Not that Tom was afraid of danger but he preferred to meet it in the open and the warning or threat of the mysterious man disquieted him When mister Swift came home a little later his son told him of the midnight interview with mister Jenks for up to this time the aged inventor was unaware of it and Tom also gave an account of the diamonds speaking of their value And do you propose to go to Phantom Mountain in search of the makers of these gems Tom asked mister Swift I had about decided to do so dad And you re going in the Red Cloud Yes Who are going with you Well mister Jenks will go of course and I ve no doubt but that if I mention the prospective trip to mister Damon that he ll bless his skating cap or something like that and come along I suppose so Tom and I d like to have you take him But I think you ll need some one else Because from what you have told me you are going out to a dangerous part of the country and you may have to deal with unscrupulous men Three of you are hardly enough to cope with them You ought to have at least another member of your party If I was not busy on my invention of a new wireless motor I would go along but I can t leave You might take mister Jackson No you need him here to help you dad How about Eradicate Tom smiled Rad would get homesick for his mule Boomerang and I d have to bring him back just when we d found the diamonds replied the young inventor No we ll have to think of some one else I ll ask mister Damon and then I ll consider matters further I expect to see mister Jenks to night and he may have some one in mind Perhaps that will be a good plan Well Tom I trust you will take good care of yourself and not run into unnecessary danger Is the Red Cloud in good shape for the voyage It needs looking over I m going to get right at it It s a pretty indefinite sort of a quest you re going on Tom my son How do you expect to find Phantom Mountain Well it s going to be quite a task In the first place we ll head for Leadville Colorado and then we ll go to Indian Ridge and make some inquiries We may get on the track of the place that way If we don t why I ll take the airship up as high as is necessary and sort of prospect until we see that big cliff that s shaped like a head That will give us something to go by Well do the best you can If you can discover the secret of making diamonds it will be a valuable one I guess it will dad and mister Jenks is entitled to know it for he paid his good money to that end He has promised to go halves with me as payment for the use of the airship and I must say the two diamonds he gave me last night have proved very valuable Two diamonds Tom You only showed me one an uncut gem and mister Swift looked at his son Oh the other er the other is I left it with a jeweler and Tom blushed a trifle as he thought of the present he contemplated making to Mary Nestor That afternoon as Tom was out in the shed of the Red Cloud looking over the airship to see what would be necessary to do to it in order to get it in shape for a long trip he heard voices outside Yes yes I know the way in perfectly well he caught You needn t bother to come my good fellow Just step this way and I ll show you something worth seeing I wonder if it s that mysterious man coming back thought Tom He dropped the tool he was using and hurried to the door As he approached it he heard the voice continue Why bless my shoe laces mister Parker You ll see a wonderful airship I promise you Wonderful Bless my hatband but I hope Tom is here mister Damon exclaimed our hero as he recognized the tones of his eccentric friend But who is with him A moment later he caught sight of the gentleman who was always blessing himself or something Behind him stood another man whose features Tom could not see plainly Hello Tom Swift called mister Damon Looking over the Red Cloud eh Does that mean you re off on another trip I guess it does answered the lad Where to this time if I may ask I m thinking of going off to the mountains to find a band of men engaged in making diamonds replied Tom Making diamonds Bless my finger ring Making diamonds A trip to the mountains Bless my disposition but do you know I d like to go with you I was thinking of asking you mister Damon Were you Bless my heart I m glad you thought of me You don t by any possible chance want another person do you We were thinking of having four in the party mister Damon and Tom wondered who was with his eccentric friend Then bless my election ticket This is the very chance for you mister Parker cried mister Damon Will you go with us It will be just what you need and mister Damon stepped aside revealing to Tom the features of mister Ralph Parker the scientist who had correctly predicted the destruction of Earthquake Island CHAPTER VII mister PARKER PREDICTS Tom Swift was a most generous lad but when he saw that mister Damon had with him mister Parker the gloomy scientist who seemed to take delight in predicting disasters our hero s spirits were not exactly of the best He would have much preferred not to take mister Parker on the quest for the diamond makers but since mister Damon had mentioned it he did not see how he could very well refuse But perhaps he won t care to go thought Tom He was undeceived a moment later however for the scientist remarked I am very glad to meet you once more mister Swift I have scarcely thanked you enough for what you did for us in erecting your wireless station on Earthquake Island which as you recall I predicted would sink into the sea It did I am glad to say not because I like to see islands destroyed but because science has been vindicated Now I have just heard you remark that you are about to set off to the mountains in search of some men who are making diamonds I need hardly state that this is utterly useless for no diamonds commercially valuable can be made by men But the trip may be valuable in that it will permit me to demonstrate some scientific facts Therefore if you will permit me I will be very glad to accompany you and mister Damon I shall be delighted in short and I can start as soon as you are ready There s no hope for it thought Tom dismally I suppose he ll wake up every morning and predict that before night the world will come to an end or he ll prophesy that the airship will blow up and vanish when about seven miles above the clouds Well there s no way out of it so here goes Thereupon Tom welcomed the scientist as cordially as he could and invited him to form one of the party that would set off in the airship to search for Phantom Mountain Bless my jewelry box exclaimed mister Damon when this formality was over Tell me more about it Tom Which our hero did stating the need of maintaining secrecy on account of the danger to mister Jenks mister Damon and mister Parker both agreed to say nothing about the matter and then the scientist became much interested in the Red Cloud which he closely examined He even complimented Tom on the skill shown in making it and contrary to our hero s expectation did not predict that it would blow up the next time it was used How did you happen to arrive just at this time mister Damon asked Tom It was partly due to mister Parker was the answer I had not seen him since we were rescued from the island until a few days ago he called on me at my home I happened to mention that you lived near here and suggested that he might like to see some of your inventions He agreed and we came over in my auto And now bless my liver pin I find you about to start off on another trip And have you fully decided to go with me asked Tom There may be danger and I don t like the way that mysterious man behaved Oh bless my revolver cried mister Damon I m used to danger by this time Of course I m going and so is mister Parker Do you know and the man who was always blessing something came closer to the lad and whispered Do you know Tom mister Parker is a very peculiar individual I m sure of it answered the young inventor looking at the gentleman in question who was then inside the airship cabin But he s all right even if he is predicting unpleasant things went on mister Damon I think we ll get better acquainted with him after a bit I hope so agreed Tom but he did not realize then how close his companionship with mister Parker was to be nor what dangers they were to share later The friends talked at considerable length of the prospective trip and Tom by this time had ascertained what needed to be done to the airship to get it in shape to travel It would take about a week and in the meanwhile mister Damon would go home and get his affairs in order for the voyage Tom s father was introduced to mister Parker and the former finding that the scientist held some views in common with him invited the gloomy predictor to remain at the Swift home until the Red Cloud was ready to sail Tom could not repress a groan at this but he decided he would have to make the best of it mister Damon left for home that afternoon promising to be on hand at the time set to start for Phantom Mountain Tom was up waiting for mister Jenks at twelve o clock that night Shortly after the hour he saw a dark figure steal into the orchard At first he feared lest it might be one of the spies who were he was now convinced on the trail of the man who was seeking to discover the secret of the diamond makers But a whistle which came to the lad s ear a moment later that being a signal mister Jenks had agreed to sound told Tom that it was none other than the visitor he expected All right mister Jenks I m here called Tom cautiously Come over this way and he went out from the shadow of the house where he had been waiting and met the men We ll go into my private work shop the youth added leading the way Have you decided to go with me asked mister Jenks in an anxious whisper Did you find the diamonds to be real ones I did and I m going spoke Tom Good That relieves my mind But we are still in danger I was followed by my shadower to day and only succeeded in shaking him off just before coming here I don t believe he knows what I am about to do Oh yes he does said Tom He does How Because he was here and warned me against you You don t mean it Well they are getting desperate We must be on our guard What sort of a man was he Tom described the fellow and mister Jenks stated that this tallied with the appearance of the person who had been shadowing him But we ll fool them yet cried Tom who had now fully entered into the spirit of the affair If they can follow us in the Red Cloud they re welcome to I think we ll get ahead of them He then told of mister Damon and mister Parker and mister Jenks agreed that it would add to the strength of the party to take these two gentlemen along Though I can t say I care so much for mister Parker he added But now as to ways and means When can we start Thereupon he and Tom talked over details in the seclusion of the little office and arranged to leave Shopton in about a week In the meanwhile the airship would be overhauled stocked with supplies and provisions and be made ready for a swift dash to the mountains And now I must be going said mister Jenks I have a great deal to do before I can start on this trip and I hope I am not prevented by any of those men who seem to be trailing me How could they prevent you Tom wanted to know Oh there are any number of ways was the answer But I m glad you found that my diamonds were real We ll soon have plenty if all goes well As mister Jenks left the shop he started back in some alarm What s the matter asked Tom Over there I thought I saw a figure sneaking along under the trees that man perhaps That s Eradicate our colored helper replied Tom with a laugh I posted him there to see that no strangers came into the orchard Everything all right Rad he asked raising his voice Yais sah Massa Tom Nobody been around yeah this night That s good You can go to bed now and Eradicate yawning loudly went to his shack A little later Tom sought his own room mister Jenks having hurried off to town where he was boarding The next few days saw Tom busily engaged on the airship making some changes and a few repairs that were needed His father Eradicate and mister Jackson helped him As for mister Parker the scientist he went about the place being much interested in the various machines which Tom or mister Swift had patented At other times the scientist would stroll about the extensive grounds making what he said were observations One afternoon Tom saw him apparently much excited kneeling down back of a shed with his ear to the ground What is the matter asked the lad thinking perhaps mister Parker might be ill Have you ever had any earthquakes here Tom Swift asked the scientist quietly Earthquakes No We had enough of them on the island And you are going to have one here in about two minutes cried mister Parker I predict that this place will be shaken by a tremendous shock very soon We had all better get away from the vicinity of buildings What makes you think there will be an earthquake asked Tom Because I can hear the rumbling beneath the ground at this very minute It is increasing in volume showing that the tremors are working this way There will soon be a great subterranean upheaval Listen for yourself Tom cast himself down on the grass Placing his ear close to the ground he did hear a series of dull thuds He arose not a little alarmed There had never been any earthquakes in Shopton yet he had great respect for mister Parker s scientific attainments Just then Eradicate Sampson came along He saw Tom and mister Parker lying flat on the ground and surprise showed on his honest black face Fo de land sakes cried Eradicate What am de mattah now Massa Tom Earthquake coming answered Tom briefly Better get away from the buildings Rad They might fall Tom s face showed the alarm he felt What would happen to all of his valuable machines to the Red Cloud Earthquake murmured Eradicate and he too cast himself down to listen A moment later he arose with a laugh What s the matter cried Tom Why dat ain t no earthquake declared the colored man No Then perhaps you know what it is said mister Parker somewhat sharply Course I knows what it am answered Eradicate with dignity Dat noise am my mule Boomerang kickin in his stable on account oh me not feedin him yet Dat s what it am I se gwine right now t gib him his oats and den yo see dat de noise stop Boomerang allers kick dat way when he s hungry I show yo And sure enough when Eradicate had gone to the mule s stable which was near where mister Parker had heard the mysterious sounds they immediately ceased Dat mule was all de earthquake dere was around here said the colored man as he came out mister Parker walked away saying nothing and Tom did not make any comments just then CHAPTER VIII OFF FOR THE WEST It was a great relief to Tom to find that there was no danger from an earth tremor Now that he had made up his mind to go in search of the diamond makers he wanted nothing to interfere with it Lest the feelings of mister Parker might be hurt by the mistake he had made the young inventor cautioned Eradicate not to say anything more about the matter Deed an I won t the colored man promised I se only too glad dere wa n t no earthquake dat s what I is As for mister Parker he did not appear much put out by his error in predicting I am sure that what I heard was a tremor due to some distant earthquake shock he said The mule s kicking was only a coincidence And Tom let him have his way about it The week was drawing to a close and the Red Cloud was nearly in shape for the voyage At almost the last minute Tom found that he needed some electrical apparatus for the airship and as he had to go to Chester for it he decided he would make the trip in his monoplane and while in the city would also get the diamond pin he was having made for Mary Nestor He started off early one morning in the swift little craft Butterfly and soon had reached Chester The diamond brooch was ready for him It is one of the most beautiful stones we have ever set the diamond merchant told him Don t forget if you find any more mister Swift to let us have a chance to bid on them I may Tom promised rather indefinitely Then having purchased his electrical supplies he made a quick trip to Shopton stopping on the way to call on Miss Nestor Why Tom I m delighted to see you cried the girl blushing prettily Did you come for some apple turnovers and she laughed as she referred to a call Tom had once paid when a new cook had been engaged and when the pastry formed a feature of the meal No turnovers this time said the young inventor I came to wish you many happy returns of the day Oh you remembered my birthday How nice of you And here is something else added our hero rather awkwardly as he handed her the diamond pin Oh Tom This for me Oh it s too lovely it s far too much It isn t half enough he declared warmly Oh what a large diamond Mary cried as she saw the sparkling stone I never saw one so large and beautiful It s just as easy to make them large as small explained Tom Make them she looked the surprise she felt Yes I m about to start for the place where diamonds are made Oh Tom But isn t it dangerous I mean won t you have to go to some far country like Africa to get to where diamonds are made Well we are going on quite a trip but not as far as that And as for the danger well we ll have to take what comes and he told her something of the proposed quest Oh it sounds sounds scary Mary exclaimed when she had heard of mister Jenks experience Do be careful Tom I will he promised and somehow he was glad that she had cautioned him thus and in such tones as she had used For Mary Nestor was a girl that any young chap would have been glad to have manifest an interest in him Well I guess I ll have to say good by spoke Tom at length We expect to start in a couple of days and I may not get another chance to see you Oh I I hope you come back safely faltered Mary and then she held out her hand and Tom well it s none of our affair what Tom did after that except to say that he hurried out fairly jumped into his monoplane and completed the trip home As the Red Cloud has been fully described in the volume entitled Tom Swift and His Airship we will not go into details about it now Sufficient to say that it was a combination of a biplane and dirigible balloon It could be used either as one or the other and the gas bag feature was of value when the wind was too great to allow the use of the planes or when the motive power for some reason stopped In that event the airship could remain suspended far above the clouds if necessary There was provision for manufacturing the gas on board The Red Cloud was fitted up to accommodate about ten persons though it was seldom that this number was carried Two persons could successfully operate the machinery There were sleeping berths and in the main cabin a sitting room a dining room and a kitchen There was also the motor compartment and a steering tower from which the engines could be controlled It was in this craft that the seekers after the diamond makers proposed undertaking the trip mister Damon came on from his home in Waterfield about two days before the date set to leave and mister Jenks had three days before this taken up his abode at the Swift home mister Parker as has been stated was already there and he had put in his time making a number of scientific observations though he had made no more predictions Nothing more had been seen of the mysterious man who had warned Tom and the young inventor and mister Jenks began to hope that they had thrown their enemies off the track Though I don t imagine they ll give up altogether said mister Jenks They re too desperate for that We ll have trouble with them yet Well it can t be helped decided Tom We ll try and be ready for it when it comes and then dismissing the matter from his mind he busied himself about the airship The food and supplies had all been put aboard and they expected to start the next morning In order to make sure that any stones which they might succeed in getting from the diamond makers were real gems a set of testing apparatus was taken along mister Parker had had some experience in this line and in spite of the fact that he might make direful predictions Tom was rather glad after all that the scientist was going to accompany them But what is worrying me said mister Damon is what we are going to do after we get to Phantom Mountain What are your plans mister Jenks Will you go in and demand your share of the diamond making business I have a right to it as I invested a large sum in it and I am entitled to more than a half share But of course I can t say what I ll do until I get there We may have to act very secretly I m inclined to think we will said Tom My plan would be to gain access to the cave if possible and watch them at work We might be able to discover the secret of making diamonds and after all that s what you want isn t it mister Jenks Yes I paid my money for the secret and I ought to have it If I can get it quietly so much the better If not I ll fight for my rights and he looked very determined Bless my powder horn cried mister Damon That s the way to talk And so we re to go cruising about in the air looking for a mountain shaped like a man s head That s it agreed mister Jenks and when we find it we will be near Phantom Mountain and the diamond makers The final details were completed that night The last of the supplies had been put aboard the larder was well stocked the diamond testing apparatus was stored safely away and all that remained was for the adventurers to board the Red Cloud in the morning and soar away That night Tom was uneasy Several times he got up and looked toward the shed where the airship was stored He could not rid himself of the idea that the men to whose interest it was that the diamond making secret remain undiscovered might attempt to wreck the airship before the start Consequently both Eradicate Sampson and Engineer Jackson were on guard Tom looked from his window to the shed where the Red Cloud was housed He saw nothing to cause him any uneasiness I guess I m just nervous he mused But all the same I ll be glad when we ve started They were all up early the next morning mister Damon beginning the day by blessing the sunrise and many other things that struck his fancy The airship was wheeled out of the shed and Tom gave her a final inspection It s all right he declared All aboard Now do be careful begged mister Swift Don t take too many chances Tom I ll not The adventurers were in the forward part of the ship and Tom had taken his place at the wheels and levers in the pilot house As he was about to start the motor he looked toward the road and saw a horse and carriage In the vehicle was a girlish figure at the sight of which Tom blushed and smiled He waved his hand I came to wish you good luck cried Mary Nestor for it was she in the carriage Thanks cried Tom leaning from the window of the pilot house It was good of you to get up so early Oh I m always up early she informed him Look out that the motor doesn t scare your horse Tom warned her Old Dobbin doesn t mind anything was her answer I ll see that he doesn t run away with me as long as you re not on earth to rescue me Good by Tom Good by he called and then he pulled the lever that set in motion the motor and whirled the great propellers about They whizzed around with a roar and the Red Cloud shivering and trembling with the vibration rose in the air like some great bird We re off for the West and Phantom Mountain called Tom to his companions As the airship soared upward Eradicate Sampson ran forward from where he had been standing near his mule Boomerang He waved his hands and shouted something Bless my hatband What does he want asked mister Damon watching him curiously It sounds as if he were calling to us to come back spoke mister Parker It s too late now decided Tom Maybe he forgot to tell us good by but he felt a vague wonder at Eradicate s odd motions for the colored man was pointing toward the stern of the airship as if there was something wrong there But the Red Cloud soared on

8580_287363_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Rapidly the airship ascended and when it was high over the town of Shopton Tom headed the craft due west 
8580_287363_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Looking down he tried to descry Mary Nestor in her carriage but the trees were in the way their interlocking branches hiding the girl 
8580_287363_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Tom did see crowds of other persons though thronging the streets of Shopton for though the young inventor had made many flights there was always a novelty about them that brought out the curious 
8580_287363_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 A good start Tom Swift complimented mister Parker 
8580_287363_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 Is it always as easy as this 
8580_287363_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Starting always is was the answer though as the Irishman said coming down isn t sometimes quite so comfortable 
8580_287363_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Bless my gizzard 
8580_287363_000007_000001	train-clean-100	That s so cried the eccentric mister Damon 
8580_287363_000007_000002	train-clean-100	 Can we vol plane to earth in the Red Cloud Tom 
8580_287363_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes but not as easily as in the Butterfly 
8580_287363_000008_000001	train-clean-100	However I hope we will not have to 
8580_287363_000008_000002	train-clean-100	Now mister Damon if you will just take charge of the steering apparatus for a minute I want to go aft 
none	none	What for I wish to see if everything is all right I can t imagine why Eradicate was making those queer motions 
8580_287363_000011_000000	train-clean-100	mister Damon who knew how to operate the Red Cloud was soon guiding her on the course while Tom made his way to the rear compartments through the motor room where the stores of supplies and food were kept 
8580_287363_000011_000001	train-clean-100	He made a careful examination looking from an after window and even going out on a small open platform but could discover nothing wrong 
8580_287363_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I guess Rad was just capering about without any special object mused Tom but it was not long after this that they learned to their dismay that the colored man had had a method in his madness 
8580_287363_000013_000000	train-clean-100	On his way back through the motor room Tom looked to the machinery and adjusted some of the auxiliary oil feeders 
8580_287363_000013_000001	train-clean-100	The various pieces of apparatus were working well though the engine had not yet been speeded up to its limit 
8580_287363_000013_000002	train-clean-100	Tom wanted it to warm up first 
8580_287363_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Everything all right asked mister Damon as Tom rejoined them in the pilot house which was just forward of the living room in the main cabin 
none	none	Yes I can t imagine what made Rad act that way 
8580_287363_000015_000001	train-clean-100	But I ll set the automatic steering gear now mister Damon and then you will be relieved 
8580_287363_000016_000000	train-clean-100	mister Jenks was gazing off toward the west to where he hoped to discover the secret of Phantom Mountain 
8580_287363_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 How do you like it asked Tom 
8580_287363_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 It s great replied the diamond man 
8580_287363_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 I ve never been in an airship before and it s different than what I expected but it s great 
none	none	It s the only craft that will serve our purpose among the towering mountain peaks where the diamond makers are hidden 
8580_287363_000018_000003	train-clean-100	I hope we can find them 
none	none	In a little while the Red Cloud was skimming along at faster speed guided by the automatic rudders so that no one was needed in the pilot house since there was no danger of collisions 
8580_287363_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Airships are not quite numerous enough for that yet though they may soon become so 
8580_287363_000020_000000	train-clean-100	Tom and the others devoted several hours to arranging their staterooms and bunks and getting their clothing stowed away and when this was done mister Parker and mister Jenks sat gazing off into space 
8580_287363_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 It s hard to realize that we are really in an airship observed the diamond man 
8580_287363_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 At first I thought I would be frightened but I m not a bit 
8580_287363_000021_000002	train-clean-100	It doesn t seem as if anything could happen 
8580_287363_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Something is likely to happen soon said mister Parker suddenly as he gazed at some weather instruments on the cabin wall 
none	none	Bless my soul 
8580_287363_000023_000001	train-clean-100	Don t say that cried mister Damon 
8580_287363_000023_000002	train-clean-100	 What is it 
8580_287363_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 I think from my observations that we will soon have a hurricane said the scientific man 
8580_287363_000024_000001	train-clean-100	 There is every indication of it and he seemed quite delighted at the prospect of his prediction coming true 
8580_287363_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 A hurricane cried mister Damon 
none	none	I hope it isn t like the one that blew us to Earthquake Island
8580_287363_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I think there will be no danger spoke Tom 
8580_287363_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 If it comes on to blow we will ascend or descend out of the path of the storm 
8580_287363_000026_000002	train-clean-100	This craft is not like the ill fated Whizzer 
none	none	I can more easily handle the Red Cloud even in a bad storm
8580_287363_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 I m glad to hear that remarked mister Jenks 
8580_287363_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 It would be too bad to be wrecked before we got to Phantom Mountain 
8580_287363_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Well I predict that we will have a bad storm insisted mister Parker and Tom could not help wishing that the scientist would keep his gloomy forebodings to himself 
8580_287363_000029_000000	train-clean-100	However the storm had not developed up to noon when Tom with mister Damon s help served a fine meal in the dining room 
8580_287363_000029_000001	train-clean-100	In the afternoon the speed of the ship was increased and by night they had covered several hundred miles 
8580_287363_000029_000002	train-clean-100	Through the darkness the Red Cloud kept on making good time 
8580_287363_000029_000003	train-clean-100	Tom got up occasionally to look to the machinery but it was all automatically controlled and an alarm bell would sound in his stateroom when anything went wrong 
8580_287363_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Bless my napkin exclaimed mister Damon the next morning as they sat down to a breakfast of fruit ham and eggs and fragrant coffee this is living as well as in a hotel and yet we are how far are we above the earth Tom he asked turning to the young inventor 
8580_287364_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 About two miles 
8580_287363_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 About two miles now 
8580_287363_000031_000001	train-clean-100	I just sent her up as I thought I detected that storm mister Parker spoke of 
8580_287363_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 I told you it would come declared the scientist and there was a small hurricane below them that morning but only the lower edge of it caught the Red Cloud and when Tom sent her up still higher she found a comparatively quiet zone where she slid along at good speed 
8580_287363_000033_000000	train-clean-100	That afternoon Tom busied himself about some wires and a number of complicated pieces of apparatus which were in one corner of the main cabin 
8580_287363_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 What are you doing now asked mister Jenks who had been talking with mister Parker and showing that scientist some of the manufactured diamonds 
8580_287363_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Getting our wireless apparatus in shape answered the lad 
8580_287363_000035_000001	train-clean-100	 I should have done it before but I had so much to do that I couldn t get at it I m going to send off some messages 
none	none	Dad will want to know how we are doing 
8580_287363_000036_000000	train-clean-100	As he worked away he also made up his mind to send another message in care of his father for there was a receiving station in the Swift home And to whom this message was addressed Tom did not say but we fancy some of our readers can guess 
8580_287363_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Finally after several hours of work the wireless was in shape to send and receive messages 
8580_287363_000037_000001	train-clean-100	Tom pulled over the lever and a crackling sound was heard as the electricity leaped from the transmitters into space Then he clamped the receiver on his ear 
none	none	All ready he announced
8580_287363_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 Has anybody any messages they wish sent For with the courtesy of a true host he was ready to serve his guests before he forwarded his own wireless notes 
none	none	Just tell my wife that I m enjoying myself requested mister Damon Bless my footstool 
8580_287363_000039_000001	train-clean-100	But this is great 
none	none	We re off the earth yet connected with it 
8580_287363_000040_000000	train-clean-100	mister Jenks had no one to whom he wanted to send any word but mister Parker wish to wire to a fellow scientist the result of some observations made in the upper air 
8580_287363_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Tom noted all the messages down and then when all was in readiness he began to call his home station 
8580_287363_000041_000001	train-clean-100	He knew that either his father or mister Jackson the engineer could receive the wireless 
none	none	But no sooner had the young inventor sent off the first few dots and dashes representing S 
8580_287363_000042_000001	train-clean-100	I his home station call than he started and a look of surprise came over his face 
8580_287363_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 They re calling us he exclaimed 
8580_287363_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Who is asked mister Jenks 
none	none	My house my father 
8580_287363_000045_000001	train-clean-100	He he s been trying to get us ever since we started but I didn t have the wireless in shape to receive messages Oh I hope it s not too late 
none	none	Too late 
8580_287363_000046_000001	train-clean-100	Bless my soul too late for what gasped mister Damon somewhat alarmed by Tom s manner 
8580_287363_000047_000000	train-clean-100	The lad did not answer at once 
none	none	He was intently listening to a series of dots and dashes that clicked in the telephone receiver clamped to his left ear 
8580_287363_000047_000002	train-clean-100	On his face there was a look of worriment 
8580_287363_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 Father has just sent me a message he said 
none	none	It s a warning flashed through space He s been trying to get it to me since yesterday
8580_287363_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 What is it asked mister Jenks rising from his seat 
8580_287363_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 The mysterious man is aboard the airship hidden away cried Tom That s what Eradicate was trying to call to our attention as we started off 
8580_287363_000050_000001	train-clean-100	Eradicate saw his face at a rear window and tried to warn us 
none	none	The mysterious man is a stowaway on board 
8580_287364_000001_000000	train-clean-100	CHAPTER X DROPPING THE STOWAWAY
8580_287364_000002_000000	train-clean-100	Tom s excited announcement startled mister Damon and the others as much as if the young inventor had informed them that the airship had exploded and was about to dash with them to the earth 
8580_287364_000002_000001	train-clean-100	The men leaped to their feet and stared at the lad 
none	none	A stowaway on board cried mister Damon Bless my soul How did he
8580_287364_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Are you sure that message is straight asked mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000004_000001	train-clean-100	 Did Eradicate see the man 
none	none	He says he did answered Tom
8580_287364_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 The man is hidden away on board now probably among the stores and supplies 
8580_287364_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Bless my tomato sauce exploded mister Damon 
none	none	I hope he doesn t eat them all up
8580_287364_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 We must get him out at once declared mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 I knew something would happen on this voyage came from mister Parker 
8580_287364_000008_000001	train-clean-100	 I predicted it from the first 
8580_287364_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Tom thought considerable but he did not answer the scientist just then 
8580_287364_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Another communication was coming to him by wireless 
8580_287364_000009_000002	train-clean-100	He listened intently 
8580_287364_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Father says the lad told his companions that Eradicate only had a glimpse of the man at the last moment 
none	none	He was looking from the rear storeroom window he s the same man who called on me that time Rad remembers him very well Bless my shoes 
8580_287364_000011_000001	train-clean-100	What s to be done inquired mister Damon looking around helplessly 
8580_287364_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 We must get him out that s all decided mister Jenks with vigor 
8580_287364_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 Get him out and drop him overboard 
8580_287364_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Drop him overboard cried mister Parker in horror 
none	none	Not exactly but get rid of him proceeded the diamond seeker
8580_287364_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 That man is one of my enemies 
8580_287364_000014_000002	train-clean-100	He has been sent by the band of diamond makers hidden among the mountains to spy on me and if possible prevent me from seeking to discover their secret 
none	none	He tried to work on Tom s Swift s fears and frighten him from using his airship on this quest 
8580_287364_000014_000004	train-clean-100	Then when he failed the man must have sneaked into the shed and hidden himself in the ship 
8580_287364_000014_000005	train-clean-100	We must get rid of him or he may wreck the Red Cloud 
8580_287364_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 That s so cried Tom 
8580_287364_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 We must try to capture him 
8580_287364_000015_000002	train-clean-100	I think we had better the lad paused and again listened to the wireless message Father says Eradicate saw the man have a gun so we must be careful the young inventor translated the dots and dashes 
8580_287364_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Bless my powder horn exploded mister Damon 
8580_287364_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 We shall have to proceed cautiously then spoke mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 If he is like any others in the gang he is a desperate man 
8580_287364_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Better sneak up on him then if we can proposed mister Parker 
8580_287364_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 There are enough of us to cope with one man even if he is armed 
none	none	You have weapons aboard haven t you he inquired of Tom
8580_287364_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes was the hesitating answer but I don t want to use them if I can help it 
8580_287364_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Not only because of the danger and a dislike of shedding blood but because a stray bullet might pierce the gas bag and damage the ship 
8580_287364_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 That s so agreed mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 Well I guess if we go at it the right way we can capture him without any shooting 
8580_287364_000020_000002	train-clean-100	But we must talk more quietly we ought to have whispered he may have heard us 
8580_287364_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t think so replied Tom 
8580_287364_000021_000001	train-clean-100	 The storeroom is far enough off so that he couldn t hear us 
none	none	Besides the motor makes such a racket that he couldn t distinguish what we were talking about even if he heard our voices 
8580_287364_000021_000003	train-clean-100	So unless he heard the wireless working and suspects something from that he probably doesn t know that we are aware of his presence aboard 
8580_287364_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 But why do you think he has remained quiet all this while Tom asked mister Damon 
none	none	Probably he wants to wait until the ship is farther out west suggested mister Jenks Then he will be nearer his friends and can get help if he needs it
8580_287364_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 And do you really believe he would destroy the Red Cloud asked mister Parker 
8580_287364_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 I think that all he is waiting for is a favorable chance declared the diamond seeker 
8580_287364_000025_000001	train-clean-100	 He would destroy the craft and us too if he could prevent us from discovering the secret of Phantom Mountain I believe 
8580_287364_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Then we must get ahead of him decided Tom quietly 
8580_287364_000026_000001	train-clean-100	 I have just flashed to dad a message telling him that we will heed his warning 
8580_287364_000026_000002	train-clean-100	Now to capture the stowaway 
8580_287364_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 And while we re about it give him a good scare when we do get him suggested mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 How asked Tom 
8580_287364_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Threaten to drop him overboard 
8580_287364_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps that will make him tell how he happened to get in our ship and what are the plans of the gang of diamond makers 
8580_287364_000029_000002	train-clean-100	We may get valuable information that way 
8580_287364_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t believe you can scare such fellows much was Tom s opinion but it was agreed to try 
8580_287364_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 How are you going to capture him asked mister Parker 
8580_287364_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 If he has a gun it won t be any too easy to go in the storeroom and drag him out 
8580_287364_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 We ll have to use a little strategy decided Tom and then they discussed several plans 
none	none	The one finally adopted was that Tom and mister Damon should enter the storeroom casually as if in search of food to cook for supper 
8580_287364_000032_000002	train-clean-100	They would discuss various dishes and mister Damon was to express a preference for something in the food line the box containing which was well back in the room 
8580_287364_000032_000003	train-clean-100	This would give the two a chance to penetrate to the far end of the apartment without arousing the suspicions of the hidden man who doubtless would be listening to the conversation 
none	none	And as soon as we get sight of him you and I will jump right at him mister Damon said Tom
8580_287364_000033_000001	train-clean-100	 Jump before he has a chance to use his gun 
none	none	mister Jenks and mister Parker will be waiting outside the room to catch him if he gets away from us 
8580_287364_000033_000003	train-clean-100	I ll have some ropes ready and we ll tie him up and well we ll decide later what to do with him 
none	none	All right 
8580_287364_000034_000001	train-clean-100	I m ready as soon as you are Tom said the eccentric man Come ahead 
8580_287364_000035_000000	train-clean-100	They went softly to the storeroom and listened at the door 
none	none	There was no sound heard save that made by the machinery
8580_287364_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 I wonder if he s really here whispered mister Damon 
8580_287364_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 We ll soon find out answered Tom 
8580_287364_000037_000001	train-clean-100	 Let s go in 
none	none	They entered and in pursuance of their plan Tom and his friend talked of various foods I think I d like some of that canned lobster with French dressing on spoke the eccentric man That s away in the back end of the room said Tom in a loud voice It s under a lot of boxes
8580_287364_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Then I ll help you get it out 
none	none	Bless my frying pan but I am very fond of lobster exclaimed mister Damon in as natural tones as was possible under the circumstances 
8580_287364_000042_000000	train-clean-100	He and Tom moved cautiously back among the boxes and barrels 
8580_287364_000042_000001	train-clean-100	They were glancing about with eager eyes 
none	none	Tom switched on an electric light and the instant he did so he was aware of a movement in a little space formed by one box which was placed on top of two others 
8580_287364_000042_000003	train-clean-100	The lad saw a dark figure moving as if to get farther out of sight 
8580_287364_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve got him cried Tom making a dive for the shadow 
none	none	A moment later the young inventor was bowled over as a dark figure leaped over his head
8580_287364_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Catch him mister Damon he cried 
none	none	Bless my hatband I I mister Damon s voice ended in a grunt 
8580_287364_000046_000002	train-clean-100	He too had been knocked down by the fleeing man 
8580_287364_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Look out mister Jenks cried Tom to warn those on guard at the door of the storeroom 
8580_287364_000048_000000	train-clean-100	There was the report of a gun some excited shouts and when Tom could scramble to his feet and rush out he beheld mister Parker calmly sitting on a struggling man while mister Jenks held a gun that was still smoking 
8580_287364_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 We caught him cried the scientist 
8580_287364_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Anybody hurt asked Tom anxiously 
8580_287364_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 No I knocked up his gun as he fired explained mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000051_000001	train-clean-100	 Where are the ropes Tom 
8580_287364_000052_000000	train-clean-100	The cords were produced and the man who had now ceased to struggle was tightly bound 
8580_287364_000052_000001	train-clean-100	He uttered not a word but he smiled grimly when mister Damon remarked 
8580_287364_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 I guess I ll go back in the storeroom Tom and see how much food he ate 
8580_287364_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I guess he didn t take much declared the lad 
8580_287364_000054_000001	train-clean-100	 He wasn t there long enough 
8580_287364_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 Well Farley Munson so it s you is it asked mister Jenks as he surveyed the prisoner 
8580_287364_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you know him asked Tom in some surprise 
8580_287364_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 He was in with the diamond makers said mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 He was one of those who took me to the secret cave 
8580_287364_000057_000002	train-clean-100	But it will be the last time he ever goes there 
8580_287364_000057_000003	train-clean-100	How high up are we Tom 
none	none	About two miles Why
8580_287364_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 I guess that will be far enough to let him fall went on the diamond seeker 
8580_287364_000059_000001	train-clean-100	 Come on mister Damon help me throw him overboard 
8580_287364_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 You you re not going to throw me over with the airship two miles high are you gasped the man 
8580_287364_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 Will you tell us what we want to know if we don t asked mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000062_000000	train-clean-100	 What do you want to know 
8580_287364_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 How you got aboard and what your object was in coming 
8580_287364_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 That s easy enough 
none	none	I had been hanging around the shed for several days watching a chance to get in 
8580_287364_000064_000002	train-clean-100	Finally I saw it when that colored man went to feed his mule and I slipped in and hid in the airship 
none	none	The stores were all in then and I stowed myself away among the boxes 
8580_287364_000064_000004	train-clean-100	I had food and water so I didn t touch any of yours and he looked at mister Damon who seemed much relieved 
8580_287364_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 And what was your object demanded mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 I wanted to prevent you from going to Phantom Mountain 
none	none	How
8580_287364_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 By destroying the airship if need be 
8580_287364_000068_000001	train-clean-100	But I hoped to accomplish it by other means 
none	none	I would have stopped at nothing though to prevent you You must keep away from there
8580_287364_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 And if we refuse asked Tom 
8580_287364_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Then you ll have to take what comes 
8580_287364_000071_000000	train-clean-100	 But not from you exclaimed mister Jenks 
8580_287364_000071_000001	train-clean-100	 We re going to get rid of you 
none	none	The man s face showed the alarm he felt
8580_287364_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh don t worry said mister Jenks quickly we re not going to toss you overboard 
8580_287364_000073_000001	train-clean-100	We re not as desperate as your crowd 
8580_287364_000073_000002	train-clean-100	But we re going to get rid of you and then go on before you can send any word to your confederates 
8580_287364_000073_000003	train-clean-100	We ll put you off in the most lonesome spot we can find and I guess you ll be some time getting back to civilization 
8580_287364_000073_000004	train-clean-100	By that time we ll have the secret of the diamonds 
none	none	You never will declared the man firmly 
8580_287364_000074_000001	train-clean-100	And he would say nothing more though by threats and promises mister Jenks tried to get from him something about the men in with him and where the cave of the diamonds was located 
8580_287364_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Heavily bound with ropes the man was locked in a small closet to be kept there until a favorable spot was reached for letting him go 
8580_287364_000075_000001	train-clean-100	mister Jenks plan of dropping him down in some place where he would have difficulty in sending on word to his confederates was considered a good one 
8580_287364_000076_000000	train-clean-100	Three days later in crossing over a lonely region near the Nebraska National Forest Farley Munson which was one of the names the spy went by was dropped off the airship when it was sent down to within a few feet of the earth 
8580_287364_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 It will take you some time to get to a telegraph office said mister Jenks as a package of food and a flask of water was tossed down to the stowaway 
8580_287364_000077_000001	train-clean-100	He shook his fist at those in the airship and shouted after them 
none	none	You ll never discover the secret of Phantom Mountain Yes we will declared Tom as he sent the Red Cloud high into the air again CHAPTER XI A WEARY SEARCH During the three days when the stowaway had been kept a prisoner the Red Cloud had made good time on her western trip She was now about two hundred and fifty miles from Leadville Colorado and Tom knew he could accomplish that distance in a short time It was necessary therefore since they were so close to the place where the real search would begin to make some more definite plans We will need to replenish our supply of gasoline said Tom shortly after the stowaway had been dropped and when the young inventor had made a general inspection of the airship Is it all gone inquired mister Damon Not all but we will soon be in the wildest part of the Rocky Mountains and gasoline is difficult to procure there So I want to fill all our reserve tanks But I would rather do that before we get far into Colorado Why inquired mister Parker Because airships are not so common but what the appearance of one attracts attention Ours is sure to be talked about and commented on In that case in spite of our precaution in putting Munson off in this lonely place word of the Red Cloud being in the vicinity of Leadville may reach the diamond makers and put them on their guard We want to take them unawares if we can That s so agreed mister Jenks We had better get our gasoline at the first stopping place then and proceed with our search Our first object ought to be to look for the landmark the head of stone Then we can begin to prospect about a bit My idea exactly declared Tom Well then I ll go down at the first place we cross where we can get gasoline and then we ll be in a position to hover in the air for a long time without descending The airship kept on her way traveling slowly the remainder of that day and at dusk when there was less chance of big crowds seeing them the Red Cloud was sent down on the outskirts of a large village Tom and mister Damon went to a supply store and arranged to have a sufficient quantity of the gasoline taken out to the airship It was delivered after dark and little talk was occasioned by the few who were aware of the presence of the craft Then once more they went aloft and Tom sent several wireless messages to Shopton including one to Miss Nestor Please tell my wife that I am well and that I have a good appetite said mister Damon mister Parker also sent a message to a scientific friend of his stating that he made some observations among the mountains of the region in which the airship then was and that the indications were that a great landslide would soon take place That won t worry us spoke Tom for we ll be far above it I hope we will be near enough to enable me to observe it and make some scientific notes came from mister Parker I am positive that one of these mountain peaks that we saw to day will disappear in a landslide within a few days I have an instrument somewhat like the one that records earthquakes and it has been acting strangely of late Tom wondered what enjoyment mister Parker got out of life when he was always looking for some calamity to happen but the scientist seemed to take as much pleasure in his gloomy forebodings now as he had on Earthquake Island They reached the vicinity of Leadville the next day but took care to keep high above the city so that the airship could not be observed With powerful glasses they examined the mountainous country looking for the little settlement of Indian Ridge There it is exclaimed mister Jenks just as dusk was settling down I can make out the hotel I stopped at Now we can really begin our search The next thing is to find the stone head and then I think I will have my bearings We ll begin the hunt for that landmark in the morning said Tom High in the air hovered the Red Cloud At that distance above the earth she must have looked like some great bird and the adventurers thought it unlikely that any one in the vicinity of Leadville would observe them The quest for the great mountain peak that looked like a stone head was under way Back and forth sailed the airship Sometimes she was enveloped in fog and no sight could be had of the earth below At other times there were rain storms which likewise prevented a view mister Parker was on the lookout for his predicted mountain landslide but it did not occur and he was much disappointed It s queer I can t pick out that landmark said mister Jenks after two days of weary searching when their eyes were strained from long peering through telescopes I m sure it was around Indian Ridge yet we ve covered almost all the ground in this neighborhood and I haven t had a glimpse of it Perhaps it was destroyed in a landslide or some cataclysm of nature suggested mister Parker That is very possible If that s the case we re going to have a hard time to locate the cave of the diamond makers answered mister Jenks but I hope it isn t so They continued the search for another day and then Tom as they sat in the comfortable cabin of the airship that night hovering almost motionless for the motor had been shut down made a proposition Why not descend in some secluded place he suggested and wander around on foot making inquiries of the miners They may know where the stone head is or they may even know about Phantom Mountain Good idea spoke mister Jenks We ll do it Accordingly the next morning the Red Cloud was lowered in a good but lonely landing place and securely moored It was in a valley well screened from observation and the craft was not likely to be seen but to guard against any damage being done to it by passing hunters or miners mister Parker and mister Damon agreed to remain on guard in it while Tom and mister Jenks spent a day or two traveling around making inquiries The young inventor and his companion proceeded on foot to a small settlement where they hired horses on which to make their way about They were to be gone two days and in that time they hoped to get on the right trail CHAPTER XII THE GREAT STONE HEAD It was a wild and desolate country in which Tom Swift and mister Jenks were traveling Villages were far apart and they were at best but small settlements In their journeys from place to place they met few travelers But of these few they made cautious inquiries as to the location of Phantom Mountain or the landmark known as the great stone head Prospectors miners and hunters whom they asked shook their heads I ve heard of Phantom Mountain said one grizzled miner but I couldn t say where it is Maybe it s only a fish story the place may not even exist Oh it does for I ve been there exclaimed mister Jenks Then why don t you go back to it asked the miner Because I can t locate it again was the reply Humph Mighty queer if you ve seen a place once and can t get to it again and the man looked as if he thought there was something strange about Tom and his companion mister Jenks did not want to say that he had been taken to the mountain blindfolded for that would have caused too much talk I think if we spent to night in a place where the miners congregate listened to their talk and put a few casual questions to them more as if we were only asking out of idle curiosity we might learn something suggested Tom Very well we ll try that scheme Accordingly after they had left the suspicious miner the two proceeded to a small milling town not far from Indian Ridge There they engaged rooms for the night at the only hotel and after supper they sat around the combined dance hall and gambling place There were wild rough scenes which were distasteful to Tom and to mister Jenks but they felt that this was their only chance to get on the right trail and so they stayed As strangers in a western mining settlement they were made roughly welcome and in response to their inquiries about the country they were told many tales some of which were evidently gotten up for the benefit of the tenderfeet Is there a place around here called Phantom Mountain asked Tom at length as quietly as he could Never heard of it stranger replied a miner who had done most of the talking I never heard of it and what Bill Slatterly don t know ain t worth knowin I m Bill Slatterly he added lest there be some doubt on that score Isn t there some sort of a landmark around here shaped like a great stone head went on Tom after some unimportant questions Seems to me I ve heard of that Nary a one answered mister Slatterly No stone heads and no Phantom Mountains nary a one Who says there ain t no Phantom Mountains demanded an elderly miner who had been dozing in one corner of the room but who was awakened by Slatterly s loud voice Who says so I do answered the one who claimed to know everything Then you re wrong Tom s heart commenced beating faster than usual Do you mean to say you ve seen Phantom Mountain Jed Nugg demanded Slatterly No I ain t exactly seen it an I don t want to but there is such a place about sixty mile from here Folks says it s haunted and them sort of places I steer clear from Can you tell me about it asked mister Jenks eagerly I am interested in such things I can t tell you much about it was the reply and I wouldn t git too interested if I was you It might not be healthy All I know is that one time my partner and I were in hard luck We got grub staked and went out prospectin We strayed into a wild part of the country about sixty mile from here and one night we camped on a mountain a wild desolate place it was too The miner stopped and began leisurely filling his pipe Well asked Tom trying not to let his voice sound too eager Well that was Phantom Mountain The miner seemed to have finished his story Is that all asked mister Jenks How did you know it was Phantom Mountain Cause we seen the ghost my partner and I that s why exclaimed the man puffing on his pipe As I said we was campin there and long about midnight we seen somethin tall and white and all shimmerin with a sort of yellow fire slidin down the side of the mountain It made straight for our camp Huh Guess you run didn t you Jed asked Bill Slatterly Course we did You d a run too if you seen a ghost comm at you an firin a gun Ghosts can t fire guns declared Bill I guess you dreamed it Jed Ghosts can t fire guns eh That s all you know about it This one did and to prove I didn t dream it there was a bullet hole in my hat next mornin I could prove it too only I ain t got that hat any more But that was Phantom Mountain strangers an my advice to you is to keep away from it I was on it but I didn t exactly see it cause it was dark at the time Was it near a peak that looked like a stone head asked Tom It were stranger but I didn t take much notice of it Me and my partner got out of them diggin s next day and I never went back I ain t never said much about this place but it s called Phantom Mountain all right and I ain t the only one that s seen a ghost there Other grub stakers has had the same experience Why ain t I never heard about it demanded Bill suspiciously Cause as why you re allers so busy talkin that you don t never listen to nothin I reckon was Jed s answer amid laughter Can you tell us what trail to take to get there asked Tom of the miner Yes it s called the old silver trail and you strike it by goin to a place called Black Gulch about forty mile from here Then it s twenty mile farther on But take my advice and don t go Can it be reached by way of Indian Ridge asked mister Jenks wondering how he had been taken to the cave of the diamond makers He did not remember Black Gulch Yes you can git there by Indian Ridge way but it s more dangerous You re likely to lose your way for that s a trail that s seldom traveled mister Jenks thought that perhaps was the reason the gang had taken him that way It s easier to get to the stone head and Phantom Mountain by Black Gulch but it ain t healthy to go there strangers take my advice on that concluded the miner as he prepared to go to sleep again Tom could scarcely contain the exultation he felt At last it seemed they were on the trail He motioned to mister Jenks and they slipped quietly from the place just as another dance was beginning Now for Black Gulch cried Tom We must hurry back to the airship and tell the good news It s too late to night decided mister Jenks and so they waited until morning when they made an early start They found mister Damon and mister Parker anxiously awaiting their return mister Damon blessed so many things that he was nearly out of breath and mister Parker related something of the observations he had made I think I have discovered traces of a dormant volcano he said I am in hopes that it will have an eruption while we are here I m not spoke Tom decidedly We ll start for Black Gulch as soon as possible The airship once more rose in the air and following the directions the miner had given him Tom pointed his craft for the depression in the mountains which had been given the name Black Gulch It was reached in a short time and then making a turn up a long valley the airship proceeded at reduced speed We ought to see that stone head soon now spoke Tom as he peered from the windows of the pilot house It s queer we didn t notice it when we were up in the air remarked mister Jenks We ve been over this place before I m sure of it The next moment mister Damon uttered a cry Bless my watch chain he exclaimed Look at that He pointed off to the left There jutting out from the side of a steep mountain peak was a mass of stone black stone which as the airship slowly approached took the form and shape of a giant s head That s it That s it cried Tom The great stone head And now for Phantom Mountain and the diamonds shouted mister Jenks as Tom let the airship slowly settle to the bottom of the valley CHAPTER XIII ON PHANTOM MOUNTAIN Out from the Red Cloud piled Tom and the others They made a rush for the irregular mass of rock which bore so strong a resemblance to the head of some gigantic man That s the one That s the thing I saw when they were taking me along here blindfolded exclaimed mister Jenks I m sure we re on the right trail now But what gets me though remarked mister Damon is why we couldn t see that landmark when we were up in the air We had a fine view and ought to have been able to pick it out with the telescopes The adventurers saw the reason a few seconds later The image was visible only from one place and that was directly looking up the valley If one went too far to the right or left the head disappeared from view behind jutting crags and it was impossible to see it from overhead because the head was almost under a great spur of a mighty mountain We might have hunted for it a week in the airship and been directly over it said Tom and yet we would never have seen it Yes but we never would have gotten here in such good shape if it hadn t been for your wonderful craft declared mister Jenks It brought us here safely and quickly and enabled us to elude the men who tried to keep us back We re here in spite of them If we had traveled by train they might have interfered with us in a dozen ways That s so agreed mister Damon Well now we re here what s to be done Which way do we start to reach the cave where the diamonds are manufactured mister Jenks That I can t say As you know I only had a momentary glimpse of this stone head as they were taking me along the trail Then one the men noticed that the bandage had slipped and he pulled it into place So I really can t say which direction to take now in order to discover the secret How long after you saw the head before you reached the cave asked Tom In that way we may be able to tell how far away it is Well I should say it was about two or three hours after I saw the head before we got to the halting place and I was carried into the cave That would make it several miles from here for we went in a wagon Yes and they might have driven in a round about way in order to deceive you suggested mister Damon At best we have but a faint idea where the diamond cave is but we must search for it eh Tom Certainly We ll start right in And as the airship will be of but little service to us now I suggest that we leave it in this valley It is very much secluded and no one will harm it I think We can then start off prospecting for I have a large portable tent and we can carry enough food with us with what game we can shoot to enable us to live I have a regular camping outfit on board Fine cried mister Parker and that will give me a chance to make some observations among the mountains and perhaps I can predict when a landslide or an eruption of some dormant volcano may occur Bless my stars cried mister Damon I don t wish you any bad luck mister Parker but I sincerely hope nothing of the sort happens We had enough of that on Earthquake Island One can not halt the forces of nature said the scientist solemnly There are many towering peaks around here which may contain old volcanoes And I notice the presence of iron ore all about This must be a wonderful place in a thunder and lightning storm Why asked Tom curiously Because lightning would be powerfully attracted here by the presence of the metal In fact there is evidence that many of the peaks have been struck by lightning and the scientist showed curious livid scars on the stone faces of the peaks within sight Then this is a good place to stay away from in a storm observed mister Damon However we won t worry about that now If this is the landmark mister Jenks was searching for then we must be in the vicinity of Phantom Mountain I think we are declared the diamond seeker Probably it is within sight now but there are so many peaks and this is such a wild and desolate part of the country that we may have trouble in locating it We ve got to make a beginning anyhow decided Tom and the sooner the better Come we ll make up our camping kits and start out It was something to know that they were on the right trail and it was a relief to be able to busy oneself and not be aimlessly searching for a mysterious landmark They all felt this and soon the airship was taken to a secluded part of the valley where it was well hidden from sight in a grove of trees Tom and mister Damon then served a good meal and preparations were made to start on their search among the mountains a search which they hoped would lead them to Phantom Mountain and the cave of the diamond makers The tent which would afford them shelter was in sections and could be laced together They carried food compressed into small packages coffee a few cooking utensils and each one had a gun Tom carrying a combination rifle and shotgun for game We can t live very high while we re on the trail said the young inventor but it won t be much worse than it was on Earthquake Island Are we all ready I guess so answered mister Damon How long are we going to be away Until we find the diamond makers declared Tom firmly Shouldering their packs the adventurers started off Tom turned for a last look at his airship dimly seen amid the trees Would he ever come back to the Red Cloud Would she be there when he did return Would their quest be successful These questions the lad asked himself as he followed his companions along the rocky trail Perhaps we can find the road by which these men go in and out of the cave suggested mister Damon when they had gone on for several miles I fancy not replied mister Jenks They probably take great pains to hide it I think though that our best plan will be to go here and there looking for the entrance to the cave I believe I would remember the place But why can t you follow the directions given by the miner who told you about Phantom Mountain asked mister Damon Because his talk was too indefinite answered mister Jenks He was so frightened by seeing what he believed to be a ghost that he didn t take much notice of the location of the place All he knows is that Phantom Mountain is somewhere around here And we ve got to hunt until we find it is that the idea asked mister Parker Or until we see the phantom added Tom in a low voice Bless my topknot exclaimed mister Damon You don t mean to say you expect to see that ghost do you Tom Perhaps answered the young inventor and he did not add something else of which he was thinking For Tom had a curious theory regarding the phantom They tramped about the remainder of that day Toward evening Tom shot some birds which made a welcome addition to their supper Then the tent was put together some spruce and hemlock boughs were cut to make a soft bed and on these while the light of a campfire gleamed in on them the adventurers slept Their experience the following day was similar to the first They saw no evidence of a large cave such as mister Jenks had described nor were there any traces of men having gone back and forth among the mountains as might have been expected of the diamond makers for as mister Jenks had said they made frequent journeys to the settlement for food and other supplies Well I haven t begun to give up yet announced Tom on the third day when their quest was still unsuccessful But I think we are making one mistake What is that inquired mister Jenks I think we should go up higher In my opinion the cave is near the top of some peak isn t it mister Jenks I have that impression though as you know I never saw the outside of it Still it might not be a bad idea to ascend some of these peaks Following this suggestion they laid their trail more toward the sky and that night found them encamped several thousand feet above the sea level It was quite cool and the campfire was a big one about which they sat after supper talking of many things Tom did not sleep well that night He tossed from side to side on the bed of boughs and once or twice got up to replenish the fire which had burned low His companions were in deep slumber I wonder what time it is mused Tom when he had been up the third time to throw wood on the blaze Must be near morning He looked at his watch and was somewhat startled to see that it was only a little after twelve Somehow it seemed much later As he was putting the timepiece back into his pocket the lad looked around at the dark and gloomy mountains amid which they were encamped As his gaze wandered toward the peak of the one on the side of which the tent was pitched he gave a start of surprise For coming down a place where that afternoon Tom had noticed a sort of indefinite trail was a figure in white A tall waving figure which swayed this way and that a figure which halted and then came on again I wonder I wonder if that can be a wisp of fog mused the young inventor He rubbed his eyes thinking it might be a swirling of the night mist or a defect of vision Then as he saw more plainly he noticed the thing in white rushing toward him It s the phantom the phantom cried Tom aloud It s the thing the miner saw We re on Phantom Mountain now CHAPTER XIV WARNED BACK Tom s cries awakened the sleepers in the tent mister Damon was the first to rush out Bless my nightcap Tom he cried What is it What has happened Are we attacked by a mountain lion For answer the young inventor pointed up the mountain to where in the dim light from a crescent moon there stood boldly revealed the figure in white Bless bless my very existence cried the odd man What is it Tom The phantom was the quiet answer Watch it and see what it does By this time mister Jenks and mister Parker had joined Tom and mister Damon The four diamond seekers stood gazing at the apparition And as they looked the thing in white seemingly too tall for any human being slid slowly forward with a gliding motion Then it raised its long white arms and waved them threateningly at the adventurers It s motioning us to go back said mister Parker in an awed whisper It doesn t want us to go any farther Very likely agreed Tom coolly But we re not going to be frightened by anything like that are we Not much exclaimed mister Jenks I expected this A ghost can t drive me back from getting my rights from those scoundrels Suppose it uses a revolver to back up its demand asked the scientist Wait until it does answered mister Jenks But the figure in white evidently had no such intentions It came on a little distance farther still waving the long arms threateningly and then it suddenly disappeared seeming to dissolve in the misty shadows of the night Bless my suspenders cried mister Damon That s a very strange proceeding Very strange What do you make of it Tom It is evidently some man dressed up in a sheet declared mister Jenks I expected as much The work of those diamond makers do you think continued mister Damon I believe so answered Tom slowly for he was trying to think it out I believe they are the cause of the phantom though I don t know that it s a man dressed in a sheet Why isn t it demanded mister Jenks Because it was too tall for a man unless he s a giant He may have been on stilts suggested mister Parker No man on stilts could walk along that way declared Tom confidently He glided along too easily I am inclined to think it may be some sort of a light A light queried mister Damon Yes the diamond makers may be hidden in some small cave near here and they may have some sort of a magic lantern or a similar arrangement for throwing a shadow picture They could arrange it to move as they liked and could cause it to disappear at will That I think is the ghost we have just seen But the diamond makers have only been in this mountain recently objected mister Jenks and the phantom was here before them In fact that was what gave the place its name That may be admitted the lad There are many places that have the name of being haunted but no one ever sees the ghost It is always some one else who has heard of some one who has seen it That may have been the case here I grant that this place may have been called Phantom Mountain for a number of years due to the superstitious tales of miners The diamond makers came along found the conditions just right for their work and adopted the ghost so to speak As there wasn t any real spirit they made one and they use it to scare people away I think that s what we ve just seen though I may be wrong in my theory as to what the phantom is Well it s gone now at any rate said mister Jenks and I think we d better get back inside the tent It s cold out here Aren t some of us going to stand guard demanded mister Damon What for asked mister Jenks Why er bless my key ring Suppose that ghost takes a notion to come down here and use his gun as he did on the miners I don t believe that will happen remarked Tom The diamond makers if the white thing had anything to do with them have given us a warning and I think they ll at least wait until morning to see how we heed it We aren t going to heed it burst out mister Jenks I m going to go right ahead and find that cave where they make diamonds And we re with you exclaimed Tom We ll have a good fire going the rest of the night and that may keep intruders away In the morning we ll begin our search and we ll go up the trail where we saw the white figure A big pile of wood had been collected for the fire and Tom now piled some logs and branches on the blaze It would last for some time now and the adventurers still talking of the ghost went back into the tent It was over an hour before they all got to sleep again and mister Jenks and mister Damon took turns in getting up once or twice during the remainder of the night to replenish the fire Morning dawned without anything further having occurred to disturb them and after a hearty breakfast to which Tom added some fish he caught in a nearby mountain stream they set off up the trail on Phantom Mountain They had left their tent standing as they proposed making that spot their headquarters until they located the cave they were seeking What their course would be after that would depend on the circumstances If they had expected to have an easy task locating the cavern in which mister Jenks had seen diamonds made the adventurers were disappointed All that day they tramped up and down the mountain looking for some secret entrance but none was disclosed The higher they went up the great peak the fainter became the trail until at length it vanished completely But this was not to be wondered at since it was on solid rock in which no footsteps would leave an impression They never brought you up here in a wagon mister Jenks decided Tom when he saw how steep the place was I m inclined to think so myself admitted the diamond man They must have reached the cave from some other way As a matter of fact I walked some distance after getting out of the vehicle before we got to the cavern But even at that I don t believe we came this way Yet the phantom was here persisted Tom and I m convinced that the cave is in this neighborhood It s up to us to find it But they searched the remainder of that day in vain and as night was coming on they made their way back to the camp As Tom who was in the lead approached the tent he saw something black fastened to the entrance Hello he cried Some one s been here That wasn t on the tent when we left this morning What is it asked mister Damon A black piece of paper written on with white ink replied the lad He was reading it and as he perused it a look of surprise came over his face Listen to this called Tom It s evidently from the diamond makers Holding up the black paper on which the white writing stood out in bold relief Tom read aloud Be warned in time Go back before it is too late You are near to death Go back Bless my shoelaces cried mister Damon This is getting serious

4267_287369_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Gathered about the young inventor the three men looked at the warning The writing was poor and it was evident that an attempt had been made to disguise it 
none	none	But there was no misspelling of words and there were no rudely drawn daggers or bloody hands or anything of that sort 
4267_287369_000005_000002	train-clean-100	In fact it was a very business like sort of warning 
4267_287369_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Rather odd commented mister Jenks 
4267_287369_000006_000001	train-clean-100	 Black paper and white ink 
4267_287369_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 White ink is easy enough to make stated mister Parker 
4267_287369_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 I fancy they wanted it as conspicuous as possible 
4267_287369_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes agreed Tom and this warning together with the antics of the thing in white last night shows that they are aware of our presence here and perhaps know who we are 
4267_287369_000008_000001	train-clean-100	We will have to be on our guard 
4267_287369_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you think that fellow Munson whom we left in the forest could have gotten here and warned them asked mister Damon 
4267_287369_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 It s possible admitted Tom but now let s see if the person who pinned this warning on our tent took any of our things 
none	none	A hasty examination however showed that nothing had been disturbed and Tom and mister Damon were soon getting supper ready everyone talking during the progress of the meal about the events of the day and the rather weird culmination of it
4267_287369_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Well we haven t had a great deal of success so far admitted Tom as they sat about the fire in the fast gathering dusk 
4267_287369_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 I think perhaps we d better try on the other side of the mountain to morrow 
none	none	We ve explored this side pretty thoroughly
4267_287369_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Good idea commented mister Jenks 
4267_287369_000013_000001	train-clean-100	 We ll do it and move our camp 
4267_287369_000013_000002	train-clean-100	I only hope those fellows don t find our airship and destroy it 
none	none	We ll have a hard time getting back to civilization again if we have to walk all the way 
4267_287369_000014_000000	train-clean-100	This contingency caused Tom some uneasiness 
4267_287369_000014_000001	train-clean-100	He did not like to think that the unscrupulous men might damage the Red Cloud that had been built only after hard labor 
4267_287369_000014_000002	train-clean-100	But he knew he could accomplish nothing by worrying and he tried to dismiss the matter from his mind 
4267_287369_000015_000000	train-clean-100	They rather expected to see the thing in white again that night but it did not appear and morning came without anything having disturbed their heavy sleep for they were tired from the day s tramp 
4267_287369_000016_000000	train-clean-100	It took them the greater part of the day to make a circuit of the base of Phantom Mountain in order to get to a place where a sort of trail led upward 
4267_287369_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 It s too late to do anything to night decided Tom as they set up the tent 
4267_287369_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 We ll rest and start the first thing in the morning 
none	none	And the ghost isn t likely to find us here added mister Damon
4267_287369_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 Where are you going mister Parker he asked as he saw the scientist tramping a little way up the side of the mountain 
4267_287369_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 I am going to make some observations was the answer and no one paid any more attention to him for some time 
4267_287369_000019_000001	train-clean-100	Supper was nearly ready when mister Parker returned 
4267_287369_000019_000002	train-clean-100	His face wore a rather serious air and mister Damon noting it asked laughingly 
4267_287369_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Well did you discover any volcanoes that may erupt during the night and scare us to death 
4267_287369_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 No replied mister Parker calmly but there is every indication that we will soon have a terrific electrical storm 
4267_287369_000021_000001	train-clean-100	From a high peak I caught a glimpse of one working this way across the mountains 
4267_287369_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Then we d better fasten the tent well down called Tom 
none	none	We don t want it to blow away
4267_287369_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 There will not be much danger from wind was mister Parker s opinion 
4267_287369_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 From what then asked mister Jenks 
4267_287369_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 From the discharges of lightning among these mountain peaks which contain so much iron ore 
none	none	We will be in grave danger 
4267_287369_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The fact that the scientist had not always made correct predictions was not now considered by his hearers and Tom and the two men gazed at mister Parker in some alarm 
4267_287369_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Is there anything we can do to avoid it asked mister Jenks 
none	none	The only thing to do would be to leave the mountain was the answer and as the iron ore extends for miles we can not get out of the danger zone before the storm will reach us 
4267_287369_000028_000001	train-clean-100	It will be here in less than half an hour 
4267_287369_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Then we d better have supper remarked Tom practically and get ready for it 
4267_287369_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps it may not be as bad as mister Parker fears 
4267_287369_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 It will be bad enough declared the gloomy scientist and he seemed to find pleasure in his announcement 
4267_287369_000031_000000	train-clean-100	The meal was soon over and Tom busied himself in looking to the guy ropes of the tent for he feared lest there might be wind with the storm 
4267_287369_000031_000001	train-clean-100	That it was coming was evident for now low mutterings of thunder could be heard off toward the west 
none	none	Black clouds rapidly obscured the heavens and the sound of thunder increased 
4267_287369_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Fitful flashes of lightning could be seen forking across the sky in jagged chains of purple light 
4267_287369_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 It s going to be a heavy storm Tom admitted to himself 
4267_287369_000033_000001	train-clean-100	 I hope lightning doesn t strike around here 
4267_287369_000034_000000	train-clean-100	The storm came on rapidly but there was a curious quietness in the air that was more alarming than if a wind had blown 
4267_287369_000034_000001	train-clean-100	The campfire burned steadily and there was a certain oppressiveness in the atmosphere 
4267_287369_000035_000000	train-clean-100	It was now quite dark save when the fitful lightning flashes came and they illuminated the scene brilliantly for a few seconds 
4267_287369_000035_000001	train-clean-100	Then by contrast it was blacker than ever 
4267_287369_000036_000000	train-clean-100	Suddenly as Tom was gazing up toward the peak of Phantom Mountain he saw something that caused him to cry out in alarm 
4267_287369_000036_000001	train-clean-100	He pointed upward and whispered hoarsely 
4267_287369_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 The ghost again 
4267_287369_000037_000001	train-clean-100	There s our friend in white 
4267_287369_000038_000000	train-clean-100	The others looked and saw the same weird figure that had menaced them when they were encamped on the other side of the peak 
4267_287369_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 They must have followed us said mister Jenks in a low voice 
4267_287369_000040_000000	train-clean-100	Slowly the figure advanced It waved the long white arms as if in warning 
4267_287369_000040_000001	train-clean-100	At times it would be only dimly visible in the blackness then suddenly it would stand out in bold relief as a great flash of fire split the clouds 
4267_287369_000041_000000	train-clean-100	The thunder meanwhile had been growing louder and sharper indicating the nearer approach of the storm 
4267_287369_000041_000001	train-clean-100	Each lightning flash was followed in a second or two by a terrific clap 
4267_287369_000041_000002	train-clean-100	Still there was no wind nor rain and the campfire burned steadily 
none	none	All at once there was a crash as if the very mountain had split asunder and the adventurers saw a great ball of purple bluish fire shoot down as if from some cloud and strike against the side of the crag not a hundred feet from where stood the ghostly figure in white
4267_287369_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 That was a bad one cried mister Damon shouting so as to be heard above the echoes of the thunderclap 
4267_287369_000044_000000	train-clean-100	Almost as he spoke there came another explosion even louder than the one preceding 
4267_287369_000044_000001	train-clean-100	A great ball of fire pear shaped leaped for the same spot in the mountain 
4267_287369_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 There s a mass of iron ore there yelled mister Parker 
4267_287369_000045_000001	train-clean-100	 The lightning is attracted to it 
4267_287369_000046_000000	train-clean-100	His voice was swallowed up in the terrific crash that followed and as there came another flash of the celestial fire the figure in white could be seen hurrying back up the mountain trail 
4267_287369_000046_000001	train-clean-100	Evidently the electrical storm with lightning bolts discharging so close was too much for the ghost 
4267_287369_000047_000000	train-clean-100	In another instant it looked as if the whole place about where the diamond seekers stood was a mass of fire 
none	none	Great forked tongues of lightning leaped from the clouds and seemed to lick the ground There was a rattle and bang of thunder like the firing of a battery of guns Tom and the others felt themselves tingling all over as if they had hold of an electrical battery and there was a strong smell of sulphur in the air
4267_287369_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 We are in the midst of the storm cried mister Parker 
4267_287369_000048_000001	train-clean-100	 We are standing on a mass of iron ore 
4267_287369_000048_000002	train-clean-100	Any minute may be our last 
4267_287369_000049_000000	train-clean-100	But fate had not intended the adventurers for death by lightning 
none	none	Almost as suddenly as it had begun the discharge of the tongues of fire ceased in the immediate vicinity of our friends 
4267_287369_000049_000002	train-clean-100	They stood still awed not knowing what to do 
4267_287369_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Then once more came a terrific clap 
4267_287369_000050_000001	train-clean-100	A great mass of fire like some red hot ingot from a foundry was hurled through the air straight at the face of the mountain and at the spot where the figure in white had stood but a few minutes before 
4267_287369_000051_000000	train-clean-100	Instantly the earth trembled as it had at Earthquake Island but it was not the same 
4267_287369_000051_000001	train-clean-100	It was over in a few seconds 
4267_287369_000051_000002	train-clean-100	Then as the diamond seekers looked they saw in the glare of a score of lightning flashes that followed the one great clap the whole side of the mountain slip away and go crashing into the valley below 
4267_287369_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 A landslide cried mister Parker 
4267_287369_000052_000001	train-clean-100	 That is the landslide which I predicted 
none	none	The lightning bolt has split Phantom Mountain CHAPTER XVI THE VAST CAVERN For a time the roiling slipping sliding and tumbling of the mass of earth and stones down the side of the mountain effectually drowned all other sounds Even the thunder was stilled and though Tom and his companions called to one another in terror their voices could not rise above that terrific tumult Finally when they found that the direction of the slide was away from their tent and that they were not likely to be engulfed they grew more calm Gradually the noise subsided The great boulders had rolled to the bottom of the valley and now only a mass of earth and stones was sliding down Even this stopped in about five minutes and as though satisfied with what it had done the electrical storm passed Not a drop of rain had fallen Bless my shirt studs exclaimed mister Damon who was the first to speak after the din had quieted Bless my soul But that was awful It was just what I expected said mister Parker calmly I knew from my observations that we were in a region where landslides and terrific electrical storms may be expected at any time I fully looked for this Well remarked mister Jenks rather sarcastically I hope it came up to your expectations mister Parker Oh fully was the answer though I wish it could have happened in daylight so that I could better have observed certain phenomena regarding the landslide They are very interesting At a distance admitted Tom with a laugh of relief Well I m glad it s over though we ll have to wait until morning to see what damage has been done Lucky we weren t struck by lightning I never saw such bolts Me either declared mister Damon This mountain seems to attract them It is like a magnet said mister Parker I think I shall be able to make some fine observations here If we live through it murmured mister Jenks They watched the play of lightning about a distant bank of clouds but the storm was now far away only a faint rumbling of thunder being heard I m wondering what happened to the phantom said Tom after a pause Seems to me he was right in that track of the storm Do you think it was a he asked mister Jenks I think we ll find that it s some sort of a man answered the young inventor We may find out very soon now I ve changed my theory about the ghost being reflections of light How s that mister Damon wanted to know Well I think we are on the side of Phantom Mountain where the diamond cave is went on the lad The fact that the phantom appeared here soon after we arrived shows that the men kept close track of our movements It also shows I think that the phantom did not have to travel far to be on the spot whereas we had to make quite a trip to get around the base of the mountain I think the cave is up there and Tom pointed toward the spot where the weird figure had been last seen before the storm drove it back There may be two phantoms suggested mister Jenks They may keep one on this side of the mountain and one on the other to warn intruders away It s possible admitted Tom Well we ll see how things look in the morning when we ll take up our march again and go up the mountain We ll reach the top if possible which we couldn t do from the other side as it was too steep I hope we shall be able to go forward in the morning came from mister Jenks What do you mean asked the lad struck by a peculiar significance in the diamond man s tones Why that landslide may have opened a great gully in the side of Phantom Mountain which will prevent us from passing It was a terrific lot of earth and stones that slid away answered mister Jenks It certainly was agreed mister Parker I would not be surprised if the mountain was half destroyed and it may be that the diamond cave no longer exists Not very cheerful to say the least murmured mister Jenks to Tom and as it was getting quite chilly following the storm they went inside the tent Tom could hardly wait for daylight to get up and see what havoc the landslide had wrought As soon as the first faint flush of dawn showed over the eastern peaks he hurried from the tent mister Damon heard him arise and followed A curious scene met their eyes All about were great rocks rent and torn by the awful power of the lightning The fronts of the stone cliffs were scarred and burned by the electrical fire and fantastic markings grotesque faces and leering animals seemed to have been drawn by some gigantic artist who used a bolt from heaven for his brush But the eyes of Tom and mister Damon took all this in at a glance and then their gaze went forward to where the avalanche had torn away a great part of the mountain Whew I should say it was a landslide cried Tom Bless my wishbone yes agreed mister Damon Below them in the valley lay piled immense masses of earth and stones Boulders were heaped up on boulders and rocks upon rocks being tossed about in heaps strung about in long ridges and swirled about in curves as though some cyclone had toyed with them after the lightning flash had tossed them there But the mountain isn t half gone said Tom as his eyes took in what was left of the phantom berg I guess it will take a few more bolts like that one to put this hill out of business Though the landslide had been a great one the larger part of the mountain still stood An immense slice had been taken from one side but the summit was untouched And there s where the diamond cave is cried Tom pointing to it I think so myself agreed mister Jenks who came from the tent at that moment and joined the lad and mister Damon I think we shall find the cave somewhere up there We must start for it as soon as we have eaten and we may reach it by night The three stood gazing up toward the summit of the great mountain Suddenly as the sun rose higher in the heavens it sent a shaft of rosy light on the face of the berg that had been scarred by the landslide Tom Swift uttered an exclamation and pointed at something See he cried Look where the trail is the trail down which the phantom must have come It is on the edge of a cliff now They looked and saw that this was so The increasing light had just revealed it to them When the lightning bolt had torn away a great portion of the mountain it had cut sheer down for a great depth and when the earth and stones fell away they left a narrow pathway winding around the mountain but so near the edge of a great chasm that there was room but for one person at a time to walk on that footway The uncertain trail up Phantom Mountain had all but been destroyed The way up to the peak is by that path now spoke Tom in a low voice Bless my soul cried mister Damon It s as much as a man s life is worth to attempt it If he got dizzy he d topple over and fall a thousand feet Dare we risk it It s the only way to get up went on Tom It s either that way or not at all We ve tried the other side without success We must go up this way or turn back Then we ll go up cried mister Jenks It may not be as dangerous as it looks from here But it was even more dangerous than it appeared when they went part way up it after a hasty breakfast The trail was a mere ledge of rock now and in some places to get around a projecting edge of the mountain they had to stand with their backs to the dizzy depths at their feet and with both arms outstretched work their way around to where the trail was wider Shall we risk it asked Tom when they had tried the way and found it so dangerous We can t take anything with us even our guns for we couldn t carry them and if we reach the mouth of the cave and find those men there He paused significantly The adventurers looked at one another The search for the diamond makers was becoming more and more dangerous I say let s go on decided mister Damon suddenly We want to locate that cave first of all Perhaps when we do find it we may see some easier way of getting to it than this And if those diamond makers do attack us well I don t believe they ll shoot defenseless men and they may listen to reason and give mister Jenks his rights tell him how to make diamonds in return for the money he gave them I don t believe those scoundrels will listen to reason replied the diamond man but I agree with mister Damon that we ought to go on We may find some other means of reaching the cave if we can discover it and we ll take a chance with the men Forward it is then cried Tom I have a revolver and I can supply one of you gentlemen with another They may come in useful in an emergency Let s go back to camp take a little lunch in our pockets and try to scale the mountain They were soon on their way up the dizzy path once more and as they advanced they found it growing more and more dangerous In some places they found it almost impossible to get around certain corners where there was barely room for their feet As Tom remarked grimly a fat man never could have done it Fortunately they were all comparatively thin for their hard work and not too abundant food since they had left the airship had reduced their weight Up and up they went higher and higher sometimes finding the path wide enough for two to walk abreast and again seeing it narrow almost to a ribbon They hardly dared look down into the chasm at their left a chasm filled in part with the rocks and boulders tossed into it by the lightning bolt Tom was in the lead and had just made a dangerous turn around a shoulder of rock one of those places where he had to extend both arms and fairly hug the cliff before he could get around But when he had made it and found himself on a broad pathway cut in the living rock he gave a great shout a shout that caused his companions to hasten to his side They found the young inventor pointing to a clump of bushes and small trees But it was not the shrubbery that Tom desired to call to their attention They saw that in an instant for dimly seen through the leaves was something black and as they looked more closely they saw that it was a great hole in the side of the mountain a vast cavern opening like a tunnel The cave The cave cried Tom The diamond makers cave Hardly had he spoken than two men each one carrying a gun showed themselves in the mouth of the cavern and instant later they both ran toward the little party of adventurers CHAPTER XVII THE PHANTOM CAPTURED Surprise held Tom and his friends almost spellbound for the moment The young inventor s hand went toward the pocket where he carried his revolver mister Jenks who had the only other weapon sought to draw it but he was stopped by a gesture of one of the two men with guns Hold on strangers the man cried I know what you re up to Better not try to draw anything it might not be healthy Now then who are you and what do you want The question came rather as a surprise at least to Tom and mister Jenks They had taken it for granted that these men if they were the diamond makers would know mister Jenks and guess at his errand in coming back to Phantom Mountain But it seemed that they took them all for casual strangers No one answered for a moment Tom caught the eye of mister Jenks and there was a look of hope in it If ever there was a time for strategy it was now Evidently Munson the stowaway on the airship had not yet been able to send a warning to his confederates And neither of the two men recognized mister Jenks as the man who had been defrauded of his rights It might be possible to conceal the real object of the adventurers until they had time to formulate a plan of action Well exclaimed the man with the gun impatiently I ask you folks a question What do you want Fortunately neither mister Damon nor mister Parker replied The former because he deferred to Tom and mister Jenks and the scientist because he was busy inspecting some curious rocks he picked up As it turned out this was the luckiest thing he could have done It lent color to what mister Jenks said a moment later What are you doing up here demanded the man again Don t you know this is private property We we were just looking around answered mister Jenks which was true enough as far as it went Prospecting added Tom After gold demanded the second man suspiciously We d be glad to find some retorted the lad At that moment mister Parker began breaking off bits of rock with a small geologist s hammer which he carried The men with the guns looked at him So you think you ll find gold up here asked the one who had first spoken Is there any inquired Tom trying to make his voice sound eager Nary a bit strangers was the answer and the two men laughed heartily Now we don t want to seem harsh went on the man who seemed to be the spokesman but you d better get away from here This is private ground and dangerous too how d you ever get up the trail we heard it was destroyed There is still a narrow path said mister Jenks We came up that the lightning and landslide haven t left much of it though mister Parker looked quickly up from the rocks at which he was tapping with his small hammer You have terrific lightning up here he said I am much interested in it from a scientific standpoint I predict that some day the entire mountain will be destroyed by a blast from the sky I hope it won t be right away spoke one of the men Now I guess you folks had better be leaving while there s a path left to go down by Might I ask broke in mister Parker as calmly as though he was lecturing to a class of students might I ask if you have noticed any peculiar effect of the lightning up here on the summit of the mountain Does it fuse and melt rocks so to speak What s that cried the spokesman with a sudden flash of anger The two men looked at each other I wanted to know merely for scientific reasons whether the lightning up here ever melted rocks repeated mister Jenks Well whether it s for scientific reasons or for any other I m not going to answer you snapped the man It s none of your affair what the lightning does up here Now you d all better vamoose clear out All right we ll go said Tom quickly at the same time motioning to mister Jenks to agree with him The eyes of the young inventor were roving about He saw what looked like a second trail leading down the mountain from the far side of the cave He was convinced now that there was another way to get to it Possibly they might find it At any rate nothing more could be done now They must go back for the cavern was too well guarded to attempt to enter it by force at least just yet Yes we ll go back assented mister Jenks mister Parker was tapping away at the rocks He looked toward the black mouth of the big cave On what corresponded to the roof of it some distance back from the entrance he saw a slender metal rod sticking up into the air May I ask if that s a lightning rod he inquired innocently If it is I should like to ask about its action in a mountain that is so impregnated with iron ore You may ask until you get tired cried the spokesman again showing unreasoning anger but you ll get no answer from us Now get away from here before we do something desperate You re on private ground and you re not wanted Clear out while you have the chance There was no help for it Slowly our friends turned and began to go down the dangerous trail They were soon out of sight of the two men who stood before the cave with their guns ready but neither Tom nor any of his companions spoke for some time When they had rounded one of the most dangerous turns the young inventor sat down to rest an example followed by the others Well asked Tom do you think those are some of the diamond makers mister Jenks I certainly do though I never saw those two men before If I could once get inside the cave I could tell whether or not it was the one where I was practically held a prisoner But I m sure it is I know some of the men used to go off every day with guns and not come back until night I have no doubt they were on guard just as these two are And also I think I heard them speak of a second entrance to the cavern The one we just saw may not be the main one through which I was taken I believe we are on the right track ventured mister Damon but we will either have to go up there after dark which will be risky on account of the narrow trail or else we will have to find some other path The last would be better spoke Tom That rod of metal sticking up on top of the cave interested me said the scientist Did you hear anything of that when you were here before mister Jenks No Probably that is only a lightning rod or it may be a staff for a signal flag But what surprises me is that those men didn t suspect that we were seeking to discover their secret They took us for ordinary prospectors So much the better remarked Tom We have a chance now of getting inside that cave But we will have to go back to camp and make other plans And we must hurry or it will be dark before we get there They hastened their steps pausing only briefly to eat some of the lunch they had brought along and to drink from a spring that bubbled from the side of the mountain It was getting dusk when they got back to their tent They found nothing disturbed I wonder if we ll see that phantom again to night ventured Tom as they were sitting about the campfire a little later Probably not remarked mister Jenks I don t believe the ghost will venture down the dangerous trail after dark and the gang may think that the warning given us by the two men on guard at the cave will be sufficient But if we don t leave here by to morrow I think we will have another visit from the thing in white It was about an hour after this when Tom was collecting some wood in a pile nearer the fire so as to have it ready to throw on in case there was any alarm in the night that he happened to look up toward the summit of the mountain A slight noise as of loose stones rolling down attracted his attention and at first he feared lest another landslide was beginning but a moment later he saw what caused it There advancing down the steep and dangerous trail was the figure in white the phantom Instantly a daring plan came into Tom s head Dropping the wood softly he moved back out of the glare of the fire mister Jenks he called in a whisper The diamond man who was behind the tent came toward Tom What is it he asked Then as he saw the ghostly visitor he added Oh the phantom again What s it up to The same thing replied Tom but it won t do it long if my plan succeeds What plan is that Tom I m going to try to capture that that man or whatever it is Will you help Surely Then let s work around behind it while mister Damon and mister Parker come up from in front We ll solve this part of the mystery anyhow if it s possible The two other men were soon told of the plan Meanwhile the thing in white had advanced slowly until within a few hundred feet of the camp They could see now that it was no shaft of light but some white body shaped like a tall thin man draped in a white garment The long arms waved to and fro There was no semblance of a head You and mister Parker go right toward it slowly mister Damon advised Tom mister Jenks and I will make a circle and get in back Then if it s anything alive we ll have it The ghost continued to advance Tom and the diamond man stole off to one side their buckskin moccasins making no sound mister Damon and the scientist went boldly forward This movement appeared to disconcert the spirit It halted waved the arms with greater vigor than before and seemed to indicate to the adventurers that it was dangerous to advance But mister Damon and mister Parker kept on They wanted to give Tom and mister Jenks time enough to make the circuit Suddenly the stillness of the night was broken by a low whistle It was Tom s signal that he and mister Jenks were ready Come on Run cried mister Damon The scientist and the eccentric man leaped forward The ghost heard the whistle and heard the spoken words The thing in white hesitated a moment and then raised one arm There was a flash of fire and a loud report He s firing in the air cried Tom Come on we have him now Undaunted by the display of firearms mister Damon and mister Parker kept on They could hear Tom and mister Jenks running up in back of the figure The latter also heard this and suddenly turned Caught between the two forces of our friends the ghost was at a loss what to do The next instant Tom who had distanced mister Jenks made a flying tackle for the figure in white and caught it around the legs Very substantial legs they were too Tom felt the legs of a man Wow yelled the ghost as he went down in a heap the revolver falling from his hand Come on cried Tom I have him His friends rushed to his aid There was a confused mass of dark bodies arms and legs mingled with something tall and thin all in white Suddenly the moon came from behind a cloud and they could see what they had captured for captured the phantom was It proved to be a rather small man who wore upon his shoulders a framework of wood over which some white cloth was draped It had fallen off him when Tom made that tackle Well remarked the young inventor as he sat on the struggling man s chest I guess we ve got you I rather guess you have stranger was the cool reply CHAPTER XVIII BILL RENSHAW WILL HELP They were all panting from the exertion of the run up the mountain and the contest with the phantom a phantom no longer though truth to tell the struggle was not nearly so fierce as Tom had expected He thought the ghost would put up a stiff fight Got any ropes to tie him with asked mister Damon who was helping Tom hold the man down Ropes You aren t going to tie me up are you strangers asked the captive That s what we are exclaimed mister Jenks We ve had trouble enough in this matter and if I ve got one of the gang perhaps I can get some of the others and have my rights So tie him up Tom and we ll take him to camp Oh you needn t go to all that trouble strangers went on the man calmly If one of you will get off my chest and the other gentleman ease up on my stomach a bit I ll walk wherever you want me and not make any trouble I haven t got a gun Bless my gloves But you re a cool one commented mister Damon as he complied with the man s request and got up from his stomach But look out for him Tom He had a gun for he fired it in the air He hasn t it now answered the young inventor I knocked it from his hand when I leaped for him That s what you did assented the man as he got up while Tom kept a tight hold of him as did mister Jenks What kind of a grizzly bear hug do you call that anyhow that you gave me That was a football tackle explained Tom I allers heard that was a dangerous game remarked the former phantom simply Well now you ve got me what are you going to do with me Take you where we can have a good look at you replied mister Jenks as he kicked aside the wooden framework and the sheet which had made the ghost appear so tall So this is how you worked it eh Yep That was the haunt stranger I made it myself and it worked all right until you folks come along I rather suspicioned from the first when I played the trick over on tother side of the mountain that you wouldn t be so easy to fool as most prospectors are Oh so you re the only ghost then asked Tom I m the only one By this time they had reached the camp Tom threw some light logs on the fire which blazed up brightly As the flames illuminated the face of their captive mister Jenks looked at him and cried out Why it s Bill Renshaw That s me admitted the man who had played the part of the phantom and thunder turtles if it ain t mister Jenks who was once in the diamond cave with us Whatever happened to you I never heard The others said you got tired and went away They took me away defrauded me of my rights declared mister Jenks bitterly But I ll get them back To think of Bill Renshaw playing the part of a ghost They made me do it went on the man somewhat dejectedly I wanted to be at work in the cave but they wouldn t let me Is this man one of the diamond makers asked Tom in great surprise He is one of the helpers though I don t believe he knows the secret of making the gems explained mister Jenks He was one of the men in the cave when I was there before and he and I struck up quite a friendship didn t we Renshaw That s what and there ain t no reason why we can t be friends now that is unless you hold a grudge against me for firing at you But I only shot in the air to scare you away Them s my instructions I m supposed to be on guard and scare away strangers I m tired of the work too for I don t get my share and those other fellows in the cave get all the money from the diamonds Tom Swift uttered an exclamation A sudden plan had come to him Quickly he whispered to mister Jenks Make a friend of this man if possible He evidently is dissatisfied Offer him a sum to show us another way into the cave and we may yet discover the secret of the diamond makers I will declared mister Jenks quietly Then turning to Renshaw he added Bill come over here I want to have a talk with you Perhaps it will be to our mutual advantage He led the former phantom to one side and for some time conversed earnestly with him mister Jenks told the story of how he had been deceived by Folwell and the others who were at the head of the gang of diamond makers The rich man related how they had taken his money and after promising to disclose the secret process to him had broken faith and had drugged him afterward taking him out of the cave I want only my rights and that for which I paid concluded mister Jenks Now I gather that these men haven t treated you altogether fairly Bill Indeed they haven t I helped em to the best of my ability and all I get out of it is to stay out on this lonely side of the mountain and play ghost They owe me money too and they won t pay me either though they have lots for they sold some diamonds lately Then they are still making diamonds asked mister Jenks eagerly Have you seen them Do you know the secret No I don t know it for they won t let me in on it I m always sent out of the cave just before they make the gems But I know they ve made some lately and have sold em I want my share Look here exclaimed mister Jenks quickly wishing to strike while the iron was hot I ll make you a proposition Show us how to get into that cave unknown to the diamond makers and I ll pay you twice what they agreed to Is it a bargain Bill Renshaw considered a moment Then he thrust out his hand clasped that of mister Jenks and exclaimed It is I ll take you into the cave by an entrance that s seldom used There are four ways to get in The one where the two men drove you back is the rear one The front one is on the other side of the mountain but it s so well concealed that you d never find it But I can take you to one where you can get in and those fellows will never know it And what s more I ll help you if it comes to a fight Good exclaimed mister Jenks I think we ll discover the secret of the diamond makers this time and he went to tell the others of the success of his talk Bill Renshaw had been converted from an enemy into a friend and the former phantom was now ready to lead Tom and the others into the secret cave We ll start in the morning decided mister Jenks who after many disappointments at last saw success ahead of him CHAPTER XIX IN THE SECRET CAVE Tom Swift was up at break of day and the others were not far behind him Now for the secret cave cried the young inventor as he gazed up the mountain in the interior of which the mysterious band of men were making the diamonds Have you made any plans Bill asked mister Jenks of the former phantom who had cast his lot in with the adventurers What will be the best course for us to follow You just leave it to me mister Jenks was the answer I ll get you into the cave and those fellows who I believe are trying to do me out of my rights as they did you out of yours will never know a thing about it Bless my finger nails cried mister Damon That will be great We can get in the cave and watch them make the diamonds at our leisure They don t make them every day explained Renshaw It seems they have to wait for certain occasions Mostly they make the diamonds when there s a big storm A big storm asked the scientist with a sudden show of interest Do you mean one of those electrical storms such as we had the other night That s it mister Parker though why they wait until there s a storm is more than I can tell Perhaps they know that on such occasions no one will venture up the mountain spoke mister Damon No it isn t that declared the scientist I think I am on the track of a great scientific discovery and I will soon be able to make observations that will confirm it Well I m going to make an observation right now said Tom with a laugh I m going to see what there is for breakfast And that reminds me came from mister Jenks shall we move our camp Bill and take the tent with us to the cave I hardly think so was the answer I think the best plan would be to conceal the tent somewhere around here in case you might need it again You can also store what food you have left But bless my appetite we don t want to starve in that diamond cave objected mister Damon I ll see that you don t declared Bill Renshaw I ll take you in there unbeknownst to those fellows and I ll provide you with plenty of food and water You see the cave is so big that there are some parts they never visit And we can stay in one of those parts and eat asked Tom Sure answered Bill And watch the diamond makers at work asked mister Jenks That s it replied the former phantom Then the sooner we get started the better remarked mister Damon mister Parker said nothing He appeared to be thinking deeply and was tapping at some rocks with his little hammer The advice of Bill Renshaw was followed and the tent and what food remained was concealed in the bushes with rocks piled over to keep away prowling animals Then they started for the secret cave The man who played the part of a ghost picked up the framework and white cloth that had formed his disguise I ll still have to use this he explained for I don t want those fellows to know that I m helping you I ll continue to play the spirit of the mountain but there won t be much need of it I don t think any more people will come prospecting out here Have you heard of the arrival of Farley Munson asked Tom as he related the facts about the stowaway He hadn t arrived up to a day or so ago answered Bill I guess he s still traveling Farley is one of the heads of the gang he added and a dangerous man As Bill led the way toward the cave taking a route that the adventurers had never suspected led to it he explained that the cavern was a large one capable of holding an army But there s only a small part of it used by the diamond makers he added They work in a small recess near the summit of the mountain The little cave where I m going to take you opens off from it by a long passage And except that you ll be pretty much in the dark you ll be quite comfortable There are tables chairs and some bunks in the place I can get you some lights and plenty of food But if you are seen taking away food won t the others suspect something asked Tom I do pretty much as I please said Bill I go and come when I like All I m supposed to do is to watch my two sides of the mountain play the ghost and give warning when any one is coming Sometimes I leave black and white messages like the one I put on your tent Those fellows fix em up for me I ve told em about you though I didn t know who you were and they think you have gone for the two men on guard at the rear entrance so reported Sometimes I stay out on the mountain for a couple of days at a time when the weather s good and don t go back to the cave Those times I take food with me and so if they see me making off with some supplies they ll think I m going to camp out It doesn t look as though we d ever get into a cave near the top of the mountain going this way said Tom as they marched along We re going down instead of up That s the secret of this trail explained Bill We go down in a sort of valley and then go up a pretty stiff place and then we re on a direct trail to the entrance I told you about It s a steep road to climb but I guess we can manage it And a hard climb the adventurers did find it The road was almost as bad as the one along the edge of the chasm but they managed to negotiate it and finally found themselves on a fairly good trail We ll soon be there Bill assured them After you get in the little cave where I m going to hide you I ll have to leave you for a spell until I get my ghost rigging fixed up again But I ll see that you have plenty of food and drink A little later their guide came to a sudden halt and peered around anxiously What s the matter asked Tom I was just looking to see if any of the men were about he answered But I guess not it looks all right The entrance is right here They were on a side of the mountain near the summit Below stretched a magnificent scene A great valley lay at their feet and they could look off to many distant peaks The main trail to Leadville and the one to the settlement of Indian Ridge was in sight Suddenly Tom who had been using a small but powerful telescope uttered an exclamation and focussed the instrument on a speck that seemed moving along on the trail below A man coming up the mountain cried Tom And it can t be yet it is it s Farley Munson the stowaway he cried He s coming here Let me look begged mister Jenks taking the glass from Tom An instant later the diamond man exclaimed Yes it s Munson Then in here with you quick cried Renshaw He can t see us yet and we ll be out of sight in another minute The former spirit pulled aside some thick bushes and pointed to a hole which was disclosed The entrance to the secret cave he announced Slip in all of you Tom after another glance at the man toiling his way up the mountain entered the cavern He was followed by the others Bill was the last to enter and he replaced the bushes over the entrance At last exclaimed mister Jenks as he gazed up at the roof of the dimly lighted vault in which they found themselves Yes we re in the diamond makers secret cave added Tom Now to catch them at work Come on advised Bill in a low tone We re not safe yet and he produced a lantern from some hidden recess lighted the wick and led the way As the others followed they were aware of a subdued noise in the great cavern CHAPTER XX MAKING THE DIAMONDS What s that noise asked Tom as their guide flashed the lantern to show them the way That s the men getting ready to make diamonds I guess was the answer You see it takes quite a while to get the stuff ready I don t know what they use they never tell me any of their secrets Oh I know the ingredients well enough said mister Jenks but I don t know the secret of how they apply the terrific heat and pressure necessary to fuse the materials into diamonds Well you ll soon know declared Bill Renshaw Of course it isn t always successful I ve known em to try half a dozen times before they got any diamonds big enough to satisfy em They gave me some of the small ones when I asked for my wages How did you come to get in with these men asked Tom curious to understand how a person seemingly as honest as Renshaw appeared to be had cast his lot in with the men who had broken faith with mister Jenks Oh I ve lived around these parts all my life was the answer I knew of this cave before these diamond fellers came to it In fact I showed it to em It was several years ago that a party of men who were prospecting around here came to me and asked if I knew of a small cave near the top of a high mountain where lightning storms were frequent I told them about Phantom Mountain as it was called then and also of this cave If there s any place where they have worse lightning storms than here I d like to know it They scare me sometimes like the night when that landslide happened and I m sort of used to em Well I took these men to the cave and they hired me as a sort of lookout Then they began their work and at first I didn t know what they were up to but finally I caught on Then mister Jenks came and disappeared mysteriously though then I didn t know that they had played a trick on him I was outside most of the time pretending I was the ghost So that s how I came to get in with em and I wish I was out You soon will be I think declared mister Jenks But won t our talking be heard by the men No danger There is a thick wall between this part of the cave and the part where they live and work I ll soon have you well hid and then you wait until I come back What about Munson asked Tom He is evidently on his way here to tell his confederates about us He won t know what has happened to us said mister Jenks and he won t see anything of us I guess we re safe enough Through the dark passage they followed Bill Renshaw until he came to a halt in a place that suddenly widened and broadened into a good sized cave Here s your stopping place said the former ghost Now if you follow that passage off to the left and he pointed to it you ll come to the larger part of the cave where the diamond makers are But go cautiously and don t make any noise I won t be responsible for what happens We ll take all the risk interrupted Tom All right Now there s a couple of lanterns around here I ll light them and leave you for a while until I can get some grub I ll be back as soon as I can He glided away after lighting two lanterns by the gleams of which the adventurers could see that they were in a vaulted cavern that had evidently been fitted up as a living apartment The sides roof and floor were of stone It was clean and the air was fresh There were some chairs a table and several cots with pieces of bagging for bedding though it was warm in the place I guess we can stay here until we discover the secret spoke Tom Bless my watch We can if we have something to eat came from mister Damon with something like a sigh I m hungry And I want to make some observations said mister Parker From what I have seen of this mountain I would not be surprised if this cave was to be suddenly destroyed by a landslide or a lightning bolt I will make some further investigations Well if it s going to cause you to make such gloomy prophecies as that I d just as soon you wouldn t look any further spoke Tom in a low voice But mister Parker taking one of the lanterns set about examining the rock of which the cave consisted In a short time Bill Renshaw returned with enough food to last for two days He said he was going out on the mountain once more to act the part of a lookout and would visit the adventurers again the next day In the meanwhile you can do just as you please he said Nobody is likely to disturb you here and you can sneak up and take a look at the men in the other cave whenever you re ready Only be careful that s all I ve got to say They re desperate men It was not very pleasant eating in the gloomy cavern but they made the best of it They cooked on a small oil stove they found in the place and after some hot coffee they felt much better Well remarked Tom after a while shall we take a chance and go look at the men at work I think so answered mister Jenks The sooner we discover this mystery the better Then we can go back home And recover my airship added Tom who was a bit uneasy regarding the safety of the Red Cloud Then bless my finger rings let s go and see if we can find the big cave your friend the ghost told us of suggested mister Damon Cautiously they made their way along the passage Bill had pointed out As they went forward the subdued noise became louder and finally they could feel the vibration of machinery This is the place whispered mister Jenks That sound we hear is one of the mixing machines for grinding the materials carbon and the other substances which go to make up the diamonds I remember hearing that when I was in the cave before Then we must be near the place observed Tom Yes but I didn t have much chance to look around when I was here before They wouldn t let me I never even knew of the small cave Bill took us to Well if we re close to it we d better go cautiously and not talk any more than we re obliged to suggested mister Parker and they agreed that this was good advice They walked on softly Suddenly Tom who was in the lead saw a gleam of light We re here he whispered I ll put out our lantern now which he did Then stealing forward he and the others beheld a curious sight The tunnel they were in ended at a small hole which opened into a large cavern and fortunately this opening was concealed from the view of those in the main place The diamond makers whispered Tom hoarsely pointing to several men grouped about a number of strange machines Yes the very place where I was answered mister Jenks and there is the apparatus the steel box from which the diamonds are taken now to see how they make them Fascinated the adventurers looked into the cave The men there were unaware of the presence of our friends and were busily engaged Some attended to the grinding machine the roar and clatter of which made it possible for Tom and the others to talk and move about without being overheard Into this machine certain ingredients were put and they were then pulverized and taken out in powdery form The power to run the mixing machine was a gasoline motor which chug chugged away in one corner of the cave As the powder was taken out other men fashioned it into small balls which were put on pan and into a sort of oven that was heated by a gasoline stove Is that how they make the diamonds asked mister Damon That is evidently the first step said mister Jenks Those balls of powdered chemicals are partly baked and then they are put into the steel box In some way terrific heat and pressure are applied and the diamonds are made But how the heat and pressure are obtained is what we have yet to learn He paused to watch the men at work They were all busy some attending to the machines and others coming and going in and out of the cave In one part a man was apparently getting ready a meal Suddenly there rushed into the cave a man who seemed much excited Are you nearly ready with that stuff he cried There s a good storm gathering on the mountain Yes we ll be ready in half an hour answered one of the men at the mixing machine Good It will be flashing lightning bolts then and we can see what luck we have The last batch was a failure The man hurried out again mister Parker touched Tom and mister Jenks on their shoulders What is it asked Tom I know the secret of making the diamonds said the scientist What cried mister Jenks It is by the awful power of the lightning bolts whispered mister Parker Everything is explained now the reason why they make diamonds in this lonely place near the top of the mountain They need a place where the lightning is powerful I can understand it now I suspected it before They make diamonds by lightning Are you sure cried mister Jenks Positive I agree with you said Tom Swift I was just getting on that track myself when I saw the electric wires running to the steel box That explains the upright rod on the top of the mountain The man says a storm is coming very well we ll stay here and watch them make diamonds As he spoke there came the mutter of thunder and the mountain vibrated slightly The men in the cave redoubled their activity Tom and his friends felt that the secret process they had so long sought was about to be demonstrated before their eyes CHAPTER XXI FLASHING GEMS Eagerly the adventurers looked through the opening at the end of the passage into the larger cave The men opened the small oven in which the balls of white chemicals and carbon mixed had been baked and a pile of things that looked like irregularly shaped marbles were placed in the steel box This box which was about the size of a trunk was of massive metal It was placed in a recess in the solid rock and all about were layers of asbestos and other substances that were nonconductors of heat That box becomes red hot exclaimed mister Jenks in a whisper When things are in readiness that lever is pulled and the diamonds are made I pulled it once but I did not then know the process involved I supposed that the lightning had nothing to do with making the diamonds It has a most important part said mister Parker The hidden adventurers could talk in perfect safety now for the men in the large cave were too excited to pay much attention to them The muttering of the thunder grew louder and at times a particularly loud crash told that a bolt had struck somewhere in the vicinity of the cave But bless my watch charm exclaimed mister Damon I didn t know lightning made diamonds It does not always went on the scientist But great heat and pressure are necessary to create the gems In nature this was probably obtained by prehistoric volcanic fires and by the terrific pressure of immense rocks It is possible to make diamonds in the laboratory of the chemist but they are so minute as to be practically valueless However these men seem to have hit upon a new plan They utilize the terrific heat of lightning and the pressure which is instantaneously obtained when the bolt strikes I am anxious to see how it is done Look I think they are getting ready to make the gems Indeed there seemed to be an air of expectancy among the diamond makers The mixing machine had now been stopped and as it was more quiet in the cave our friends in their hiding place had to speak in mere whispers All the men were now gathered about the great steel box This receptacle had been closed by a solid metal door which was screwed and clamped tight Then one of the men examined a number of heavily insulated electric wires that extended from the box off into the darkness where Tom and his companions could not discern them That s Folwell the man I befriended and who got me into this game whispered mister Jenks He was also one of the first to turn against me I think he s one of the leaders Folwell came back after having gone into a dark part of the cave He went over to an electrical switch on one of the stone walls It s almost time Tom heard him say to his confederates The storm is coming up rapidly Will it be severe enough asked one of the helpers We had all our work for nothing last time The flashes weren t heavy enough These will be asserted Folwell The indicator shows nearly a million volts now and it s increasing A million volts exclaimed Tom I hope it doesn t strike anywhere around here Oh it will probably be harmlessly conducted down on the heavy wires said mister Parker We are in no danger at present though ultimately I expect to see the whole mountain shattered by a lightning bolt Cheerful prospect murmured Tom There was a terrific crash outside The rocky floor of the cave trembled Here she comes cried Folwell Get back everybody I m going to throw over the switch now The men retreated well away from the steel box Folwell threw over the lever the same one mister Jenks remembered pulling Then the man ran to the electric switch on the wall and snapped that into place establishing a connection There was a moment s pause as Folwell ran to join the others in their place of safety Then from without there came a most nerve racking and terrifying crash It seemed as if the very mountain would be rent into fragments Watching with eager eyes the adventurers saw sparks flash from the steel box Instantly it became red hot and then glowed white and incandescent It was almost at the melting point Then came comparative quiet as the echoes of the thunder died away amid the mountain peaks I guess that did the trick cried Folwell It was a terrific crash all right He and the others ran forward The steel box was now a cherry red for it was cooling Folwell threw back the lever and another man disconnected the switch There was a period of waiting until the box was cool enough to open Then the heavy door was swung back With a long iron rod Folwell drew something from the retort It was the tray which had held the white balls But they were white no longer for they had been turned into diamonds From their hiding place Tom and the others could see the flashing gems for in spite of the fact that the diamonds were uncut some of them sparkled most brilliantly due to the peculiar manner in which they were made We have the secret of the diamonds whispered mister Jenks There must be a quart of the gems there The men gathered about Folwell uttering exclamations of delight The diamonds were too hot to handle yet That s going some exclaimed the chief of the diamond makers We have a small fortune here The was a sudden commotion at one end of the cave A man rushed in At the sight of him Tom stared and uttered an exclamation Munson the stowaway he whispered Hello cried Folwell as he saw his confederate I thought you were East keeping Jenks away from here He got the best of me cried Munson he and that Tom Swift I stowed away on their airship but they found me out by a wireless message and marooned me in the woods I ve been trying to get here ever since Didn t you get my messages of warning No what warnings cried Folwell About Jenks Tom Swift and the others They re here they must be on Phantom Mountain now In fact I shouldn t be surprised if they were in this cave I traced them to their camp but they re gone They may be among us now in some of the secret recesses For an instant Folwell stared at the bearer of these tidings Then he cried out Scatter men and find these fellows We must get them before they discover our secret It s too late we know it exulted Tom Swift Then he whispered to the others to hurry to the part of the cave where Bill Renshaw had first hidden them CHAPTER XXII PRISONERS Do you think there is any danger of them finding us asked mister Damon as he hurried along beside Tom I m afraid so was the answer I ve been worried ever since we saw Munson heading this way But we couldn t do any differently Perhaps Bill Renshaw may be able to conceal us suggested mister Jenks Very likely he knows that Munson is on hand Perhaps we will be safe for a while I want to make a few more observations as to how they manufacture the diamonds and then with what I already know I ll have the secret And I d like to make some scientific tests of the sides and bottom rocks of the cave spoke mister Parker I think it will bear out my theory that the mountain will soon be destroyed Well you were right about Earthquake Island and you may be right about this mountain said Tom but if it is going to be annihilated I hope we get far enough away from it We can keep our presence here a secret for a few more days I think that will be long enough proceeded mister Jenks Then we will leave And in the meanwhile they ll be searching for us objected mister Damon I wish that ghost chap would come back and tell us what to do Bless my liver pin but we are going to be in considerable danger I m afraid Those men may capture us and decide to make diamond dust from us Come on hurry to the little cave urged Tom Then we ll get ready to defend ourselves The main cave is a large one said mister Jenks and there are many hiding places in it In fact it is so large that it will take those fellows several days to complete a circuit of it By that time Bill Renshaw may come back and take us to some place in which they have already searched for us Then we ll be comparatively safe This thought was some consolation to them as they made their way through the dark passage dimly illuminated by the lantern they had rekindled to the place where Bill had hidden them They found things as they had left them and proceeded to get a meal though Tom said it would be best not to cook anything or even to make coffee for fear the odors would enable the searchers to trail them So they ate cold food glad to get that Silently they sat about the dimly lighted cavern and discussed the situation True they might even now retreat going out of the entrance Bill had showed them and so escape But mister Jenks felt that his mission was not completed yet and they all agreed to stay with him For there are several points about making diamonds that are not quite clear to me he said I need to know how that steel box is constructed how the electrical switches are arranged what kind of lightning rods they use and how they regulate the pressure The other things and how to mix the ingredients I already know Then we ll do our best to help you promised Tom But now I think we had better see what sort of a defense we can put up We have our guns and revolvers and with these chairs and tables we can build a sort of barricade behind which we can take refuge if those fellows do discover our hiding place This was conceded to be a good idea and soon a rude sort of fort was made behind which the adventurers could take their stand and fight if necessary though they hoped this would not come to pass They remained quietly in the cave the remainder of that day and when it was night as they could tell by their timepieces there was no daylight they divided the hours into watches taking turns standing guard Morning at least in point of time came without any disturbance and they made a cold breakfast They hoped that Bill Renshaw would come but he did not appear After sitting in the dark cave until afternoon Tom said I think we might as well go and take another observation of the big cave We can tell what the men are doing then for they don t seem to have been near us Maybe they have given up the search for us and we can see them at work and mister Jenks can gain what further knowledge he needs That will be a good plan agreed the diamond man It s maddening to sit here doing nothing And it will be comparatively safe to go from here to our former post of observation added Tom for there doesn t seem to be any opening along the tunnel into the larger cave except the place where we were Accordingly they started off Cautiously they looked through the opening into the apartment where they had seen the diamonds made There s not a soul here exclaimed Tom in a whisper The others looked The place was deserted the machinery silent mister Jenks peered in for a moment and then exclaimed I m going in Now s my chance to find out all that I wish to know It may never come again and then we can soon leave Phantom Mountain It was a daring plan but it seemed to be the best one to follow They were all tired of inactivity mister Jenks managed to get through the opening and dropped into the big cave The others followed mister Jenks hurried over to the steel box and began an examination of it Tom Swift was looking at the electrical switch He saw how it was constructed mister Damon and mister Parker were peering interestedly about Suddenly the sound of voices was heard and the echo of footsteps mister Jenks started They re coming back he whispered hoarsely Run They all turned and sped toward their hiding place But they were too late An instant later Folwell Munson and the other diamond makers confronted them Our friends made a bold rush but were caught before they could go ten feet We have them cried Munson They walked right into our hands It was true Tom Swift and the others were the prisoners of the diamond makers CHAPTER XXIII BROKEN BONDS Well remarked Tom Swift in mournful tones this looks as if we were up against it doesn t it Bless my umbrella it certainly does agreed mister Damon And it s all my fault said mister Jenks I shouldn t have gone into the big cave I might have known those men would come back any time The above conversation took place as our friends lay securely bound in a small cave or recess opening from the larger cavern where about an hour before they had been captured and made prisoners by the diamond makers Despite their struggles they had been overpowered and bound being carried to the cave where they were laid in a row on some old bags It certainly is a most unpleasant situation to say the least observed mister Parker And all my fault repeated mister Jenks Oh no it isn t declared Tom Swift quickly We were just as ready to follow you into that cave as you were to go No one could tell that the men would return so soon It s nobody s fault It s just our bad luck From where he lay tied hand and foot the young inventor could look out into the cave where he and the others had been caught The diamond makers were busily engaged apparently in getting ready to manufacture another batch of the precious stones They paid little attention to their captives save to warn them when they had first been taken into the little cave that it was useless to try to escape They needn t have told us that observed Tom as he and the others were talking over their situation in low voices I don t believe any one could loosen these ropes They certainly are pretty tight agreed mister Damon I ve been tugging and straining at mine for the last half hour and all I ve succeeded in doing is to make the cords cut into my flesh Better give it up advised mister Jenks We ll just have to wait For what the scientist wanted to know To see what they ll do with us They can t keep us here forever They ll have to let us go some time Following their capture Folwell and Munson the latter the stowaway of the airship had been in earnest conversation regarding our friends but what conclusion they had reached the adventurers could only guess And we didn t have time to examine the diamond making machinery close enough so that we could duplicate it if necessary complained Tom a little later No agreed mister Jenks There are certain things about it that are not clear to me Well I don t believe I ll have another chance to inspect it They ll take good care of that though they seem to be getting ready to make more diamonds Perhaps they re going to manufacture a big batch and then leave this place suggested mister Damon They will probably go to some other secret cave and leave us here I hope they untie us before they leave and give us something to eat remarked the young inventor For two hours longer the captives lay there in most uncomfortable positions Then Folwell and Munson leaving the group of diamond makers who were grouped about the machinery approached the captives Well remarked Munson we got ahead of you after all didn t we You thought you had our secret but it will be a long while before you ever make diamonds What are you going to do with us asked Tom Never mind You came where you had no right to and you must take the consequences We did have a right to come here exclaimed mister Jenks I am entitled to know how the diamonds are made I paid for the information and you tricked me If ever it s possible I ll have the whole gang arrested for swindling You ll never get the chance declared Folwell You were given some diamonds for the money you invested and that makes us square No it doesn t declared mister Jenks I invested the money to learn how to make diamonds and you know it You tricked me and I had a right to try to discover your secret I nearly have it too and I ll get it completely before I m done with you No you won t boasted Folwell But we didn t come here to tell you that We came to give you something to eat We re not savages and we ll treat you as well as we can in spite of the fact that you are trespassers We re going to give you some grub but I warn you that any attempt to escape will mean that some of you will get hurt He signalled to some of his confederates These men unbound the captives arms and stood over them while they ate some coarse food that was brought into the small cave They were given coffee to drink and then when the simple meal was over they were securely bound again and left to themselves while the diamond makers went back to their machinery It was evident that they were going to attempt a big operation for an unusually large quantity of the white stuff was prepared The prisoners watched them idly They could see some but not all of the operations In this way several hours passed Gloom possessed the hearts of Tom and his friends Not only had their expedition been almost a failure so far but the young inventor was worried lest the gang might discover and wreck his airship This would prove a serious loss Lying there in the semi darkness the lad imagined all sorts of unpleasant happenings At times he dozed off as did the others They had become somewhat used to the pain caused by the bonds for their nerves were numb from the strain and pressure Once as he was lightly sleeping Tom was awakened by hearing loud voices in the main cave He looked out rolling over slightly to get a better view He saw the man who once before had run in to give news of an approaching electrical storm Are you fellows all ready asked this same man again Yes Is there another storm coming Yes and it s going to be a corker was the reply It s one of the worst I ve ever seen It s sweeping right up the valley It ll be here in an hour That s good We need a big flash to make all the material we have prepared into diamonds It s the biggest batch we ever tried I hope it succeeds for we re going to leave The rest was in so low a tone that Tom could not catch it The storm messenger departed Folwell and Munson busied themselves about the machinery Tom dozed off again dimly wondering what had become of Bill Renshaw and whether the former ghost knew of their plight The others were asleep as the young inventor saw by the dim light of a lantern in the cave Then he too shut his eyes Tom was suddenly awakened by feeling some one s hands moving about his clothing At first he thought it was one of the diamond making gang who had sneaked in to rob him Here What are you up to exclaimed Tom Quiet cautioned a voice Are you all here All of us yes But who are you Easy keep quiet Tom Swift I m Bill Renshaw I ve been searching all over for you since I got back to your cave and found it empty Now I m going to free you I got in here by a secret entrance Wait I ll cut your ropes There was a slight sound and an instant later Tom was freed from his bonds CHAPTER XXIV IN GREAT PERIL The young inventor could scarcely believe the good luck that had so unexpectedly come to him and his companions No sooner was Tom able to move freely about than Bill Renshaw performed the same service for mister Jenks and the others cautioning them to be quiet as he awakened them and cut the ropes Bless my circulation exclaimed mister Damon in a hoarse whisper How did you ever get here I d given ourselves up for lost Oh I came in off the mountain as there s a big storm due explained the man There was no need of me playing the haunt in daytime anyhow I went to the cave found you and your things gone and I surmised that you might have walked into some trap We did admitted mister Jenks grimly Well I hunted around until I found you went on Bill This mountain is honeycombed with caves all opening from the large one I know them better than these fellows do so I could explore freely and keep out of their sight They didn t know that there was a second entrance to this place but I did and I made for it when I couldn t find you in some of the other caves where I looked And sure enough here you were Well we can t thank you enough said mister Parker But you say there is a big storm coming One of the biggest that s been around these parts in some time replied Bill Then perhaps the mountain will be destroyed went on the scientist as calmly as if he had remarked that it might rain I hope nothing like that happens until we get away spoke mister Damon fervently What had we better do inquired Tom Get away unless you want to discover some more of their secrets advised Bill Those fellows are planning something but I can t find out what it is They are suspicious of me I think But they are up to something and I believe it would be best for you to leave while you have the chance It may not be healthy to stay That s why I did my best to untie you We appreciate what you have done declared mister Jenks but I want my rights I must learn a few more facts about how to make diamonds from lightning flashes and then I will have the same secret they cheated me out of I think if we wait a while we may be able to see the parts of the process that are not quite clear to us What do you say Tom Swift Well I would like to learn the secret replied the lad and if Bill thinks it s safe to stay here a while longer Oh I guess it will be safe enough was the reply Those fellows won t bother about you now that they are about to make some more diamonds Besides they think you re all tied up Yes you can stay here and watch I reckon I ve got a couple of guns and Then we ll stay decided Tom We can put up a better fight now Silently in their prison but which they could now leave whenever they pleased the adventurers watched the diamond makers once more The same process they had witnessed before was gone through with The white balls were put inside the steel box and sealed up Then they waited for the storm to reach its height That this would not be long was evidenced by the mutterings of thunder which every moment grew louder The outburst of electrical fury was likely to take place momentarily and that it would be unusually severe was shown by the precautions taken by the diamond makers They attached a number of extra wires and brought out some insulated hard rubber platforms on which they themselves stood Tom and mister Jenks were much interested in watching this detail of the work and sought to learn how each part of the process was done I almost think we can make diamonds Tom when we get back to civilization whispered mister Jenks I hope we can answered Tom and we can t get back any too soon to suit me I want to be in my airship again I don t blame you But look they are getting ready to adjust the switch The adventurers ceased their whispered talk and eagerly watched the diamond makers Folwell and Munson were hurrying to and fro in the big cave attending to the adjustments of the machinery On your insulated plates all of you Folwell gave the order This is going to be a terrific storm The gage shows twice the power we have ever used and it s creeping up every minute We ll have more diamonds than ever had before Yes if the mountain isn t destroyed added mister Parker in a low voice I predict that it will be split from top to bottom Comforting thought Tom grimly I guess we re all ready said Folwell in a low tone to Munson We d better get insulated ourselves I m going to throw the switch He did so A moment later the man who had before given warning of the storm came dashing in He was very much excited It s awful he cried The lightning is striking all over Big rocks are being split like logs of wood Well it can t do any damage in here said Munson We are well protected Get on one of the plates and he motioned to one of the hard rubber platforms that was not occupied The roar and rumble of the storm outside had given place to short terrific crashes In their small cave the adventurers could feel the solid ground shake A bluish light began dancing about the electrical wires There was a smell of sulphur in the air Crash after crash resounded outside A flash of flame lit up the whole interior of the cave It came from the copper switch Something s wrong with the insulation cried Munson Don t go near it yelled Folwell If you value your life stand still Hardly had he spoken than inside the cavern there sounded a report like that of a small cannon A big ball of fire danced about the middle of the cave and then leaped on top of the steel box This is a fearful storm cried Munson The adventurers in the cave did not know what to say or do They were in deadly peril Suddenly there came a crash louder than any that had preceded it The whole side of the cave where the switches were was a mass of bluish flame Then came a ripping tearing sound and a tangle of wires and copper connections were thrown to the floor At the same time the steel box containing the materials from which diamonds were made turned blue and flames shot from it It s all up with us cried Munson Run for it everybody The wires are down and this place will be an electric furnace in another minute He leaped toward the exit from the cave What about those fellows asked Folwell indicating the place where Tom and the others had been tied They ll have to do the best they can It s every man for himself now yelled Munson There was a wild scramble from the cavern Come on cried Tom We must escape It s our only chance He leaped into the big cave followed by the others Already long tongues of electrical fire were shooting out from the walls and roof as Tom Swift and his companions evading them as best they could sought safety in flight CHAPTER XXV THE MOUNTAIN SHATTERED CONCLUSION Can t we get some of the diamonds cried mister Damon as he raced along behind Tom Now s our chance 
7320-287379-0001	train-other-500	Those fellows have all gone The odd man made a grab for something as he ran It s as much as our lives are worth declared the young inventor We dare not stop Come on I d like to investigate some of the machinery
7320-287379-0002	train-other-500	spoke mister Jenks but I wouldn t stop even for that The storm is too dangerous called Bill Renshaw I can show you a shorter way out
none	none	 than the one those fellows have taken Follow me 
7320-287379-0003	train-other-500	No way can be too short said mister Parker solemnly This mountain will go to pieces shortly I think Tom shuddered He remembered how narrow had been their escape when Earthquake Island sank into the sea And that
7320-287379-0004	train-other-500	some terrific upheaval was now imminent might be judged from the awful reports that sounded more plainly as the adventurers raced toward the opening of the cave It was like the bombardment of some doomed city
7320-287379-0005	train-other-500	mister Jenks and Tom cast one longing look behind at the complicated and expensive machinery that had been installed in the cave by the diamond makers They had abandoned it and in it lay the secret of making precious gems
7320-287379-0006	train-other-500	But there was no time to stop now and investigate This way urged Bill Renshaw We ll soon be out But won t it be dangerous to go outside asked mister Damon Shan t we be struck by lightning There is some protection in here None at all
7320-287379-0007	train-other-500	said mister Parker quickly This mountain is a natural lightning rod To stay here in this cave will be sure death when the storm gets directly over it And that will be very soon We must get on insulated ground
none	none	 Is there any part of this mountain 
7320-287379-0008	train-other-500	that does not contain iron ore the scientist asked of the former spirit Yes
none	none	 the way out by which we are going lands on a dirt hill 
7320-287379-0009	train-other-500	That s good then we may be saved On they ran They had no lanterns but the blue light of the electricity as it leaped from point to point inside the cave
none	none	 where there were 
7320-287379-0010	train-other-500	outcroppings of iron ore made the place bright enough to see Here we are cried Bill Renshaw at length Here s the way out Making a sudden turn in the winding passage he showed the adventurers a small opening
7320-287379-0011	train-other-500	in the side of the crag In an instant they had passed through and found themselves in daylight once more The sudden glare almost blinded them for though the sky was overcast by clouds
7320-287379-0012	train-other-500	from which jagged tongues of lightning played the outside was much lighter than the dark cave I should say it was a storm cried Tom Swift See it is striking every minute and all around us
7320-287379-0013	train-other-500	In fact lightning bolts were falling on every side of the adventurers Every time the balls of fire struck they burst open great stones or seared a livid scar on the face of some cliff
7320-287379-0014	train-other-500	As for Tom and the others they stood on a dry dirt hill in which fortunately there was no iron ore To this fact they undoubtedly owed their lives though had there been rain to moisten the ground and make the earth a good conductor of electricity
7320-287379-0015	train-other-500	they probably would have been badly shocked But the electrical outburst was not accompanied by rain Tom looked up He saw a compact mass of cloud moving
7320-287379-0016	train-other-500	toward the summit of the mountain on the slope of which they stood From this cloud there played shafts of reddish green fire Look called the young inventor to mister Parker
none	none	 The instant the latter saw the cloud he cried We must get away from here by all means 
7320-287379-0017	train-other-500	That is the center of the storm As soon as it gets over the mountain where that lightning rod is all the electrical fluid will be discharged in one bolt at the mountain and it will be destroyed We must run
7320-287379-0018	train-other-500	but keep on the dirt places Run for your lives They needed no second warning Turning they fled down the steep side of the mountain slipping and stumbling but taking care not to step on any iron ore
7320-287379-0019	train-other-500	Behind them flashed the lightning bolts Suddenly there was a most awful crash It seemed as if the end of the world had come and the ear drums of Tom and his companion almost burst with the fearful report
none	none	 The concussion knocked them down 
7320-287379-0020	train-other-500	and they lay stunned for a moment Following the terrible report there was a low rumbling sound Hardly knowing whether he was dead or alive Tom opened his eyes and looked about him What he saw
7320-287379-0021	train-other-500	caused him to cry out in terror The whole mountain seemed bathed in fire
none	none	 Great blue red and green flashes played around it 
7320-287379-0022	train-other-500	Then the towering cliff seemed to melt and crumble up and the great peak the top of it containing the diamond makers cave from which they had fled but a few minutes before the entire summit was toppled over into the valley on the other side
7320-287379-0023	train-other-500	and in the direction opposite to that where the adventurers stood Then came a profound silence and the lightning ceased The storm was over and only the rattle of stones and boulders as they came to rest in the valley below
7320-287379-0024	train-other-500	reached the ears of our friends Phantom Mountain has been destroyed just as I said it would be spoke mister Parker solemnly Once more he had prophesied correctly
none	none	 For a few minutes the adventurers hardly knew what to say They arose awkwardly from the ground where the shock had tossed them 
7320-287379-0025	train-other-500	Then Tom remarked as calmly as possible Well it s all over I guess we may as well get back to our airship What became of Munson and the others asked mister Damon mister Jenks pointed to the trail far below
7320-287379-0026	train-other-500	The figures of some men running madly could be seen There they go he said I fancy we have seen the last of them And they had for some time at least There was little use lingering any longer on Phantom Mountain indeed
7320-287379-0027	train-other-500	little of it was left on which to remain Looking back toward the place where the cave had been Tom and the others started forward again The diamond making machinery had all been destroyed
none	none	 So also had the finished diamonds stored in the cavern and the large supply which had probably been made by the last terrific crash 
7320-287379-0028	train-other-500	No one would ever have them now Tom and mister Jenks felt a sense of disappointment but they were glad to have escaped with their lives
7320-287379-0029	train-other-500	They sought their former camp but the tent and all their food was buried under tons of earth and rocks Three days later after rather severe hardships
none	none	 they were near the place where they had left the Red Cloud They had suffered cold and hunger 
7320-287379-0030	train-other-500	for they had no food supplies and had it not been that Bill Renshaw knew the haunts of some game of which they managed to snare some they would have fared badly for they had left their guns in the cave
7320-287379-0031	train-other-500	Well there are the trees behind which I hope my airship is hidden announced Tom as they came to the spot Good old Red Cloud
none	none	 Maybe we won t do some eating when we get aboard eh Bless my appetite but we certainly will cried mister Damon 
7320-287379-0032	train-other-500	There s somebody walking around the place spoke mister Jenks I hope it s no one who has damaged the ship came from Tom apprehensively
7320-287379-0033	train-other-500	He broke into a run and soon confronted an aged miner who seemed to have established a rude sort of camp near the airship Is anything the matter asked Tom breathlessly Is my airship all right
none	none	 I guess she s all right stranger was the reply I don t know much about these contraptions but I haven t touched her I knowed she was an airship for I ve seen pictures of em 
7320-287379-0034	train-other-500	and I ve been waiting until the owner came along Why asked Tom wonderingly Because I ve got a proposition to make to you went on the miner
none	none	 who said his name was Abe Abercrombie I ve been a miner for a good many years 
7320-287379-0035	train-other-500	and I m just back from Alaska prospecting around here I haven t had any luck but I know of a gold mine in Alaska that will make us all rich Only it needs an airship to get to it and I ve been figuring how to hire one Then I comes along
7320-287379-0036	train-other-500	and I sees this big one and I makes up my mind to stay here until the owners come back That s what I ve done Now if I prove that I m telling the truth will you go to Alaska to the valley of gold with me I don t know answered Tom
7320-287379-0037	train-other-500	to whom the proposition was rather sudden We ve just had some pretty startling adventures and we re almost starved Wait until we get something to eat and we ll talk Come aboard the Red Cloud and the lad led the way to his craft
none	none	 which was in as good condition 
7320-287379-0038	train-other-500	as when he left it to go to the diamond cave
none	none	 Later he listened to the miner s story Tom Swift did go to the valley of gold in Alaska and what happened to him and his companions there will be told of in the next volume of this series to be called Tom Swift in the Caves of Ice or the Wreck of the Airship It did not take our friends long after they had eaten a hearty meal to generate some fresh gas and start the Red Cloud on her homeward way Tom wanted to take Bill Renshaw with him but the old man said he would rather remain among the mountains where he had been born So after paying him well for his services they said good by to him Abercrombie the miner also remained behind but promised to call and see Tom in a few months Well we didn t make any money out of this trip observed mister Jenks rather dubiously as they were nearing Shopton after an uneventful trip I guess I owe you considerable Tom Swift I promised to get you a lot of diamonds but all I have are those I had from my first visit to the cave Oh that s all right spoke Tom easily The experience was worth all the trip cost Speaking of diamonds look here exclaimed mister Damon suddenly and he pulled out a double handful Where did you get them cried the others in astonishment I grabbed them up as we ran from the cave said the eccentric man but bless my gaiters I forgot all about them until you spoke We ll share them These diamonds some of which were large proved very valuable though the total sum was far below what mister Jenks hoped to make when he started on the remarkable trip Tom gave Mary Nestor a very fine stone and it was set in a ring instead of a pin this time On their arrival in Shopton where mister Swift the housekeeper mister Jackson and Eradicate Sampson were much alarmed for Tom s safety an attempt was made to manufacture diamonds using a powerful electric current instead of lightning But it was not a success and so mister Jenks concluded to give up his search for the secret which was lost on Phantom Mountain And now we will take leave of Tom Swift to meet him again soon in other adventures he is destined to have in the caves of ice and the valley of gold THE END THE TOM SWIFT SERIES By VICTOR APPLETON TOM SWIFT
