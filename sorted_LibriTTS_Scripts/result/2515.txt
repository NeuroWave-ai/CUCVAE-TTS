about two million dollars for each hour we work The time it takes us a rather conservative estimate is fifty hours to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright searched and analyzed the copyright letters written et cetera This projected audience is one hundred million readers If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce two dollars million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty six text files per month or four hundred thirty two more Etexts in nineteen ninety nine for a total of two thousand If these reach just ten of the computerized population then the total should reach over two hundred billion Etexts given away this year The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext Files by December thirty one two thousand one ten thousand x one hundred million one Trillion This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers which is only five of the present number of computer users At our revised rates of production we will reach only one third of that goal by the end of two thousand one or about three thousand three hundred thirty three Etexts unless we manage to get some real funding currently our funding is mostly from Michael Hart s salary at Carnegie Mellon University and an assortment of sporadic gifts this salary is only good for a few more years so we are looking for something to replace

SMALL PRINT FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS Ver four point twenty nine ninety three END STEPPING HEAVENWARD Chapter one I January fifteen eighteen thirty one How dreadfully old I am getting Sixteen Well I don t see as I can help it There it is in the big Bible in father s own hand Katherine born Jan fifteen eighteen fifteen I meant to get up early this morning but it looked dismally cold out of doors and felt delightfully warm in bed So I covered myself up and made ever so many good resolutions I determined in the first place to begin this Journal To be sure I have begun half a dozen and got tired of them after a while Not tired of writing them but disgusted with what I had to say of myself But this time I mean to go on in spite of everything It will do me good to read it over and see what a creature I am Then I resolved to do more to please mother than I have done And I determined to make one more effort to conquer my hasty temper I thought too I would be self denying this winter like the people one reads about in books I fancied how surprised and pleased everybody would be to see me so much improved Time passed quickly amid these agreeable thoughts and I was quite startled to hear the bell ring for prayers I jumped up in a great flurry and dressed as quickly as I could Everything conspired together to plague me I could not find a clean collar or a handkerchief It is always just so Susan is forever poking my things into out of the way places When at last I went down they were all at breakfast I hoped you would celebrate your birthday dear by coming down in good season said mother I do hate to be found fault with so I fired up in an instant If people hide my things so that I can t find them of course I have to be late I said And I rather think I said it in a very cross way for mother sighed a little I wish mother wouldn t sigh I would rather be called names out and out The moment breakfast was over I had to hurry off to school Just as I was going out mother said Have you your overshoes dear
4899_32637_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mother 
none	none	don t hinder me I shall be late I said I don t need overshoes It snowed all night and I think you do need them mother said I don t know where they are I hate overshoes Do let me go mother I cried I do wish I could ever have my own way You shall have it now my child mother said and went away Now what was the use of her calling me my child in such a tone I should like to know I hurried off and just as I got to the door of the schoolroom it flashed into my mind that I had not said my prayers A nice way to begin on one s birthday to be sure Well I had not time And perhaps my good resolutions pleased God almost as much as one of my rambling stupid prayers could For I must own I can t make good prayers I can t think of anything to say I often wonder what mother finds to say when she is shut up by the hour together I had a pretty good time at school My teachers praised me and Amelia seemed so fond of me She brought me a birthday present of a purse that she had knit for me herself and a net for my hair Nets are just coming into fashion It will save a good deal of time my having this one Instead of combing and combing and combing my old hair to get it glossy enough to suit mother I can just give it one twist and one squeeze and the whole thing will be settled for the day Amelia wrote me a dear little note with her presents I do really believe she loves me dearly It is so nice to have people love you When I got home mother called me into her room She looked as if she had been crying She said I gave her a great deal of pain by my self will and ill temper and conceit Conceit I screamed out Oh mother if you only knew how horrid I think I am Mother smiled a little Then she went on with her list till she made me out the worst creature in the world I burst out crying and was running off to my room but she made me come back and hear the rest She said my character would be essentially formed by the time I reached my twentieth year and left it to me to say if I wished to be as a woman what I was now as a girl I felt sulky and would not answer I was shocked to think I had got only four years in which to improve but after all a good deal could be done in that time Of course I don t want to be always exactly what I am now Mother went on to say that I had in me the elements of a fine character if I would only conquer some of my faults You are frank and truthful she said and in some things conscientious I hope you are really a child of God and are trying to please Him And it is my daily prayer that you may become a lovely loving useful woman I made no answer I wanted to say something but my tongue wouldn t move I was angry with mother and angry with myself At last everything came out all in a rush mixed up with such floods of tears that I thought mother s heart would melt and that she would take back what she had said Amelia s mother never talks so to her I said She praises her and tells her what a comfort she is to her But just as I am trying as hard as I can to be good and making resolutions and all that you scold me and discourage me Mother s voice was very soft and gentle as she asked Do you call this scolding my child And I don t like to be called conceited I went on I know I am perfectly horrid and I am just as unhappy as I can be I am very sorry for you dear mother replied But you must bear with me Other people will see your faults but only your mother will have the courage to speak of them Now go to your own room and wipe away the traces of your tears that the rest of the family may not know that you have been crying on your birthday She kissed me but I did not kiss her I really believe Satan himself hindered me I ran across the hall to my room slammed the door and locked myself in I was going to throw myself on the bed and cry till I was sick Then I should look pale and tired and they would all pity me I do like so to be pitied But on the table by the window I saw a beautiful new desk in place of the old clumsy thing I had been spattering and spoiling so many years A little note full of love said it was from mother and begged me to read and reflect upon a few verses of a tastefully bound copy of the Bible which accompanied it every day of my life A few verses she said carefully read and pondered instead of a chapter or two read for mere form s sake I looked at my desk which contained exactly what I wanted plenty of paper seals wax and pens I always use wax Wafers are vulgar Then I opened the Bible at random and lighted on these words Watch therefore for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come There was nothing very cheering in that I felt a real repugnance to be always on the watch thinking I might die at any moment I am sure I am not fit to die Besides I want to have a good time with nothing to worry me I hope I shall live ever so long Perhaps in the course of forty or fifty years I may get tired of this world and want to leave it And I hope by that time I shall be a great deal better than I am now and fit to go to heaven I wrote a note to mother on my new desk and thanked her for it I told her she was the best mother in the world and that I was the worst daughter When it was done I did not like it and so I wrote another Then I went down to dinner and felt better We had such a nice dinner Everything I liked best was on the table Mother had not forgotten one of all the dainties I like Amelia was there too Mother had invited her to give me a little surprise It is bedtime now and I must say my prayers and go to bed I have got all chilled through writing here in the cold I believe I will say my prayers in bed just for this once I do not feel sleepy but I am sure I ought not to sit up another moment JAN thirty Here I am at my desk once more There is a fire in my room and mother is sitting by it reading I can t see what book it is but I have no doubt it is Thomas A Kempis How she can go on reading it so year after year I cannot imagine For my part I like something new But I must go back to where I left off That night when I stopped writing I hurried to bed as fast as I could for I felt cold and tired I remember saying Oh God I am ashamed to pray and then I began to think of all the things that had happened that day and never knew another thing till the rising bell rang and I found it was morning I am sure I did not mean to go to sleep I think now it was wrong for me to be such a coward as to try to say my prayers in bed because of the cold While I was writing I did not once think how I felt Well I jumped up as soon as I heard the bell but found I had a dreadful pain in my side and a cough Susan says I coughed all night I remembered then that I had just such a cough and just such a pain the last time I walked in the snow without overshoes I crept back to bed feeling about as mean as I could Mother sent up to know why I did not come down and I had to own that I was sick She came up directly looking so anxious And here I have been shut up ever since only to day I am sitting up a little Poor mother has had trouble enough with me I know I have been cross and unreasonable and it was all my own fault that I was ill Another time I will do as mother says JAN thirty one How easy it is to make good resolutions and how easy it is to break them Just as I had got so far yesterday mother spoke for the third time about my exerting myself so much And just at that moment I fainted away and she had a great time all alone there with me I did not realize how long I had been writing nor how weak I was I do wonder if I shall ever really learn that mother knows more than I do Feb seventeen It is more than a month since I took that cold and here I still am shut up in the house To be sure the doctor lets me go down stairs but then he won t listen to a word about school Oh dear All the girls will get ahead of me This is Sunday and everybody has gone to church I thought I ought to make a good use of the time while they were gone so I took the Memoir of Henry Martyn and read a little in that I am afraid I am not much like him Then I knelt down and tried to pray But my mind was full of all sorts of things so I thought I would wait till I was in a better frame At noon I disputed with James about the name of an apple He was very provoking and said he was thankful he had not got such a temper as I had I cried and mother reproved him for teasing me saying my ill ness had left me nervous and irritable James replied that it had left me where it found me then I cried a good while lying on the sofa and then I fell asleep I don t see as I am any the better for this Sunday it has only made me feel unhappy and out of sorts I am sure I pray 
4899_32639_000017_000008	train-clean-360	to God 
none	none	to make me better and why doesn t He Feb twenty It has been quite a mild day for the season and the doctor said I might drive out I enjoyed getting the air very much I feel just well as ever and long to get back to school I think God has been very good to me in making me well again and wish I loved Him better But oh I am not sure I do love Him I hate to own it to myself and to write it down here but I will I do not love to pray I am always eager to get it over with and out of the way so as to have leisure to enjoy myself I mean that this is usually so This morning I cried a good deal while I was on my knees and felt sorry for my quick temper and all my bad ways If I always felt so perhaps praying would not be such a task I wish I knew whether anybody exactly as bad as I am ever got to heaven at last I have read ever so many memoirs and they were all about people who were too good to live and so died or else went on a mission I am not at all like any of them

none	none	six I have been so busy that I have not said much to you you poor old journal you have I Somehow I have been behaving quite nicely lately Everything has gone on exactly to my mind Mother has not found fault with me once and father has praised my drawings and seemed proud of me He says he shall not tell me what my teachers say of me lest it should make me vain And once or twice when he has met me singing and frisking about the house he has kissed me and called me his dear little Flibbertigibbet if that s the way to spell it When he says that I know he is very fond of me We are all very happy together when nothing goes wrong In the long evenings we all sit around the table with our books and our work and one of us reads aloud Mother chooses the book and takes her turn in reading She reads beautifully Of course the readings do not begin till the lessons are all learned As to me my lessons just take no time at all I have only to read them over once and there they are So I have a good deal of time to read and I devour all the poetry I can get hold of I would rather read Pollok s Course of Time than read nothing at all APRIL two There are three of mother s friends living near us each having lots of little children It is perfectly ridiculous how much those creatures are sick They send for mother if so much as a pimple comes out on one of their faces When I have children I don t mean to have such goings on I shall be careful about what they eat and keep them from getting cold and they will keep well of their own accord missus Jones has just sent for mother to see her Tommy It was so provoking I had coaxed her into letting me have a black silk apron they are all the fashion now embroidered in floss silk I had drawn a lovely vine for mine entirely out of my own head and mother was going to arrange the pattern for me when that message came and she had to go I don t believe anything ails the child a great chubby thing April three Poor missus Jones Her dear little Tommy is dead I stayed at home from school to day and had all the other children here to get them out of their mother s way How dreadfully she must feel Mother cried when she told me how the dear little fellow suffered in his last moments It reminded her of my little brothers who died in the same way just before I was born Dear mother I wonder I ever forget what troubles she has had and am not always sweet and loving She has gone now where she always goes when she feels sad straight to God Of course she did not say so but I know mother April twenty five I have not been down in season once this week I have persuaded mother to let me read some of Scott s novels and have sat up late and been sleepy in the morning I wish I could get along with mother as nicely as James does He is late far oftener than I am but he never gets into such scrapes about it as I do This is what happens He comes down when it suits him Mother begins James I am very much displeased with you James I should think you would be mother Mother mollified I don t think you deserve any breakfast James hypocritically No I don t think I do mother Then mother hurries off and gets something extra for his breakfast Now let us see how things go on when I am late Mother Katherine she always calls me Katherine when she is displeased and spells it with a K Katherine you are late again how can you annoy your father so Katherine Of course I don t do it to annoy father or anybody else But if I oversleep myself it is not my fault Mother I would go to bed at eight o clock rather than be late as often as you How should you like it if I were not down to prayers Katherine muttering Of course that is very different I don t see why I should be blamed for oversleeping any more than James I get all the scoldings Mother sighs and goes off I prowl round and get what scraps of breakfast I can May twelve The weather is getting perfectly delicious I am sitting with my window open and my bird is singing with all his heart I wish I was as gay as he is I have been thinking lately that it was about time to begin on some of those pieces of self denial I resolved on upon my birthday I could not think of anything great enough for a long time At last an idea popped into my head Half the girls at school envy me because Amelia is so fond of me and Jane Underhill in particular is just crazy to get intimate with her But I have kept Amelia all to myself To day I said to her Amelia Jane Underhill admires you above all things I have a good mind to let you be as intimate with her as you are with me It will be a great piece of self denial but I think it is my duty She is a stranger and nobody seems to like her much You dear thing you cried Amelia kissing me I liked Jane Underhill the moment I saw her She has such a sweet face and such pleasant manners But you are so jealous that I never dared to show how I liked her Don t be vexed dearie if you are jealous it is your only fault She then rushed off and I saw her kiss that girl exactly as she kisses me This was in recess I went to my desk and made believe I was studying Pretty soon Amelia came back She is a sweet girl she said and only to think She writes poetry Just hear this It is a little poem addressed to me Isn t it nice of her I pretended not to hear her I was as full of all sorts of horrid feelings as I could hold It enraged me to think that Amelia after all her professions of love to me should snatch at the first chance of getting a new friend Then I was mortified because I was enraged and I could have torn myself to pieces for being such a fool as to let Amelia see how silly I was I don t know what to make of you Katy she said putting her arms round me Have I done anything to vex you Come let us make up and be friends whatever it is I will read you these sweet verses I am sure you will like them She read them in her clear pleasant voice How can you have the vanity to read such stuff I cried Amelia colored a little You have said and written much more flattering things to me she replied Perhaps it has turned my head and made me too ready to believe what other people say She folded the paper and put it into her pocket We walked home together after school as usual but neither of us spoke a word And now here I sit unhappy enough All my resolutions fail But I did not think Amelia would take me at my word and rush after that stuck up smirking piece May twenty I seem to have got back into all my bad ways again Mother is quite out of patience with me I have not prayed for a long time It does not do any good May twenty one It seems this Underhill thing is here for health though she looks as well as any of us She is an orphan and has been adopted by a rich old uncle who makes a perfect fool of her Such dresses and such finery as she wears Last night she had Amelia there to tea without inviting me though she knows I am her best friend She gave her a bracelet made of her own hair I wonder Amelia s mother lets her accept presents from strangers My mother would not let me On the whole there is nobody like one s own mother Amelia has been cold and distant to me of late but no matter what I do or say to my darling precious mother she is always kind and loving She noticed how I moped about to day and begged me to tell her what was the matter I was ashamed to do that I told her that it was a little quarrel I had had with Amelia Dear child she said how I pity you that you have inherited my quick irritable temper Yours mother I cried out what can you mean Mother smiled a little at my surprise It is even so she said Then how did you cure yourself of it Tell me quick mother and let me cure myself of mine My dear Katy she said I wish I could make you see that God is just as willing and just as able to sanctify as He is to redeem us It would save you so much weary disappointing work But God has opened my eyes at last I wish He would open mine then I said for all I see now is that I am just as horrid as I can be and that the more I pray the worse I grow That is not true dear she replied go on praying pray without ceasing I sat pulling my handkerchief this way and that and at last rolled it up into a ball and threw it across the room I wished I could toss my bad feelings into a corner with it I do wish I could make you love to pray my darling child mother went on If you only knew the strength and the light and the joy you might have for the simple asking God attaches no conditions to His gifts He only says Ask This may be true but it is hard work to pray It tires me And I do wish there was some easy way of growing good In fact I should like to have God send a sweet temper to me just as He sent bread and meat to Elijah I don t believe Elijah had to kneel down and pray for them Chapter two II June one LAST Sunday doctor Cabot preached to the young He first addressed those who knew they did not love God It did not seem to me that I belonged to that class Then he spoke to those who knew they did I felt sure I was not one of those Last of all he spoke affectionately to those who did not know what to think and I was frightened and ashamed to feel tears running down my cheeks when he said that he believed that most of his hearers who were in this doubtful state did really love their Master only their love was something as new and as tender and perhaps as unobserved as the tiny point of green that forcing its way through the earth is yet unconscious of its own existence but promises a thrifty plant I don t suppose I express it very well but I know what he meant He then invited those belonging to each class to meet him on three successive Saturday afternoons I shall certainly go July nineteen I went to the meeting and so did Amelia A great many young people were there and a few children doctor Cabot went about from seat to seat speaking to each one separately When he came to us I expected he would say something about the way in which I had been brought up and reproach me for not profiting more by the instructions and example I had at home Instead of that he said in a cheerful voice Well my dear I cannot see into your heart and positively tell whether there is love to God there or not But I suppose you have come here to day in order to let me help you to find out I said Yes that was all I could get out Let me see then he went on Do you love your mother I said Yes once more But prove to me that you do How do you know it I tried to think Then I said I feel that I love her I love to love her I like to be with her I like to hear people praise her And I try sometimes at least to do things to please her But I don t try half as hard as I ought and I do and say a great many things to displease her Yes yes he said I know Has mother told you I cried out No dear no indeed But I know what human nature is after having one of my own fifty years and six of my children s to encounter Somehow I felt more courage after he said that In the first place then you feel that you love your mother But you never feel that you love your God and Saviour I often try and try but I never do I said Love won t be forced he said quickly Then what shall I do In the second place you like to be with your mother But you never like to be with the Friend who loves you so much better than she does I don t know I never was with Him Sometimes I think that when Mary sat at His feet and heard Him talk she must have been very happy We come to the third test then You like to hear people praise your mother And have you ever rejoiced to hear the Lord magnified I shook my head sorrowfully enough Let us then try the last test You know you love your mother because you try to do things to please her That is to do what you know she wishes you to do Very well Have you never tried to do anything God wishes you to do Oh yes often But not so often as I ought Of course not No one does that But come now why do you try to do what you think will please Him Because it is easy Because you like to do what He likes rather than what you like yourself I tried to think and got puzzled Never mind said doctor Cabot I have come now to the point I was aiming at You cannot prove to yourself that you love God by examining your feelings towards Him They are indefinite and they fluctuate But just as far as you obey Him just so far depend upon it you love Him It is not natural to us sinful ungrateful human beings to prefer His pleasure to our own or to follow His way instead of our own way and nothing nothing but love to Him can or does make us obedient to Him Couldn t we obey Him from fear Amelia now asked She had been listening all this time in silence Yes and so you might obey your mother from fear but only for a season If you had no real love for her you would gradually cease to dread her displeasure whereas it is in the very nature of love to grow stronger and more influential every hour You mean then that if we want to know whether we love God we must find out whether we are obeying Him Amelia asked I mean exactly that He that keepeth my commandments he it is that loveth me But I cannot talk with you any longer now There are many others still waiting You can come to see me some day next week if you have any more questions to ask When we got out into the street Amelia and I got hold of each other s hands We did not speak a word till we reached the door but we knew that we were as good friends as ever I understand all doctor Cabot said Amelia whispered as we separated But I felt like one in a fog I cannot see how it is possible to love God and yet feel as stupid as I do when I think of Him Still I am determined to do one thing and that is to pray regularly instead of now and then as I have got the habit of doing lately July twenty five School has closed for the season I took the first prize for drawing and my composition was read aloud on examination day and everybody praised it Mother could not possibly help showing in her face that she was very much pleased I am pleased myself We are now getting ready to take a journey I do not think I shall go to see doctor Cabot again My head is so full of other things and there is so much to do before we go I am having four new dresses made and I can t imagine how to have them trimmed I mean to run down to Amelia s and ask her July twenty seven I was rushing through the hall just after I wrote that and met mother I am going to Amelia s I said hurrying past her Stop one minute dear doctor Cabot is downstairs He says he has been expecting a visit from you and that as you did not come to him he has come to you I wish he would mind his own business I said I think he is minding it dear mother answered His Master s business is his and that has brought him here Go to him my darling child I am sure you crave something better than prizes and compliments and new dresses and journeys If anybody but mother had said that my heart would have melted at once and I should have gone right down to doctor Cabot to be moulded in his hand to almost any shape But as it was I brushed past ran into my room and locked my door Oh what makes me act so I hate myself for it I don t want to do it Last week I dined with missus Jones Her little Tommy was very fond of me and that I suppose makes her have me there so often Lucy was at the table and very fractious She cried first for one thing and then for another At last her mother in a gentle but very decided way put her down from the table Then she cried louder than ever But when her mother offered to take her back if she would be good she screamed yet more She wanted to come and wouldn t let herself come I almost hated her when I saw her act so and now I am behaving ten times worse and I am just as miserable as I can be July twenty nine Amelia has been here She has had her talk with doctor Cabot and is perfectly happy She says it is so easy to be a Christian It may be easy for her everything is She never has any of my dreadful feelings and does not understand them when I try to explain them to her Well if I am fated to be miserable I must try to bear it Oct three Summer is over school has begun again and I am so busy that I have not much time to think to be low spirited We had a delightful journey and I feel well and bright and even gay I never enjoyed my studies as I do those of this year Everything goes on pleasantly here at home But James has gone away to school and we miss him sadly I wish I had a sister Though I dare say I should quarrel with her if I had Oct twenty three I am so glad that my studies are harder this year as I am never happy except when every moment is occupied However I do not study all the time by any means

none	none	grows more and more fond of me and has me there to dinner or to tea continually She has a much higher opinion of me than mother has and is always saying the sort bf things that make you feel nice She holds me up to Amelia as an example begging her to imitate me in my fidelity about my lessons and declaring there is nothing she so much desires as to have a daughter bright and original like me Amelia only laughs and goes and purrs in her mother s ears when she hears such talk It costs her nothing to be pleasant She was born so For my part I think myself lucky to have such a friend She gets along with my odd hateful ways better than any one else does Mother when I boast of this says she has no penetration into character and that she would be fond of almost any one fond of her and that the fury with which I love her deserves some response I really don t know what to make of mother Most people are proud of their children when they see others admire them but she does say such pokey things Of course I know that having a gift for music and a taste for drawing and a reputation for saying witty bright things isn t enough But when she doesn t find fault with me and nothing happens to keep me down I am the gayest creature on earth I do love to get with a lot of nice girls and carry on I have got enough fun in me to keep a houseful merry And mother needn t say anything I inherited it from her Evening I knew it was coming Mother has been in to see what I was about and to give me a bit of her mind She says she loves to see me gay and cheerful as is natural at my age but that levity quite upsets and disorders the mind indisposing it for serious thoughts But mother I said didn t you carry on when you were a young girl Of course I did she said smiling But I do not think I was quite so thoughtless as you are Thoughtless indeed I wish I were But am I not always full of uneasy reproachful thoughts when the moment of excitement is over Other girls who seem less trifling than I are really more so Their heads are full of dresses and parties and beaux and all that sort of nonsense I wonder if that ever worries their mothers or whether mine is the only one who weeps in secret Well I shall be young but once and while I am do let me have a good time Sunday Nov twenty Oh the difference between this day and the day I wrote that There are no good times in this dreadful world I have hardly courage or strength to write down the history of the past few weeks The day after I had deliberately made up my mind to enjoy myself cost what it might my dear father called me to him kissed me pulled my ears a little and gave me some money We have had to keep you rather low in funds he said laughing But I recovered this amount yesterday and as it was a little debt I had given up I can spare it to you For girls like pin money I know and you may spend this just as you please I was delighted I want to take more drawing lessons but did not feel sure he could afford it Besides I am a little ashamed to write it down I knew somebody had been praising me or father would not have seemed so fond of me I wondered who it was and felt a good deal puffed up After all I said to myself some people like me if I have got my faults I threw my arms around his neck and kissed him though that cost me a great effort I never like to show what I feel But oh how thankful I am for it now As to mother I know father never goes out without kissing her good by I went out with her to take a walk at three o clock We had just reached the corner of Orange Street when I saw a carriage driving slowly towards us it appeared to be full of sailors Then I saw our friend mister Freeman among them When he saw us he jumped out and came up to us I do not know what he said I saw mother turn pale and catch at his arm as if she were afraid of falling But she did not speak a word Oh mister Freeman what is it I cried out Has anything happened to father Is he hurt Where is he He is in the carriage he said We are taking him home He has had a fall Then we went on in silence The sailors were carrying father in as we reached the house They laid him on the sofa we saw his poor head Nov twenty three I will try to write the rest now Father was alive but insensible He had fallen down into the hold of the ship and the sailors heard him groaning there He lived three hours after they brought him home mister Freeman and all our friends were very kind But we like best to be alone we three mother and James and I Poor mother looks twenty years older but she is so patient and so concerned for us and has such a smile of welcome for every one that comes in that it breaks my heart to see her Nov twenty five Mother spoke to me very seriously to day about controlling myself more She said she knew this was my first real sorrow and how hard it was to bear it But that she was afraid I should become insane some time if I indulged myself in such passions of grief And she said too that when friends came to see us full of sympathy and eager to say or do something for our comfort it was our duty to receive them with as much cheerfulness as possible I said they none of them had anything to say that did not provoke me It is always a trying task to visit the afflicted mother said and you make it doubly hard to your friends by putting on a gloomy forbidding air and by refusing to talk of your dear father as if you were resolved to keep your sorrow all to yourself I can t smile when I am so unhappy I said A good many people have been here to day Mother has seen them all though she looked ready to drop missus Bates said to me in her little weak watery voice Your mother is wonderfully sustained dear I hope you feel reconciled to God s will Rebellion is most displeasing to Him dear I made no answer It is very easy for people to preach Let me see how they behave when they their turn to lose their friends missus Morris said this was a very mysterious dispensation But that she was happy to see that Mother was meeting it with so much firmness As for myself she went on I was quite broken down by my dear husband s death I did not eat as much as would feed a bird for nearly a week But some people have so much feeling then again others are so firm Your mother is so busy talking with missus March that I won t interrupt her to say good bye I came prepared to suggest several things that I thought would comfort her but perhaps she has thought of them herself I could have knocked her down Firm indeed Poor mother After they had all gone I made her lie down she looked so tired and worn out Then I could not help telling her what missus Morris had said She only smiled a little but said nothing I wish you would ever flare up mother I said She smiled again and said she had nothing to flare up about Then I shall do it for you I cried To hear that namby pamby woman who is about as capable of understanding you as an old cat talking about your being firm You see what you get by being quiet and patient People would like you much better if you refused to be comforted and wore a sad countenance Dear Katy said mother it is not my first object in life to make people like me By this time she looked so pale that I was frightened Though she is so cheerful and things go on much as they did before I believe she has got her death blow If she has then I hope I have got mine And yet I am not fit to die I wish I was and I wish I could die I have lost all interest in everything and don t care what becomes of me Nov twenty three I believe I shall go crazy unless people stop coming here hurling volleys of texts at mother and at me When soldiers drop wounded on the battle field they are taken up tenderly and carried to the rear which means I suppose out of sight and sound Is anybody mad enough to suppose it will do them any good to hear Scripture quoted sermons launched at them before their open bleeding wounds are staunched Mother assents in a mild way when I talk so and says Yes yes we are indeed lying wounded on the battle field of life and in no condition to listen to any words save those of pity But dear Katy we must interpret aright all the well meant attempts of our friends to comfort us They mean sympathy however awkwardly they express it And then she sighed with a long deep sigh that told how it all wearied her Dec fourteen Mother keeps saying I spend too much time in brooding over my sorrow As for her she seems to live in heaven Not that she has long prosy talks about it but little words that she lets drop now and then show where her thoughts are and where she would like to be She seems to think everybody is as eager to go there as she is For my part I am not eager at all I can t make myself feel that it will be nice to sit in rows all the time singing fond as I am of music And when I say to myself Of course we shall not always sit in rows singing then I fancy a multitude of shadowy phantom like beings dressed in white moving to and fro in golden streets doing nothing in particular and having a dreary time without anything to look forward to I told mother so She said earnestly and yet in her sweetest tenderest way Oh my darling Katy What you need is such a living personal love to Christ as shall make the thought of being where He is so delightful as to fill your mind with that single thought What is personal love to Christ Oh dear dear Why need my father have been snatched away from me when so many other girls have theirs spared to them He loved me so He indulged me so much He was so proud of me What have I done that I should have this dreadful thing happen to me I shall never be as happy as I was before Now I shall always be expecting trouble Yes I dare say mother will go next Why shouldn t I brood over this sorrow I like to brood over it I like to think how wretched I am I like to have long furious fits of crying lying on my face on the bed Jan I eighteen thirty two People talk a great deal about the blessed effects of sorrow But I do not see any good it has done me to lose my dear father and as to mother she was good enough before We are going to leave our pleasant home where all of us children were born and move into a house in an out of the way street By selling this and renting a smaller one mother hopes with economy to carry James through college And I must go to Miss Higgins school because it is less expensive than mister Stone s Miss Higgins indeed I never could bear her A few months ago how I should have cried and stormed at the idea of her school But the great sorrow swallows up the little trial I tried once more this morning as it is the first day of the year to force myself to begin to love God I want to do it I know I ought to do it but I cannot I go through the form of saying something that I try to pass off as praying every day now But I take no pleasure in it as good people say they do and as I am sure mother does Nobody could live in the house with her and doubt that Jan ten We are in our new home now and it is quite a cozy little place James is at home for the long vacation and we are together all the time I am out of school We study and sing together and now and then when we forget that dear father has gone we are as full of fun as ever If it is so nice to have a brother what must it be to have a sister Dear old Jim He is the very pleasantest dearest fellow in the world Jan fifteen I have come to another birthday and am seventeen Mother has celebrated it just as usual though I know all these anniversaries which used to be so pleasant must be sad days to her now my dear father has gone She has been cheerful and loving and entered into all my pleasures exactly as if nothing had happened I wonder at myself that I do not enter more into her sorrows but though at times the remembrance of our loss overwhelms me my natural elasticity soon makes me rise above and forget it And I am absorbed with these school days that come one after another in such quick succession that I am all the time running to keep up with them And as long as I do that I forget that death has crossed our threshold and may do it again But to night I feel very sad and as if I would give almost any thing to live in a world where nothing painful could happen Somehow mother s pale face haunts and reproaches me I believe I will go to bed and to sleep as quickly as possible and forget everything Chapter three

4899_32637_000003_000000	train-clean-360	My school days are over 
4899_32637_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I have come off with flying colors and mother is pleased at my success 
4899_32637_000003_000002	train-clean-360	I said to her today that I should now have time to draw and practice to my heart s content 
4899_32637_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 You will not find your heart content with either she said 
4899_32637_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Why mother I cried I thought you liked to see me happy 
4899_32637_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 And so I do she said quietly 
none	none	But there is something better to get out of life than you have yet found
4899_32637_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I am sure I hope so I returned 
4899_32637_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 On the whole I haven t got much so far 
4899_32637_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Amelia is now on such terms with Jenny Underhill that I can hardly see one without seeing the other After the way in which I have loved her this seems rather hard 
4899_32637_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Sometimes I am angry about it and sometimes grieved 
4899_32637_000008_000002	train-clean-360	However I find Jenny quite nice 
4899_32637_000008_000003	train-clean-360	She buys all the new books and lends them to me 
4899_32637_000008_000004	train-clean-360	I wish I liked more solid reading but I don t 
4899_32637_000008_000005	train-clean-360	And I wish I were not so fond of novels but I am 
4899_32637_000008_000006	train-clean-360	If it were not for mother I should read nothing else 
4899_32637_000008_000007	train-clean-360	And I am sure I often feel quite stirred up by a really good novel and admire and want to imitate every high minded noble character it describes 
4899_32637_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Jenny has a miniature of her brother Charley in a locket which she always wears and often shows me 
4899_32637_000009_000001	train-clean-360	According to her he is exactly like the heroes I most admire in books 
4899_32637_000009_000002	train-clean-360	She says she knows he would like me if we should meet 
4899_32637_000009_000003	train-clean-360	But that is not probable 
4899_32637_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Very few like me 
4899_32637_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Amelia says it is because I say just what I think 
none	none	Wednesday Mother pointed out to me this evening two lines from a book she was reading with a significant smile that said they described me A frank unchastened generous creature Whose faults and virtues stand in bold relief
4899_32637_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me I said so then I have some virtues after all 
4899_32637_000013_000000	train-clean-360	And I really think I must have for Jenny s brother who has come here for the sake of being near her seems to like me very much Nobody ever liked me so much before not even Amelia 
4899_32637_000013_000001	train-clean-360	But how foolish to write that down 
4899_32637_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Thursday Jenny s brother has been here all evening 
4899_32637_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He has the most perfect manners I ever saw 
4899_32637_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I am sure that mother who thinks so much of such things would be charmed with him but she happened to be out missus Jones having sent for her to see about her baby 
4899_32637_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He gave me an account of his mother s death and how he and Jenny nursed her day and night 
4899_32637_000014_000004	train-clean-360	He has a great deal of feeling 
4899_32637_000014_000005	train-clean-360	I was going to tell him about my father s death sorrow seems to bring people together so but I could not 
none	none	Oh if he had only had a sickness that needed our tender nursing instead of being snatched from us in that sudden way 
4899_32637_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Sunday Aug five Jenny s brother has been at our church all day 
4899_32637_000015_000001	train-clean-360	He walked home with me this afternoon 
4899_32637_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Mother after being up all night with missus Jones and her baby was not able to go out 
4899_32637_000016_000000	train-clean-360	doctor Cabot preaches as if we had all got to die pretty soon or else have something almost as bad happen to us 
4899_32637_000016_000001	train-clean-360	How can old people always try to make young people feel uncomfortable and as if things couldn t last 
none	none	Aug twenty five Jenny says her brother is perfectly fascinated with me and that I must try to like him in return 
4899_32637_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I suppose mother would say my head was turned by my good fortune but it is not 
4899_32637_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I am getting quite sober and serious 
4899_32637_000017_000003	train-clean-360	It is a great thing to be to be well liked 
none	none	I have seen some verses of his composition to day that show that he is all heart and soul and would make any sacrifice for one he loved 
4899_32637_000017_000005	train-clean-360	I could not like a man who did not possess such sentiments as his 
4899_32637_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Perhaps mother would think I ought not to put such things into my journal 
none	none	Jenny has thought of such a splendid plan What a dear little thing she is 
4899_32637_000019_000002	train-clean-360	She and her brother are so much alike 
4899_32637_000019_000003	train-clean-360	The plan is for us three girls Jenny Amelia and myself to form ourselves into a little class to read and to study together 
4899_32637_000019_000004	train-clean-360	She says Charley will direct our readings and help us with our studies 
4899_32637_000019_000005	train-clean-360	It is perfectly delightful 
4899_32637_000020_000000	train-clean-360	September one Somehow I forgot to tell mother that mister Underhill was to be our teacher 
4899_32637_000020_000001	train-clean-360	So when it came my turn to have the class meet here she was not quite pleased 
4899_32637_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I told her she could stay and watch us and then she would see for herself that we all behaved ourselves 
4899_32637_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Sept nineteen The class met at Amelia s to night 
4899_32637_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Mother insisted on sending for me though mister Underhill had proposed to see me home himself 
4899_32637_000021_000002	train-clean-360	So he stayed after I left 
none	none	It was not quite the thing in him for he must see that Amelia is absolutely crazy about him 
4899_32637_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Sept twenty eight We met at Jenny s this evening 
none	none	Amelia had a bad headache and could not come 
4899_32637_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Jenny idled over her lessons and at last took a book and began to read 
4899_32637_000022_000003	train-clean-360	I studied awhile with mister Underhill 
4899_32637_000022_000004	train-clean-360	At last he said scribbling something on a bit of paper 
4899_32637_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Here is a sentence I hope you can translate 
4899_32637_000024_000000	train-clean-360	I took it and read these words 
4899_32637_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 You are the brightest prettiest most warm hearted little thing in the world 
4899_32637_000025_000001	train-clean-360	And I love you more than tongue can tell 
4899_32637_000025_000002	train-clean-360	You must love me in the same way 
none	none	I felt hot and then cold and then glad and then sorry 
4899_32637_000026_000001	train-clean-360	But I pretended to laugh and said I could not translate Greek 
4899_32637_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I shall have to tell mother and what will she say 
none	none	Sept twenty nine This morning mother began thus
4899_32637_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Kate I do not like these lessons of yours 
4899_32637_000028_000001	train-clean-360	At your age with your judgment quite unformed it is not proper that you should spend so much time with a young man 
4899_32637_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Jenny is always there and Amelia I replied 
4899_32637_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 That makes no difference 
4899_32637_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I wish the whole thing stopped 
none	none	I do not know what I have been thinking of to let it go on so long 
4899_32637_000030_000003	train-clean-360	missus Gordon says 
none	none	missus Gordon Ha I burst out I knew Amelia was at the bottom of it Amelia is in love with him up to her very ears and because he does not entirely neglect me she has put her mother up to coming here meddling and making
4899_32637_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 If what you say of Amelia is true it is most ungenerous in you to tell of it 
4899_32637_000032_000001	train-clean-360	But I do not believe it 
none	none	Amelia Gordon has too much good sense to be carried away by a handsome face and agreeable manners 
4899_32637_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I began to cry 
4899_32637_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 He likes me I got out he likes me ever so much 
none	none	Nobody ever was so kind to me before 
4899_32637_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Nobody ever said such nice things to me 
4899_32637_000034_000003	train-clean-360	And I don t want such horrid things said about him 
none	none	Has it really come this said mother quite shocked Oh my poor child how my selfish sorrow has made me neglect you 
4899_32637_000036_000000	train-clean-360	I kept on crying 
4899_32637_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it possible she went on that with your good sense and the education you have had you are captivated by this mere boy 
4899_32637_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 He is not a boy I said 
none	none	He is a man He is twenty years old or at least he will be on the fifteenth of next October
4899_32637_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 The child actually keeps his birthdays cried mother 
none	none	Oh my wicked shameful carelessness It s done now I said desperately It is too late to help it now You don t mean that he has dared to say anything without consulting me asked mother And you have allowed it Oh Katherine 
4899_32637_000042_000000	train-clean-360	This time my mouth shut itself up and no mortal force could open it I stopped crying and sat with folded arms 
4899_32637_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Mother said what she had to say and then I came to you my dear old Journal 
4899_32637_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Yes he likes me and I like him 
4899_32637_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Come now let s out with it once for all 
4899_32637_000043_000002	train-clean-360	He loves me and I love him 
4899_32637_000043_000003	train-clean-360	You are just a little bit too late mother 
4899_32637_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Oct one I never can write down all the things that have happened 
4899_32637_000044_000001	train-clean-360	The very day after I wrote that mother had forbidden my going to the class Charley came to see her and they had a regular fight together 
none	none	He has told me about it since 
4899_32637_000044_000003	train-clean-360	Then as he could not prevail his uncle wrote told her it would be the making of Charley to be settled down on one young lady instead of hovering from flower to flower as he was doing now 
4899_32637_000044_000004	train-clean-360	Then Jenny came with her pretty ways and cried and told mother what a darling brother Charley was 
4899_32637_000044_000005	train-clean-360	She made a good deal too out of his having lost both father and mother and needing my affection so much 
4899_32637_000044_000006	train-clean-360	Mother shut herself up and I have no doubt prayed over it 
none	none	I really believe she prays over every new dress she buys 
4899_32637_000044_000008	train-clean-360	Then she sent for me and talked beautifully and I behaved abominably 
4899_32637_000045_000000	train-clean-360	At last she said she would put us on one year s probation 
4899_32637_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Charley might spend one evening here every two weeks when she should always be present 
4899_32637_000045_000002	train-clean-360	We were never to be seen together in public nor would she allow us to correspond 
4899_32637_000045_000003	train-clean-360	If at the end of the year we were both as eager for it as we are now she would consent to our engagement Of course we shall be so I consider myself as good as engaged now Dear me 
4899_32637_000045_000004	train-clean-360	how funny it seems 
4899_32637_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Oct two Charley is not at all pleased with mother s terms but no one would guess it from his manner to her 
4899_32637_000046_000001	train-clean-360	His coming is always the signal for her trotting down stairs he goes to meet her and offers her a chair as if he was delighted to see her 
4899_32637_000046_000002	train-clean-360	We go on with the lessons as this gives us a chance to sit pretty close together and when I am writing my exercises and he corrects them I rather think a few little things get on to the paper that sound nicely to us but would not strike mother very agreeably 
4899_32637_000046_000003	train-clean-360	For instance last night Charley wrote 
none	none	Is your mother never sick 
4899_32637_000047_000001	train-clean-360	A nice little headache or two would be so convenient to us 
4899_32637_000048_000000	train-clean-360	And I wrote back 
4899_32637_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 You dear old horrid thing How can you be so selfish 
4899_32637_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Jan fifteen eighteen thirty three I have been trying to think whether I am any happier today than I was at this time a year ago 
4899_32637_000050_000001	train-clean-360	If I am not I suppose it is the tantalizing way in which I am placed in regard to Charley 
none	none	We have so much to say to each other that we can t say before mother and that we cannot say in writing because a correspondence is one of the forbidden things 
4899_32637_000050_000003	train-clean-360	He says he entered into no contract not to write and keeps slipping little notes into my hand but I don t think that quite right 
none	none	Mother hears us arguing and disputing about it though she does not know the subject under discussion and to day she said to me
4899_32637_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I would not argue with him if I were you 
4899_32637_000051_000001	train-clean-360	He never will yield 
none	none	But it is a case of conscience I said and he ought to yield There is no obstinacy like that of a f she and stopped short
4899_32637_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you may as well finish it I cried 
4899_32637_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 I know you think him a fool 
4899_32637_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Then mother burst out 
4899_32637_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my child she said before it is too late do be persuaded by me to give up this whole thing 
4899_32637_000056_000001	train-clean-360	I shrink from paining or offending you but it is my duty as your mother to warn you against a marriage that will make shipwreck of your happiness 
4899_32637_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Marriage I fairly shrieked out 
none	none	That is the last thing I have ever thought of 
4899_32637_000057_000002	train-clean-360	I felt a chill creep over me 
none	none	All I had wanted was to have Charley come here every day take me out now and then and care for nobody else
4899_32637_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes marriage mother repeated 
none	none	For what is the meaning of an engagement if marriage is not to follow 
4899_32637_000058_000002	train-clean-360	How can you fail to see what I see oh so plainly that Charley Underhill can never never meet the requirements of your soul 
4899_32637_000058_000003	train-clean-360	You are captivated by what girls of your age call beauty regular features a fair complexion and soft eyes 
4899_32637_000058_000004	train-clean-360	His flatteries delude and his professions of affection gratify you 
4899_32637_000058_000005	train-clean-360	You do not see that he is shallow and conceited and selfish and 
none	none	Oh mother 
4899_32637_000059_000001	train-clean-360	How can you be so unjust 
4899_32637_000059_000002	train-clean-360	His whole study seems to be to please others 
4899_32637_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Seems to be that is true she replied 
4899_32637_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 His ruling passion is love of admiration the little pleasing acts that attract you are so many traps set to catch the attention and the favorable opinion of those about him 
4899_32637_000060_000002	train-clean-360	He has not one honest desire to please because it is right to be pleasing 
none	none	Oh my precious child what a fatal mistake you are making in relying on your own judgment in this the most important of earthly decisions 
4899_32637_000061_000000	train-clean-360	I felt very angry 
4899_32637_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought the Bible forbade back biting I said 
none	none	Mother made no reply except by a look which said about a hundred and forty different things 
4899_32637_000063_000001	train-clean-360	And then I came up here and wrote some poetry which was very good for me though I don t suppose she would think so 
none	none	Oct one The year of probation is over and I have nothing to do now but to be happy 
4899_32637_000064_000001	train-clean-360	But being engaged is not half so nice as I expected it would be 
4899_32637_000064_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose it is owing to my being obliged to defy mother s judgment in order to gratify my own 
4899_32637_000064_000003	train-clean-360	People say she has great insight into character and sees at a glance what others only learn after much study 
4899_32637_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Oct ten I have taken a dreadful cold 
4899_32637_000065_000001	train-clean-360	It is too bad 
4899_32637_000065_000002	train-clean-360	I dare say I shall be coughing all winter and instead of going out with Charley be shut up at home 
none	none	Oct twelve Charley says he did not know that I was subject to a cough and that he hopes I am not consumptive because his father and mother died of consumption and it makes him nervous to hear people cough I nearly strangled myself all the evening trying not to annoy him with mine Chapter four IV Nov two I really think I am sick and going to die Last night I raised a little blood I dare not tell mother it would distress her so but I am sure it came from my lungs Charley said last week he really must stay away till I got better for my cough sounded like his mother s I have been very lonely and have shed some tears but most of the time have been too sorrowful to cry If we were married and I had a cough would he go and leave me I wonder Sunday Nov eighteen Poor mother is dreadfully anxious about me But I don t see how she can love me so after the way I have behaved I wonder if after all mothers are not the best friends there are I keep her awake with my cough all night and am mopy and cross all day but she is just as kind and affectionate as she can be Nov twenty five The day I wrote that was Sunday I could not go to church and I felt very forlorn and desolate I tried to get some comfort by praying but when I got on my knees I just burst out crying and could not say a word For I have not seen Charley for ten days As I knelt there I began to think myself a perfect monster of selfishness for wanting him to spend his evenings with me now that I am so unwell and annoy him so with my cough and I asked myself if I ought not to break off the engagement altogether if I was really in consumption the very disease Charley dreaded most of all It seemed such a proper sacrifice to make of myself Then I prayed yes I am sure I really prayed as I had not done for more than a year the idea of self sacrifice grew every moment more beautiful in my eyes till at last I felt an almost joyful triumph in writing to poor Charley and tell him what I had resolved to do This is my letter My Dear Dear Charley I dare not tell you what it costs me to say what I am about to do but I am sure you know me well enough by this time believe that it is only because your happiness is far more precious to me than my own that I have decided to write you this letter When you first told me that you loved me you said and you have often said so since then that it was my brightness and gayety that attracted you I knew there was something underneath my gayety better worth your love and was glad I could give you more than you asked for I knew I was not a mere thoughtless laughing girl but that I had a heart as wide as the ocean to give you as wide and as deep But now my brightness and gayety have gone I am sick and perhaps am going to die If this is so it would be very sweet to have your love go with me to the very gates of death and beautify and glorify my path thither But what a weary task this would be to you my poor Charley And so if you think it best and it would relieve you of any care and pain I will release you from our engagement and set you free Your Little Katy I did not sleep at all that night Early on Monday I sent off my letter and my heart beat so hard all day that I was tired and faint Just at dark his answer came I can copy it from memory Dear Kate What a generous self sacrificing little thing you are I always thought so but now you have given me a noble proof of it I will own that I have been disappointed to find your constitution so poor and that it has been very dull sitting and hearing you cough especially as I was reminded of the long and tedious illness through which poor Jenny and myself had to nurse our mother I vowed then never to marry a consumptive woman and I thank you for making it so easy for me to bring our engagement to an end My bright hopes are blighted and it will be long before I shall find another to fill your place I need not say how much I sympathize with you in this disappointment I hope the consolations of religion will now be yours Your notes the lock of your hair et cetera I return with this now I will not reproach you for the pain you have cost me I know it is not your fault that your health has become so frail I remain your sincere friend Charles Underhill Jan I eighteen thirty four Let me finish this story If I can My first impulse after reading his letter was to fly to mother and hide away forever in her dear loving arms But I restrained myself and with my heart beating so that I could hardly hold my pen I wrote mister Underhill Sir The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see you at last just as you are Since my note to you on Sunday last I have had a consultation of physicians and they all agree that my disease is not of an alarming character and that I shall soon recover But I thank God that before it was too late you have been revealed to me just as you are a heartless selfish shallow creature unworthy the love of a true hearted woman unworthy even of your own self respect I gave you an opportunity to withdraw from our engagement in full faith loving you so truly that I was ready to go trembling to my grave alone if you shrank from sustaining me to it But I see now that I did not dream for one moment that you would take me at my word and leave me to my fate I thought I loved a man and could lean on him when strength failed me I know now that I loved a mere creature of my imagination Take back your letters loathe the sight of them Take back the ring and find if you can a woman who will never be sick never out of spirits and who never will die Thank heaven it is not Katherine Mortimer These lines came to me in reply Thank God it is not Kate Mortimer I want an angel for my wife not a vixen C U Jan fifteen What a tempest tossed creature this birthday finds me But let me finish this wretched disgraceful story if I can before I quite lose my senses I showed my mother the letters She burst into tears and opened her arms and I ran into them as a wounded bird flies into the ark We cried together Mother never said never looked I told you so All she did say was this God has heard my prayers He is reserving better things for my child Dear mother s are not the only arms I have flown to But it does not seem as if God ought to take me in because I am in trouble when I would not go to him when I was happy in something else But even in the midst of my greatest felicity I had many and many a misgiving many a season when my conscience upbraided me for my willfulness towards my dear mother and my whole soul yearned for something higher and better even than Charley s love precious as it was Jan twenty six I have shut myself up in my room to day to think over things The end of it is that I am full of mortification and confusion of face If I had only had confidence in mother s judgment I should never have get entangled in this silly engagement I see now that Charley never could have made me happy and I know there is a good deal in my heart he never called out I wish however I had not written him when I was in passion No wonder he is thankful that he free from such a vixen But oh the provocation was terrible I have made up my mind never to tell a human soul about this affair It will be so high minded and honorable to shield him thus from the contempt he deserves With all my faults I am glad that there is nothing mean or little about me Jan twenty seven I can t bear to write it down but I will The ink was hardly dry yesterday on the above self laudation when Amelia came She had been out of town and had only just learned what had happened Of course she was curious to know the whole story And I told it to her every word of it Oh Kate Mortimer how high minded you are How free from all that is mean and little I could tear my hair if it would do any good Amelia defended Charley and I was thus led on to say every harsh thing of him I could think of She said he was of so sensitive a nature had so much sensibility and such a constitutional aversion to seeing suffering that for her part she could not blame him It is such a pity you had not had your lungs examined before you wrote that first letter she went on But you are so impulsive If you had only waited you would be engaged to Charley still I am thankful I did not wait I cried angrily Do Amelia drop the subject forever You and I shall never agree upon it The truth is you are two thirds in love with him and have been all along She colored and laughed and actually looked pleased If anyone had made such an outrageous speech to me I should have been furious I suppose you know said she that old mister Underhill has taken such a fancy to him that he has made him his heir and he is as rich as a Jew Indeed I said dryly I wonder if mother knew it when she opposed our engagement so strenuously Jan thirty one one have asked her and she said she did mister Underhill told her his intentions when he urged her consent to the engagement Dear mother How unworldly how unselfish she is Feb four The name of Charley Underhill appears on these pages for the last time He is engaged to Amelia From this moment she is lost to me forever How desolate how mortified how miserable I am Who could have thought this of Amelia She came to see me radiant with joy I concealed my disgust until she said that Charley felt now that he had never really loved me but had preferred her all along Then I burst out What I said I do not know and do not care The whole thing is so disgraceful that I should be a stock or a stone not to resent it Feb five After yesterday s passion of grief shame and anger I feel perfectly stupid and languid Oh that I was prepared for a better world and could fly to it and be at rest Feb six Now that it is all over how ashamed I am of the fury I have been in and which has given Amelia such advantage over me I was beginning to believe that I was really living a feeble and fluttering but real Christian life and finding some satisfaction in it But that is all over now I am doomed to be a victim of my own unstable passionate wayward nature and the sooner I settle down into that conviction the better And yet how my very soul craves the highest happiness and refuses to be comforted while that is wanting Feb seven After writing that I do not know what made me go to see doctor Cabot He received me in that cheerful way of his that seems to promise the taking one s burden right off one s back I am very glad to see you my dear child he said I intended to be very dignified and cold As if I was going to have any doctor Cabot s undertaking to sympathize with me But those few kind words just upset me and I began to cry You would not speak so kindly I got out at last if you knew what a dreadful creature I am I am angry with myself and angry with everybody and angry with God I can t be good two minutes at a time I do everything I do not want to do and do nothing I try and pray to do Everybody plagues me and tempts me And God does not answer any of my prayers and I am just desperate Poor child he said in a low voice as if to himself Poor heart sick tired child that cannot see what I can see that its Father s loving arms are all about it I stopped crying to strain my ears and listen He went on Katy all that you say may be true I dare say it is But God loves you He loves you He loves me I repeated to myself He loves me Oh doctor Cabot if I could believe that If I could believe that after all the promises I have broken all the foolish wrong things I have done and shall always be doing God perhaps still loves me You may be sure of it he said solemnly I minister bring the gospel to you to day Go home and say over and over to yourself I am a wayward foolish child But He loves me I have disobeyed and grieved Him ten thousand times But He loves me I have lost faith in some of my dearest friends and am very desolate But He loves me I do not love Him I am even angry with Him But He loves me I came away and all the way home I fought this battle with myself saying He loves me I knelt down to pray and all my wasted childish wicked life came and stared me in the face I looked at it and said with tears of joy But He loves me Never in my life did I feel so rested so quieted so sorrowful and yet so satisfied Feb ten What a beautiful world this is and how full it is of truly kind good people missus Morris was here this morning and just one squeeze of that long yellow old hand of hers seemed to speak a bookful I wonder why I have always disliked her so for she is really an excellent woman I gave her a good kiss to pay her for the sympathy she had sense enough not to put into canting words and if you will believe it dear old Journal the tears came into her eyes and she said You are one of the Lord s beloved ones though perhaps you do not know it I repeated again to myself those sweet mysterious words and then I tried to think what I could do for Him But I could not think of anything great or good enough I went into mother s room and put my arms round her and told her how I loved her She looked surprised and pleased Ah I knew it would come she said laying her hand on her Bible Knew what would come mother Peace she said I came back here and wrote a little note to Amelia telling her how ashamed and sorry I was that I could not control myself the other day Then I wrote a long letter to James I have been very careless about writing to him Then I began to hem those handkerchiefs mother asked me to finish a month ago But I could not think of anything to do for God I wish I could It makes me so happy to think that all this time while I was caring for nobody but myself and fancying He must almost hate me He was loving and pitying me Feb fifteen I went to see doctor Cabot again to day He came down from his study with his pen in his hand How dare you come and spoil my sermon on Saturday he asked good humoredly Though he seemed full of loving kindness I was ashamed of my thoughtlessness Though I did not know he was particularly busy on Saturdays If I were a minister I am sure I would get my sermons done early in the week I only wanted to ask one thing I said I want to do something for God And I cannot think of anything unless it is to go on a mission And mother would never let me do that She thinks girls with delicate health are not fit for such work At all events I would not go to day he replied Meanwhile do everything you do for Him who has loved you and given Himself for you I did not dare to stay any longer and so came away quite puzzled Dinner was ready and as I sat down to the table I said to myself I eat this dinner for myself not for God What can doctor Cabot mean Then I remembered the text about doing all for the glory of God even in eating and drinking but I do not understand it at all Feb nineteen It has seemed to me for several days that it must be that I really do love God though ever so little But it shot through my mind to day like a knife that it is a miserable selfish love at the best not worth my giving not worth God s accepting All my old misery has come back with seven other miseries more miserable than itself I wish I had never been born I wish I were thoughtless and careless like so many other girls of my age who seem to get along very well and to enjoy themselves far more than I do Feb twenty one doctor Cabot came to see me to day I told him all about it He could not help smiling as he said When I see a little infant caressing its mother would you have me say to it You selfish child how dare you pretend to caress your mother in that way You are quite unable to appreciate her character you love her merely because she loves you treats you kindly It was my turn to smile now at my own folly You are as yet but a babe in Christ doctor Cabot continued You love your God and Saviour because He first loved you The time will come when the character of your love will become changed into one which sees and feels the beauty and the perfection of its object and if you could be assured that He no longer looked on you with favor you would still cling to Him with devoted affection There is one thing more that troubles me I said Most persons know the exact moment when they begin real Christian lives But I do not know of any such time in my history This causes me many uneasy moments You are wrong in thinking that most persons have this advantage over you I believe that the children of Christian parents who have been judiciously trained rarely can point to any day or hour when they began to live this new life The question is not do you remember my child when you entered this world and how It is simply this are you now alive and an inhabitant thereof And now it is my turn to ask you a question How happens it that you who have a mother of rich and varied experience allow yourself to be tormented with these petty anxieties which she is as capable of dispelling as I am I do not know I answered But we girls can t talk to our mothers about any of our sacred feelings and we hate to have them talk to us doctor Cabot shook his head There is something wrong somewhere he said A young girl s mother is her natural refuge in every perplexity I hoped that you who have rather more sense than most girls of your age could give me some idea what the difficulty is After he had gone I am ashamed to own that I was in a perfect flutter of delight at what he had said about my having more sense than most girls Meeting poor mother on the stairs while in this exalted state of mind I gave her a very short answer to a kind question and made her unhappy as I have made myself It is just a year ago to day that I got frightened at my novel reading propensities and resolved not to look into one for twelve months I was getting to dislike all other books and night after night sat up late devouring everything exciting I could get hold of One Saturday night I sat up till the clock struck twelve to finish one and the next morning I was so sleepy that I had to stay at home from church Now I hope and believe the back of this taste is broken and that I shall never be a slave to it again Indeed it does not seem to me now that I shall ever care for such books again Feb twenty four Mother spoke to me this morning for the fiftieth time I really believe about my disorderly habits I don t think I am careless because I like confusion but the trouble is I am always in a hurry and a ferment about something If I want anything I want it very much and right away So if I am looking for a book or a piece of music or a pattern I tumble everything around and can t stop to put them to rights I wish I were not so eager and impatient But I mean to try to keep my room and my drawers in order to please mother She says too that I am growing careless about my hair and my dress But that is because my mind is so full of graver more important things I thought I ought to be wholly occupied with my duty to God But mother says duty to God includes duty to one s neighbor and that untidy hair put up in all sorts of rough bunches rumpled cuffs and collars and all that sort of thing make one offensive to all one meets I am sorry she thinks so for I find it very convenient to twist up my hair almost any how and it takes a good deal of time to look after collars and cuffs March fourteen To day I feel discouraged and disappointed I certainly thought that if God really loved me and I really loved Him I should find myself growing better day by day But I am not improved in the least Most of the time I spend on my knees I am either stupid feeling nothing at all or else my head is full of what I was doing before I began to pray or what I am going to do as soon as I get through I do not believe anybody else in the world is like me in this respect Then when I feel differently and can make a nice glib prayer with floods of tears running down my cheeks I get all puffed up and think how much pleased God must be to see me so fervent in spirit I go down stairs in this frame and begin to scold Susan for misplacing my music till all of a sudden I catch myself doing it and stop short crestfallen and confounded I have so many such experiences that I feel like a baby just learning to walk who is so afraid of falling that it has half a mind to sit down once for all Then there is another thing Seeing mother so fond of Thomas A Kempis I have been reading it now and then and am not fond of it at all From beginning to end it exhorts to self denial in every form and shape Must I then give up all hope of happiness in this world and modify all my natural tastes and desires Oh I do love so to be happy I do so hate to suffer The very thought of being sick or of being forced to nurse sick people with all their cross ways and of losing my friends or of having to live with disagreeable people make s me shudder I want to please God and to be like Him I certainly do But I am so young and it is so natural to want to have a good time And now I am in for it I may as well tell the whole story When I read the lives of good men and women who have died and gone to heaven I find they all liked to sit and think about God and about Christ Now I don t I often try but my mind flies off in a tangent The truth is I am perfectly discouraged March seventeen I went to see doctor Cabot to day but he was out so I thought I would ask for missus Cabot though I was determined not to tell her any of my troubles But somehow she got the whole story out of me and instead of being shocked as I expected she would be she actually burst out laughing She recovered herself immediately however Do excuse me for laughing at you you dear child you she said But I remember so well how I use to flounder through just such needless anxieties and life looks so different so very different to me now from what it did then What should you think of a man who having just sowed his field was astonished not to see it at once ripe for the harvest because his neighbor s after long months of waiting was just being gathered in Do you mean I asked that by and by I shall naturally come to feel and think as other good people do Yes I do You must make the most of what little Christian life you have be thankful God has given you so much cherish it pray over it and guard it like the apple of your eye Imperceptibly but surely it will grow and keep on growing for this is its nature But I don t want to wait I said despondently I have just been reading a delightful book full of stories of heroic deeds not fables but histories of real events and real people It has quite stirred me up and made me wish to possess such beautiful heroism and that I were a man that I might have a chance to perform some truly noble self sacrificing acts I dare say your chance will come she replied though you are not a man I fancy we all get more or less what we want Do you really think so Let me see then what I want most But I am staying too long Were you particularly busy No she returned smilingly I am learning that the man who wants me is the man I want You are very good to say so Well in the first place I do really and truly want to be good Not with common goodness you know but But uncommon goodness she put in I mean that I want to be very very good I should like next best to be learned and accomplished Then I should want to be perfectly well and perfectly happy And a pleasant home of course I must have with friends to love me and like me too And I can t get along without some pretty tasteful things about me But you are laughing at me Have I said anything foolish If I laughed it was not at you but at poor human nature that would fain grasp everything at once Allowing that you should possess all you have just described where is the heroism you so much admire for exercise That is just what I was saying That is just what troubles me To be sure while perfectly well and happy in a pleasant home with friends to love and admire you Oh I did not say admire I interrupted That was just what you meant my dear I am afraid it was now I come to think it over Well with plenty of friends good in an uncommon way accomplished learned and surrounded with pretty and tasteful objects your life will certainly be in danger of not proving very sublime It is a great pity I said musingly Suppose then you content yourself for the present with doing in a faithful quiet persistent way all the little homely tasks that return with each returning day each one as unto God and perhaps by and by you will thus have gained strength for a more heroic life But I don t know how You have some little home duties I suppose Yes I have the care of my own room and mother wants me to have a general oversight of the parlor you know we have but one parlor now Is that all you have to do Why my music and drawing take up a good deal of my time and I read and study more or less and go out some and we have a good many visitors I suppose then you keep your room in nice lady like order and that the parlor is dusted every morning loose music put out of the way books restored to their places Now I know mother has been telling you Your mother has told me nothing at all Well then I said laughing but a little ashamed I don t keep my room in nice order and mother really sees to the parlor herself though I pretend to do it And is she never annoyed by this neglect Oh yes very much annoyed Then dear Katy suppose your first act of heroism tomorrow should be the gratifying your mother in these little things little though they are Surely your first duty next to pleasing God is to please your mother and in every possible way to sweeten and beautify her life You may depend upon it that a life of real heroism and self sacrifice must begin and lay its foundation in this little world wherein it learns its first lesson and takes its first steps And do you really think that God notices such little things My dear child what a question If there is any one truth I would gladly impress on the mind of a you Christian it is just this that God notices the most trivial act accepts the poorest most threadbare little service listens to the coldest feeblest petition and gathers up with parental fondness all our fragmentary desires and attempts at good works Oh if we could only begin to conceive how He loves us what different creatures we should be I felt inspired by her enthusiasm though I don t think I quite understand what she means I did not dare to stay any longer for with her great host of children she must have her hands full March twenty five Mother is very much astonished to see how nicely I am keeping things in order I was flying about this morning singing and dusting the furniture when she came in and began He that is faithful in that which is least but I ran at her my brush and would not let her finish really really don t deserve to be praised For I have been thinking that if it is true that God notices every little thing we do to please Him He must also notice every cross word we speak every shrug of the shoulders every ungracious look and that they displease Him And my list of such offences is as long as my life March twenty nine Yesterday for the first time since that dreadful blow I felt some return of my natural gayety and cheerfulness It seemed to come hand in hand with my first real effort to go so far out of myself as to try to do exactly what would gratify dear mother But to day I am all down again I miss Amelia s friendship for one thing To be sure I wonder how I ever came to love such a superficial character so devotedly but I must have somebody to love and perhaps I invented a lovely creature and called it by her name and bowed down to it and worshiped it I certainly did so in regard to him whose heart less cruelty has left me so sad so desolate Evening Mother has been very patient and forbearing with me all day To night after tea she said in her gentlest tenderest way Dear Katy I feel very sorry for you But I see one path which you have not yet tried which can lead you out of these sore straits You have tried living for yourself a good many years and the result is great weariness and heaviness of soul Try now to live for others Take a class in the Sunday school Go with me to visit my poor people You will be astonished to find how much suffering and sickness there is in this world and how delightful it is to sympathize with and try to relieve it This advice was very repugnant to me My time is pretty fully occupied with my books my music and my drawing And of all places in the world I hate a sick room But on the whole I will take a class in the Sunday school

4899_32639_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I have taken it at last 
none	none	I would not take one be fore because I knew I could not teach little children how to love God unless I loved Him myself 
4899_32639_000004_000002	train-clean-360	My class is perfectly delightful 
4899_32639_000004_000003	train-clean-360	There are twelve dear little things in it of all ages between eight and nine 
none	none	Eleven are girls and the one boy makes me more trouble than all of them put together 
4899_32639_000004_000005	train-clean-360	When I get them all about me and their sweet innocent faces look up into mine I am so happy that I can hardly help stopping every now and then to kiss them 
4899_32639_000004_000006	train-clean-360	They ask the very strangest questions I mean to spend a great deal of time in preparing the lesson and in hunting up stories to illustrate it 
none	none	Oh I am so glad I was ever born into this beautiful world where there will always be dear little children to love 
4899_32639_000005_000000	train-clean-360	APRIL thirteen Sunday has come again and with it my darling little class doctor Cabot has preached delightfully all day and I feel that I begin to understand his preaching better and that it must do me good 
none	none	I long I truly long to please God I long to feel as the best Christians feel and to live as they live 
4899_32639_000006_000000	train-clean-360	APRIL twenty Now that I have these twelve little ones to instruct I am more than ever in earnest about setting them a good example through the week 
4899_32639_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It is true they do not most of them know how I spend my time nor how I act 
4899_32639_000006_000002	train-clean-360	But I know and whenever I am conscious of not practicing what I preach I am bitterly ashamed and grieved 
4899_32639_000006_000003	train-clean-360	How much work badly done I am now having to undo 
4899_32639_000006_000004	train-clean-360	If I had begun in earnest to serve God when I was as young as these children are how many wrong habits I should have avoided habits that entangle me now as in so many nets 
none	none	I am trying to take each of these little gentle girls by the hand and to lead her to Christ 
4899_32639_000006_000006	train-clean-360	Poor Johnny Ross is not so docile as they are and tries my patience to the last degree 
4899_32639_000007_000000	train-clean-360	APRIL twenty seven This morning I had my little flock about me and talked to them out of the very bottom of my heart about Jesus 
4899_32639_000007_000001	train-clean-360	They left their seats and got close to me in a circle leaning on my lap and drinking in every word 
4899_32639_000007_000002	train-clean-360	All of a sudden I was aware as by a magnetic influence that a great lumbering man in the next seat was looking at me out of two of the blackest eyes I ever saw and evidently listening to what I was saying 
4899_32639_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I was disconcerted at first then angry 
4899_32639_000007_000004	train-clean-360	What impertinence 
4899_32639_000007_000005	train-clean-360	What rudeness 
4899_32639_000007_000006	train-clean-360	I am sure he must have seen my displeasure in my face for he got up what I suppose he meant for a blush that is he turned several shades darker than he was before giving one the idea that he is full of black rather than red blood 
4899_32639_000007_000007	train-clean-360	I should not have remembered it however by it I mean his impertinence if he had not shortly after made a really excellent address to the children 
4899_32639_000007_000008	train-clean-360	Perhaps it was a little above their comprehension but it showed a good deal of thought and earnestness I meant to ask who he was but forgot it 
4899_32639_000008_000000	train-clean-360	This has been a delightful Sunday 
none	none	I have really feasted on doctor Cabot s preaching 
4899_32639_000008_000002	train-clean-360	But I am satisfied that there is something in religion I do not yet comprehend 
4899_32639_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I do wish I positively knew that God had forgiven and accepted me 
4899_32639_000009_000000	train-clean-360	MAY six Last evening Clara Ray had a little party and I was there 
none	none	She has a great knack at getting the right sort of people together and of making them enjoy themselves 
4899_32639_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I sang several songs and so did Clara but they all said my voice was finer and in better training than hers 
4899_32639_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It is delightful to be with cultivated agreeable people 
4899_32639_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I could have stayed all night but mother sent for me before any one else had thought of going 
4899_32639_000011_000000	train-clean-360	MAY seven I have been on a charming excursion to day with Clara Ray and all her set 
4899_32639_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I was rather tired but had an invitation to a concert this evening which I could not resist 
none	none	JULY twenty one So much has been going on that I have not had time to write There is no end to the picnics drives parties et cetera this summer I am afraid I am not getting on at all 
4899_32639_000012_000002	train-clean-360	My prayers are dull and short and full of wandering thoughts 
4899_32639_000012_000003	train-clean-360	I am brimful of vivacity and good humor in company and as soon as I get home am stupid and peevish 
none	none	I suppose this will always be so as it always has been and I declare I would rather be so than such a vapid flat creature as Mary Jones or such a dull heavy one as big Lucy Merrill 
4899_32639_000013_000000	train-clean-360	JULY twenty four Clara Ray says the girls think me reckless and imprudent in speech 
4899_32639_000013_000001	train-clean-360	I ve a good mind not to go with her set any more 
4899_32639_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I am afraid I have been a good deal dazzled by the attentions I have received of late and now comes this blow at my vanity 
4899_32639_000014_000000	train-clean-360	On the whole I feel greatly out of sorts this evening 
none	none	JULY twenty eight People talk about happiness to be found in a Christian life I wonder why I do not find more 
4899_32639_000015_000001	train-clean-360	On Sundays I am pretty good and always seem to start afresh but on week days I am drawn along with those about me 
none	none	All my pleasures are innocent ones there is surely no harm in going to concerts driving out singing and making little visits 
4899_32639_000015_000003	train-clean-360	But these things distract me they absorb me they make religious duties irksome 
4899_32639_000015_000004	train-clean-360	I almost wish I could shut myself up in a cell and so get out of the reach of temptation 
4899_32639_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The truth is the journey heavenward is all up hill I have to force myself to keep on 
4899_32639_000016_000001	train-clean-360	The wonder is that anybody gets there with so much to oppose so little to help one 
4899_32639_000017_000000	train-clean-360	JULY twenty nine It is high time to stop and think 
none	none	I have been like one running a race and am stopping to take breath I do not like the way in which things have been going on of late 
4899_32639_000017_000003	train-clean-360	I feel restless and ill at ease 
none	none	I see that if I would be happy in God I must give Him all And there is a wicked reluctance to do that 
4899_32639_000017_000005	train-clean-360	I want Him but I want to have my own way too 
4899_32639_000017_000006	train-clean-360	I want to walk humbly and softly before Him and I want to go where I shall be admired and applauded 
none	none	To whom shall I yield To God 
4899_32639_000017_000009	train-clean-360	Or to myself 
4899_32639_000018_000000	train-clean-360	JULY thirty I met doctor Cabot to day and could not help asking the question 
4899_32639_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it right for me to sing and play in company when all I do it for is to be admired 
4899_32639_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you sure it is all you do it for he returned 
4899_32639_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I said I suppose there may be a sprinkling of desire to entertain and please mixed with the love of display 
4899_32639_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you suppose that your love of display allowing you have it would be forever slain by your merely refusing to sing in company 
none	none	I thought that might give it a pretty hard blow I said if not its death blow Meanwhile in punishing yourself you punish your poor innocent friends he said laughing
4899_32639_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 No child go on singing God has given you this power of entertaining and gratifying your friends 
4899_32639_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But pray without ceasing that you may sing from pure benevolence and not from pure self love 
4899_32639_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do people pray about such things as that I cried 
4899_32639_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course they do 
4899_32639_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Why I would pray about my little finger if my little finger went astray 
4899_32639_000027_000000	train-clean-360	I looked at his little finger but saw no signs of its becoming schismatic 
4899_32639_000028_000000	train-clean-360	AUG three This morning I took great delight in praying for my little scholars and went to Sunday school as on wings 
4899_32639_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But on reaching my seat what was my horror to find Maria Perry there 
4899_32639_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Oh your seat is changed said she 
4899_32639_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I am to have half your class and I like this seat better than those higher up 
4899_32639_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose you don t care 
none	none	But I do care I returned and you have taken my very best children the very sweetest and the very prettiest 
4899_32639_000030_000001	train-clean-360	I shall speak to mister Williams about it directly 
none	none	At any rate I would not fly into such a fury she said
4899_32639_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 It is just as pleasant to me to have pretty children to teach as it is to you 
4899_32639_000031_000002	train-clean-360	mister Williams said he had no doubt you would be glad to divide your class with me as it is so large and I doubt if you gain anything by speaking to him 
none	none	There was no time for further discussion as school was about to begin 
4899_32639_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I went to my new seat with great disgust and found it very inconvenient 
4899_32639_000032_000002	train-clean-360	The children could not cluster around me as they did before and I got on with the lesson very badly 
4899_32639_000032_000003	train-clean-360	I am sure Maria Perry has no gift at teaching little children and I feel quite vexed and disappointed 
none	none	This has not been a profitable Sunday and I and now going to bed cheerless and uneasy 
4899_32639_000033_000000	train-clean-360	AUG nine mister 
4899_32639_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Williams called this evening to say that I am to have my old seat and all the children again 
none	none	All the mothers had been to see him or had written him notes about it and requested that I continue to teach them mister Williams said he hoped I would go on teaching for twenty years and that as fast as his little girls grew old enough to come to Sunday school he should want me to take charge of them 
4899_32639_000033_000004	train-clean-360	I should have been greatly elated by these compliments but for the display I made of myself to Maria Perry on Sunday 
4899_32639_000033_000005	train-clean-360	Oh that I could learn to bridle my unlucky tongue 
none	none	JAN fifteen eighteen thirty five To day I am twenty 
4899_32639_000034_000001	train-clean-360	That sounds very old yet I feel pretty much as I did before 
none	none	I have begun to visit some of mother s poor folks with her and am astonished to see how they love her how plainly they let her talk to them 
4899_32639_000034_000003	train-clean-360	As a general rule I do not think poor people are very interesting and they are always ungrateful 
4899_32639_000035_000000	train-clean-360	We went first to see old Jacob Stone 
none	none	I have been there a good many times with the baskets of nice things mother takes such comfort in sending him but never would go in I was shocked to see how worn away he was 
4899_32639_000035_000003	train-clean-360	He seemed in great distress of mind and begged mother to pray with him 
4899_32639_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I do not see how she could 
none	none	I am perfectly sure that no earthly power could ever induce me to go round praying on bare floors with people sitting rocking and staring all the time as the two Stone girls stared at mother 
4899_32639_000035_000006	train-clean-360	How tenderly she prayed for him 
none	none	We then went to see Susan Green 
4899_32639_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She had made a carpet for her room by sewing together little bits of pieces given her I suppose by persons for whom she works for she goes about fitting and making carpets 
4899_32639_000036_000002	train-clean-360	It looked bright and cheerful 
none	none	She had a nice bed in the corner covered with a white quilt and some little ornaments were arranged about the room Mother complimented her on her neatness and said a queen might sleep in such a bed as that and hoped she found it as comfortable as it looked
4899_32639_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Mercy on us she cried out it ain t to sleep in 
none	none	I sleep up in the loft that I climb to by a ladder every night 
4899_32639_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Mother looked a little amused and then she sat and listened patiently to a long account of how the poor old thing had invested her money how mister Jones did not pay the interest regularly and how mister Stevens haggled about the percentage 
4899_32639_000038_000001	train-clean-360	After we came away I asked mother how she could listen to such a rigmarole in patience and what good she supposed she had done by her visit 
4899_32639_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Why the poor creature likes to show off her bright carpet and nice bed her chairs her vases and her knick knacks and she likes to talk about her beloved money and her bank stock 
4899_32639_000039_000001	train-clean-360	I may not have done her any good but I have given her a pleasure and so have you 
4899_32639_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I hardly spoke a word 
4899_32639_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but your mere presence gratified her 
4899_32639_000041_000001	train-clean-360	And if she ever gets into trouble she will feel kindly towards us for the sake of our sympathy with her pleasures and will let us sympathize with her sorrows 
4899_32639_000042_000000	train-clean-360	I confess this did not seem a privilege to be coveted 
4899_32639_000042_000001	train-clean-360	She is not nice at all and takes snuff 
4899_32639_000043_000000	train-clean-360	We went next to see Bridget Shannon 
4899_32639_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Mother had lost sight of her for some years and had just heard that she was sick and in great want We found her in bed there was no furniture in the room and three little half naked children sat with their bare feet in some ashes where there had been a little fire 
4899_32639_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Three such disconsolate faces I never saw 
none	none	Mother sent me to the nearest baker s for bread I ran nearly all the way and I hardly know which I enjoyed most mother s eagerness in distributing or the children s in clutching at and devouring it 
4899_32639_000043_000004	train-clean-360	I am going to cut up one or two old dresses to make the poor things something to cover them 
none	none	One of them has lovely hair that would curl beautifully if it were only brushed out I told her to come to see me to morrow she is so very pretty 
4899_32639_000043_000007	train-clean-360	Those few visits used up the very time I usually spend in drawing 
4899_32639_000043_000008	train-clean-360	But on the whole I am glad I went with mother because it has gratified her 
4899_32639_000043_000009	train-clean-360	Besides one must either stop reading the Bible altogether or else leave off spending one s whole time in just doing easy pleasant things one likes to do 
none	none	JAN twenty The little Shannon girl came and I washed her face and hands brushed out her hair and made it curl in lovely golden ringlets all round her sweet face and carried her in great triumph to mother
4899_32639_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Look at the dear little thing mother I cried doesn t she look like a line of poetry 
4899_32639_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 You foolish romantic child quoth mother 
4899_32639_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 She looks to me like a very ordinary line of prose 
4899_32639_000046_000002	train-clean-360	A slice of bread and butter and a piece of gingerbread mean more to her than these elaborate ringlets possibly can 
4899_32639_000046_000003	train-clean-360	They get in her eyes and make her neck cold see they are dripping with water and the child is all in a shiver 
4899_32639_000047_000000	train-clean-360	So saying mother folded a towel round its neck to catch the falling drops and went for bread and butter of which the child consumed a quantity that was absolutely appalling 
none	none	To crown all the ungrateful little thing would not so much as look at me from that moment but clung to mother turning its back upon me in supreme contempt Moral Mothers occasionally know more than their daughters do Chapter six VI JANUARY twenty four A Message came yesterday morning from Susan Green to the effect that she had had a dreadful fall and was half killed Mother wanted to set off at once to see her but I would not let her go as she has one of her worst colds She then asked me to go in her place I turned up my nose at the bare thought though I dare say it turns up enough on its own account Oh mother I said reproachfully that dirty old woman Mother made no answer and I sat down at the piano and played a little But I only played discords Do you think it is my duty to run after such horrid old women I asked mother at last I think dear you must make your own duties she said kindly I dare say that at your age I should have made a great deal out of my personal repugnance to such a woman as Susan and very little out of her sufferings I believe I am the most fastidious creature in the world Sick rooms with their intolerable smells of camphor and vinegar and mustard their gloom and their whines and their groans actually make me shudder But was it not just such fastidiousness that made Cha no I won t utter his name that made somebody weary of my possibilities And has that terrible lesson really done me no good JAN twenty six No sooner had I written the above than I scrambled into my cloak and bonnet and flew on the wings of holy indignation to Susan Green Such wings fly fast and got me a little out of breath I found her lying on that nice white bed of hers in a frilled cap and night gown It seems she fell from her ladder in climbing to the dismal den where she sleeps and lay all night in great distress with some serious internal injury I found her groaning and complaining in a fearful way Are you in such pain I asked as kindly as I could It isn t the pain she said it isn t the pain Its the way my nice bed is going to wreck and ruin and the starch all getting out of my frills that I fluted with my own hands And the doctor s bill and the medicines oh dear dear dear Just then the doctor came in After examining her he said to a woman who seemed to have charge of her Are you the nurse Oh no I only stepped in to see what I could do for her Who is to be with her to night then Nobody knew I will send a nurse then he said But some one else will be needed also he added looking at me I will stay I said But my heart died within me The doctor took me aside Her injuries are very serious be said If she has any friends they ought to be sent for You don t mean that she is going to die I asked I fear she is But not immediately He took leave and I went back to the bedside I saw there no longer a snuffy repulsive old woman but a human being about to make that mysterious journey a far country whence there is no return Oh how I wished mother were there Susan I said have you any relatives No I haven t she answered sharply And if I had they needn t come prowling around me I don t want no relations about my body Would you like to see doctor Cabot What should I want of doctor Cabot Don t tease child Considering the deference with which she had heretofore treated me this was quite a new order of things I sat down and tried to pray for her silently in my heart Who was to go with her on that long journey and where was it to end The woman who had been caring for her now went away and it was growing dark I sat still listening to my own heart which beat till it half choked me What were you and the doctor whispering about she suddenly burst out He asked me for one thing if you had any friends that could be sent for I ve been my own best friend she returned Who d have raked and scraped and hoarded and counted for Susan Green if I hadn t ha done it I ve got enough to make me comfortable as long as I live and when I lie on my dying bed But you can t carry it with you I said This highly original remark was all I had courage to utter I wish I could she cried I suppose you think I talk awful They say you are getting most to be as much of a saint as your ma It s born in some and in some it ain t Do get a light It s lonesome here in the dark and cold I was thankful enough to enliven the dark room with light and fire But I saw now that the thin yellow hard face had changed sadly She fixed her two little black eyes on me evidently startled by the expression of my face Look here child I ain t hurt to speak of am I The doctor says you are hurt seriously My tone must have said more than my words did for she caught me by the wrist and held me fast He didn t say nothing about my about it being dangerous I ain t dangerous am I I felt ready to sink Oh Susan I gasped out you haven t any time to lose You re going you re going Going she cried going where You don t mean to say I m a dying Why it beats all my calculations I was going to live ever so years and save up ever so much money and when my time come I was going to put on my best fluted night gown and night cap and lay my head on my handsome pillow and draw the clothes up over me neat and tidy and die decent But here s my bed all in a toss and my frills all in a crumple and my room all upside down and bottles of medicine setting around alongside of my vases and nobody here but you just a girl and nothing else All this came out by jerks as it were and at intervals Don t talk so I fairly screamed Pray pray to God to have mercy on you She looked at me bewildered but yet as if the truth had reached her at last Pray yourself she said eagerly I don t know how I can t think Oh my time s come my time s come And I ain t ready I ain t ready Get down on your knees and pray with all your might and main And I did she holding my wrist tightly in hard hand All at once I felt her hold relax After that the next thing I knew I was lying on the and somebody was dashing water in my face It was the nurse She had come at last and found me by the side of the bed where I had fallen and had been trying to revive me ever since I started up and looked about me The nurse was closing Susan s eyes in a professional way and performing other little services of the sort The room wore an air of perfect desolation The clothes Susan had on when she fell lay in a forlorn heap on a chair her shoes and stockings were thrown hither and thither the mahogany bureau in which she had taken so much pride was covered with vials to make room for which some pretty trifles had been hastily thrust aside I remembered what I had once said to missus Cabot about having tasteful things about me with a sort of shudder What a mockery they are in the awful presence of death Mother met me with open arms when I reached home She was much shocked at what I had to tell and at my having encountered such a scene alone I should have felt myself quite a heroine under her caresses if I had not been overcome with bitter regret that I had not with firmness and dignity turned poor Susan s last thoughts to her Saviour Oh how could I through miserable cowardice let those precious moments slip by Feb twenty seven I have learned one thing by yesterday s experience that is worth knowing It is this duty looks more repelling at a distance than when fairly faced and met Of course I have read the lines Nor know we anything so fair As is the smile upon thy face but I seem to be one of the stupid sort who never apprehend a thing till they experience it Now however I have seen the smile and find it so fair that I shall gladly plod through many a hardship and trial to meet it again Poor Susan Perhaps God heard my prayer for her soul and revealed Himself to her at the very last moment March two Such a strange thing has happened Susan Green left a will bequeathing her precious savings to whoever offered the last prayer in her hearing I do not want I never could touch a penny of that hardly earned store and if I did no earthly motive would tempt me to tell a human being that it was offered by me an inexperienced trembling girl driven to it by mere desperation So it has gone to doctor Cabot who will not use it for himself I am sure but will be delighted to have it to give to poor people who really besiege him The last time he called to see her he talked and prayed with her and says she seemed pleased and grateful and promised to be more regular at church which she had been ever since March twenty eight I feel all out of sorts Mother says it is owing to the strain I went through at Susan s dying bed She wants me to go to visit my aunt Mary who is always urging me to come But I do not like to leave my little Sunday scholars nor to give mother the occasion to deny herself in order to meet the expense of such a long journey Besides I should have to have some new dresses a new bonnet and lots of things To day doctor Cabot has sent me some directions for which I have been begging him a long time Lest I should wear out this precious letter by reading it over I will copy it here After alluding to my complaint that I still saw men as trees walking he says Yet he who first uttered this complaint had had his eyes opened by the Son of God and so have you Now He never leaves His work incomplete and He will gradually lead you into clear and open vision if you will allow Him to do it I say gradually because I believe this to be His usual method while I do not deny that there are cases where light suddenly bursts in like a flood To return to the blind man When Jesus found that his cure was not complete He put His hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly Now this must be done for you and in order to have it done you must go to Christ Himself not to one of His servants Make your complaint tell Him how obscure everything still looks to you and beg Him to complete your cure He may see fit to try your faith and patience by delaying this completion but meanwhile you are safe in His presence and while led by His hand He will excuse the mistakes you make and pity your falls But you will imagine that it is best that He should at once enable you to see clearly If it is you may be sure He will do it He never makes mistakes But He often deals far differently with His disciples He lets them grope their way in the dark until they fully learn how blind they are how helpless how absolutely in need of Him What His methods will be with you I cannot foretell But you may be sure that He never works in an arbitrary way He has a reason for everything He does You may not understand why He leads you now in this way and now in that but you may nay you must believe that perfection is stamped on His every act I am afraid that you are in danger of falling into an error only too common among young Christians You acknowledge that there has been enmity to towards God in your secret soul and that one of the first steps towards peace is to become reconciled to Him and to have your sins forgiven for Christ s sake This done you settle down with the feeling that the great work of life is done and that your salvation is sure Or if not sure that your whole business is to study your own case to see whether you are really in a state of grace Many persons never get beyond this point They spend their whole time in asking the question Do I love the Lord or no Am I His or am I not I beg you my dear child if you are doing this aimless useless work to stop short at once Life is to precious to spend in a tread mill Having been pardoned by your God and Saviour the next thing you have to do is to show your gratitude for this infinite favor by consecrating yourself entirely to Him body soul and spirit This is the least you can do He has bought you with a price and you are no longer your own But you may reply this is contrary to my nature I love my own way I desire ease and pleasure I desire to go to heaven to be carried thither on a bed of flowers Can I not give myself so far to God as to feel a sweet sense of peace with Him and be sure of final salvation and yet to a certain extent indulge and gratify myself If I give myself entirely away in Him and lose all ownership in myself He may deny me many things I greatly desire He may make my life hard and wearisome depriving me of all that now makes it agreeable But I reply this is no matter of parley and discussion it is not optional with God s children whether they will pay Him a part of the price they owe Him and keep back the rest He asks and He has a right to ask for all you have and all you are And if you shrink from what is involved in such a surrender you should fly to Him at once and never rest till He has conquered this secret disinclination to give to Him as freely and as fully as He has given to you It is true that such an act of consecration on your part may involve no little future discipline and correction As soon as you become the Lord s by your own deliberate and conscious act He will begin that process of sanctification which is to make you holy as He is holy perfect as He is perfect He becomes at once your physician as well as your dearest and best Friend but He will use no painful remedy that can be avoided Remember that it is His will that you should be sanctified and that the work of making you holy is His not yours At the same time you are not to sit with folded hands waiting for this blessing You are to avoid laying hindrances in His way and you are to exercise faith in Him as just as able and just as willing to give you sanctification as He was to give you redemption And now if you ask how you may know that you have truly consecrated yourself to Him I reply observe every in indication of His will concerning you no matter how trivial and see whether you at once close in with that will Lay down this principle as a law God does nothing arbitrary If He takes away your health for instance it is because He has some reason for doing so and this is true of everything you value and if you have real faith in Him you will not insist on knowing this reason If you find in the course of daily events that your self consecration was not perfect that is that your will revolts at His will do not be discouraged but fly to your Saviour and stay in His presence till you obtain the spirit in which He cried in His hour of anguish Father if Thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but Thine be done Every time you do this it will be easier to do it every such consent to suffer will bring you nearer and nearer to Him and in this nearness to Him you will find such peace such blessed sweet peace as will make your life infinitely happy no matter what may be its mere outside conditions Just think my dear Katy of the honor and the joy of having your will one with the Divine will and so becoming changed into Christ s image from glory to glory But I cannot say in a letter the tithe of what I want to say Listen to my sermons from week to week and glean from them all the instruction you can remembering that they are preached to you In reading the Bible I advise you to choose detached passages or even one verse a day rather whole chapters Study every word ponder and pray over it till you have got out of it all the truth it contains As to the other devotional reading it is better to settle down on a few favorite authors and read their works over and over and over until you have digested their thoughts and made them your own It has been said that a fixed inflexible will is a great assistance in a holy life You can will to choose for your associates those who are most devout and holy You can will to read books that will stimulate you in your Christian life rather than those that merely amuse You can will to use every means of grace appointed by God You can will to spend much time in prayer without regard to your frame at the moment You can will to prefer a religion of principle to one of mere feeling in other words to obey the will of God when no comfortable glow of emotion accompanies your obedience You cannot will to possess the spirit of Christ that must come as His gift but you can choose to study His life and to imitate it This will infallibly lead to such self denying work as visiting the poor nursing the sick giving of your time and money to the needy and the like If the thought of such self denial is repugnant to you remember that it is enough for the disciple to be as his Lord And let me assure you that as you penetrate the labyrinth of life in pursuit of Christian duty you will often be surprised and charmed by meeting your Master Himself amid its windings and turnings and receive His soul inspiring smile Or I should rather say you will always meet Him wherever you go I have read this letter again and again It has taken such hold of me that I can think of nothing else The idea of seeking holiness had never so much as crossed my mind And even now it seems like presumption for such a one as I to utter so sacred a word And I shrink from committing myself to such a pursuit lest after a time I should fall back into the old routine And I have an undefined wicked dread of being singular as well as a certain terror of self denial and loss of all liberty But no choice seems left to me Now that my duty has been clearly pointed out to me I do not stand where I did before And I feel mingled with my indolence and love of ease and pleasure some drawings towards a higher and better life There is one thing I can do and that is to pray that Jesus would do for me what He did for the blind man put His hands yet again upon my eyes and make me to see clearly And I will MARCH thirty Yes I have prayed and He has heard me I see that I have no right to live for myself and that I must live for Him I have given myself to Him as I never did before and have entered as it were a new world I was very happy when I began to believe in His love for me and that He had redeemed me But this new happiness is deeper it involves something higher than getting to heaven at last which has hitherto been my great aim March thirty one The more I pray and the more I read the Bible the more I feel my ignorance And the more earnestly I desire holiness the more utterly unholy I see myself to be But I have pledged myself to the Lord and I must pay my vows cost what in may I have begun to read Taylor s Holy Living and Dying A month ago I should have found it a tedious dry book But I am reading it with a sort of avidity like one seeking after hid treasure Mother observing what I was doing advised me to read it straight through but to mingle a passage now and then with chapters from other books She suggested my beginning on Baxter s Saints Rest and of that I have read every word I shall read it over as doctor Cabot advised till I have fully caught its spirit Even this one reading has taken away my lingering fear of death and made heaven awfully attractive I never mean to read worldly books again and my music and drawing I have given up forever Chapter seven VII Mother asked me last evening to sing and play to her I was embarrassed to know how to excuse myself without telling her my real reason for declining But somehow she got it out of me One need not be fanatical in order to be religious she said Is it fanatical to give up all for God I asked What is it to give up all she asked in reply Why to deny one s self every gratification and indulgence in order to mortify one s natural inclinations and to live entirely for Him God is then a hard Master who allows his children no liberty she replied Now let us see where this theory will lead you In the first place you must shut your eyes to all the beautiful things He has made You must shut your eyes to all the harmonies He has ordained You must shut your heart against all sweet human affections You have a body it is true and it may revolt at such bondage We are told to keep under the body I interrupted Oh mother don t hinder me You know my love for music is a passion and that it is my snare and temptation And how can I spend my whole time in reading the Bible and praying if I go on with my drawing It may do for other people to serve both God and Mammon but not for me I must belong wholly to the world or wholly to Christ Mother said no more and I went on with my reading But somehow my book seemed to have lost its flavor Besides it was time to retire for my evening devotions which I never put off now till the last thing at night as I used to do When I came down Mother was lying on the sofa by which I knew she was not well I felt troubled that I had refused to sing to her Think of the money she had spent on that part of my education I went to her and kissed her with a pang of terror What if she were going to be very sick and to die It is nothing darling she said nothing at all I am tired and felt a little faint I looked at her anxiously and the bare thought that she might die and leave me alone was so terrible that I could hardly help crying out And I saw as by a flash of lightning that if God took her from me I could not should not say Thy will be done But she was better after taking a few drops of lavender and what color she has came back to her dear sweet face APRIL twelve doctor Cabot s letter has lost all its power over me A stone has more feeling than I I don t love to pray I am sick and tired of this dreadful struggle after holiness good books are all alike flat and meaningless But I must have something to absorb and carry me away and I have come back to my music and my drawing with new zest Mother was right in warning me against giving them up Maria Kelley is teaching me to paint in oil colors and says I have a natural gift for it APRIL thirteen Mother asked me to go to church with her last evening and I said I did not want to go She looked surprised and troubled Are you not well dear she asked I don t know Yes I suppose I am But I could not be still at church five minutes I am nervous that I feel as if I should fly I see how it is she said you have forgotten that body of yours of which I reminded you and have been trying to live as if you were all soul and spirit You have been straining every nerve to acquire perfection whereas this is God s gift and one that He is willing to give you fully and freely I have done seeking for that or anything else that is good I said despondently And so I have gone back to my music and everything else Here is just the rock upon which you split she returned You speak of going back to your music as if that implied going away from God You rush from one extreme to another The only true way to live in this world constituted just as we are is to make all our employments subserve the one great end and aim of existence namely to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever But in order to do this we must be wise task masters and not require of ourselves what we cannot possibly perform Recreation we must have Otherwise the strings of our soul wound up to an unnatural tension will break Oh I do wish I cried that God had given us plain rules about which we could make no mistake I think His rules are plain she replied And some liberty of action He must leave us or we should become mere machines I think that those who love Him and wait upon Him day by day learn His will almost imperceptibly and need not go astray But mother music and drawing are sharp edged tools in such hands as mine I cannot be moderate in my use of them And the more I delight in them the less I delight in God Yes this is human nature But God s divine nature will supplant it if we only consent to let Him work in us of His own good pleasure New York April sixteen After all mother has come off conqueror and here I am at Aunty s After our quiet plain little home in our quiet little town this seems like a new world The house is large but is as full as it can hold Aunty has six children her own and has adopted two She says she ways meant to imitate the old woman who lived in a shoe She reminds me of mother and yet she is very different full of fun and energy flying about the house as on wings with a kind bright word for everybody All her household affairs go on like clock work the children are always nicely dressed nobody ever seems out of humor nobody is ever sick Aunty is the central object round which every body revolves you can t forget her a moment she is always doing something for you and then her unflagging good humor and cheerfulness keep you good humored and cheerful I don t wonder Uncle Alfred loves her so I hope I shall have just such a home I mean this is the sort of home I should like if I ever married which I never mean to do I should like to be just such a bright loving wife as Aunty is to have my husband lean on me as Uncle leans on her to have just as many children and to train them as wisely and kindly us she does hers Then I should feel that I had not been born in vain but had a high and sacred mission on earth But as it is I must just pick up what scraps of usefulness I can and let the rest go APRIL eighteen Aunty says I sit writing and reading and thinking too much and wants me to go out more I tell her I don t feel strong enough to go out much She says that is all nonsense and drags me out I get tired and hungry and sleep like a baby a month old I see now mother s wisdom and kindness in making me leave home when I did I had veered about from point to point till I was nearly ill Now Aunty keeps me well by making me go out and dear doctor Cabot s precious letter can work a true and not a morbid work in my soul I am very happy I have delightful talks with Aunty who sets me right at this point and at that and it is beautiful to watch her home life and to see with what sweet unconsciousness she carries her religion into every detail I am sure it must do me good to be here and yet if I am growing better how slowly how slowly it is Somebody has said that our course heavenward is like the plan of the zealous pilgrims of old who for every three steps forward took one backward APRIL thirty Aunty s baby my dear father s namesake and hitherto the merriest little fellow I ever saw was taken sick last night very suddenly She sent for the doctor at once who would not say positively what was the matter but this morning pronounced it scarlet fever The three youngest have all come down with it to day If they were my children I should be in a perfect worry and flurry Indeed I am as it is But Aunty is as bright and cheerful as ever She flies from one to another and keeps up their spirits with her own gayety I am mortified to find that at such a time as this I can think of myself and that I find it irksome to be shut up in sick rooms instead of walking driving visiting and the like But as doctor Cabot says I can now choose to imitate my Master who spent His whole life in doing good and I do hope too to be of some little use to Aunty after her kindness to me MAY one The doctor says the children are doing as well as could be expected He made a short visit this morning as it is Sunday If I had ever seen him before I should say I had some unpleasant association with him I wonder Aunty employs such a great clumsy man But she says he is good and very skillful I wish I did not take such violent likes and dislikes to people I want my religion to change me in every respect MAY two Oh I know now This is the very who was so rude at Sunday school and afterwards made such a nice address to the children Well he may know how to speak in public but I am sure he doesn t in private I never knew such a shut up man MAY four I have my hands as full as they can hold The children have got so fond of me and one or the other is in my lap nearly all the time I sing to them tell them stories build block houses and relieve Aunty all I can Dull and poky as the doctor is I am not afraid of him for he never notices anything I say or do so while he is holding solemn consultations with Aunty in one corner I can sing and talk all sorts of nonsense to my little pets in mine What fearful black eyes he has and what masses of black hair This busy life quite suits me now I have got used to it And it sweetens every bit of work to think that I am doing it in humble far off yet real imitation of Jesus I am indeed really and truly happy MAY fourteen It is now two weeks since little Raymond was taken sick and I have lived in the nursery all the time though Aunty has tried to make me go out Little Emma was taken down to day though she has been kept on the third floor all the time I feel dreadfully myself But this hard cold doctor of Aunty s is so taken up with the children that he never so much as looks at me I have been in a perfect shiver all day but these merciless little folks call for stories as eagerly as ever Well let me be a comfort to them if I can I hate selfishness more and more and am shocked to see how selfish I have been MAY fifteen I was in a burning fever all night and my head ached and my throat was and is very sore If knew I was going to die I would burn up this journal first I would not have any one see it for the world MAY twenty four doctor Elliott asked me on Sunday morning a week ago if I still felt well For answer I behaved like a goose and burst out crying Aunty looked more anxious than I have seen her look yet and reproached herself for having allowed me to be with the children She took me by one elbow and the doctor by the other and they marched me off to my own room where I was put through the usual routine on such occasions and then ordered to bed I fell asleep immediately and slept all day The doctor came to see me in the evening and made a short stiff little visit gave me a powder and said thought I should soon be better I had two such visits from him the next day when I began to feel quite like myself again and in spite of his grave staid deportment could not help letting my good spirits run away with me in a style that evidently shocked him He says persons nursing scarlet fever often have such little attacks as mine indeed every one of the servants have had a sore throat and headache MAY twenty five This morning just as the doctor shuffled in on his big feet it came over me how ridiculously I must have looked the day I was taken sick being walked off between Aunty and himself crying like a baby I burst out laughing and no consideration I could make to myself would stop me I pinched myself asked myself how I should feel if one of the children should die and used other kindred devices all to no purpose At last the doctor gravity personified as he is joined in though not knowing in the least what he was laughing at Then he said After this I suppose I shall have to pronounce you convalescent Oh no I cried I am very sick indeed This looks like it to be sure said Aunty I suppose this will be your last visit doctor Elliott I went on and I am glad of it After the way I behaved the day I was taken sick I have been ashamed to look you in the face But I really felt dreadfully He made no answer whatever I don t suppose he would speak a little flattering word by way of putting one in good humor with one s self for the whole world JUNE one We are all as well as ever but the doctor keeps some of the children still confined to the house for fear of bad consequences following the fever He visits them twice a day for the same reason or at least under that pretense but I really believe he comes because he has got the habit of coming and because he admires Aunty so much She has a real affection for him and is continually asking me if I don t like this and that quality in him which I can t see at all We be gin to drive out again The weather is very warm but I feel perfectly well JUNE two After the children s dinner to day I took care of them while their nurse got hers and Aunty went to lie down as she is all tired out We were all full of life and fun and some of the little ones wanted me to play a play of their own invention which was to lie down on the floor cover my face with a handkerchief and make believe I was dead They were to gather about me and I was suddenly to come to life and jump up and try to catch them as they all ran scampering and screaming about We had played in this interesting way for some time and my hair which I keep in nice order nowadays was pulled down and flying every way when in marched the doctor I started up and came to life quickly enough when I heard his step looking red and angry no doubt I should think you might have knocked doctor Elliott I said with much displeasure I ask your pardon I knocked several times he returned I need hardly ask how my little patients are No I replied still ruffled arid making desperate efforts to get my hair into some sort of order They are as well as possible I came a little earlier than usual to day he went on because I am called to visit my uncle doctor Cabot who is in a very critical state of health doctor Cabot I repeated bursting into tears Compose yourself I entreat he said I hope that I may be able to relieve him At all events At all events if you let him die it will break my heart I cried passionately Don t wait another moment go this instant I cannot go this instant he replied The boat does not leave until four o clock And if I may be allowed as a physician to say one word that my brief acquaintance hardly justifies I do wish to warn you that unless you acquire more self control Oh I know that I have a quick temper and that I spoke very rudely to you just now I interrupted not a little startled by the seriousness of his manner I did not refer to your temper he said I meant your whole passionate nature Your vehement loves and hates your ecstasies and your despondencies your disposition to throw yourself headlong into whatever interests you I would rather have too little self control I retorted resentfully than to be as cold as a stone and as hard as a rock and as silent as the grave like some people I know His countenance fell he looked disappointed even pained I shall probably see your mother he said turning to go your aunt wishes me to call on her have you any message No I said Another pained disappointed look made me begin to recollect myself I was sorry oh so sorry for my anger and rudeness I ran after him into the hall my eyes full of tears holding out both hands which he took in both his Don t go until you have forgiven me for being so angry I cried Indeed doctor Elliott though you not be able to believe it I am trying to do right all the time one do believe it he said earnestly Then tell me that you forgive me If I once begin I shall be tempted to tell something else he said looking me through and through with those great dusky eyes And I will tell it he went on his grasp on my hands growing firmer It is easy to forgive when one loves I pulled my hands away and burst out crying again Oh doctor Elliott this is dreadful I said You do not you cannot love me You are so much older than I am So grave and silent You are not in earnest I am only too much so he said and went quietly out I went back to the nursery The children rushed upon me and insisted that I should play die I let them pull me about as they pleased I only wished I could play it in earnest Chapter eight VIII JUNE twenty eight MOTHER writes me that doctor Cabot is out of danger doctor Elliott having thrown new light on his case and performed some sort of an operation that relieved him at once I am going home Nothing would tempt me to encounter those black eyes again Besides the weather is growing warm and Aunty is getting ready to go out of town with the children JUNE twenty nine Aunty insisted on knowing why I was hurrying home so suddenly and at last got it out of me inch by inch On the whole it was a relief to have some one to speak to Well she said and leaned back in her chair in a fit of musing Is that all you are going to say Aunty I ventured to ask at last No I have one more remark to add she said and it is this I don t know which of you has behaved most ridiculously It would relieve me to give you each a good shaking I think doctor Elliot has behaved ridiculously I said and he has made me most unhappy Unhappy she repeated I don t wonder you are unhappy You have pained and wounded one of the noblest men that walks the earth It is not my fault I never tried to make him like me Yes you did You were perfectly bewitching whenever he came here No mortal man could help being fascinated I knew this was not true and bitterly resented Aunty s injustice If I wanted to fascinate or bewitch a man I cried I should not choose one old enough to be my father nor one who was as uninteresting awkward and stiff as doctor Elliott Besides how should I know he was not married If I thought anything about it at all I certainly thought of him as a middle aged man settled down with a wife long ago In the first place he is not old or even middle aged He is not more than twenty seven or eight As to his being uninteresting perhaps he is to you who don t know him And if he were a married man what business had he to come here to see as he has done I did not know he came to see me he never spoke to me And I always said I would never marry a doctor We all say scores of things we live to repent she replied But I must own that the doctor acted quite out of character when he expected you to take a fancy to him on such short notice you romantic little thing Of course knowing him as little as you do and only seeing him in sick rooms you could not have done otherwise than as you did Thank you Aunty I said running and throwing my arms around her thank you with all my heart And now won t you take back what you said about my trying to fascinate him I suppose I must you dear child she said I was not half in earnest The truth is I am so fond of you both that the idea of your misunderstanding each other annoys me extremely Why you were made for each other He would tone you down and keep you straight and you would stimulate him and keep him awake I don t want to be toned down or kept straight I remonstrated I hate prigs who keep their wives in leading strings I do not mean to marry any one but if I should be left to such a piece of folly it must be to one who will take me for better for worse just as I am and not as a wild plant for him to prune till he has got it into a shape to suit him now Aunty promise me one thing Never mention doctor Elliott s name to me again I shall make no such promise she replied laughing I like him and I like to talk about him and the more you hate and despise him the more I shall love and admire him I only wish my Lucy were old enough to be his wife and that he could fancy her but he never could On the contrary I should think that little model of propriety would just suit him I exclaimed Don t make fun of Lucy Aunty said shaking her head She is a dear good child after all After all means this for what with my own observation and what Aunty has told me Lucy s portrait is easy to paint The child is the daughter of a man who died from a lingering illness caused by an accident She entered the family at a most inauspicious moment two days after this accident From the outset she comprehended the situation and took the ground that a character of irreproachable dignity and propriety became an infant coming at such a time She never cried never put improper objects into her mouth never bumped her head or scratched herself Once put to bed at night you knew nothing more of her till such time next day as you found it convenient to attend to her If you forgot her existence as was not seldom the case under the circumstances she vegetated on unmoved It is possible that pangs of hunger sometimes assailed her and it is a fact that she teethed had the measles and the whooping cough But these minute ripples on her infant life only showed the more clearly what a waveless placid little sea it was She got her teeth in the order laid down in Dewees on Children her measles came out on the appointed day like well behaved measles as they were and retired decently and in order as measles should Her whooping cough had a well bred methodical air and left her conqueror of the field As the child passed out of her babyhood she remained still her mother s appendage and glory a monument of pure white marble displaying to the human race one instance at least of perfect parental training Those smooth round hands were always magically clean the dress immaculate and uncrumpled the hair dutifully shining and tidy She was a model child as she had been a model baby No slamming of doors no litter of carpets no pattering of noisy feet on the stairs no headless dolls no soiled or torn books indicated her presence Her dolls were subject to a methodical training not unlike her own They rose they were dressed they took the air they retired for the night with clock like regularity At the advanced age of eight she ceased occupying herself with such trifles and began a course of instructive reading Her lessons were received in mute submission like medicine so many doses so many times a day An agreeable interlude of needlework was afforded and Dorcas like many were the garments that resulted for the poor Give her the very eyes out of your head cut off your right hand for her if you choose but don t expect a gush of enthusiasm that would crumple you collar she would as soon strangle herself as run headlong to embrace you If she has any passions or emotions they are kept under but who asks for passion in blanc mange or seeks emotion in a comfortable apple pudding When her father had been dead a year her mother married a man with a large family of children and a very small purse Lucy had a hard time of it especially as her step father a quick impulsive man took a dislike to her Aunty had no difficulty persuading them to give the child to her She took from the purest motives and it does seem as if she ought to have more reward than she gets She declares however that she has all the reward she could ask in the conviction that God accepts this attempt to please Him Lucy is now nearly fourteen very large of her age with a dead white skin pale blue eyes and a little light hair To hear her talk is most edifying Her babies are all babes she never begins anything but commences it she never cries she weeps never gets up in the morning but rises But what am I writing all this for Why to escape my own thoughts which are anything but agreeable companions and to put off answering the question which must be answered Have I really made a mistake in refusing doctor Elliott Could I not in time have come to love a man who has so honored me JULY five Here I am again safely at home and very pleasant it seems to be with dear mother again I have told her about doctor E She says very little about it one way or the other JULY ten Mother sees that I am restless and out of sorts What is it dear she asked this morning Has doctor Elliott anything to do with the unsettled state you are in Why no mother I answered My going away has broken up all my habits that s all Still if I knew doctor Elliott did not care much and was beginning to forget it I dare say I should feel better If you were perfectly sure that you could never return his affection she said you were quite right in telling him so at once But if you had any misgivings on the subject it would have been better to wait and to ask God to direct you Yes it would But at the moment I had no misgivings In my usual headlong style I settled one of the most weighty questions of my life without reflection without so much as one silent appeal to God to tell me how to act And now I have forever repelled and thrown away a heart that truly loved me He will go his way and I shall go mine He never will know what I am only just beginning to know myself that I yearn after his love with unutterable yearning I am not going to sit down in sentimental despondency to weep over this irreparable past No human being could forgive such folly as mine but God can In my sorrowfulness and loneliness I fly to Him and find what is better than earthly felicity the sweetest peace He allowed me to bring upon myself in one hasty moment a shadow out of which I shall not soon pass but He pities and He forgives me and I have had many precious moments when I could say sincerely and joyfully Whom have I in heaven but Thee and there is none upon earth that I desire besides Thee With a character still so undisciplined as mine I seriously doubt whether I could have made him who has honored me with his unmerited affection Sometimes I think I am as impetuous and as quick tempered as ever I get angry with dear mother and with James even if they oppose me how unfit then I am to become the mistress of a household and the wife of a good a man How came he to love me I cannot cannot imagine August thirty one The last day of the very happiest summer I ever spent If I had only been willing to believe the testimony of others I might have been just as happy long ago But I wanted to have all there was in God and all there was in the world at once and there was a constant painful struggle between the two I hope that struggle is now over I deliberately choose and prefer God I have found a sweet peace in trying to please Him such as I never conceived of I would not change it for all the best things this world can give But I have a great deal to learn I am like a little child who cannot run to get what he wants but approaches it step by step slowly timidly and yet approaches it I am amazed at the patience of my blessed Master and Teacher but how I love His school September This too has been a delightful month in a certain sense Amelia s marriage at which I had to be present upset me a little but it was but a little ruffle on a deep sea of peace I saw doctor Cabot to day He is quite well again and speaks of doctor Elliott s skill with rapture He asked about my Sunday scholars and my poor folks et cetera and I could not help letting out a little of the new joy that has taken possession of me This is as it should be he said I should be sorry to see a person of your temperament enthusiastic in everything save religion Do not be discouraged if you still have some ups and downs He that is down need fear no fall but you are away up on the heights and may have one now and then This made me a little uncomfortable I don t want any falls I want to go on to perfection OCT one Laura Cabot came to see me today and seemed very affectionate I hope we may see more of each other than we have done she began My father wishes it and so do I Katy mentally Ah He sees how unworldly how devoted I am and so wants Laura under my influence Katy aloud I am sure that is very kind Laura Not at all He knows it will be profitable to me to be with you I get a good deal discouraged at times and want a friend to strengthen and help me Katy to herself Yes yes he thinks me quite experienced and trustworthy Katy aloud I shall never dare to try to help you Laura Oh yes you must I am so far behind you in Christian experience But I am ashamed to write down any more After she had gone I felt delightfully puffed up for a while But when I came up to my room this evening and knelt down to pray everything looked dark and chaotic God seemed far away and I took no pleasure in speaking to Him I felt sure that I had done something or felt something wrong and asked Him to show me what it was There then flashed into my mind the remembrance of the vain conceited thoughts I had had during Laura s visit and ever since How perfectly contemptible I have had a fall indeed I think now my first mistake was in telling doctor Cabot my secret sacred joys as if some merit of mine had earned them for me That gave Satan a fine chance to triumph over me After this I am determined to maintain the utmost reserve in respect to my religious experiences Nothing is gained by running to tell them and much is lost I feel depressed and comfortless Chapter nine IX OCT ten WE have very sad news from Aunty She says my Uncle is quite broken down with some obscure disease that has been creeping stealthily along for months All his physicians agree that he must give up his business and try the effect of a year s rest doctor Elliott proposes his going to Europe which seems to me about as formidable as going to the next world Aunty makes the best she can of it but she says the thought of being separated from Uncle a whole year is dreadful I pray for her day and night that this wild project may be given up Why he would be on the ocean ever so many weeks exposed to all the discomforts of narrow quarters and poor food and that just as winter is drawing nigh OCT twelve Aunty writes that the voyage to Europe has been decided on and that doctor Elliott is to accompany Uncle travel with him amuse him and bring him home a well man I hope doctor E s power to amuse may exist somewhere but must own it was in a most latent form when I had the pleasure of knowing him Poor Aunty How much better it would be for her to go with Uncle There are the children to be sure Well I hope Uncle may be the better for this great undertaking but I don t like the idea of it OCT fifteen Another letter from Aunty and new plans The doctor is to stay at home Aunty is to go with Uncle and we mother and myself are to take possession of the house and children during their absence In other words all this is to be if we say amen Could anything be more frightful To refuse would be selfish and cruel If we consent I thrust myself under doctor Elliott s very nose OCT sixteen Mother is surprised that I can hesitate one instant She seems to have forgotten all about doctor E She says we can easily find a family to take this house for a year and that she is delighted to do anything for Aunty that can be done Nov four Here we are the whole thing settled Uncle and Aunty started a week ago and we are monarchs of all we survey and this is a great deal I am determined that mother shall not be worn out with these children although of course I could not them without her advice and help It is to be hoped they won t all have the measles in a body or anything of that sort I am sure it would be annoying to doctor E to come here now Nov twenty five Of course the baby must go on teething if only to have the doctor sent for to lance his gums I told mother I was sure I could not be present when this was being done so though she looked surprised and said people should accustom themselves to such things she volunteered to hold baby herself Nov twenty six The baby was afraid of mother not being used to her so she sent for me As I entered the room she gave him to me with an apology for doing so since I shrank from witnessing the operation What must doctor E think I am made of if I can t bear to see a child s gums lanced However it is my own fault that he thinks me such a coward for I made mother think me one It was very embarrassing to hold baby and have the doctor s face so close to mine I really wonder mother should not see how awkwardly I am situated here Nov twenty seven We have a good many visitors friends of Uncle and Aunty How uninteresting most people are They all say the same thing namely how strange that Aunty had courage to undertake such a voyage and to leave her children et cetera et cetera et cetera and what was doctor Elliott thinking of to let them go et cetera et cetera et cetera doctor Embury called to day with a pretty little fresh creature his new wife who hangs on his arm like a work bag He is doctor Elliott s intimate friend and spoke of him very warmly and so did his wife who says she has known him always as they were born and brought up in the same village I wonder he did not marry her himself instead of leaving her for doctor Embury She says he doctor Elliott I mean was the most devoted son she ever saw and that he deserves his present success because he has made such sacrifices for his parents I never met any one whom I liked so well on so short acquaintance I mean missus Embury though you might fancy you poor deluded journal you that I meant somebody else Nov thirty I have so much to do that I have little time for writing The way the children wear out their shoes and stockings the speed with which their hair grows the way they bump their heads and pinch their fingers and the insatiable demand for stories is something next to miraculous Not a day passes that somebody doesn t need something bought that somebody else doesn t choke itself and that I don t have to tell stories till I feel my intellect reduced to the size of a pea If ever I was alive and wide awake however it is just now and in spite of some vague shadows of I don t know what I am very happy indeed So is dear mother She and the doctor have become bosom friends He keeps her making beef tea scraping lint and boiling calves feet for jelly till the house smells like an hospital I suppose he thinks me a poor selfish frivolous girl whom nothing would tempt to raise a finger for his invalids But of course I do not care what he thinks Dec four doctor Elliott came this morning to ask mother to go with him to see a child who had met with a horrible accident She turned pale and pressed her lips together but went at once to get ready Then my long suppressed wrath burst out How can you ask poor mother to go and see such sights I cried You must think her nothing but a stone if you suppose that after the way in which my father died It was indeed most thoughtless in me he interrupted but your mother is such a rare woman so decided and self controlled yet so gentle so full of tender sympathy that I hardly know where to look for just the help I need to day If you could see this poor child even you would justify me Even you you monster of selfishness heart of stone floating bubble even you would justify it How cruel how unjust how unforgiving he is I rushed out of the room and cried until I was tired DEC six Mother says she feels really grateful to doctor E for taking her to see that child and to help soothe and comfort it while he went through with a severe painful operation which she would not describe because she fancied I looked pale I said I should think the child s mother the most proper person to soothe it on such an occasion The poor thing has no mother she said reproachfully What has got into you Kate You do not seem at all like yourself I should think you had enough to do with this great house to keep in order so many mouths to fill and so many servants to oversee without wearing yourself out with nursing all doctor Elliott s poor folks I said gloomily The more I have to do the happier I am she replied Dear Katy the old wound isn t healed yet and I like to be with those who have wounds and bruises of their own And doctor Elliott seems to have divined this by instinct I ran and kissed her dear pale face which grows more beautiful every day No wonder she misses father so He loved and honored her beyond description and never forgot one of those little courtesies which must have a great deal to do with a wife s happiness People said of him that he was a gentleman of the old school and that race is dying out I feel a good deal out of sorts myself Oh I do so wish to get above myself and all my childish petty ways and to live in a region where there is no temptation and no sin DEC twenty two I have been to see missus Embury to day She did not receive me as cordially as usual and I very soon resolved to come away She detained me however Would you mind my speaking to you on a certain subject she asked with some embarrassment I felt myself flush up I do not want to meddle with affairs that don t concern me she went on but doctor Elliott and I have been intimate friends all our lives And his disappointment has really distressed me One of my moods came on and I couldn t speak a word You are not at all the sort of a girl I supposed he would fancy she continued He always has said he was waiting to find some one just like his mother and she is one of the gentlest meekest sweetest and fairest among women You ought to rejoice then that he has escaped the snare I said in a husky voice and is free to marry his ideal when he finds her But that is just what troubles me He is not free He does not attach himself readily and I am afraid that it will be a long long time before he gets over this unlucky passion for you Passion I cried contemptuously She looked at me with some surprise and then went on Most girls would jump at the chance of getting such a husband I don t know that I particularly care to be classed with most girls I replied loftily But if you only knew him as well as I do He is so noble so disinterested and is so beloved by his patients I could tell you scores of anecdotes about him that would show just what he is Thank you I said I think we have discussed doctor Elliott quite enough already I cannot say that he has elevated himself in my opinion by making you take up the cudgels in his defence You do him injustice when you say that she cried His sister the only person to whom he confided the state of things begged me to find out if I could whether you had any other attachment and if her brother s case was quite hopeless But I am sorry I undertook the task as it has annoyed you so much I came away a good deal ruffled When I got home mother said she was glad I had been out at last for a little recreation and that she wished I did not confine myself so to the children I said that I did not confine myself more than Aunty did But that is different mother objected She is their own mother and love helps her to bear her burden So it does me I returned I love the children exactly as if they were my own That she said is impossible I certainly do I persisted Mother would not dispute with me though I wished she would A mother she went on receives her children one at a time and gradually adjusts herself to gradually increasing burdens But you take a whole houseful upon you at once and I am sure it is too much for you You do not look or act like yourself It isn t the children I said What is it then Why it s nothing I said pettishly I must say dear said mother not noticing my manner that your wonderful devotion to the children aside from its effect on your health and temper has given me great delight I don t see why I said Very few girls of your age would give up their whole time as you do to such work That is because very few girls are as fond of children as I am There is no virtue in doing exactly what one likes best to do There go away you contrary child said mother laughing If you won t be praised you won t So I came up here and moped a little I don t see what ails me But there is an under current of peace that is not entirely disturbed by any outside event In spite of my follies and my shortcomings I do believe that God loves and pities me and will yet perfect that which concerneth me It is a great mystery But so is everything doctor Elliott to missus Crofton And now my dear friend having issued my usual bulletin of health you may feel quite at ease about your dear children and I come to a point in your letter which I would gladly pass over in silence But this would be but a poor return for the interest you express in my affairs Both ladies are devoted to your little flock and Miss Mortimer seems not to have a thought but for them The high opinion I formed of her at the outset is more than justified by all I see of her daily household life I know what her faults are for she seems to take delight in revealing them But I also know her rare virtues and what a wealth of affection she has to bestow on the man who is so happy as to win her heart But I shall never be that man Her growing aversion to me makes me dread a summons to your house and I have hardly manliness enough to conceal the pain this gives me I entreat you therefore never again to press this subject upon me After all I would not if I could dispense with the ministry of disappointment and unrest missus Crofton in reply So she hates you does she I am charmed to hear it Indifference would be an alarming symptom but good cordial hatred or what looks like it is a most hopeful sign The next chance you get to see her alone assure her that you never shall repeat your first offence If nothing comes of it I am not a woman and never was one nor is she MARCH twenty five eighteen thirty six The New Year and my birthday have come and gone and this is the first moment I could find for writing down all that has happened The day after my last date I was full of serious earnest thoughts of new desires to live without one reserve for God I was smarting under the remembrance of my folly at missus Embury s and with a sense of vague disappointment and discomfort and had to fly closer than ever to Him In the evening I thought I would go to the usual weekly service It is true I don t like prayer meetings and that is a bad sign I am afraid But I am determined to go where good people go and see if I can t learn to like what they like Mother went with me of course What was my surprise to find that doctor E was to preside I had no idea that he was that sort of a man The hymns they sang were beautiful and did me good So was his prayer If all prayers were like that I am sure I should like evening meetings as much as I now dislike them He so evidently spoke to God in it and as if he were used to such speaking He then made a little address on the ministry of disappointments as he called it He spoke so cheerfully and hopefully that I began to see almost for the first time God s reason for the petty trials and crosses that help to make up every day of one s life He said there were few who were not constantly disappointed with themselves with their slow progress their childishness and weakness disappointed with their friends who strangely enough were never quite perfect enough and disappointed with the world which was always promising so much and giving so little Then he urged to a wise and patient consent to this discipline which if rightly used would help to temper and strengthen the soul against the day of sorrow and bereavement But I am not doing him justice in this meagre report there was something almost heavenly in his expression which words cannot describe Coming out I heard some one ask Who was that young clergyman and the answer Oh that is only a doctor Well the next week I went again with mother We had hardly taken our seats when doctor E marched in with the sweetest looking little creature I ever saw He was so taken up with her that he did not observe either mother or myself As she sat by my side I could not see her full face but her profile was nearly perfect Her eyes were of that lovely blue one sees in violets and the skies with long soft eye lashes and her complexion was as pure as a baby s Yet she was not one of your doll beauties her face expressed both feeling and character They sang together from the same book though I offered her a share of mine Of course when people do that it can mean but one thing So it seems he has forgotten me and consoled himself with this pretty little thing No doubt she is like his mother that gentlest meekest sweetest and fairest among women Now if anybody should be sick and he should come here I thought what would become of me I certainly could not help showing that a love that can so soon take up with a new object could not have been a sentiment of much depth It is not pleasant to lose even a portion of one s respect and esteem for another The next day mother went to visit an old friend of hers who has a beautiful place outside of the city The baby s nurse had ironing to do so I promised to sit in the nursery till it was finished Lucy came with her books to sit with me She always follows like my shadow After a while missus Embury called I hesitated a little about trusting the child to Lucy s care for though her prim ways have given her the reputation of being wise beyond her years I observe that she is apt to get into trouble which a quick witted child would either avoid or jump out of in a twinkling However children are often left to much younger girls so with many cautions I went down resolving to stay only a few moments But I wanted so much to know all about that pretty little friend of doctor E s that I let missus Embury stay on and on though not a ray of light did I get for my pains At last I heard Lucy s step coming downstairs Cousin Katy she said entering the room with her usual propriety I was seated by the window engaged with my studies and the children were playing about as usual when suddenly I heard a shriek and one of them ran past me all in a blaze and I believe I pushed her out of my way as I rushed upstairs for I took it for granted I should meet the little figure all in a blaze coming to meet me But I found it wrapped in a blanket the flames extinguished Meanwhile missus Embury had roused the whole house and everybody came running upstairs Get the doctor some of you I cried clasping the poor little writhing form in my arms And then I looked to see which of them it was and found it was Aunty s pet lamb everybody s pet lamb our little loving gentle Emma doctor Elliott must have come on wings for I had not time to be impatient for his arrival He was as tender as a woman with Emma we cut off and tore off her clothes wherever the fire had touched her and he dressed the burns with his own hands He did not speak a word to me or I to him This time he did not find it necessary to advise me to control my self I was as cold and hard as a stone But when poor little Emma s piercing shrieks began to subside and she came a little under the influence of some soothing drops he had given her at the outset I began to feel that sensation in the back of my neck that leads to conquest over the most stubborn and the most heroic I had just time to get Emma into the doctor s arms and then down I went I got over it in a minute and was up again before any one had time to come to the rescue But doctor E gave Emma to missus Embury who had taken off her things and been crying all the time and said in a low voice I beg you will now leave the room and lie down And do not feel obliged to see me when I visit the child That annoyance at least you should spare yourself No consideration shall make me neglect little Emma I replied defiantly By this time missus Embury had rocked her to sleep and she lay pale and with an air of complete exhaustion in her arms You must lie down now Miss Mortimer doctor Elliott said as he rose to go I will return in a few hours to see how you both do He stood looking at Emma but did not go Then missus Embury asked the question I had not dared to ask Is the poor child in danger I cannot say I trust not Miss Mortimer s presence of mind in extinguishing the flames at once has I hope saved its life It was not my presence of mind it was Lucy s I cried eagerly Oh how I envied her for being the heroine and for the surprised delighted smile with which he went and took her hand saying I congratulate you Lucy How your mother will rejoice at this I tried to think of nothing but poor little Emma and of the reward Aunty had had for her kindness to Lucy But I thought of myself and how likely it was that under the same circumstances I should have been beside myself and done nothing This and many other emotions made me burst out crying Yes cry cry with all your heart said missus Embury laying Emma gently down and coming to get me into her arms It will do you good poor child She cried with me till at last I could lie down and try to sleep Well the days and the weeks were very long after that Dear mother had a hard time what with her anxiety about Emma and my crossness and unreasonableness doctor Elliott came and went came and went At last he said all danger was over and that our patient little darling would get well But his visits did not diminish he came twice and three times every day Sometimes I hoped he would tell us about his new flame and sometimes I felt that I could not hear her mentioned One day mother was so unwell that I had to help him dress Emma s burns and I could not help saying Even a mother s gentlest touch full of love as it is is almost rough compared with that of one trained to such careful handling as you are He looked gratified but said I am glad you begin to find that even stones feel sometimes Another time something was said about the fickleness of women missus Embury began it I fired up of course He seemed astonished at my attack I said nothing he declared No but you looked a good many things Now the fact is women are not fickle When they lose what they value most they find it impossible to re place it But men console themselves with the first good thing that comes along I dare say I spoke bitterly for I was thinking how soon Ch I mean somebody replaced me in his shallow heart and how with equal speed doctor Elliott had helped himself to a new love I do not like these sweeping assertions said doctor Elliott looking a good deal annoyed I have to say what I think I persisted It is well to think rightly then he said gravely By the bye have you heard from Helen missus Embury most irreverently asked Yes I heard yesterday I suppose you will be writing her then Will you enclose a little note from me Or rather let me have the least corner of your sheet I was shocked at her want of delicacy Of course this Helen must be the new love and how could a woman with two grains of sense imagine he would want to spare her a part of his sheet I felt tired and irritated As soon as doctor Elliott had gone I began to give her a good setting down I could hardly believe my ears I said when I heard you ask leave to write on doctor Elliott s sheet No wonder she said laughing I suppose you never knew what it was to have to count every shilling and to deny yourself the pleasure of writing to a friend because of what it would cost I m sure I never did till I was married But to ask him to let you help write his love letters I objected Ah is that the way the wind blows she cried nodding her pretty little head Well then let me relieve your mind my dear by informing you that this love letter is to his sister my dearest friend and the sweetest little thing you ever saw Oh I said and immediately felt quite rested and quite like myself Like myself And who is she pray Two souls dwell in my poor little body and which of them is me and which of them isn t it would be hard to tell This is the way they behave SCENE FIRST Katy to the other creature whom I will call Kate Your mother looks tired and you have been very cross Run and put your arms around her and tell her how you love her Kate Oh I can t it would look queer I don t like palaver Besides who would not be cross who felt as I do SCENE SECOND Katy Little Emma has nothing to do and ought to be amused Tell her a story do Kate I am tired and need to be amused myself Katy But the dear little thing is so patient and has suffered so much Kate Well I have suffered too If she had not climbed up on the fender she would not have got burned SCENE THIRD Kate You are very irritable to day You had better go upstairs to your room and pray for patience Katy One can t be always praying I don t feel like it SCENE FOURTH Katy You treat doctor Elliott shamefully I should think he would really avoid you as you avoid him Kate Don t let me hear his name I don t avoid him Katy You do not deserve his good opinion Kate Yes I do SCENE FIFTH Just awake in the morning Katy Oh dear how hateful I am I am cross and selfish and domineering and vain I think of myself the whole time I behave like a heroine when doctor Elliott is present and like a naughty spoiled child when he is not Poor mother how can she endure me As to my piety it is worse than none Kate a few hours later Well nobody can deny that I have a real gift in managing children And I am very lovable or mother wouldn t be so fond of me I am always pleasant unless I am sick or worried and my temper is not half so hasty as it used to be I never think of myself but am all the time doing something for others As to doctor E I am thankful to say that I have never stooped to attract him by putting on airs and graces He sees me just as I am And I am very devout I love to read good books and to be with good people I pray a great deal The bare thought of doing wrong makes me shudder Mother is proud of me and I don t wonder Very few girls would have behaved as I did when Emma was burned Perhaps I am not as sweet as some people I am glad of it I hate sweet people I have great strength of character which is much better and am certainly very high toned But my poor journal you can t stand any more such stuff can you But tell me one thing am I Katy or am I Kate Chapter ten X APRIL twenty YESTERDAY I felt better than I have done since the accident I ran about the house quite cheerily for me I wanted to see mother for something and flew singing into the parlor where I had left her shortly before But she was not there and doctor Elliott was I started back and was about to leave the room but he detained me Come in I beg of you he said his voice grow mg hoarser and hoarser Let us put a stop to this To what I asked going nearer and nearer and looking up into his face which was quite pale To your evident terror of being alone with me of hearing me speak Let me assure you once for all that nothing would tempt me to annoy you by urging myself upon you as you seem to fear I may be tempted to do I cannot force you to love me nor would I if I could If you ever want a friend you will find one in me But do not think of me as your lover or treat me as if I were always lying in wait for a chance to remind you of it That I shall never do never Oh no of course not I broke forth my face all in a glow and tears of mortification raining down my cheeks I knew you did not care for me I knew you had got over it I don t know which of us began it I don t think he did and I am sure I did not but the next moment I was folded all up in his great long arms and a new life had begun Mother opened the door not long after and seeing what was going on trotted away on her dear feet as fast as she could APRIL twenty one I am too happy to write journals To think how we love each other Mother behaves beautifully APRIL twenty five One does not feel like saying much about it when one is as happy as I am I walk the streets as one treading on air I fly about the house as on wings I kiss everybody I see Now that I look at Ernest for he makes me call him so with unprejudiced eyes I wonder I ever thought him clumsy And how ridiculous it was in me to confound his dignity and manliness with age It is very odd however that such a cautious well balanced man should have fallen in love with me that day at Sunday school And still stranger that with my headlong impulsive nature I deliberately walked into love with him I believe we shall never get through with what we have to say to each other I am afraid we are rather selfish to leave mother to herself every evening SEPT five This has been a delightful summer To be sure we had to take the children to the country for a couple of months but Ernest s letters are almost better than Ernest himself I have written enough to him to fill a dozen books We are going back to the city now In his last letter Ernest says he has been home and that his mother is delighted to hear of his engagement He says too that he went to see an old lady one of the friends of his boyhood to tell the news to her When I told her he goes on that I had found the most beautiful the noblest the most loving of human beings she only said Of course of course Now you know dear that it is not at all of course but the very strangest most wonderful event in the history of the world And then he described a scene he had just witnessed at the deathbed of a young girl of my own age who left this world and every possible earthly joy with a delight in the going to be with Christ that made him really eloquent Oh how glad I am that God has cast in my lot with a man whose whole business is to minister to others I am sure this will of itself keep him unworldly and unselfish How delicious it is to love such a character and how happy I shall be to go with him to sick rooms and to dying beds He has already taught me that lessons learned in such scenes far outweigh in value what books and sermons even can teach And now my dear old journal let me tell you a secret that has to do with life and not with death I am going to be married To think that I am always to be with Ernest To sit at the table with him every day to pray with him to go to church with him to have him all mine I am sure that there is not another man on earth whom I could love as I love him The thought of marrying Ch I mean of having that silly school girl engagement end in marriage was always repugnant to me But I give myself to Ernest joyfully and with all my heart How good God has been to me I do hope and pray that this new this absorbing love has not detached my soul from Him will not detach it If I knew it would could I should I have courage to cut it off and cast it from me JAN sixteen eighteen thirty seven Yesterday was my birthday and to day is my wedding day We meant to celebrate the one with the other but Sunday would come this year on the fifteenth I am dressed and have turned everybody out of this room where I have suffered so much mortification and experienced so much joy that before I give myself to Ernest and before I leave home forever I may once more give myself away to God I have been too much absorbed in my earthly love and am shocked to find how it fills my thoughts But I will belong to God I will begin my married life in His fear depending on Him to make me an unselfish devoted wife JAN twenty five We had a delightful trip after the wedding was over Ernest proposed to take me to his own home that I might see his mother and sister He never has said that he wanted them to see me But his mother is not well I am heartily glad of it I mean I was glad to escape going there to be examined and criticised Every one of them would pick at me I am sure and I don t like to be picked at We have a home of our own and I am trying to take kindly to housekeeping Ernest is away a great deal more than I expected he would be I am fearfully lonely Aunty comes to see me as often as she can and I go there almost every day but that doesn t amount to much As soon as I can venture to it I shall ask Ernest to let me invite mother to come and live with us It is not right for her to be left all alone so I hoped he would do that himself But men are not like women We think of everything FEB fifteen Our honeymoon ends to day There hasn t been quite as much honey in it as I expected I supposed that Ernest would be at home every evening at least and that he would read aloud and have me play and sing and that we should have delightful times together But now he has got me he seems satisfied and goes about his business as if he had been married a hundred years In the morning he goes off to see his list of patients he is going in and out all day after dinner we sit down to have a nice talk together the door bell invariably rings and he is called away Then in the evening he goes and sits in his office and studies I don t mean every minute but he certainly spends hours there To day he brought me such a precious letter from dear mother I could not help crying when I read it it was so kind and so loving Ernest looked amazed he threw down his paper came and took me in his arms and asked What is the matter darling Then it all came out I said I was lonely and hadn t been used to spending my evenings all by myself You must get some of your friends to come and see you poor child he said I don t want friends I sobbed out I want you Yes darling why didn t you tell me so sooner Of course I will stay with you if you wish it If that is your only reason I am sure I don t want you I pouted He looked puzzled I really don t know what to do he said with a most comical look of perplexity But he went to his office and brought up a pile of fusty old books Now dear he said we understand each other I think I can read here just as well as down stairs Get your book and we shall be as cosy as possible My heart felt sore and dissatisfied Am I unreasonable and childish What is married life An occasional meeting a kiss here and a caress there or is it the sacred union of the twain who walk together side by side knowing each other s joys and sorrows and going Heavenward hand in hand FEB seventeen missus Embury has been here to day I longed to compare notes with her and find out whether it really is my fault that I am not quite happy But I could not bear to open my heart to her on so sacred a subject We had some general conversation however which did me good for the time at least She said she thought one of the first lessons a wife should learn is self forgetfulness I wondered if she had seen anything in me to call forth this remark We meet pretty often partly because our husbands are such good friends partly because she is as fond of music as I am and we like to sing and play together and I never see her that she does not do or say something elevating something that strengthens my own best purposes and desires But she knows nothing of my conflict and dismay and never will Her gentle nature responds at once to holy influences I feel truly grateful to her for loving me for she really does love me and yet she must see my faults I should like to know if there is any reason on earth why a woman should learn self forgetfulness that does not apply to a man FEB eighteen Uncle says he has no doubt he owes his oneife to Ernest who in the face of opposition to other physicians insisted on his giving up his business and going off to Europe at just the right moment For his partner whose symptoms were very like his own has been stricken down with paralysis and will not recover It Is very pleasant to hear Ernest praised and it is a pleasure I have very often for his friends come to see me and speak of him with rapture A lady told me that through the long illness of a sweet young daughter of hers he prayed with her every day ministering so skillfully to her soul that all fear of death was taken away and she just longed to go and did go at last with perfect delight I think he spoke of her to me once but he did not tell me that her preparations for death was his work I could not conceive of him as doing that FEB twenty four Ernest has been gone a week His mother is worse and he had to go I wanted to go too but he said it was not worth while as he should have to return directly doctor Embury takes charge of his patients during his absence and missus E and Aunty and the children come to see me very often I like missus Embury more and more She is not so audacious as I am but I believe she agrees with me more than she will own FEB twenty five Ernest writes that his mother is dangerously ill and seems in great distress I am mean enough to want all his love myself while I should hate him if he gave none to her Poor Ernest If she should die he would be sadly afflicted FEB twenty seven She died the very day he wrote How I long to fly to him and to comfort him I can think of nothing else I pray day and night that God would make me a better wife A letter came from mother at the same time with Ernest s She evidently misses me more than she will own Just as soon as Ernest returns home I will ask him to let her come and live with us I am sure he will he loves her already and now that his mother has gone he will find her a real comfort I am sure she will only make our home the happier FEB twenty eight Such a dreadful thing is going to happen I have cried and called myself names by turns all day Ernest writes that it has been decided to give up the old homestead and scatter the family about among the married sons and daughters Our share is to be his father and his sister Martha and he desires me to have two rooms got ready for them at once So all the glory and the beauty is snatched out of my married life at one swoop And it is done by the hand I love best and that I would not have believed could be so unkind I am rent in pieces by conflicting emotions and passions One moment I am all tenderness and sympathy for poor Ernest and ready to sacrifice everything for his pleasure The next I am bitterly angry with him for disposing of all my happiness in this arbitrary way If he had let me make common cause with him and share his interests with him I know I am not so abominably selfish as to feel as I do now But he forces two perfect strangers upon me and forever shuts our doors against my darling mother For of course she cannot live with us if they do And who knows what sort of people they are It is not everybody I can get along with nor is it everybody can get along with me Now if Helen were coming instead of Martha that would be some relief I could love her I am sure and she would put up with my ways But your Marthas I am afraid of Oh dear dear what a nest of scorpions this affair has stirred up within me Who would believe I could be thinking of my own misery while Ernest s mother whom he loved so dearly is hardly in her grave But I have no heart I am stony and cold It is well to have found out just what I am Since I wrote that I have been trying to tell God all about it But I could not speak for crying And I have been getting the rooms ready How many little things I had planned to put in the best one which I intended for mother I have made myself arrange them just the same for Ernest s father The stuffed chair I have had in my room and enjoyed so much has been rolled in and the Bible with large print placed on the little table near which I had pictured mother with her sweet pale face as sitting year after year The only thing I have taken away is the copy of father s portrait He won t want that When I had finished this business I went and shook my fist at the creature I saw in the glass You re beaten I I cried You didn t want to give up the chair nor your writing table nor the Bible in which you expect to record the names of your ten children I But you ve had to do it so there MARCH three They all got here at seven o clock last night just in time for tea I was so glad to get hold of Ernest once more that I was gracious to my guests too The very first thing however Ernest annoyed me by calling me Katherine though he knows I hate that name and want to be called Katy as if I were a lovable person as I certainly am sometimes Of course his father and Martha called me Katherine too His father is even taller darker blacker eyed blacker haired than he Martha is a spinster I had got up a nice little supper for them thinking they would need something substantial after their journey And perhaps there was some vanity in the display of dainties that needed the mortification I felt at seeing my guests both push away their plates in apparent disgust Ernest too looked annoyed and expressed some regret that they could find nothing to tempt their appetites Martha said something about not expecting much from young housekeepers which I inwardly resented for the light delicious bread had been sent by Aunty together with other luxuries from her own table and I knew they were not the handiwork of a young housekeeper but of old Chloe who had lived in her own and her mother s family twenty years Ernest went out as soon as this unlucky repast was over to hear doctor Embury s report of his patients and we passed a dreary evening as my mind was preoccupied with longing for his return The more I tried to think of something to say the more I couldn t At last Martha asked at what time we breakfasted At half past seven precisely I answered Ernest is very punctual about breakfast The other meals are more irregular That is very late she returned Father rises early and needs his breakfast at once I said I would see that he had it as early as he liked while I foresaw that this would cost me a battle with the divinity who reigned in the kitchen You need not trouble yourself I will speak to my brother about it she said Ernest has nothing to do with it I said quickly She looked at me in a speechless way and then there was a long silence during which she shook her head a number of times At last she inquired Did you make the bread we had on the table to night No I do not know how to make bread I said smiling at her look of horror Not know how to make bread she cried The very spirit of mischief got into me and made me ask Why can you Now I know there is but one other question I could have asked her less insulting than this and that is Do you know the Ten Commandments A spinster fresh from a farm not know how make bread to be sure But in a moment I was ashamed and sorry that I had yielded to myself so far as to forget the courtesy due to her as my guest and one just home from a scene of sorrow so I rushed across the room seized her hand and said eagerly Do forgive me It slipped out before I thought She looked at me in blank amazement unconscious that there was anything to forgive How you startled me she said I thought you had suddenly gone crazy I went back to my seat crestfallen enough All this time Ernest s father had sat grim and grave in his corner without a word But now he spoke At what hour does my son have family worship I should like to retire I feel very weary Now family worship at night consists in our kneeling down together hand in hand the last thing before going to bed and in our own room The awful thought of changing this sweet informal habit into a formal one made me reply quickly Oh Ernest is very irregular about it He is often out in the evening and sometimes we are quite late I hope you never will feel obliged to wait for him I trust I shall do my duty whatever it costs was the answer Oh how I wished they would go to bed It was now ten o clock and I felt tired and restless When Ernest is out late I usually lie on the sofa and wait for him and so am bright and fresh when he comes in But now I had to sit up and there was no knowing for how long I poked at the fire and knocked down the shovel and tongs now I leaned back in my chair and now I leaned forward and then I listened for his step At last he came What are you not all gone to bed he asked As if I could go to bed when I had scarcely seen him a moment since his return I explained why we waited and then we had prayer and escorted our guests to their rooms When we got back to the parlor I was thankful to rest my tired soul in Ernest s arms and to hear what little he had to tell about his mother s last hours You must love me more than ever now he said for I have lost my best friend Yes I said I will As if that were possible All the time we were talking I heard the greatest racket overhead but he did not seem to notice it I found this morning that Martha or her father or both together had changed the positions of article of furniture in the room making it look a fright Chapter eleven XI MARCH ten THINGS are even worse than I expected Ernest evidently looked at me with his father s eyes and this father has got the jaundice or something and certainly is cooler towards me than he was before he went home Martha still declines eating more than enough to keep body and soul together and sits at the table with the air of a martyr Her father lives on crackers and stewed prunes and when he has eaten them fixes his melancholy eyes on me watching every mouthful with an air of plaintive regret that I will consume so much unwholesome food Then Ernest positively spends less time with me than ever and sits in his office reading and writing nearly every evening Yesterday I came home from an exhilarating walk and a charming call at Aunty s and at the dinner table gave a lively account of some of the children s exploits Nobody laughed and nobody made any response and after dinner Ernest took me aside and said kindly enough but still said it My little wife must be careful how she runs on in my father s presence He has a great deal of every thing that might be thought levity Then all the vials of my wrath exploded and went off Yes I see how it is I cried passionately You and your father and your sister have got a box about a foot square that you want to squeeze me into I have seen it ever since they came And I can tell you it will take more than three of you to do it There was no harm in what I said none whatever If you only married me for the sake of screwing me down and freezing me up why didn t you tell me so before it was too late Ernest stood looking at me like one staring at a problem he had got to solve and didn t know where to begin I am very sorry he said I thought you would be glad to have me give you this little hint Of course I want you to appear your very best before my father and sister My very best is my real self I cried To talk like a woman of forty is unnatural to a girl of my age If your father doesn t like me I wish he would go away and not come here putting notions into your head and making you as cold and hard as a stone Mother liked to have me run on as you call it and I wish I had stayed with her all my life Do you mean he asked very gravely that you really wish that No I said I don t mean it for his husky troubled voice brought me to my senses All I mean is that I love you so dearly and you keep my heart feeling so hungry and restless and then you went and brought your father and sister here and never asked me if I should like it and you crowded mother out and she lives all alone and it isn t right I always said that whoever married me had got to marry mother and I never dreamed that you would disappoint me so Will you stop crying and listen to me he said But I could not stop The floods of the great deep were broken up at last and I had to cry If I could have told my troubles to some one I could thus have found vent for them but there was no one to whom I had a right to speak of my husband Ernest walked up and down in silence Oh if I could have cried on his breast and felt that he loved and pitied me At last as I grew quieter he came and sat by me This has come upon me like a thunderclap he said I did not know I kept your heart hungry I did not know you wished your mother to live with us And I took it for granted that my wife with her high toned heroic character would sustain me in every duty and welcome my father and sister to our home I do not know what I can do now Shall I send them away No no I cried Only be good to me Ernest only love me only look at me with your own eyes and not with other people s You knew I had faults when you married me I never tried to conceal them And did you fancy I had none myself he asked No I replied I saw no faults in you Everybody said you were such a noble good man and you spoke so beautifully one night at an evening meeting Speaking beautifully is little to the purpose less one lives beautifully he said sadly And now is it possible that you and I a Christian man and a Christian woman are going on and on with scenes as this Are you to wear your very life out because I have not your frantic way of loving and am I to be made weary of mine because I cannot satisfy you But Ernest I said you used to satisfy me Oh how happy I was in those first days when we were always together and you seemed so fond me I was down on the floor by this time and looking up into his pale anxious face Dear child he said I do love you and that more than you know But you would not have me leave my work and spend my whole time telling you so You know I am not so silly I cried It is not fair it is not right to talk as if I were I ask for nothing unreasonable I only want those little daily assurances of your affection which I should suppose would be spontaneous if you felt at all towards me as I do to you The fact is he returned I am absorbed in my work It brings many grave cares and anxieties I spend most of my time amid scenes of suffering and at dying beds This makes me seem abstracted and cold but it does not make you less dear On the contrary the sense it gives me of the brevity and sorrowfulness of life makes you doubly precious since it constantly reminds me that sick beds and dying beds must sooner or later come to our home as to those of others I clung to him as he uttered these terrible words In an agony of terror Oh Ernest promise me promise me that you will not die first I pleaded Foolish little thing he said and was as silly for a while as the silliest heart could ask Then he became serious again Katy he said if you can once make up your mind to the fact that I am an undemonstrative man not all fire and fury and ecstasy as you are yet loving you with all my heart however it may seem I think you will spare yourself much needless pain and spare me also But I want you to be demonstrative I persisted Then you must teach me And about my father and sister perhaps we may find some way of relieving you by and by Meanwhile try to bear with the trouble they make for my sake But I don t mind the trouble Oh Ernest how you do misunderstand me What I mind is their coming between you and me and making you love me less By this time there was a call for Ernest it is a wonder there had not been forty and he went I feel as heart sore as ever What has been gained by this tempest Nothing at all Poor Ernest How can I worry him so when he is already full of care MARCH twenty I have had such a truly beautiful letter to day from dear mother She gives up the hope of coming to spend her last years with us with a sweet patience that makes me cry whenever I think of it What is the secret of this instant and cheerful consent to whatever God wills Oh that I had it too She begs me to be considerate and kind to Ernest s father and sister and constantly to remind myself that my Heavenly Father has chosen to give me this care and trial on the very threshold of my married life I am afraid I have quite lost sight of that in my indignation with Ernest for bringing them here APRIL three Martha is closeted with Ernest in his office day and night They never give me the least hint of what is going on in these secret meetings Then this morning Sarah my good faithful cook bounced into my room to give warning She said she could not live where there were two mistresses giving contrary directions But really there is but one mistress I urged Then it came out that Martha went down every morning to look after the soap fat and to scrimp in the house keeping and see that there was no food wasted I remembered then that she had inquired whether I attended to these details evidently ranking such duties with saying one s prayers and reading one s Bible I flew to Ernest the moment he was at leisure and poured my grievances into his ear Well dear he said suppose you give up the house keeping to Martha She will be far happier and you will be freed from much annoying petty care I bit my tongue lest it should say something and went back to Sarah Suppose Miss Elliott takes charge of the housekeeping and I have nothing to do with it will you stay Indeed and I won t then I can t bear her and I won t put up with her nasty scrimping pinching ways Very well Then you will have to go I said with great dignity though just ready to cry Ernest on being applied to for wages undertook to argue the question himself My sister will take the whole charge he began And may and welcome for all me quoth Sarah I don t like her and never shall Your liking or disliking her is of no consequence whatever said Ernest You may dislike her as much as you please But you must not leave us Indeed and I m not going to stay and be put upon by her persisted Sarah So she has gone We had to get dinner ourselves that is to say Martha did for she said I got in her way and put her out with my awkwardness I have been running hither and thither to find some angel who will consent to live in this ill assorted household Oh how different everything is from what I had planned I wanted a cheerful home where I should be the centre of every joy a home like Aunty s without a cloud But Ernest s father sits the personification of silent gloom like a nightmare on my spirits Martha holds me in disfavor and contempt Ernest is absorbed in his profession and I hardly see him If he wants advice he asks it of Martha while I sit humbled degraded and ashamed wondering why he ever married me at all And then come interludes of wild joy when he appears just as he did in the happy days of our bridal trip and I forget every grievance and hang on his words and looks like one intoxicated with bliss OCT two There has been another explosion I held in as long as I could and then flew into ten thousand pieces Ernest had got into the habit of helping his father and sister at the table and apparently forgetting me It seems a little thing but it chafed and fretted my already irritated soul till at last I was almost beside myself Yesterday they all three sat eating their breakfast and I with empty plate sat boiling over and looking on when Ernest brought things to a crisis by saying to Martha If you can find time to day I wish you would go out with me for half an hour or so I want to consult you about Oh I said rising with my face all in a flame do not trouble yourself to go out in order to escape me I can leave the room and you can have your secrets to yourselves as you do your breakfast I don t know which struck me most Ernest s appalled grieved look or the glance exchanged between Martha and her father He did not hinder my leaving the room and I went upstairs as pitiable an object as could be seen I heard him go to his office then take his hat and set forth on his rounds What wretched hours I passed thus left alone One moment I reproached myself the next I was indignant at the long series of offences that had led to this disgraceful scene At last Ernest came He looked concerned and a little pale Oh Ernest I cried running to him I am so sorry I spoke to you as I did But indeed I cannot stand the way things are going on I am wearing all out Everybody speaks of my growing thin Feel of my hands They burn like fire I knew you would be sorry dear he said Yes your hands are hot poor child There was a long dreadful silence And yet I was speaking and perhaps he was I was begging and beseeching God not to let us drift apart not to let us lose one jot or tittle of our love to each other to enable me to understand my dear dear husband and make him understand me Then Ernest began What was it vexed you dear What is it you can t stand Tell me I am your husband I love you I want to make you happy Why you are having so many secrets that you keep from me and you treat me as if I were only a child consulting Martha about everything And of late you seem to have forgotten that I am at the table and never help me to anything Secrets he re echoed What possible secrets can I have I don t know I said sinking wearily back on the sofa Indeed Ernest I don t want to be selfish or exacting but I am very unhappy Yes I see it poor child And if I have neglected you at the table I do not wonder you are out of patience I know how it has happened While you were pouring out the coffee I busied myself in caring for my father and Martha and so forgot you I do not give this as an excuse but as a reason I have really no excuse and am ashamed of myself Don t say that darling I cried it is I who ought to be ashamed for making such an ado about a trifle It is not a trifle he said and now to the other points I dare say I have been careless about consulting Martha But she has always been a sort of oracle in our family and we all look up to her and she is so much older than you Then as to the secrets Martha comes to my office to help me look over my books I have been careless about my accounts and she has kindly undertaken to attend to them for me Could not I have done that No why should your little head be troubled about money matters But to go on I see that it was thoughtless in me not to tell you what we were about But I am greatly perplexed and harassed in many ways Perhaps you would feel better to know all about it I have only kept it from you to spare you all the anxiety I could Oh Ernest I said ought not a wife to share in all her husband s cares No he returned but I will tell you all that is annoying me now My father was in business in our native town and went on prosperously for many years Then the tide turned he met with loss after loss till nothing remained but the old homestead and on that there was a mortgage We concealed the state of things from my mother her health was delicate and we never let her know a trouble we could spare her Now she has gone and we have found it necessary to sell our old home and to divide and scatter the family My father s mental distress when he found others suffering from his own losses threw him into the state in which you see him now I have therefore assumed his debts and with God s help hope in time to pay them to the uttermost farthing It will be necessary for us to live economically until this is done There are two pressing cases that I am trying to meet at once This has given me a preoccupied air I have no doubt and made you suspect and misunderstand me But now you know the whole my darling I felt my injustice and childish folly very keenly and told him so But I think dear Ernest I added if you will not be hurt at my saying so that you have led me to it by not letting me share at once in your cares If you had at the outset just told me the whole story you would have enlisted my sympathies in your father s behalf and in your own I should have seen the reasonableness of your breaking up the old home and bringing him here and it would have taken the edge of my bitter bitter disappointment about my mother I feel very sorry about that he said It would be a real pleasure to have her here But as things are now she could not be happy with us There is no room I put in I am truly sorry And now my dear little wife must have patience with her stupid blundering old husband and we ll start together once more fair and square Don t wait next time till you are so full that you boil over the moment I annoy you by my inconsiderate ways come right and tell me I called myself all the horrid names I could think of May I ask one thing more now we are upon the subject I said at last Why couldn t your sister Helen have come here instead of Martha He smiled a little In the first place Helen would be perfectly if she had the care of father in his present She is too young to have such responsibility In the second place my brother John with whom she has gone to live has a wife who would be quite crushed by my father and Martha She is one of those little tender soft souls one could crush fingers Now you are not of that sort you have force of character enough to enable you to live with them while maintaining your own dignity and remaining yourself in spite of circum stances I thought you admired Martha above all thing and wanted me to be exactly like her I do admire her but I do not want you to be like anybody but yourself But you nearly killed me by suggesting that I should take heed how I talked in your father s presence Yes dear it was very stupid of me but my father has a standard of excellence in his mind by which he tests every woman this standard is my mother She had none of your life and fun in her and perhaps would not have appreciated your droll way of putting things any better than he and Martha do I could not help sighing a little when I thought what sort of people were watching my every word There is nothing amiss to my mind Ernest continued in your gay talk but my father has his own views as to what constitutes a religious character and cannot understand that real earnestness and real genuine mirthfulness are consistent with each other He had to go now and we parted as if for a week s separation this one talk had brought us so near to each other I understand him now as I never have done and feel that he has given me as real a proof of his affection by unlocking the door of his heart and letting me see its cares as I give him in my wild pranks and caresses and foolish speeches How truly noble it is in him to take up his father s burden in this way I must contrive to help to lighten it Chapter twelve XII NOVEMBER six AUNTY has put me in the way of doing that I could not tell her the whole story of course but I made her understand that Ernest needed money for a generous purpose and that I wanted to help him in it She said the children needed both music and drawing lessons and that she should be delighted if I would take them in hand Aunty does not care a fig for accomplishments but I think I am right in accepting her offer as the children ought to learn to sing and to play and to draw Of course I cannot have them come here as Ernest s father could not bear the noise they would make besides I want to take him by surprise and keep the whole thing a secret Nov fourteen I have seen by the way Martha draws down the corners of her mouth of late that I am unusually out of favor with her This evening Ernest coming home quite late found me lolling back in my chair idling after a hard day s work with my little cousins and Martha sewing nervously away at the rate of ten knots an hour which is the first pun I ever made Why will you sit up and sew at such a rate Martha he asked She twitched at her thread broke it and began with a new one before she replied I suppose you find it convenient to have a whole shirt to your back I saw then that she was making his shirts It made me both hot and cold at once What must Ernest think of me It is plain enough what he thinks of her for he said quite warmly for him This is really too kind What right has she to prowl round among Ernest s things and pry into the state of his wardrobe If I had not had my time so broken up with giving lessons I should have found out that he needed new shirts and set to work on them Though I must own I hate shirt making I could not help showing that I felt aggrieved Martha defended herself by saying that she knew young people would be young people and would gad about shirts or no shirts Now it is not her fault that she thinks I waste my time gadding about but I am just as angry with her as if she did Oh why couldn t I have had Helen to be a pleasant companion and friend to me instead of this old well I won t say what And really with so much to make me happy what would become of me if I had no trials Nov fifteen To day Martha has a house cleaning mania and has dragged me into it by representing the sin and misery of those deluded mortals who think servants know how to sweep and to scrub In spite of my resolution not to get under her thumb I have somehow let her rule and reign over me to such an extent that I can hardly sit up long enough to write this Does the whole duty of woman consist in keeping her house distressingly clean and prim in making and baking and preserving and pickling in climbing to the top shelves of closets lest haply a little dust should lodge there and getting down on her hands and knees to inspect the carpet The truth is there is not one point of sympathy between Martha and myself not one One would think that our love to Ernest would furnish it But her love aims at the abasement of his character and mine at its elevation She thinks I should bow down to and worship him jump up and offer him my chair when he comes in feed him with every unwholesome dainty he fancies and feel myself honored by his acceptance of these services I think it is for him to rise and offer me a seat because I am a woman and his wife and that a silly subservience on my part is degrading to him and to myself And I am afraid I make known these sentiments to her in a most unpalatable way Nov eighteen Oh I am so happy that I sing for joy Dear Ernest has given me such a delightful surprise He says he has persuaded James to come and spend his college days here and finally study medicine with him Dear darling old James He is to be here to morrow He is to have the little hall bedroom fitted up for him and he will be here several years Next to having mother this is the nicest thing that could happen We love each other so dearly and get along so beautifully together I wonder how he ll like Martha with her grim ways and Ernest s father with his melancholy ones Nov thirty James has come and the house already seems lighter and cheerier He is not in the least annoyed by Martha or her father and though he is as jovial as the day is long they actually seem to like him True to her theory on the subject Martha invariably rises at his entrance and offers him her seat He pretends not to see it and runs to get one for her Then she takes comfort in seeing him consume her good things since his gobbling them down is a sort of tacit tribute to their merits missus Embury was here to day She says there is not much the matter with Ernest s father that he has only got the hypo I don t know exactly what this is but I believe it is thinking something is the matter with you when there isn t At any rate I put it to you my dear old journal whether it is pleasant to live with people who behave in this way In the first place all he talks about is his fancied disease He gets book after book from the office and studies and ponders his case till he grows quite yellow One day he says he has found out the seat of his disease to be the liver and changes his diet to meet that view of the case Martha has to do him up in mustard and he takes kindly to blue pills In a day or two he finds his liver is all right but that his brain is all wrong The mustard goes now to the back of his neck and he takes solemn leave of us all with the assurance that his last hour has come Finding that he survives the night however he transfers the seat of his disease to the heart spends hours in counting his pulse refuses to take exercise lest he should bring on palpitations and warns us all to prepare to follow him Everybody who comes in has to hear the whole story every one prescribes something and he tries each remedy in turn These all failing to reach his case he is s plunged into ten fold gloom He complains that God has cast him off forever and that his sins are like the sands of the sea for number I am such a goose that I listen to all these varying moods and symptoms with the solemn conviction that he is going to die immediately I bathe his head and count his pulse and fan him and take down his dying depositions for Ernest s solace after he has gone And I talk theology to him by the hour while Martha bakes and brews in the kitchen or makes mince pies after eating which one might give him the whole Bible at one dose without the smallest effect To day I stood by his chair holding his head and whispering such consoling passages as I thought might comfort him when James burst in singing and tossing his cap in the air Come here young man and hear my last testimony I am about to die The end draws near were the sepulchral words that made him bring his song to an abrupt close I shall take it very ill of you sir quoth James if you go and die before giving me that cane you promised me Who could die decently under such circumstances The poor old man revived immediately but looked a good deal injured After James had gone out he said It is very painful to one who stands on the very verge of the eternal world to see the young so thoughtless But James is not thoughtless I said It is only his merry way Daughter Katherine he went on you are very kind to the old man and you will have your reward But I wish I could feel sure of your state before God I greatly fear you deceive yourself and that the ground of your hope is delusive I felt the blood rush to my face At first I was staggered a good deal But is a mortal man who cannot judge of his own state to decide mine It is true he sees my faults anybody can who looks But he does not see my prayers or my tears of shame and sorrow he does not know how many hasty words I repress how earnestly I am aiming all the day long to do right in all the little details of life He does not know that it costs my fastidious nature an appeal to God every time I kiss his poor old face and that what would be an act of worship in him is an act of self denial in me How should he The Christian life is a hidden known only by the eye that seeth in secret And I do believe this life is mine Up to this time I have contrived to get along without calling Ernest s father by any name I mean now to make myself turn over a new leaf DECEMBER seven James is my perpetual joy and pride We read and sing together just as we used to do in our old school days Martha sits by with her work grimly approving for is he not a man And as if my cup of felicity were not full enough I am to have my dear old pastor come here to settle over this church and I shall once more hear his beloved voice in the pulpit Ernest has managed the whole thing He says the state of doctor C s health makes the change quite necessary and that he can avail himself of the best surgical advice this city affords in case his old difficulties recur I rejoice for myself and for this church but mother will miss him sadly I am leading a very busy happy life only I am perhaps working a little too hard What with my scholars the extra amount of housework Martha contrives to get out of me the practicing I must keep up if I am to teach and the many steps I have to take I have not only no idle moments but none too many for recreation Ernest is so busy himself that he fortunately does not see what a race I am running JANUARY sixteen eighteen thirty eight The first anniversary of our wedding day and like all days has had its lights and its shades I thought I would celebrate it in such a way as to give pleasure to everybody and spent a good deal of time in getting up a little gift for each from Ernest and myself And I took special pains to have a good dinner particularly for father Yes I had made up my mind to call him by that sacred name for the first time to day cost what it may But he shut himself up in his room directly after breakfast and when dinner was ready refused to come down This cast a gloom over us all Then Martha was nearly distracted because a valuable dish had been broken in the kitchen and could not recover her equanimity at all Worst of all Ernest who is not in the least sentimental never said a word about our wedding day and didn t give me a thing I have kept hoping all day that he would make me some little present no matter how small but now it is too late he has gone out to be gone all night probably and thus ends the day an utter failure I feel a good deal disappointed Besides when I look back over this my first year of married life I do not feel satisfied with myself at all I can t help feeling that I have been selfish and unreasonable towards Ernest in a great many ways and as contrary towards Martha as if I enjoyed a state of warfare between us And I have felt a good deal of secret contempt for her father with his moods and tenses his pill boxes and his plasters his feastings and his fastings I do not understand how a Christian can make such slow progress as I do and how old faults can hang on so If I had made any real progress should I not be sensible of it I have been reading over the early part of this journal and when I came to the conversation I had with missus Cabot in which I made a list of my wants I was astonished that I could ever have had such contemptible ones Let me think what I really and truly most want now First of all then if God should speak to me at this moment and offer to give just one thing and that alone I should say without hesitation Love to Thee O my Master Next to that if I could have one thing more I would choose to be a thoroughly unselfish devoted wife Down in my secret heart I know there lurks another wish which I am ashamed of It is that in some way or other some right way I could be delivered from Martha and her father I shall never be any better while they are here to tempt me FEBRUARY one Ernest spoke to day of one of his patients a missus Campbell who is a great sufferer but whom he describes as the happiest most cheerful person he ever met He rarely speaks of his patients Indeed he rarely speaks of anything I felt strangely attracted by what he said of her and asked so many questions that at last he proposed to take me to see her I caught at the idea very eagerly and have just come home from the visit greatly moved and touched She is confined to her bed and is quite helpless and at times her sufferings are terrible She received me with a sweet smile however and led me on to talk more of myself than I ought to have done I wish Ernest had not left me alone with her so that I should have had the restraint of his presence FEB fourteen I am so fascinated with missus Campbell that I cannot help going to see her again and again She seems to me like one whose conflict and dismay are all over and who looks on other human beings with an almost divine love and pity To look at life as she does to feel as she does to have such a personal love to Christ as she has I would willingly go through every trial and sorrow When I told her so she smiled a little sadly Much as you envy me she said my faith is not yet so strong that I do not shudder at the thought of a young enthusiastic girl like you going through all I have done in order to learn a few simple lessons which God was willing to teach me sooner and without the use of a rod if I had been ready for them But you are so happy now I said Yes I am happy she replied and such happiness is worth all it costs If my flesh shudders at the remembrance of what I have endured my faith sustains God through the whole But tell me a little more about yourself my dear I should so love to give you a helping hand if I might You know I began dear missus Campbell that there are some trials that cannot do us any good They only call out all there is in us that is unlovely and severe I don t know of any such trials she replied Suppose you had to live with people who were perfectly uncongenial who misunderstood you and who were always getting into your way as stumbling blocks If I were living with them and they made me unhappy I would ask God to relieve me of this trial if He thought it best If He did not think it best I would then try to find out the reason He might have two reasons One would be the good they might do me The other the good I might do them But in the case I was supposing neither party can be of the least use to the other You forget perhaps the indirect good one may in by living with uncongenial tempting persons First such people do good by the very self denial and self control their mere presence demands Then their making one s home less home like and perfect than it would be in their absence may help to render our real home in heaven more attractive But suppose one cannot exercise self control and is always flying out and flaring up I objected I should say that a Christian who was always doing that she replied gravely was in pressing need of just the trial God sent when He shut him up to such a life of hourly temptation We only know ourselves and what we really are when the force of circumstances bring us out It is very mortifying and painful to find how weak one is That is true But our mortifications are some of God s best physicians and do much toward healing our pride and self conceit Do you really think then that God deliberately appoints to some of His children a lot where their worst passions are excited with a desire to bring good out of this seeming evil Why I have always supposed the best thing that could happen to me instance would be to have a home exactly to my mind a home where all were forbearing loving and good tempered a sort of little heaven below If you have not such a home my dear are you sure it is not partly your own fault Of course it is my own fault Because I am very quick tempered I want to live with good tempered people That is very benevolent in you she said archly I colored but went on Oh I know I am selfish And therefore I want live with those who are not so I want to live with persons to whom I can look for an example and who will constantly stimulate me to something higher But if God chooses quite another lot for you you may be sure that He sees that you need something totally different from what you want You just now that you would gladly go through any trial in order to attain a personal love to Christ that should become the ruling principle of your life Now as soon as God sees this desire in you is He not kind is He not wise in appointing such trials as He knows will lead to this end I meditated long before I answered Was God really asking me not merely to let Martha and her father live with me on sufferance but to rejoice that He had seen fit to let them harass and embitter my domestic life I thank you for the suggestion I said at last one want to say one thing more missus Campbell resumed after another pause We look at our fellow men too much from the standpoint of our own prejudices They may be wrong they may have their faults and foibles they may call out all that is meanest and most hateful in us But they are not all wrong they have their virtues and when they excite our bad passions by their own they may be as ashamed and sorry as we are irritated And I think some of the best most contrite most useful of men and women whose prayers prevail with God and bring down blessings into the homes in which they dwell often possess unlovely traits that furnish them with their best discipline The very fact that they are ashamed of themselves drives them to God they feel safe in His presence and while they lie in the very dust of self confusion at His feet they are dear to Him and have power with Him That is a comforting word and I thank you for it I said My heart was full and I longed to stay and hear her talk on But I had already exhausted her strength On the way home I felt as I suppose people do when they have caught a basketful of fish I always am delighted to catch a new idea I thought I would get all the benefit out of Martha and her father and as I went down to tea after taking off my things felt like a holy martyr who had as good as won a crown I found however that the butter was horrible Martha had insisted that she alone was capable of selecting that article and had ordered a quantity from her own village which I could not eat myself and was ashamed to have on my table I pushed back my plate in disgust I hope Martha that you have not ordered much of this odious stuff I cried Martha replied that it was of the very first quality and appealed to her father and Ernest who both agreed with her which I thought very unkind and unjust I rushed into a hot debate on the subject during which Ernest maintained that ominous silence that indicates his not being pleased and it irritated and led me on I would far rather he should say Katy you are behaving like a child and I wish you would stop talking Martha I said you will persist that the butter is good because you ordered it If you will only own that I won t say another word I can t say it she returned missus Jones butter is invariably good I never heard it found fault with before The trouble is you are so hard to please No I am not And you can t convince me that if the buttermilk is not perfectly worked out the butter could be fit to eat This speech I felt to be a masterpiece It was time to let her know how learned I was on the subject of butter though I wasn t brought up to make it or see it made But here Ernest put in a little oil I think you are both right he said missus Jones makes good butter but just this once she failed I dare say it won t happen again and mean while this can be used for making seed cakes and we can get a new supply This was his masterpiece A whole firkin of butter made up into seed cakes Martha turned to encounter him on that head and I slipped off to my room to look with a miserable sense of disappointment at my folly and weakness in making so much ado about nothing I find it hard to believe that it can do me good to have people live with me who like rancid butter and who disagree with me in everything else Chapter thirteen XIII MARCH one AUNTY sent for us all to dine with her to day to celebrate Lucy s fifteenth birthday Ever since Lucy behaved so heroically in regard to little Emma really saving her life Ernest says Aunty seems to feel that she cannot do enough for her The child has taken the most unaccountable fancy to me strangely enough and when we got there she came to meet me with something like cordiality Mamma permits me to be the bearer of agreeable news she said because this is my birthday A friend of whom you are very fond has just arrived and is impatient to embrace you To embrace me I cried You foolish child And the next moment I found myself in my mother s arms The despised Lucy had been the means of giving me this pleasure It seems that Aunty had told her she should choose her own birthday treat and that after solemn meditation she had decided that to see dear mother again would be the most agreeable thing she could think of I have never told you dear journal why I did not go home last summer and never shall If you choose to fancy that I couldn t afford it you can Well wasn t it nice to see mother and to read in her dear loving face that she was satisfied with her poor wayward Katy and fond of her as ever I only longed for Ernest s coming that she might see us together and see how he loved me He came I rushed out to meet him and dragged him in But it seemed as if he had grown stupid and awkward All through the dinner I watched for one of those loving glances which should proclaim to mother the good understanding between us but watched in vain It will come by and by I thought When we get by ourselves mother will see how fond of me he is But by and by it was just the same I was preoccupied and mother asked me if I were well It was all very foolish I dare say and yet I did want to have her know that with all my faults he still loves me Then besides this disappointment I have to reproach myself for misunderstanding poor Lucy as I have done Because she was not all fire and fury like myself I need not have assumed that she had no heart It is just like me I hope I shall never be so severe in my judgment again APRIL thirty Mother has just gone Her visit has done me a world of good She found out something to like in father at once and then something good in Martha She says father s sufferings are real not fancied that his error is not knowing where to locate his disease and is starving one week and over eating the next She charged me not to lay up future misery for myself by misjudging him now and to treat him as a daughter ought without the smallest regard to his appreciation of it Then as to Martha she declares that I have no idea how much she does to reduce our expenses to keep the house in order and to relieve us from care But mother I said did you notice what horrid butter we have And it is all her doing But the butter won t last forever she replied Don t make yourself miserable about such a trifle For my part it is a great relief to me to know that with your delicate health you have this tower of strength to lean on But my health is not delicate mother You certainly look pale and thin Oh well I said whereupon she fell to giving me all sorts of advice about getting up on step ladders and climbing on chairs and sewing too much and all that JUNE fifteen The weather or something makes me rather languid and stupid I begin to think that Martha is not an entire nuisance in the house I have just been to see missus Campbell In answer to my routine of lamentations she took up a book and read me what was called as nearly as I can remember Four steps that lead to peace Be desirous of doing the will of another rather than thine own Choose always to have less rather than more Seek always the lowest place and to be inferior to every one Wish always and pray that the will of God may be wholly fulfilled in thee I was much struck with these directions but I said despondently If peace can only be found at the end of such hard roads I am sure I shall always be miserable Are you miserable now she asked Yes just now I am I do not mean that I have no happiness I mean that I am in a disheartened mood weary of going round and round in circles committing the same sins uttering the same confessions and making no advance My dear she said after a time have you a perfectly distinct settled view of what Christ is to the human soul I do not know I understand of course more or less perfectly that my salvation depends on Him alone it is His gift But do you see with equal clearness that your sanctification must be as fully His gift as your salvation is No I said after a little thought I have had a feeling that He has done His part and now I must do mine My dear she said with much tenderness and feeling then the first thing you have to do is to learn Christ But how On your knees my child on your knees She was tired and I came away and I have indeed been on my knees JULY one I think that I do begin dimly it is true but really to understand that this terrible work which I was trying to do myself is Christ s work and must be done and will be done by Him I take some pleasure in the thought and wonder why it has all this time been hidden from me especially after what doctor C said in his letter But I get hold of this idea in a misty unsatisfactory way If Christ is to do all what am I to do And have I not been told over and over again that the Christian life is one of conflict and that I am to fight like a good soldier AUGUST five doctor Cabot has come just as I need him most I long for one of those good talks with him which always used to strengthen me so I feel a perfect weight of depression that makes me a burden to myself and to poor Ernest who after visiting sick people all day needs to come home to a cheerful wife But he comforts me with the assurance that this is merely physical despondency and that I shall get over it by and by How kind how even tender he is My heart is getting all it wants from him only I am too stupid to enjoy him as I ought Father too talks far less about his own bad feelings and seems greatly concerned at mine As to Martha I have done trying to get sympathy or love from her She cannot help it I suppose but she is very hard and dry towards me and I feel such a longing to throw myself on her mercy and to have one little smile to assure me that she has forgiven me for being Ernest s wife and so different from what she would have chosen for him doctor Elliott to missus Mortimer OCTOBER four eighteen thirty eight My dear Katy s Mother You will rejoice with us when I tell you that we are the happy parents of a very fine little boy My dearest wife sends an ocean of love to you and says she will write her self to morrow That I shall not be very likely to allow as you will imagine She is doing extremely well and we have everything to be grateful for Your affectionate Son J E ELLIOTT missus Crofton to missus Mortimer I am sure my dear sister that the doctor has riot written you more than five lines about the great event which has made such a stir in our domestic circle So I must try to supply the details you will want to hear one need not add that our darling Katy behaved nobly Her self forgetfulness and consideration for others were really beautiful throughout the whole scene The doctor may well be proud of her and I took care to tell him so ill presence of that dreadful sister of his I never met so angular so uncompromising a person as she is in all my life She does not understand Katy and never can and I find it hard to realize that living with such a person can furnish a wholesome discipline which is even more desirable than the most delightful home And yet I not only know that is true in the abstract but I see that it is so in the fact Katy is acquiring both self control and patience and her Christian character is developing in a way that amazes me I cannot but hope that God will in time deliver her from this trial indeed feel sure that when it has done its beneficent work He will do so Martha Elliott is a good woman but her goodness is without grace or beauty She takes excellent care of Katy keeps her looking as if she had just come out of a band box as the saying and always has her room in perfect order But one misses the loving word the re assuring smile the delicate thoughtful little forbearance that ought to adorn every sick room and light it up with genuine sunshine There is one comfort about it how ever and that is that I can spoil dear Katy to my heart s content As to the baby he is a fine little fellow and his mother is so happy in him that she can afford to do without some other pleasures I shall write again in a few days Meanwhile you may rest assured that I love your Katy almost as well as you do and shall be with her most of the time till she is quite herself again James to his mother Of course there never was such a baby before on the face of the earth Katy is so nearly wild with joy that you can t get her to eat or sleep or do any of the proper things that her charming sister in law thinks becoming under the circumstances You never saw anything so pretty in your life as she is now I hope the doctor is as much in love with her as I am He is the best fellow in the world and Katy is just the wife for him Nov four My darling baby is a month old to day I never saw such a splendid child I love him so that I lie awake nights to watch him Martha says in her dry way that I had better show my love by sleeping and eating for him and Ernest says I shall as soon as I get stronger But I don t get strong and that discourages me Nov twenty six I begin to feel rather more like myself and as if I could write with less labor I have had in these few past weeks such a revelation of suffering and such a revelation of joy as mortal mind can hardly conceive of The world I live in now is a new world a world full of suffering that leads to unutterable felicity Oh this precious precious baby How can I thank God enough for giving him to me I see now why He has put some thorns into my domestic life but for them I should be too happy to live It does not seem just the moment to com plain and yet as I can speak to no one it is a relief a great relief to write about my trials During my whole sickness Martha has been so hard so cold so unsympathizing that sometimes it has seemed as if my cup of trial could not hold another drop She routed me out of bed when I was so languid that everything seemed a burden and when sitting up made me faint away I heard her say to herself that I had no constitution and had no business to get married The worst of all is that during that dreadful night before baby came she kept asking Ernest to lie down and rest and was sure he would kill himself and all that while she had not one word of pity for me But oh why need I let this rankle in my heart Why cannot I turn my thoughts entirely to my darling baby my dear husband and all the other sources of joy that make my home a happy one in spite of this one discomfort I hope I am learning some useful lessons from my joys and from my trials and that both will serve to make me in earnest and to keep me so DEC four We have had a great time about poor baby s name I expected to call him Raymond for my own dear father as a matter of course It seemed a small gratification for mother in her loneliness Dear mother How little I have known all these years what I cost her But it seems there has been a Jotham in the family ever since the memory of man each eldest son handing down his father s name to the next in descent and Ernest s real name is Jotham Ernest of all the extraordinary combinations His mother would add the latter name in spite of everything Ernest behaved very well through the whole affair and said he had no feeling about it all But he was so gratified when I decided to keep up the family custom that I feel rewarded for the sacrifice Father is in one of his gloomiest moods As I sat caressing baby to day he said to me Daughter Katherine I trust you make it a subject of prayer to God that you may be kept from idolatry No father I returned I never do An idol is something one puts in God s place and I don t put baby there He shook his head and said the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked I have heard mother say that we might love an earthly object as much as we pleased if we only love God better I might have added but of course I didn t that I prayed every day that I might love Ernest and baby better and better Poor father seemed puzzled and troubled by what I did say and after musing a while went on thus The Almighty is a great and terrible Being He cannot bear a rival He will have the whole heart or none of it When I see a young woman so absorbed in a created being as you are in that infant and in your other friends I tremble for you I tremble for you But father I persisted God gave me this child and He gave me my heart just as it is Yes and that heart needs renewing I hope it is renewed I replied But I know there is a great work still to be done in it And the more effectually it is done the more loving I shall grow Don t you see father Don t you see that the more Christ like I become the more I shall be filled with love for every living thing He shook his head but pondered long as he always does on whatever he considers audacious As for me I am vexed with my presumption in disputing with him and am sure too that I was trying to show off what little wisdom I have picked up Besides my mountain does not stand so strong as it did Perhaps I am making idols out of Ernest and the baby JANUARY sixteen eighteen thirty nine This is our second wedding day I did not expect much from it after last year s failure Father was very gloomy at breakfast and retired to his room directly after it No one could get in to make his bed and he would not come down to dinner I wonder Ernest lets him go on so But his rule seems to be to let everybody have their own way He certainly lets me have mine After dinner he gave me a book I have been wanting for some time and had asked him for The Imitation of Christ Ever since that day at missus Campbell s I have felt that I should like it though I did think in old times that it preached too hard a doctrine I read aloud to him the Four Steps to Peace he said they were admirable and then took it from me and began reading to himself here and there I felt the precious moments when I had got him all to myself were passing away and was becoming quite out of patience with him when the words Constantly seek to have less rather than more flashed into my mind I suppose this direction had reference to worldly good but I despise money and despise people who love it The riches I crave are not silver and gold but my husband s love and esteem And of these must I desire to have less rather than more I puzzled myself over this question in vain but when I silently prayed to be satisfied with just what God chose to give me of the wealth I crave yes hunger and thirst for I certainly felt a sweet content for the time at least that was quite resting and quieting And just as I had reached that acquiescent mood Ernest threw down his book and came and caught me in his arms I thank God he said my precious wife that I married you this day The wisest thing I ever did was when I fell in love with you and made a fool of myself What a speech for my silent old darling to make Whenever he says and does a thing out of character and takes me all by surprise how delightful he is Now the world is a beautiful world and so is everybody in it I met Martha on the stairs after Ernest had gone and caught her and kissed her She looked perfectly astonished What spirits the child has I heard her whisper to herself no sooner down than up again And she sighed Can it be that under that stern and hard crust there lie hidden affections and perhaps hidden sorrows I ran back and asked as kindly as I could What makes you sigh Martha Is anything troubling you Have I done anything to annoy you You do the best you can she said and pushed past me to her own room Chapter fourteen XIV JAN thirty WHO would have thought I would have anything more to do with poor old Susan Green doctor Cabot came to see me to day and told me the strangest thing It seems that the nurse who performed the last offices for her was taken sick about six months ago and that doctor Cabot visited her from time to time Her physician said she needed nothing but rest and good nourishing food to restore her strength yet she did not improve at all and at last it came out that she was not taking the food the doctor ordered because she could not afford to do so having lost what little money she had contrived to save doctor Cabot on learning this gave her enough out of Susan s legacy to meet her case and in doing so told her about that extraordinary will The nurse then assured him that when she reached Susan s room and found the state that she was in and that I was praying with her she had remained waiting in silence fearing to interrupt me She saw me faint and sprang forward just in time to catch me and keep me from falling I take great pleasure therefore doctor Cabot continued in making over Susan s little property to you to whom it belongs and I cannot help congratulating you that you have had the honor and the privilege of perhaps leading that poor benighted soul to Christ even at the eleventh hour Oh doctor Cabot I cried what a relief it is to hear you say that For I have always reproached myself for the cowardice that made me afraid to speak to her of her Saviour It takes less courage to speak to God than to man It is my belief replied doctor Cabot that every prayer offered in the name of Jesus is sure to have its answer Every such prayer is dictated by the Holy Spirit and therefore finds acceptance with God and if your cry for mercy on poor Susan s soul did not prevail with Him in her behalf as we may hope it did then He has answered it in some other way These words impressed me very much To think that every one of my poor prayers is answered Every one doctor Cabot then returned to the subject of Susan s will and in spite of all I could say to the contrary insisted that he had no legal right to this money and that I had He said he hoped that it would help to relieve us from some of the petty economies now rendered necessary by Ernest s struggle to meet his father s liabilities Instantly my idol was rudely thrown down from his pedestal How could he reveal to doctor Cabot a secret he had pretended it cost him so much to confide to me his wife I could hardly restrain tears of shame and vexation but did control myself so far as to say that I would sooner die than appropriate Susan s hard earnings to such a purpose and that I should use it for the poor as I was sure he would have done He then advised me to invest the principal and use the interest from year to year as occasions presented themselves So I shall have more than a hundred dollars to give away each year as long as I live How perfectly delightful I can hardly conceive of anything that give me so much pleasure Poor old Susan How many hearts she shall cause to sing for joy Feb twenty five Things have not gone on well of late Dearly as I love Ernest he has lowered himself in my eye by telling that to doctor Cabot It would have bee far nobler to be silent concerning his sacrifices and he certainly grows harder graver sterner every day He is all shut up within himself and I am growing afraid of him It must be that he is bitterly disappointed in me and takes refuge in this awful silence Oh if I could only please him and know that I pleased him how different my life would be Baby does not seem well I have often plumed myself on the thought that having a doctor for his father would be such an advantage to him as he would be ready to attack the first symptoms of disease But Ernest hardly listens to me when I express anxiety about this or that and if I ask a question he replies Oh you know better than I do Mothers know by instinct how to manage babies But I do not know by instinct or in any other way and I often wish that the time I spent over my music had been spent learning how to meet all the little emergencies that are constantly arising since baby came How I used to laugh in my sleeve at those anxious mothers who lived near us and always seemed to be in hot water Martha will take baby when I have other things to attend to and she keeps him every Sunday afternoon that I may go to church but she knows no more about his physical training than I do If my dear mother were only here I feel a good deal worn out What with the care of baby who is restless at night and with whom I walk about lest he should keep Ernest awake the depressing influence of father s presence Martha s disdain and Ernest keeping so aloof from me life seems to me little better than a burden that I have not strength to carry and would gladly lay down MARCH three If it were not for James I believe I should sink He is so kind and affectionate so ready to fill up the gaps Ernest leaves empty and is so sunshiny and gay that I cannot be entirely sad Baby too is a precious treasure it would be wicked to cloud his little life with my depression I try to look at him always with a smiling face for he already distinguishes between a cheerful and a sad countenance I am sure that there is something in Christ s gospel that would soothe and sustain me amid these varied trials if I only knew what it is and how to put forth my hand and take it But as it is I feel very desolate Ernest often congratulates me on having had such a good night s rest when I have been up and down every hour with baby half asleep frozen and exhausted But he shall sleep at any rate April five The first rays of spring make me more languid than ever Martha cannot be made to understand that nursing such a large voracious baby losing sleep and confinement within doors are enough to account for this She is constantly speaking in terms of praise of those who keep up even when they do feel a little out of sorts and says she always does In the evening after baby gets to sleep I feel fit for nothing but to lie on the sofa dozing but she sees in this only a lazy habit which ought not to be tolerated and is constantly devising ways to rouse and set me at work If I had more leisure for reading meditation and prayer I might still be happy But all the morning I must have baby till he takes his nap and as soon as he gets to sleep I must put my room in order and by that time all the best part of the day is gone And at night I am so tired that I can hardly feel anything but my weariness That too is my only chance of seeing Ernest and if I lock my door and fall upon my knees I keep listening for his step ready to spring to welcome should he come This is wrong I know but how can I live without one loving word from him and every day I am hoping it will come MAY two Aunty was here to day I had not seen her for some weeks She exclaimed at my looks in a tone that seemed to upbraid Ernest and Martha though of course she did not mean to do that You are not fit to have the whole care of that great boy at night said she and you ought to begin to feed him both for his sake and your own I am willing to take the child at night Martha said a little stiffly But I supposed his mother preferred to keep him herself And so I do I cried I should be perfectly miserable if I had to give him up just as he is getting teeth and so wakeful What are you taking to keep up your strength dear asked Aunty Nothing in particular I said Very well it is time the doctor looked after that she cried It really never will do to let you run down in this way Let me look at baby Why my child his gums need lancing So I have told Ernest half a dozen times I declared But he is always in a hurry and says another time will do I hope baby won t have convulsions while he is waiting for that other time said Aunty looking almost savagely at Martha I never saw Aunty so nearly out of humor At dinner Martha began I think brother the baby needs attention missus Crofton has been here and says so And she seems to find Katherine run down I am sure if I had known it I should have taken her in hand and built her up But she did not complain She never complains father here put in calling all the blood I had into my face my heart so leaped for joy at his kind word Ernest looked at me and caught the illumination of my face You look well dear he said But if you do not feel so you ought to tell us As to baby I will attend to him directly So Martha s one word prevailed where my twenty fell to the ground Baby is much relieved and has fallen into a sweet sleep And I have had time to carry my tired oppressed heart to my compassionate Saviour and to tell Him what I cannot utter to any human ear How strange it is that when through many years of leisure and strength prayer was only a task it is now my chief solace if I can only snatch time for it missus Embury has a little daughter How glad I am for her She is going to give it my name That is a real pleasure JULY four Baby is ten months old to day and in spite of everything is bright and well I have come home to mother Ernest waked up at last to see that something must be done and when he is awake he is very wide awake So he brought me home Dear mother is perfectly delighted only she will make an ado about my health But I feel a good deal better and think I shall get nicely rested here How pleasant it is to feel myself watched by friendly eyes my faults excused and forgiven and what is best in me called out I have been writing to Ernest and have told him honestly how annoyed and pained I was at learning that he had told his secret to doctor Cabot JULY twelve Ernest writes that he has had no communication with doctor Cabot or any one else on subject that touching his father s honor as it does he regards as a sacred one You say dear be said you often say that I do not understand you Are you sure that you understand me Of course I don t How can I How can I reconcile his marrying me and professing to do it with delight with his indifference to my society his reserve his carelessness about my health But his letters are very kind and really warmer than he is I can hardly wait for them and then though my pride bids me to be reticent as he is my heart runs away with me and I pour out upon him such floods of affection that I am sure he is half drowned Mother says baby is splendid AUGUST one When I took leave of Ernest I was glad to get away I thought he would perhaps find after I was gone that he missed something out of his life and would welcome me home with a little of the old love But I did not dream that he would not find it easy to do without me till summer was over and when this morning he came suddenly upon us carpet bag in hand I could do nothing but cry in his arms like a tired child And now I had the silly triumph of having mother see that he loved me How could you get away I asked at last And what made you come And how long can you stay I could get away because I would he replied And I came because I wanted to come And I can stay three days Three days of Ernest all to myself AUGUST five He has gone but he has left behind him a happy wife and the memory of three happy days After the first joy of our meeting was over we had time for just such nice long talks as I delight in Ernest began by upbraiding me a little for my injustice in fancying he had betrayed his father to doctor Cabot That is not all I interrupted I even thought you had made a boast of the sacrifices you were making That explains your coldness he returned My coldness Of all the ridiculous things in the world I cried You were cold for you and I felt it Don t you know that we undemonstrative men prefer loving winsome little women like you just because you are our own opposites And when the pet kitten turns into a cat with claws Now Ernest that is really too bad To compare me to a cat You certainly did say some sharp things to me about that time Did I really Oh Ernest how could I And it was at a moment when I particularly needed your help But do not let us dwell upon it We love each other we are both trying to do right in all the details of life I do not think we shall ever get very far apart But Ernest tell me are you very very much disappointed in me Disappointed Why Katy Then what did make you seem so indifferent What made you so slow to observe how miserably I was as to health Did I seem indifferent I am sure I never loved you better As to your health I am ashamed of myself I ought to have seen how feeble you were But the truth is I was deceived by your bright ways with baby For him you were all smiles and gayety That was from principle I said and felt a good deal elated as I made the announcement He fell into a fit of musing and none of my usual devices for arousing him had any effect I pulled his hair and his ears and shook him but he remained unmoved At last he began again Perhaps I owe it to you dear to tell you that when I brought my father and sister home to live with us I did not dream how trying a thing it would be to you I did not know that he was a confirmed invalid or that she would prove to possess a nature so entirely antagonistic to yours I thought my father would interest himself in reading visiting et cetera as he used to do And I thought Martha s judgment would be of service to you while her household skill would relieve you of some care But the whole thing has proved a failure I am harassed by the sight of my father sitting there in his corner so penetrated with gloom I reproach myself for it but I almost dread coming home When a man has been all day encompassed with sounds and sights of suffering he naturally longs for cheerful faces and cheerful voices in his own house Then Martha s pertinacious I won t say hostility to my little wife what shall I call it It is only want of sympathy She is too really good to be hostile to any one Thank you my darling he said I believe you do her justice I am afraid I have not been as forbearing with her as I ought I said But oh Ernest it is because I have been jealous of her all along That is really too absurd You certainly have treated her with more deference than you have me You looked up to her and looked down upon me At least it seemed so My dear child you have misunderstood the whole thing I gave Martha just what she wanted most she likes to be looked up to And I gave you what I thought you wanted most my tenderest love And I expected that I should have your sympathy amid the trials with which I am burdened and that with your strong nature I might look to you to help me bear them I know you have the worst of it dear child but then you have twice my strength I believe women almost always have more than men I have indeed misunderstood you I thought you liked to have them here and that Martha s not fancying me influenced you against me But now I know just what you want of me and I can give it darling After this all our cloud melted away I only long to go home and show Ernest that he shall have one cheerful face about him and have one cheerful voice AUGUST twelve I have had a long letter from Ernest to day He says he hopes he has not been selfish and unkind in speaking of his father and sister as he has done because he truly loves and honors them both and wants me to do so if I can His father had called them up twice to see him die and to receive his last messages This always happens when Ernest has been up all the previous night there seems a fatality about it Chapter fifteen XV OCTOBER four HOME again and with my dear Ernest delighted to see me Baby is a year old to day and as usual father who seems to abhor anything like a merry making took himself off to his room To morrow he will be all the worse for it and will be sure to have a theological battle with somebody OCTOBER five The somebody was his daughter Katherine as usual Baby was asleep in my lap and I reached out for a book which proved to be a volume of Shakespeare which had done long service as an ornament to the table but which nobody ever read on account of the small print The battle then began thus Father I regret to see that worldly author in your hands my daughter Daughter a little mischievously Why were you wanting to talk father No I am too feeble to talk to day My pulse is very weak Let me read aloud to you then Not from that profane book It would do you good You never take any recreation Do let me read a little Father gets nervous Recreation is a snare I must keep my soul ever fixed on divine things But can you No alas no It is my grief and shame that I do not But if you would indulge yourself in a little harmless mirth now and then your mind would get rested and you would return to divine things with fresh zeal Why should not the mind have its seasons of rest as well as the body We shall have time to rest in heaven Our business here on earth is to be sober and vigilant because of our adversary not to be reading plays I don t make reading plays my business dear father I make it my rest and amusement Christians do not need amusement they find rest refreshment all they want in God Do you father Alas no He seems a great way off To me He seems very near So near that He can see every thought of my heart Dear father it is your disease that makes everything so unreal to you God is really so near really loves us so is so sorry for us And it seems hard when you are so good and so intent on pleasing Him that you get no comfort out of Him I am not good my daughter I am a vile worm of the dust Well God is good at any rate and He would never have sent His Son to die for you if He did not love you So then I began to sing Father likes to hear me sing and the sweet sense I had that all I had been saying was true and more than true made me sing with joyful heart I hope it is not a mere miserable presumption that makes me dare to talk so to poor father Of course he is ten times better than I am and knows ten times as much but his disease whatever it is keeps his mind befogged I mean to begin now to pray that light may shine into his soul It would be delightful to see the peace of God shining in that pale stern face MARCH twenty eight It is almost six months since I wrote that About the middle of October father had one of his ill turns one night and we were all called up He asked for me particularly and Ernest came for me at last He was a good deal agitated and would not stop to half dress myself and as I had a slight cold already I suppose I added to it then At any rate I was taken very sick and the worst cough ever had has racked my poor frame almost to pieces Nearly six months confinement to my room six months of uselessness during which I have been a mere cumberer of the ground Poor Ernest What a hard time he has had Instead of the cheerful welcome home I was to give him whenever he entered the house here I have lain exhausted woe begone and good for nothing It is the bitterest disappointment I ever had My ambition is to be the sweetest brightest best of wives and what with my childish follies and my sickness what a weary life my dear husband has had But how often I have prayed that God would do His will in defiance if need be of mine I have tried to remind myself of that every day But I am too tired to write any more now MARCH thirty This experience of suffering has filled my mind with new thoughts At one time I was so sick that Ernest sent for mother Poor mother she had to sleep with Martha It was a great comfort to have her here but I knew by her coming how sick I was and then I began to ponder the question whether I was ready to die Death looked to me as a most solemn momentous event but there was something very pleasant in the thought of being no longer a sinner but a redeemed saint and of dwelling forever in Christ s presence Father came to see me when I had just reached this point My dear daughter he asked are you prepared to face the Judge of all the earth No dear father I said Christ will do that for me Have you no misgivings I could only smile I had no strength to talk Then I heard Ernest my dear calm self controlled Ernest burst out crying and rush out of the room I looked after him and how I loved him But I felt that I loved my Saviour infinitely more and that if He now let me come home to be with Him I could trust Him to be a thousand fold more to Ernest than I could ever be and to take care of my darling baby and my precious mother far better than I could The very gates of heaven seemed open to let me in And then they were suddenly shut in my face and I found myself a poor weak tempted creature here upon earth I who fancied myself an heir of glory was nothing but a peevish human creature very human indeed overcome if Martha shook the bed as she always did irritated if my food did not come at the right moment or was not of the right sort hurt and offended if Ernest put on at one less anxious and tender than he had used when I was very ill and in short my own poor faulty self once more Oh what fearful battles I fought for patience forbearance and unselfishness What sorrowful tears of shame I shed over hasty impatient words and fretful tones No wonder I longed to be gone where weakness should be swallowed up in strength and sin give place to eternal perfection But here I am and suffering and work lie before me for which I feel little physical or mental courage But blessed be the will of God APRIL five I was alone with father last evening Ernest and Martha both being out and soon saw by the way he fidgeted in his chair that he had something on his mind So I laid down the book I was reading and asked him what it was My daughter he began can you bear a plain word from an old man I felt frightened for I knew I had been impatient to Martha of late in spite of all my efforts to the contrary I am still so miserably unwell I have seen many death beds he went on but I never saw one where there was not some dread of the King of Terrors exhibited nor one where there was such absolute certainty of having found favor with God to make the hour of departure entirely free from such doubts and such humility as becomes a guilty sinner about to face his Judge I never saw such a one either I replied but ere have been many such deaths and I hardly know of any scene that so honors and magnifies the Lord Yes he said slowly but they were old mature ripened Christians Not always old dear father Let me describe to you a scene Ernest described to me only yesterday He waved his hand in token that this would delay his coming to the point he was aiming at To speak plainly he said I feel uneasy about you my daughter You are young and in the bloom of life but when death seemed staring you in the face you expressed no anxiety asked for no counsel showed no alarm It must be pleasant to possess so comfortable a persuasion of our acceptance with God but is it safe to rest on such an assurance while we know that the human heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked I thank you for the suggestion I said and dear father do not be afraid to speak still more plainly You live in the house with me see all my shortcomings and my faults and I cannot wonder that you think me a poor weak Christian But do you really fear that I am deceived in believing that notwithstanding this I do really love my God and Saviour and am His Child No he said hesitating a little I can t say that exactly I can t say that This hesitation distressed me At first it seemed to me that my life must have uttered a very uncertain sound if those who saw it could misunderstand its language But then I reflected that it was at best a very faulty life and that its springs of action were not necessarily seen by lookers on Father saw my distress and perplexity and seemed touched by them Just then Ernest came in with Martha but seeing that something was amiss the latter took herself off to her room which I thought really kind of her What is it father What is it Katy asked Ernest looking from one troubled face to the other I tried to explain I think father you may safely trust my wife s spiritual interests to me Ernest said with warmth You do not understand her I do Because there is nothing morbid about her because she has a sweet cheerful confidence in Christ you doubt and misjudge her You may depend upon it that people are individual in their piety as in other things and cannot all be run in one mould Katy has a playful way of speaking I know and often expresses her strongest feelings with what seems like levity and is perhaps a little reckless about being misunderstood in consequence He smiled on me as he thus took up the cudgels in my defence and I never felt so grateful to him in my life The truth is I hate sentimentalism so cordially and have besides such an instinct to conceal my deepest most sacred emotions that I do not wonder people misunderstand and misjudge me I did not refer to her playfulness father returned Old people must make allowances for the young they must make allowances What pains me is that this child full of life and gayety as she is sees death approach without that becoming awe and terror which befits mortal man Ernest was going to reply but I broke in eagerly upon his answer It is true that I expressed no anxiety when I believed death to be at hand I felt none I had given myself away to Christ and He had received me and why should I be afraid to take His hand and go where He led me And it is true that I asked for no counsel I was too weak to ask questions or to like to have questions asked but my mind was bright and wide awake while my body was so feeble and I took counsel of God Oh let me read to you two passages from the life of Caroline Fry which will make you understand how a poor sinner looks upon death The first is an extract from a letter written after learning that her days on earth were numbered As many will hear and will not understand why I want no time of preparation often desired by far holier ones than I I tell you why and shall tell others and so shall you It is not because I am so holy but because I am so sinful The peculiar character of my religious experience has always been a deep an agonizing sense of sin the sin of yesterday of to day confessed with anguish hard to be endured and cried for pardon that could not be unheard each day cleansed anew in Jesus blood and each day more and more hateful in my own sight what can I do in death I have not done in life What do in this week when I am told I cannot live other than I did last week when knew it not Alas there is but one thing undone to serve Him better and the death bed is no place for that Therefore I say if I am not ready now I shall not be by delay so far as I have to do with it If He has more to do in me that is His part I need not ask Him not to spoil His work by too much haste And these were her dying words a few days later This is my bridal day the beginning of my life I wish there should be no mistake about the reason of my desire to depart and to be with Christ I confess myself the vilest chiefest of sinners and I desire to go to Him that I may be rid of the burden of sin the sin of my nature not the past repented of every day but the present hourly momentary sin which I do commit or may commit the sense of which at times drives me half mad with grief I shall never forget the expression of father s face as I finished reading these remarkable words He rose slowly from his seat and came and kissed me on the forehead Then he left the room but returned with a large volume and pointing to a blank page requested me to copy them there He com plains that I do not write legibly so I printed them as plainly as I could with my pen JUNE twenty On the first of May there came to us with other spring flowers our little fair haired blue eyed daughter How rich I felt when I heard Ernest s voice as he replied to a question asked at the door proclaim Mother and children all well To think that we who thought ourselves rich before are made so much richer now But she is not large and vigorous as little Ernest was and we cannot rejoice in her without some misgiving Yet her very frailty makes her precious to us Little Ernest hangs over her with an almost lover like pride and devotion and should she live I can imagine what a protector he will be for her I have had to give up the care of him to Martha During my illness I do not know what would have become of him but for her One of the pleasant events of every day at that time was her bringing him to me in such exquisite order his face shining with health and happiness his hair and dress so beautifully neat and clean Now that she has the care of him she has become very fond of him and he certainly forms one bond of union between us for we both agree that he is the handsomest best most remarkable child that ever lived or ever will live JULY six I have come home to dear mother with both my children Ernest says our only hope for baby is to keep her out of the city during the summer months What a petite wee maiden she is Where does all the love come from If I had had her always I do not see how I could be more fond of her And do people call it living who never had any children JULY ten lf this darling baby lives I shall always believe it is owing to my mother s prayers I find little Ernest has a passionate temper and a good deal of self will But he has fine qualities I wish he had a better mother I am so impatient with him when he is wayward and perverse What he needs is a firm gentle hand moved by no caprice and controlled by the constant fear of God He never ought to hear an irritable word or a sharp tone but he does hear them I must own with grief and shame The truth is it is so long since I really felt strong and well that I am not myself and can not do him justice poor child Next to being a perfect wife I want to be a perfect mother How mortifying how dreadful in all things to come short of even one s own standard What approach then does one make to God s standard Mother seems very happy to have us here though we make so much trouble She encourages me in all my attempts to control myself and to control my dear little boy and the chapters she gives me out of her own experience are as interesting as a novel and a good deal more instructive AUGUST Dear Ernest has come to spend a week with us He is all tired out as there has been a great deal of sickness in the city and father has had quite a serious attack He brought with him a nurse for baby as one more desperate effort to strengthen her constitution I reproached him for doing it without consulting me but he said mother bad written to tell him that I was all worn out and not in a state to have the care of the children It has been a terrible blow to me One by one I am giving up the sweetest maternal duties God means that I shall be nothing and do nothing a mere useless sufferer But when I tell Ernest so he says I am everything to him and that God s children please him just as well when they sit patiently with folded hands if that is His will as when they are hard at work But to be at work to be useful to be necessary to my husband and children is just what I want and I do find it hard to be set against the wall as it were like an old piece of furniture no longer of any service I see now that my first desire has not been to please God but to please myself for I am restless under His restraining hand and find my prison a very narrow one I would be willing to bear any other trial if I could only have health and strength for my beloved ones I pray for patience with bitter tears Chapter sixteen XVI OCTOBER WE are all at home together once more The parting with mother was very painful Every year that she lives now increases her loneliness and makes me long to give her the shelter of my home But in the midst of these anxieties how much I have to make me happy Little Ernest is the life and soul of the house the sound of his feet pattering about and all his prattle are the sweetest music to my ear and his heart is brimful of love and joy so that he shines on us all like a sunbeam Baby is improving every day and is one of those tender clinging little things that appeal to everybody s love and sympathy I never saw a more angelic face than hers Father sits by the hour looking at her To day he said Daughter Katherine this lovely little one is not meant for this sinful world This world needs to be adorned with lovely little ones I said And baby was never so well as she is now Do not set your heart too fondly upon her he returned I feel that she is far too dear to me But father we could give her to God if He should ask for her Surely we love Him better than we love her But as I spoke a sharp pang shot through and through my soul and I held my little fair daughter closely in my arms as if I could always keep her there It may be my conceit but it really does seem as if poor father was getting a little fond of me Ever since my own sickness I have felt great sympathy for him and he feels no doubt that I give him something that neither Ernest nor Martha can do since they were never sick one day in their lives I do wish he could look more at Christ and at what He has done and is doing for us The way of salvation is to me a wide path absolutely radiant with the glory of Him who shines upon it I see my shortcomings I see my sins but I feel myself bathed as it were in the effulgent glow that proceeds directly from the throne of God and the Lamb It seems as if I ought to have some misgivings about my salvation but I can hardly say that I have one How strange how mysterious that is And here is father so much older so much better than I am creeping along in the dark I spoke to Ernest about it He says I owe it to my training in a great measure and that my mother is fifty years in advance of her age But it can t be all that It was only after years of struggle and prayer that God gave me this joy NOVEMBER twenty four Ernest asked me yesterday if I knew that Amelia and her husband had come here to live and that she was very ill I wish you would go to see her dear he added She is a stranger here and in great need of a friend I felt extremely disturbed I have lost my old affection for her and the idea of meeting her husband was unpleasant Is she very sick I asked Yes She is completely broken down I promised her that you should go to see her Are you attending her Yes her husband came for me himself I don t want to go I said It will be very disagreeable Yes dear I know it But she needs a friend as I said before I put on my things very reluctantly and went I found Amelia in a richly furnished house but looking untidy and ill cared for She was lying on a couch in her bedroom three delicate looking children were playing about and their nurse sat sewing at the window A terrible fit of coughing made it impossible for her to speak for some moments At last she recovered herself sufficiently to welcome me by throwing her arms around me and bursting into tears Oh Katy she cried should you have known me if we had met in the street Don t you find me sadly altered You are changed I said but so am I Yes you do not look strong But then you never did And you are as pretty as ever while I oh Kate do you remember what round white arms I used to have Look at them now And she drew up her sleeve poor child Just then I heard a step in the passage and her husband sauntered into the room smoking Do go away Charles she said impatiently You know how your cigar sets me coughing He held out his hand to me with the easy nonchalant air of one who is accustomed to success and popularity I looked at him with an aversion I could not conceal The few years since we met has changed him so completely that I almost shuddered at the sight of his already bloated face and at the air that told of a life worse than wasted Do go away Charles Amelia repeated He threw himself into a chair without paying the least attention to her and still addressing himself to me again said Upon my word you are prettier than ever and I will come to see you at another time Amelia I said putting on all the dignity I could condense in my small frame and rising to take leave Don t go Katy he cried starting up don t go I want to have a good talk about old times Katy indeed How dared he I came away burning with anger and mortification Is it possible that I ever loved such a man That to gratify that love I defied and grieved my dear mother through a whole year Oh from what hopeless misery God saved me when He snatched me out of the depth of my folly DECEMBER one Ernest says I can go to see Amelia with safety now as her husband has sprained his ankle and keeps to his own room So I am going But I am sure I shall say something imprudent or unwise and wish I could think it right to stay away I hope God will go with me and teach me what words to speak DEC two I found Amelia more unwell than on my first visit and she received me again with tears How good you are to come so soon she began I did not blame you for running off the other day Charley s impertinence was shameful He said after you left that he perceived you had not yet lost your quickness to take offence but I know he felt that you showed a just displeasure and nothing more No I was really angry I replied I find the road to perfection lies up hill and I slip back so often that sometimes I despair of ever reaching the top What does the doctor say about me she asked Does he think me very sick I dare say he will tell you exactly what he thinks I returned if you ask him This is his rule with all his patients If I could get rid of this cough I should soon be myself again she said Some days I feel quite bright and well But if it were not for my poor little children I should not care much how the thing ended With the life Charley leads me I haven t much to look forward to You forget that the children s nurse is in the room I whispered Oh I don t mind Charlotte Charlotte knows he neglects me don t you Charlotte Charlotte was discreet enough to pretend not to hear this question and Amelia went on It began very soon after we were married He would go round with other girls exactly as he did before then when I spoke about it he would just laugh in his easy good natured way but pay no attention to my wishes Then when I grew more in earnest he would say that as long as he let me alone I ought to let him alone I thought that when our first baby came that would sober him a little but be wanted a boy and it turned out to be a girl And my being unhappy and crying so much made the poor thing fretful it kept him awake at night so he took another room After that I saw him less than ever though now and then he would have a little love fit when he would promise to be at home more and treat me with more consideration We had two more little girls twins and then a boy Charley seemed quite fond of him and did certainly seem improved though he was still out a great deal with a set of idle young men smoking drinking wine and I don t know what else His uncle gave him too much money and he had nothing to do but to spend it You must not tell me any more now I said Wait till you are stronger The nurse rose and gave her something which seemed to refresh her I went to look at the little girls who were all pretty pale faced creatures very quiet and mature in their ways I am rested now said Amelia and it does me good to talk to you because I can see that you are sorry for me I am indeed I cried When our little boy was three months old I took this terrible cold and began to cough Charley at first remonstrated with me for coughing so much he said it was a habit I had got and that I ought to cure myself of it Then the baby began to pine and pine and the more it wasted the more I wasted And at last it died Here the poor child burst out again and I wiped away her tears as fast as they fell thankful that she could cry After that she went on after awhile Charley seemed to lose his last particle of affection for me he kept away more than ever and once when I besought him not to neglect me and my children so he said he was well paid for not keeping up his engagement with you that you had some strength of character and Amelia I interrupted do not repeat such things They only pain and mortify me Well she sighed wearily this is what he has at last brought me to I am sick and broken hearted and care very little what becomes of me There was a long silence I wanted to ask her if when earthly refuge failed her she could not find shelter in the love of Christ But I have what is I fear a morbid terror of seeking the confidence of others I knelt down at last and kissed the poor faded face Yes I knew you would feel for me she said The only pleasant thought I had when Charley insisted on coming here to live was that I should see you Does your uncle live here too I asked Yes he came first and it was that that put it into Charley s head to come He is very kind to me Yes I said and God is kind too isn t He Kind to let me get sick and disgust Charley Now Katy how can you talk so I replied by repeating two lines from a hymn of which I am very fond O Saviour whose mercy severe in its kindness Hath chastened my wanderings and guided my way I don t much care for hymns she said When one is well and everything goes quite to one s mind it is nice to go to church and sing with the rest of them But sick as I am it isn t so easy to be religious But isn t this the very time to look to Christ for comfort What s the use of looking anywhere for comfort she said peevishly Wait till you are sick and heart broken yourself and you ll see that you won t feel much like doing anything but just groan and cry your life out I have been sick and I know what sorrow means I said And I am glad that I do For I have learned Christ in that school and I know that He can comfort when no one else can You always were an odd creature she replied I never pretended to understand half you said I saw that she was tired and came away Oh how I wished that I had been able to make Christ look to her as He did to me all the way home DEC twenty four Father says he does not like doctor Cabot s preaching He thinks that it is not doctrinal enough and that he does not preach enough to sinners But I can see that it has influenced him already and that he is beginning to think of God as manifested in Christ far more than he used to do With me he has endless discussions on his and my favorite subjects and though I can never tell along what path I walked to reach a certain conclusion the earnestness of my convictions does impress him strangely I am sure there is a great deal of conceit mixed up with all I say and then when I compare my life with my own standard of duty I wonder I ever dare to open my mouth and undertake to help others Baby is not at all well To see a little frail tender thing really suffering tears my soul to pieces I think it would distress me less to give her to God just as she is now a vital part of my very heart than to see her live a mere invalid life But I try to feel as I know I say Thy will be done Little Ernest is the very picture of health and beauty He has vitality enough for two children He and his little sister will make very interesting contrasts as they grow older His ardor and vivacity will rouse her and her gentleness will soften him JAN one eighteen forty one Every day brings its own duty and its own discipline How is it that I make such slow progress while this is the case It is a marvel to me why God allows characters like mine to defile His church I can only account for it with the thought that if I ever am perfected I shall be a great honor to His name for surely worse material for building up a temple of the Holy Ghost was never gathered together before The time may come when those who know me now crude childish incomplete will look upon me with amazement saying What hath God wrought If I knew such a time would never come I should want to flee into the holes and caves of the earth I have everything to inspire me to devotion My dear mother s influence is always upon me To her I owe the habit of flying to God in every emergency and of believing in prayer Then I am in close fellowship with a true man and a true Christian Ernest has none of my fluctuations he is always calm and self possessed This is partly his natural character but he has studied the Bible more than any other book his convictions of duty are fixed because they are drawn thence and his constant contact with the sick and the suffering has revealed life to him just as it is How he has helped me on God bless him for it Then I have James To be with him one half hour is an inspiration He lives in such blessed communion with Christ that he is in perpetual sunshine and his happiness fertilizes even this disordered household there is not a soul in it that does not catch somewhat of his joyousness And there are my children My darling precious children For their sakes I am continually constrained to seek after an amended a sanctified life what I want them to become I must become myself So I enter on a new year not knowing what it will bring forth but surely with a thousand reasons for thanksgiving for joy and for hope JAN sixteen One more desperate effort to make harmony out of the discords of my house and one more failure Ernest forgot that it was our wedding day which mortified and pained me especially as he had made an engagement to dine out I am always expecting something from life that I never get Is it so with everybody I am very uneasy too about James He seems to be growing fond of Lucy s society I am perfectly sure that she could not make him happy Is it possible that he does not know what a brilliant young man he is and that he can have whom he pleases It is easy in theory to let God plan our own destiny and that of our friends But when it comes to a specific case we fancy we can help His judgments with our poor reason Well I must go to Him with this new anxiety and trust my darling brother s future to Him if I can I shall try to win James confidence If it is not Lucy who or what is it that is making him so thoughtful and serious yet so wondrously happy JAN seventeen I have been trying to find out whether this is a mere notion of mine about Lucy James laughs and evades my questions But he owns that a very serious matter is occupying his thoughts of which he does not wish to speak at present May God bless him in it whatever it is MAY one My delicate little Una s first birthday Thank God for sparing her to us a year If He should take her away I should still rejoice that this life was mingled with ours and has influenced them Yes even an unconscious infant is an ever felt influence in the household what an amazing thought I have given this precious little one away to her Saviour and to mine living or dying she is His DEC thirteen Writing journals does not seem to be my mission on earth of late My busy hands find so much else to do And sometimes when I have been particularly exasperated and tried by the jarring elements that form my home I have not dared to indulge myself with recording things that ought to be forgotten How I long to live in peace with all men and how I resent interference in the management of my children If the time ever comes that I live a spinster of a certain age in the family of an elder brother what a model of forbearance charity and sisterly loving kindness I shall be Chapter seventeen XVII JANUARY one eighteen forty two I MEAN to resume my journal and be more faithful to it this year How many precious things said by dear missus Campbell and others are lost forever because I did not record them at the time I have seen her to day At Ernest s suggestion I have let Susan Green provide her with a comfortable chair which enables her to sit up during a part of each day I found her in it full of gratitude her sweet tranquil face shining as it always is with a light reflected from heaven itself She looks like one who has had her struggle with life and conquered it During last year I visited her often and gradually learned much of her past history though she does not love to talk of herself She has outlived her husband a houseful of girls and her ill health is chiefly the result of years of watching by their sick beds and grief at their loss For she does not pretend not to grieve but always says It is repining that dishonors God not grief I said to her to day Doesn t it seem hard when you think of the many happy homes there are in the world that you should be singled out for such bereavement and loneliness She replied with a smile I am not singled out dear There are thousands of God s own dear children scattered over the world suffering far more than I do And I do not think there are many persons in it who are happier than I am I was bound to my God and Saviour before I knew a sorrow it is true But it was by a chain of many links and every link that dropped away brought me to Him till at last having nothing left I was shut up to Him and learned fully what I had only learned partially how soul satisfying He is You think then I said while my heart died within me that husband and children are obstacles in our way and hinder our getting near to Christ Oh no she cried God never gives us hindrances On the contrary He means in making us wives and mothers to put us into the very conditions of holy living But if we abuse His gifts by letting them take His place in our hearts it is an act of love on His part to take them away or to destroy our pleasure in them It is delightful she added after a pause to know that there are some generous souls on earth who love their dear ones with all their hearts yet give those hearts unreservedly to Christ Mine was not one of them I had some little service to render her which interrupted our conversation The offices I have had to have rendered me in my own long days of sickness have taught me to be less fastidious about waiting upon others I am thankful that God has at last made me willing to do anything in a sickroom that must be done She thanked me as she always does and then I said I have a great many little trials but they don t do me a bit of good Or at least I don t see that they do No we never see plants growing she said And do you really think then that perhaps I am growing though unconsciously I know you are dear child There can t be life without growth This comforted me I came home praying all the way and striving to commit myself entirely to Him in whose school I sit as learner Oh that I were a better scholar But I do not half learn my lessons I am heedless and inattentive and I forget what is taught Perhaps this is the reason that weighty truths float before my mind s eye at times but do not fix themselves there MARCH twenty I have been much impressed by doctor Cabot s sermons to day while I am listening to his voice and hear him speak of the beauty and desirableness of the Christian life I feel as he feels that I am waiting to count all things but dross that I may win Christ But when I come home to my worldly cares I get completely absorbed in them it is only by a painful wrench that I force my soul back to God Sometimes I almost envy Lucy her calm nature which gives her so little trouble Why need I throw my whole soul into whatever I do Why can t I make so much as an apron for little Ernest without the ardor and eagerness of a soldier marching to battle I wonder if people of my temperament ever get toned down and learn to take life coolly JUNE ten My dear little Una has had a long and very severe illness It seems wonderful that she could survive such sufferings And it is almost as wonderful that I could look upon them week after week without losing my senses At first Ernest paid little attention to my repeated entreaties that he would prescribe for her and some precious time was thus lost But the moment he was fully aroused to see her danger there was something beautiful in his devotion He often walked the room with her by the hour together and it was touching to see her lying like a pale crushed lily in his strong arms One morning she seemed almost gone and we knelt around her with bursting hearts to commend her parting soul to Him in whose arms we were about to place her But it seemed as if all He asked of us was to come to that point for then He gave her back to us and she is still ours only seven fold dearer I was so thankful to see dear Ernest s faith triumphing over his heart and making him so ready to give up even this little lamb without a word Yes we will give our children to Him if he asks for them He shall never have to snatch them from us by force OCT four We have had a quiet summer in the country that is I have with my darling little ones This is the fourth birthday of our son and heir and he has been full of health and vivacity enjoying everything with all his heart How he lights up our sombre household Father has been fasting to day and is so worn out and so nervous in consequence that he could not bear the sound of the children s voices I wish if he must fast he would do it moderately and do it all the time Now he goes without food until he is ready to sink and now he eats quantities of improper food If Martha could only see how mischievous all this is for him After the children had been hustled out of the way and I had got them both off to bed he said in his most doleful manner I hope my daughter that you are faithful to your son He has now reached the age of four years and is a remarkably intelligent child I hope you teach him that he is a sinner and that he is in a state of condemnation Now father don t I said You are all tired out and do not know what you are saying I would not have little Ernest hear you for the world Poor father He fairly groaned You are responsible for that child s soul he said you have more influence over him than all the world beside I know it I said and sometimes I feel ready to sink when I think of the great work God has intrusted to me But my poor child will learn that he is a sinner only too soon and before that dreadful day arrives I want to fortify his soul with the only antidote against the misery that knowledge will give him I want him to see his Redeemer in all His love and all His beauty and to love Him with all his heart and soul and mind and strength Dear father pray for him and pray for me too I do I will he said solemnly And then followed the inevitable long fit of silent musing when I often wonder what is passing in that suffering soul For a sufferer he certainly is who sees a great and good and terrible God who cannot look upon iniquity and does not see His risen Son who has paid the debt we owe and lives to intercede for us before the throne of the Father JAN I eighteen forty two James came to me yesterday with a letter he had been writing to mother I want you to read this before it goes he said for you ought to know my plans as soon as mother does I did not get time to read it till after tea Then I came up here to my room and sat down curious to know what was coming Well I thought I loved him as much as one human being could love another already but now my heart embraced him with a fervor and delight that made me so happy that I could not speak a word when I knelt down to tell my Saviour all about it He said that he had been led within a few months to make a new consecration of himself to Christ and to Christ s cause on earth and that this had resulted in his choosing the life of a missionary instead of settling down as he had intended to do as a city physician Such expressions of personal love to Christ and delight in the thought of serving Him I never read I could only marvel at what God had wrought in his soul For me to live to Christ seems natural enough for I have been driven to Him not only by sorrow but by sin Every outbreak of my hasty temper sends me weeping and penitent to the foot of the cross and I love much because I have been forgiven much But James as far as I know has never had a sorrow except my father s death and that had no apparent religious effect And his natural character is perfectly beautiful He is as warm hearted and loving and simple and guileless as a child and has nothing of my intemperance hastiness and quick temper I have often thought that she would be a rare woman who could win and wear such a heart as his Life has done little but smile upon him he is handsome and talented and attractive everybody is fascinated by him everybody caresses him and yet he has turned his back on the world that has dealt so kindly with him and given himself as Edwards says clean away to Christ Oh how thankful I am And yet to let him go My only brother mother s Son But I know what she will say she will him God speed Ernest came upstairs looking tired and jaded I read the letter to him It impressed him strangely but he only said This is what we m might expect who knew James dear fellow But when we knelt down to pray together I saw how he was touched and how his soul kindled within him in harmony with that consecrated devoted spirit Dear James it must be mother s prayers that have done for him this wondrous work that is usually the slow growth of years and this is the mother who prays for you Katy So take courage JAN two James means to study theology as well as medicine it seems That will keep him with us for some years Oh is it selfish to take this view of it Alas the spirit is willing to have him go but the flesh is weak and cries out OCT twenty two Amelia came to see me to day She has been traveling for her health and certainly looks much improved Charley and I are quite good friends again she began We have jaunted about everywhere and have a delightful time What a snug little box of a house you have It is inconveniently small I said for our family is large and the doctor needs more office room Does he receive patients here How horrid Don t you hate to have people with all sorts of ills and aches in the house It must depress your spirits I dare say it would if I saw them but I never do I should like to see your children Your husband says you are perfectly devoted to them As I suppose all mothers are I replied laughing As to that she returned people differ The children were brought down She admired little Ernest as everybody does but only glanced at the baby What a sickly looking little thing she said But this boy is a splendid fellow Ah if mine had lived he would have been just such a child But some people have all the trouble and others all the comfort I am sure I don t know what I have done that I should have to lose my only boy and have nothing left but girls To be sure I can afford to dress them elegantly and as soon as they get old enough I mean to have them taught all sorts of accomplishments You can t imagine what a relief it is to have plenty of money Indeed I can t I said it is quite beyond the reach of my imagination My uncle that is to say Charley s uncle has just given me a carriage and horses for my own use In fact he heaps everything upon me Where do you go to church I told her reminding her that doctor Cabot was its pastor Oh I forgot Poor doctor Cabot Is he as old fashioned as ever I don t know what you mean I cried He is as good as ever if not better His health is very delicate and that one thing seems to be a blessing to him A blessing Why Kate Mortimer Kate Elliott I mean It is a blessing I for one am very willing to dispense with But you always did say queer things Well I dare say doctor Cabot is very good and all that but his church is not a fashionable one and Charley and I go to doctor Bellamy s That is I go once a day pretty regularly and Charley goes when he feels like it Good by I must go now I have all my fall shopping to do Have you done yours Suppose you jump into the carriage and go with me You can t imagine how it passes away the morning to drive from shop to shop looking over the new goods There seem to be a number of things I can t imagine I replied dryly You must excuse me this morning She took her leave I looked at her rich dress as she gathered it about her and swept away and recalled all her empty frivolous talk with contempt She and Ch her husband I mean are well matched They need their money and their palaces and their fine clothes and handsome equipages for they have nothing else How thankful I am that I am as unlike them as ex OCTOBER thirty I m sure I don t know what I was going to say when I was interrupted just then Something in the way of self glorification most likely I remember the contempt with which I looked after Amelia as she left our house and the pinnacle on which I sat perched for some days when I compared my life with hers Alas it was my view of life of which I was lost in admiration for I am sure that if I ever come under the complete dominion of Christ s gospel I shall not know the Sentiment of disdain I feel truly ashamed and sorry that I am still so far from being penetrated with that spirit My pride has had a terrible fall As I sat on my throne looking down on all the Amelias in the world I felt a profound pity at their delight in petty trifles their love of position of mere worldly show and passing vanities They are all alike I said to myself They are incapable of understanding a character like mine or the exalted ennobling principles that govern me They crave the applause of this world they are satisfied with fine clothes fine houses fine equipages They think and talk of nothing else I have not one idea in common with them I see the emptiness and hollowness of these things I am absolutely unworldly my ambition is to attain whatever they in their blind folly and ignorance absolutely despise Thus communing with myself I was not a little pleased to hear doctor Cabot and his wife announced I hastened to meet them and to display to them the virtues I so admired in myself They had hardly a chance to utter a word I spoke eloquently of my contempt for worldly vanities and of my enthusiastic longings for a higher life I even went into particulars about the foibles of some of my acquaintances though faint misgivings as to the propriety of such remarks on the absent made me half repent the words I still kept uttering When they took leave I rushed to my room with my heart beating my cheeks all in a glow and caught up and caressed the children in a way that seemed to astonish them Then I took my work and sat down to sew What a horrible reaction now took place I saw my refined subtle disgusting pride just as I suppose doctor and missus Cabot saw it I sat covered with confusion shocked at myself shocked at the weakness of human nature Oh to get back the good opinion of my friends To recover my own self respect But this was impossible I threw down my work and walked about my room There was a terrible struggle in my soul I saw that instead of brooding over the display I had made of myself to doctor Cabot I ought to be thinking solely of my appearance in the sight of God who could see far more plainly than any earthly eye could all my miserable pride and self conceit But I could not do that and chafed about till I was worn out body and soul At last I sent the children away and knelt down and told the whole story to Him who knew what I was when He had compassion on me called me by my name and made me His own child And here I found a certain peace Christian on his way to the celestial city met and fought his Apollyons and his giants too but he got there at last Chapter eighteen XVIII NOVEMBER THIS morning Ernest received an early summons to Amelia I got out of all manner of patience with him because he would take his bath and eat his breakfast before he went and should have driven any one else distracted by my hurry and flurry She has had a hemorrhage I cried Do Ernest make haste Of course he returned that would come sooner or later You don t mean I said that she has been in danger of this all along I certainly do Then it was very unkind in you not to tell me so I told you at the outset that her lungs were diseased No you told me no such thing Oh Ernest is she going to die I did not know you were so fond of her he said apologetically It is not that I cried I am distressed at the thought of the worldly life she has been living at my never trying to influence her for her good If she is in danger you will tell her so Promise me that I must see her before I make such a promise he said and went out I flew up to my room and threw myself on my knees sorrowful self condemned I had thrown away my last opportunity of speaking a word to her in season though I had seen how much she needed one and now she was going to die Oh I hope God will forgive me and hear the prayers I have offered her EVENING Ernest says he had a most distressing scene at Amelia s this morning She insisted on knowing what he thought of her and then burst out bitter complaints and lamentations charging it to husband that she had this disease declaring that she could not and would not die and insisting that he must prevent it Her uncle urged for a consultation of physicians to which Ernest consented of course though he says no mortal power can save her now I asked him how her husband appeared to which he made the evasive answer that he appeared just as one would expect him to do DECEMBER Amelia was so determined to see me that Ernest thought it best for me to go I found her looking very feeble Oh Katy she began at once do make the doctor say that I shall get well I wish he could say so with truth I answered Dear Amelia try to think how happy God s own children are when they are with Him I can t think she replied I do not want to think I want to forget all about it If it were not for this terrible cough I could forget it for I am really a great deal better than I was a month ago I did not know what to say or what to do May I read a hymn or a few verses from the Bible I asked at last Just as you like she said indifferently I read a verse now and then but she looked tired and I prepared to go Don t go she cried I do not dare to be alone Oh what a terrible terrible thing it is to die To leave this bright beautiful world and be nailed in a coffin and buried up in a cold dark grave Nay I said to leave this poor sick body there and to fly to a world ten thousand times brighter more beautiful than this I had just got to feeling nearly well she said and I had everything I wanted and Charley was quite good to me and I kept my little girls looking like fairies just from fairy land Everybody said they wore the most picturesque costumes when they were dressed according to my taste And I have got to go and leave them and Charley will be marrying somebody else and saying to her all the nice things he has said to me I really must go now I said You are wearing yourself all out I declare you are crying she exclaimed You do pity me after all Indeed I do I said and came away heartsick Ernest says there is nothing I can do for her now but to pray for her since she does not really believe herself in danger and has a vague feeling that if she can once convince him how much she wants to live he will use some vigorous measures to restore her Martha is to watch with her to night Ernest will not let me JAN eighteen eighteen forty three Our wedding day has passed unobserved Amelia s suffering condition absorbs us all Martha spends much time with her and prepares almost all the food she eats JAN twenty I have seen poor Amelia once more and perhaps for the last time She has failed rapidly of late and Ernest says may drop away at almost any time When I went in she took me by the hand and with great difficulty and at intervals said something like this I have made up my mind to it and I know it must come I want to see doctor Cabot Do you think he would be willing to visit me after my neglecting him so I am sure he would I cried I want to ask him if he thinks I was a Christian at that time you know when If I was then I need not be so afraid to die But dear Amelia what he thinks is very little to the purpose The question is not whether you ever gave yourself to God but whether you are His now But I ought not to talk to you doctor Cabot will know just what to say No but I want to know what you thought about it I felt distressed as I looked at her wasted dying figure to be called on to help decide such a question But I knew what I ought to say and said it Don t look back to the past it is useless Give yourself to Christ now She shook her head I don t know how she said Oh Katy pray to God to let me live long enough to get ready to die I have led a worldly life I shudder at the bare thought of dying I must have time Don t wait for time I said with tears get ready now this minute A thousand years would not make you more fit to die So I came away weary and heavy laden and on the way home stopped to tell doctor Cabot all about it and by this time he is with her MARCH one Poor Amelia s short race on earth is over doctor Cabot saw her every few days and says he hopes she did depart in Christian faith though without Christian joy I have not seen her since that last interview That excited me so that Ernest would not let me go again Martha has been there nearly the whole time for three or four weeks and I really think it has done her good She seems less absorbed in mere outside things and more lenient toward me and my failings I do not know what is to become of those mother little girls I wish I could take them into my own home but of course that is not even to be thought at this juncture Ernest says their father seemed nearly distracted when Amelia died and that his uncle is going to send him off to Europe immediately I have been talking with Ernest about Amelia What do you think I asked about her last days on earth Was there really any preparation for death These scenes are very painful he returned Of course there is but one real preparation for Christian dying and that is Christian living But the sick room often does what a prosperous life never did Not often Sick persons delude themselves or are deluded by their friends they do not believe they are really about to die Besides they are bewildered and exhausted by disease and what mental strength they have is occupied with studying symptoms watching for the doctor and the like I do not now recall a single instance where a worldly Christian died a happy joyful death in all my practice Well in one sense it makes no difference whether they die happily or not The question is do they die in the Lord It may make no vital difference to them but we must not forget that God is honored or dishonored by the way a Christian dies as well as by the way in which he lives There is great significance in the description given in the Bible of the death by which John should Glorify God to my mind it that to die well is to live well But how many thousands die suddenly or of such exhausting disease that they cannot honor God by even one feeble word Of course I do not refer to such cases All I ask is that those whose minds are clear who are able to attend to all other final details should let it be seen what the gospel of Christ can do for poor sinners in the great exigency of life giving Him the glory I can tell you my darling that standing as I so often do by dying beds this whole subject has become one of great magnitude to my mind And it gives me positive personal pain to see heirs of the eternal kingdom made such by the ignominious death of their Lord go shrinking and weeping to the full possession of their inheritance Ernest is right I am sure but how shall the world even the Christian world be convinced that it may have blessed fortastes of heaven while yet plodding upon earth and faith to go thither joyfully for the simple asking Poor Amelia But she understands it all now It is a blessed thing to have this great faith and it is a blessed thing to have a Saviour who accepts it when it is but a mere grain of mustard seed MAY twenty four I celebrated my little Una s third birthday by presenting her with a new brother Both the children welcomed him with delight that was itself compensation enough for all it cost me to get up such a celebration Martha takes a most prosaic view of this proceeding in which she detects malice prepense on my part She says I shall now have one mouth the more to fill and two feet the more to shoe more disturbed nights more laborious days and less leisure for visiting reading music and drawing Well this is one side of the story to be sure but I look at the other Here is a sweet fragrant mouth to kiss here are two more feet to make music with their pattering about my nursery Here is a soul to train for God and the body in which it dwells is worthy all it will cost since it is the abode of a kingly tenant I may see less of friends but I have gained one dearer than them all to whom while I minister in Christ s name I make a willing sacrifice of what little leisure for my own recreation my other darlings had left me Yes my precious baby you are welcome to your mother s heart welcome to her time her strength her health her tenderest cares to her life long prayers Oh how rich I am how truly how wondrously blest JUNE five We begin to be woefully crowded We need a larger house or a smaller household I am afraid I secretly down at the bottom of my heart wish Martha and her father could give place to my little ones May God forgive me if this is so It is a poor time for such emotions when He has just given me another darling child for whom I have as rich and ample a love as if I had spent no affection on the other twain I have made myself especially kind to poor father and to Martha lest they should perceive how inconvenient it is to have them here and be pained by it I would not for the world despoil them of what little satisfaction they may derive from living with us But oh I am so selfish and it is so hard to practice the very law of love I preach to my children Yet I want this law to rule and reign in my home that it may be a little heaven below and I will not no I will not cease praying that it may be such no matter what it costs me Poor father poor old man I will try to make your home so sweet and home like to you that when you change it for heaven it shall be but a transition from one bliss to a higher EVENING Soon after writing that I went down to see father whom I have had to neglect of late baby has so used up both time and strength I found him and Martha engaged in what seemed to be an exciting debate as Martha had a fiery little red spot on each cheek and was knitting furiously I was about to retreat when she got up in a flurried way and went off saying as she went You tell her father I can t I went up to him tenderly and took his hand Ah how gentle and loving we are when we have just been speaking to God What is it dear father I asked is anything troubling you She is going to be married he replied Oh father I cried how n nice I was going to say but stopped just in time All my abominable selfishness that I thought I had left at my Master s feet ten minutes before now came trooping back in full force She s going to be married she ll go away and will take her father to live with her I can have room for my children and room for mother Every element of discord will now leave my home and Ernest will see what I really am These were the thoughts that rushed through my mind and that illuminated my face Does Ernest know I asked Yes Ernest has known it for some weeks Then I felt injured and inwardly accused Ernest of unkindness in keeping so important a fact a secret But when I went back to my children vexation with him took flight at once The coming of each new child strengthens and deepens my desire to be what I would have it become makes my faults more odious in my eyes and elevates my whole character What a blessed discipline of joy and of pain my married life has been how thankful I am to reap its fruits even while pricked by its thorns JUNE twenty one It seems that the happy man who has wooed Martha and won her is no less a personage than old mister Underhill His ideal of a woman is one who has no nerves no sentiment no backaches no headaches who will see that the wheels of his household machinery are kept well oiled so that he need never hear them creak and who in addition to her other accomplishments believes in him and will be kind enough to live forever for his private accommodation This expose of his sentiments he has made to me in a loud cheerful pompous way and he has also favored me with a description of his first wife who lacked all these qualifications and was obliging enough to depart in peace at an early stage of their married life meekly preferring thus to make way for a worthier successor mister Underhill with all his foibles however is on the whole a good man He intends to take Amelia s little girls into his own home and be a father as Martha will be a mother to them For this reason he hurries on the marriage after which they will all go at once to his country seat which is easy of access and which he says he is sure father will enjoy Poor old father I hope he will but when the subject is alluded to he maintains a sombre silence and it seems to me he never spent so many days alone in his room brooding over his misery as he has of late Oh that I could comfort him JULY twelve The marriage was appointed for the first of the month as old mister Underhill wanted to get out of town before the Fourth As the time drew near Martha began to pack father s trunk as well as her own and brush in and out of his room till he had no rest for the sole of his foot and seemed as forlorn as a pelican in the wilderness I know no more striking picture of desolation than that presented by one of these quaint birds standing upon a single leg feeling as the story has it den Jammer und das Elend der Welt On the last evening in June we all sat together on the piazza enjoying each in our own way a refreshing breeze that had sprung up after a sultry day Father was quieter than usual and seemed very languid Ernest who out of regard to Martha s last evening at home had joined our little circle ob served this and said cheerfully You will feel better as soon as you are once more out of the city father Father made no reply for some minutes and when he did speak we were all startled to find that his voice trembled as if he were shedding tears We could not understand what he said I went to him and made him lean his head upon me as he often did when it ached He took my hand in both his You do love the old man a little he asked in the same tremulous voice Indeed I do I cried greatly touched by his helpless appeal I love you dearly father And I shall miss you sadly Must I go away then he whispered Cannot I stay here till my summons hence It will not be long it will not be long my child With the cry of a hurt animal Martha sprang up and rushed past us into the house Ernest followed her and we heard them talking together a long time At last Ernest joined us Father he said Martha is a good deal wounded and disappointed at your reluctance to go with her She threatened to break off her engagement rather than to be separated from you I really think you would be better off with her than with us You would enjoy country life because it is what you have been accustomed to you could spend hours of every day in driving about just what your health requires Father did not reply He took Ernest s arm and tottered into the house Then we had a most painful scene Martha reminded him with bitter tears that her mother had committed him to her with her last breath and set before him all the advantages he would have in her house over ours Father sat pale and inflexible tear after tear rolling down his cheeks Ernest looked distressed and ready to sink As for me I cried with Martha and with her father by turns and clung to Ernest with a feeling that all the foundations of the earth were giving way It came time for evening prayers and Ernest prayed as he rarely does for he is rarely so moved He quieted us all by a few simple words of appeal to Him who loved us and father then consented to spend the summer with Martha if he might call our home his home and be with us through the winter But this was not till long after the rest of us went to bed and a hard battle with Ernest He says Ernest is his favorite child and that I am his favorite daughter and our children inexpressibly dear to him I am ashamed to write down what he said of me Besides I am sure there is a wicked wicked triumph over Martha in my secret heart I am too elated with his extraordinary preference for us to sympathize with her mortification and grief as ought Something whispered that she who has never pitied me deserves no pity now But I do not like this mean and narrow spirit in myself nay more I hate and abhor it The marriage took place and they all went off together father s rigid white face whiter more rigid than ever I am to go to mother s with the children at once I feel that a great stone has been rolled away from before the door of my heart the one human being who refused me a kindly smile a sympathizing word has gone never to return May God go with her and give her a happy home and make her true and loving to those motherless little ones Chapter nineteen XIX OCTOBER one I Have had a charming summer with dear mother and now I have the great joy so long deferred of having her in my own home Ernest has been very cordial about it and James has settled up all her worldly affairs so that she has nothing to do now but to love us and let us love her It is a pleasant picture to see her with my little darlings about her telling the old sweet story she told me so often and making God and Heaven and Christ such blissful realities As I listen I realize that it is to her I owe that early deeply seated longing to please the Lord Jesus which I never remember as having a beginning or an ending though it did have its fluctuations And it is another pleasant picture to see her sit in her own old chair which Ernest was thoughtful enough to have brought for her pondering cheerfully over her Bible and her Thomas a Kempis just as I have seen her do ever since I can remember And there is still a third pleasant picture only that it is a new one it is as she sits at my right hand at the table the living personification of the blessed gospel of good tidings with father opposite the fading image of the law given by Moses For father has come back father and all his ailments his pill boxes his fits of despair and his fits of dying But he is quiet and gentle and even loving and as he sits in his corner his Bible on his knees I see how much more he reads the New Testament than he used to do and that the fourteenth chapter of saint John almost opens to him of itself I must do Martha the justice to say that her absence while it increases my domestic peace and happiness increases my cares also What with the children the housekeeping the thought for mother s little comforts and the concern for father s I am like a bit of chaff driven before the wind and always in a hurry There are so many stitches to be taken so many things to pass through one s brain Mother says no mortal woman ought to undertake so much but what can I do While Ernest is straining every nerve to pay off those debts I must do all the needlework and we must get along with servants whose want of skill makes them willing to put up with low wages Of course I cannot tell mother this and I really believe she thinks I scrimp and pinch and overdo out of mere stinginess DECEMBER thirty Ernest came to me to day with our accounts for the last three months He looked quite worried for him and asked me if there were any expenses we could cut down My heart jumped up into my mouth and I said in an irritated way I am killing myself with over work now Mother says so I sew every night till twelve o clock and I feel all jaded out I did not mean that I wanted you to do anymore than you are doing now dear he said kindly I know you are all jaded out and I look on this state of feverish activity with great anxiety Are all these stitches absolutely necessary You men know nothing about such things I said while my conscience pricked me as I went on hurrying to finish the fifth tuck in one of Una s little dresses Of course I want my children to look decent Ernest sighed I really don t know what to do he said in a hopeless way Father s persisting in living with us is throwing a burden on you that with all your other cares is quite too much for you I see and feel it every day Don t you think I had better explain this to him and let him go to Martha s No indeed I said He shall stay here if it kills me poor old man Ernest began once more to look over the bills I don t know how it is he said but since Martha left us our expenses have increased a good deal Now the truth is that when Aunty paid me most generously for teaching her children I did not dare to offer my earnings to Ernest lest he should be annoyed So I had quietly used it for household expenses and it had held out till about the time of Martha s marriage Ernest s injustice was just as painful just as insufferable as if he had known this and I now burst out with whatever my rasped over taxed nerves impelled me to say like one possessed Ernest was annoyed and surprised I thought we had done with these things he said and gathering up the papers he went off I rose and locked my door and threw myself down upon the floor in an agony of shame anger and physical exhaustion I did not know how large a part of what seemed mere childish ill temper was really the cry of exasperated nerves that had been on too strained a tension and silent too long and Ernest did not know it either How could he His profession kept him for hours every day in the open air there were times when his work was done and he could take entire rest and his health is absolutely perfect But I did not make any excuse for myself at the moment I was overwhelmed with the sense of my utter unfitness to be a wife and a mother Then I heard Ernest try to open the door and finding it locked he knocked calling pleasantly It is I darling let me in I opened it reluctantly enough Come he said put on your things and drive about with me on my rounds I have no long visits to make and while I am seeing my patients you will be getting the air which you need I do not want to go I said I do not feel well enough Besides there s my work You can t see to sew with these red eyes he declared Come I prescribe a drive as your physician Oh Ernest how kind how forgiving you are I cried running into the arms he held out to me If you knew how ashamed how sorry I am And if you only knew how ashamed and sorry I am he returned I ought to have seen how you taxing and over taxing yourself doing your work and Martha s too It must not go on so By this time with a veil over my face he had got me downstairs and out into the air which fanned my fiery cheeks and cooled my heated brain It seemed to me that I have had all this tempest about nothing at all and that with a character still so undisciplined I was utterly unworthy to be either a wife or a mother But when I tried to say so in broken words Ernest comforted me with the gentleness and tenderness of a woman Your character is not undisciplined my darling he said Your nervous organization is very peculiar and you have had unusual cares and trials from the beginning of our married life I ought not to have confronted you with my father s debts at a moment when you had every reason to look forward to freedom from most petty economies and cares Don t say so I interrupted If you had not told me you had this draft on your resources I should have always suspected you of meanness For you know dear you have kept me that is to say you could not help it but I suppose men can t understand how many demands are made upon a mother for money almost every day I got along very well till the children came but since then it has been very hard Yes he said I am sure it has But let me finish what I was going to say I want you to make a distinction for yourself which I make for you between mere ill temper and the irritability that is the result of a goaded state of the nerves Until you do that nothing can be done to relieve you from what I am sure distresses and grieves you exceedingly Now I suppose that whenever you speak to me or the children in this irritated way you lose your own self respect for the time at least and feel degraded in the sight of God also Oh Ernest there are no words in any language that mean enough to express the anguish I feel when I speak quick impatient words to you the one human being in the universe whom I love with all my heart and soul and to my darling little children who are almost as dear I pray and mourn over it day and night God only knows how I hate myself on account of this one horrible sin It is a sin only as you deliberately and wilfully fulfill the conditions that lead to such results Now I am sure if you could once make up your mind in the fear of God never to undertake more work of any sort than you can carry on calmly quietly without hurry or flurry and the instant you find yourself growing nervous and like one out of breath would stop and take breath you would find this simple common sense rule doing for you what no prayers or tears could ever accomplish Will you try it for one month my darling But we can t afford it I cried with almost a groan Why you have told me this very day that our expenses must be cut down and now you want me to add to them by doing less work But the work must be done The children must be clothed there is no end to the stitches to be taken for them and your stockings must be mended you make enormous holes in them and you don t like it if you ever find a button wanting to a shirt or your supply of shirts getting low All you say may be very true he returned but I am determined that you shall not be driven to desperation as you have been of late By this time we had reached the house where his visit was to be made and I had nothing to do but lean back and revolve all he had been saying over and over again and to see its reasonableness while I could not see what was so be done for my relief Ah I have often felt in moments of bitter grief at my impatience with my children that perhaps God pitied more than He blamed me for it And now my dear husband was doing the same When Ernest had finished his visit we drove on again in silence At last I asked Do tell me Ernest if you worked out this problem all by yourself He smiled a little No I did not But I have had a patient for two or three years whose case has interested me a good deal and for whom I finally prescribed just as I have done for you The thing worked like a charm and she is now physically and morally quite well I dare say her husband is a rich man I said He is not as poor as your husband at any rate Ernest replied But rich or poor I am determined not to sit looking on while you exert yourself so far beyond your strength Just think dear suppose for fifty or a hundred or two hundred dollars a year you could buy a sweet cheerful quiet tone of mind would you hesitate one moment to do so And you can do it if you will You are not ill tempered but quick tempered the irritability which annoys you so is a physical infirmity which will disappear the moment you cease to be goaded into it by that exacting mistress you have hitherto been to yourself All this sounded very plausible while Ernest was talking but the moment I got home I snatched up my work from mere force of habit I may as well finish this as it is begun I said to myself arid the stitches flew from my needle like sparks of fire Little Ernest came and begged for a story but I put him off Then Una wanted to sit in my lap but I told her I was too busy In the course of an hour the influence of the fresh air and Ernest s talk had nearly lost their power over me my thread kept breaking the children leaned on and tired me the baby woke up and cried and I got all out of patience Do go away Ernest I said and let mamma have a little peace Don t you see how busy I am Go and play with Una like a good boy But he would not go and kept teasing Una till she too began to cry and she and baby made a regular concert of it Oh dear I sighed this work will never be done and threw it down impatiently and took the baby impatiently and began to walk up and down with him impatiently I was not willing that this little darling whom I love so dearly should get through with his nap and interrupt my work yet I was displeased with myself and tried by kissing him to make some amends for the hasty un pleasant tones with which I had grieved him and frightened the other children This evening Ernest came to me with a larger sum of money than he had ever given me at one time Now every cent of this is to be spent he said in having work done I know any number of poor women who will be thankful to have all you can give them Dear me I it is easy to talk and I do feel grateful to Ernest for his thoughtfulness and kindness But I am almost in rags and need every cent of this money to make myself decent I am positively ashamed to go anywhere my clothes are so shabby Besides supposing I leave off sewing and all sorts of over doing of a kindred nature I must nurse baby I suppose and be up with him nights and others will have their cross days and their sick and father will have his Alas there can be for no royal road to a sweet cheerful quiet tone of mind JANUARY I eighteen forty four Mother says Ernest is entirely right in forbidding my working so hard I own that I already feel better I have all the time I need to read my Bible and to pray now and the children do not irritate and annoy me as they did Who knows but I shall yet become quite amiable Ernest made his father very happy to day by telling him that the last of those wretched debts is paid I think that he might have told me that this deliverance was at hand I did not know but we had years of these struggles with poverty before us What with the relief from this anxiety my improved state of health and father s pleasure I am in splendid spirits to day Ernest too seems wonderfully cheerful and we both feel that we may now look forward to a quiet happiness we have never known With such a husband and such children as mine I ought to be the most grateful creature on earth And I have dear mother and James besides I don t quite know what to think about James relation to Lucy He is so brimful running over with happiness that he is also full of fun and of love and after all he may only like her as a cousin FEB fourteen Father has not been so well of late It seems as if he kept up until he was relieved about those debts and then sunk down I read to him a good deal and so does mother but his mind is still dark and he looks forward to the hour of death with painful misgivings He is getting a little childish about my leaving him and clings to me exactly as if I were his own child Martha spends a good deal of time with him and fusses over him in a way that I wonder she does not see is annoying to him He wants to be read to to hear a hymn sung or a verse repeated and to be left otherwise in perfect quiet But she is continually pulling out and shaking up his pillows bathing his head in hot vinegar and soaking his feet It looks so odd to see her in one of the elegant silk dresses old mister Underhill makes her wear with her sleeves rolled up the skirt hid away under a large apron rubbing away at poor father till it seems as if his tired soul would fly out of him FEB twenty Father grows weaker every day Ernest has sent for his other children John and Helen Martha is no longer able to come here her husband is very sick with a fever and cannot be left alone No doubt he enjoys her bustling way of nursing and likes to have his pillows pushed from under him every five minutes I am afraid I feel glad that she is kept away and that I have father all to myself Ernest never was so fond of me as he is now I don t know what to make of it FEB twenty two John and his wife and Helen have come They stay at Martha s where there is plenty of room John s wife is a little soft dumpling thing and looks up to him as a mouse would up at a steeple He strikes me as a very selfish man He steers straight for the best seat leaving her standing if need be accepts her humble attentions with the air of one collecting his just debt and is continually snubbing and setting her right Yet in some things he is very like Ernest and perhaps a wife destitute of self assertion and without much individuality would have spoiled him as Harriet has spoiled John For I think it must be partly her fault that he dares to be so egotistical Helen is the dearest prettiest creature I ever saw Oh why would James take a fancy to Lucy I feel the new delight of having a sister to love and to admire And she will love me in time I feel sure of it MARCH one Father is very feeble and in great mental distress He gropes about in the dark and shudders at the approach of death We can do nothing but pray for him And the cloud will be lifted when he leaves this world if not before For I know he is a good yes a saintly man dear to and dear to Christ MARCH four Dear father has gone We were all kneeling and praying and weeping around him when suddenly he called me to come to him I went and let him lean his head on my breast as he loved to do Sometimes I have stood so by the hour together ready to sink with fatigue and only kept up with the thought that if this were my own precious father s bruised head I could stand and hold it forever Daughter Katherine he said in his faint tremulous way you have come with me to the very brink of the river I thank God for all your cheering words and ways I thank God for giving you to be a helpmeet to my son Farewell now he added in a low firm voice I feel the bottom and it is good He lay back on his pillow looking upward with an expression of seraphic peace and joy on his worn meagre face and so his life passed gently away Oh the affluence of God s payments What a recompense for the poor love I had given my husband s father and the poor little services I had rendered him Oh that I had never been impatient with him never smiled at his peculiarities never in my secret heart felt him unwelcome to my home And how wholly I overlooked in my blind selfishness what he must have suffered in feeling himself homeless dwelling with us on sufferance but master and head nowhere on earth May God carry the lessons home to my heart of hearts and make the cloud of mingled remorse and shame which now envelops me to descend in showers of love and benediction on every human soul that mine can bless Chapter twenty XX APRIL I HAVE had a new lesson which has almost broken my heart In looking over his father s papers Ernest found a little journal brief in its records indeed but we learn from it that on all those wedding and birthdays when I fancied his austere religion made him hold aloof from our merry making he was spending the time in fasting and praying for us and for our children Oh shall I ever learn the sweet charity that thinketh no evil and believeth all things What blessings may not have descended upon us and our children through those prayers What evils may they not have warded off Dear old father Oh that I could once more put my loving arms about him and bid him welcome to our home And how gladly would I now confess to him all my unjust judgments concerning him and entreat his forgiveness Must life always go on thus Must I always be erring ignorant and blind How I hate this arrogant sweeping past my brother man this utter ignoring of his hidden life I see now that it is well for mother that she did not come to live with me at the beginning of my married life I should not have borne with her little peculiarities nor have made her half so happy as I can now I thank God that my varied disappointments and discomforts my feeble health my poverty my mortifications have done me some little good and driven me to Him a thousand times because I could not get along without His help But I am not satisfied with my state in His sight I am sure something is lacking though I know not what it is MAY Helen is going to stay here and live with Martha How glad how enchanted I am Old mister Underhill is getting well I saw him to day He can talk of nothing but his illness of Martha s wonderful skill in nursing him declaring that he owes his life to her I felt a little piqued at this speech because Ernest was very attentive to him and no doubt did his share towards the cure We have fitted up father s room for a nursery Hitherto all the children have had to sleep in our room which has been bad for them and bad for us I have been so afraid they would keep Ernest awake if they were unwell and restless I have secured an excellent nurse who is as fresh and blooming as the flower whose name she bears The children are already attached to her and I feel that the worst of my life is now over JUNE Little Ernest was taken sick on the day I wrote that The attack was fearfully sudden and violent He is still very very ill I have not forgotten that I said once that I would give my children to God should He ask for them but oh this agony of suspense It eats into my soul and eats it away Oh my little Ernest My first born son My pride my joy my hope And I thought the worst of my life was over AUGUST We have come into the country with what God has left us our two youngest children Yes I have tasted the bitter cup of bereavement and drunk it down to its dregs I gave my darling to God I gave him I gave him But oh with what anguish I saw those round dimpled limbs wither and waste away the glad smile fade forever from that beautiful face What a fearful thing it is to be a mother But I have given my child to God I would not recall him if I could I am thankful He has counted me worthy to present Him so costly a gift I cannot shed a tear and I must find relief in writing or I shall lose my senses My noble beautiful boy My first born son And to think that my delicate little Una still lives and that death has claimed that bright glad creature who was the sunshine of our home But let me not forget my mercies Let me not forget that I have a precious husband and two darling children and my kind sympathizing mother left to me Let me not forget how many kind friends gathered about us in our sorrow Above all let me remember God s loving kindness and tender mercy He has not left us to the bitterness of a grief that refuses and disdains to be comforted We believe in Him we love Him we worship as we never did before My dear Ernest has felt this sorrow to his heart s core But he has not for one moment questioned the goodness or the love of our Father in thus taking from us the child who promised to be our greatest earthly joy Our consent to God s will has drawn us together very closely together we bear the yoke in our youth together we pray and sing praises in the very midst of our tears I was dumb with silence because Thou didst it SEPT The old pain and cough have come back with the first cool nights of this month Perhaps I am going to my darling I do not know I am certainly very feeble Consenting to suffer does not annul the suffering Such a child could not go hence without rending and tearing its way out of the heart that loved it This world is wholly changed to me and I walk in it like one in a dream And dear Ernest is changed too He says little and is all kindness and goodness to me but I can see here is a wound that will never be healed I am confined to my room now with nothing do but to think think think I do not believe God has taken our child in mere displeasure but cannot but feel that this affliction might not have been necessary if I had not so chafed and writhed and secretly repined at the way in which my home was invaded and at our galling poverty God has exchanged the one discipline for the other and oh how far more bitter is this cup Oct four My darling boy would have been six years old to day Ernest still keeps me shut up but he rather urges my seeing a friend now and People say very strange things in the way of consolation I begin to think that a tender clasp of the hand is about all one can give to the afflicted One says I must not grieve because my child is better off in heaven Yes he is better off I know it I feel it but I miss him none the less Others say he might have grown up to be a bad man and broken my heart Perhaps he might but I cannot make myself believe that likely One lady asked me if this affliction was not a rebuke of my idolatry of my darling and another if I had not been in a cold worldly state needing this severe blow on that account But I find no consolation or support in the remarks My comfort is in my perfect faith in the goodness and love of my Father my certainty that He had a reason in thus afflicting me that I should admire and adore if I knew what it was And in the midst of my sorrow I have had and do have a delight in Him hitherto unknown so that sometimes this room in which I am a prisoner seems like the very gate of heaven MAY A long winter in my room and all sorts of painful remedies and appliances and deprivations And now I am getting well and drive out every day Martha sends her carriage and mother goes with me Dear mother How nearly perfect she is I never saw a sweeter face nor ever heard sweeter expressions of faith in God and love to all about her than hers She has been my tower strength all through these weary months and she has shared my sorrow and made it her own I can see that dear Ernest s affliction and this prolonged anxiety about me have been a heavenly benediction to him I am sure that every mother whose sick child he visits will have a sympathy he could not have given while all our own little ones were alive and well I thank God that He has thus increased my dear husband s usefulness as I think that He has mine also How tenderly I already feel towards all suffering children and how easy it will be now to be patient with them KEENE N H JULY twelve It is a year ago this day that the brightest sunshine faded out of our lives and our beautiful boy was taken from us I have been tempted to spend this anniversary in bitter tears and lamentations For oh this sorrow is not healed by time I feel it more and more But I begged God when I first awoke this morning not to let me so dishonor and grieve Him I may suffer I must suffer He means it He wills it but let it be without repining without gloomy despondency The world is full of sorrow it is not I alone who taste its bitter draughts nor have I the only right to a sad countenance Oh for patience to bear on cost what it may Cheerfully and gratefully I lay myself and all that I am or own at the feet of Him who redeemed me with His precious blood engaging to follow Him bearing the cross He lays upon me This is the least I can do and I do it while my heart lies broken and bleeding at His feet My dear little Una has improved somewhat in health but I am never free from anxiety about her She is my milk white lamb my dove my fragrant flower One cannot look in her pure face without a sense of peace and rest She is the sentinel who voluntarily guards my door when I am engaged at my devotions she is my little comforter when I am sad my companion and friend at all times I talk to her of Christ and always have done just as I think of Him and as if I expected sympathy from her in my love to Him It was the same with my darling Ernest If I required a little self denial I said cheerfully This is hard but doing it for our best Friend sweetens it and their alacrity was pleasant to see Ernest threw his whole soul into whatever he did and sometimes when engaged in play would hesitate a little when directed to do something else such as carrying a message for me and the like But if I said If you do this cheerfully and pleasantly my darling you do it for Jesus and that will make Him smile upon you he would invariably yield at once Is not this the true the natural way of linking every little daily act of a child s life with that Divine Love that Divine Life which gives meaning to all things But what do I mean by the vain boast that I have always trained my children thus Alas I have done it only at times for while my theory was sound my temper of mind was but too often unsound I was often and often impatient with my dear little boy often my tone was a worldly one I often full of eager interest in mere outside things and forgot that I was living or that my children were living save for the present moment It seems now that I have a child in heaven and am bound to the invisible world by such a tie that I can never again be entirely absorbed by this I fancy my ardent eager little boy as having some such employments in his new and happy home as he had here I see him loving Him who took children in His arms and blessed them with all the warmth of which his nature is capable and as perhaps employed as one of those messengers whom God sends forth as His ministers For I cannot think of those active feet those busy hands as always quiet Ah my darling that I could look in upon you for a moment a single moment and catch one of your radiant smiles just one AUGUST four How full are David s Psalms of the cry of the sufferer He must have experienced every kind of bodily and mental torture He gives most vivid illustrations of the wasting wearing process of disease for instance what a contrast is the picture we have of him when he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the one he paints of himself in after years when he says I may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me my days are like a shadow that declineth and I am withered like grass I am weary with groaning all the night make I my bed to swim I water my couch with my tears For my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth near unto the grave And then what wails of anguish are these I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted Thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me Lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into utter dark ness Yet through it all what grateful joy in God what expressions of living faith and devotion During my long illness and confinement to my room the Bible has been almost a new book to me and I see that God has always dealt with His children as He deals with them now and that no new thing has befallen me All these weary days so full of languor these nights so full of unrest have had their appointed mission to my soul And perhaps I have had no discipline so salutary as this forced inaction and uselessness at a time when youth and natural energy continually cried out for room and work AUGUST fifteen I dragged out my drawing materials in a listless way this morning and began to sketch the beautiful scene from my window At first I could not feel interested It seemed as if my hand was crippled and lost its cunning when it unloosed its grasp of little Ernest and let him go But I prayed as I worked that I might not yield to the inclination to despise and throw away the gift with which God has Himself endowed me Mother was gratified and said it rested her to see me act like myself once more Ah I have been very selfish and have been far too much absorbed with my sorrow and my illness and my own petty struggles AUGUST nineteen I met to day an old friend Maria Kelly who is married it seems and settled down in this pretty village She asked so many questions about my little Ernest that I had to tell her the whole story of his precious life sickness and death I forced myself to do this quietly and without any great demand on her sympathies My reward for the constraint I thus put upon myself was the abrupt question Haven t you grown stoical I felt the angry blood rush through my veins as it has not done in a long time My pride was wounded to the quick and those cruel unjust words still rankle in my heart This is not as it should be I am constantly praying that my pride may be humbled and then when it is attacked I shrink from the pain the blow causes and am angry with the hand that inflicts it It is just so with two or three unkind things Martha has said to me I can t help brooding over them and feeling stung with their injustice even while making the most desperate struggle to rise above and forget them It is well for our fellow creatures that God forgives and excuses them when we fail to do it and I can easily fancy that poor Maria Kelly is at this moment dearer in His sight than I am who have taken fire at a chance word And I can see now what I wonder I did not see at the time that God was dealing very kindly and wisely with me when He made Martha overlook my good qualities of which I suppose I have some as everybody else has and call out all my bad ones since the axe was thus laid at the root of self love And it is plain that self love cannot die without a fearful struggle MAY twenty six eighteen forty six How long it is since I have written in my journal We have had a winter full of cares perplexities and sicknesses Mother began it by such a severe attack of inflammatory rheumatism as I could not have supposed she could live through Her sufferings were dreadful and I might almost say her patience was for I often thought it would be less painful to hear her groan and complain than to witness such heroic fortitude such sweet docility under God s hand I hope I shall never forget the lessons I have learned in her sick room Ernest says he never shall cease to rejoice that she lives with us and that he can watch over her health He has indeed been like a son to her and this has been a great solace amid all her sufferings Before she was able to leave the room poor little Una was prostrated by one of her ill turns and is still very feeble The only way in which she can be diverted is by reading to her and I have done little else these two months but hold her in my arms singing little songs and hymns telling stories and reading what few books I can find that are unexciting simple yet entertaining My precious little darling She bears the yoke in her youth without a frown but it is agonizing to see her suffer so How much easier it would be to bear all her physical infirmities myself I suppose to those who look on from the outside we must appear like a most unhappy family since we hardly get free from one trouble before another steps in But I see more and more that happiness is not dependent on health or any other outside prosperity We are at peace with each other and at peace with God His dealings with us do not perplex or puzzle us though we do not pretend to understand them On the other hand Martha with absolutely perfect health with a husband entirely devoted to her and with every wish gratified yet seems always careworn and dissatisfied Her servants worry her very life out she misses the homely household duties to which she has been accustomed and her conscience stumbles at little things and overlooks greater ones It is very interesting I think to study different homes as well as the different characters that form them Amelia s little girls are quiet good children to whom their father writes what mister Underhill and Martha pronounce beautiful letters wherein he always styles himself their broken hearted but devoted father Devotion to my mind involves self sacrifice and I cannot reconcile its use in this case with the life of ease he leads while all the care of his children is thrown upon others But some people by means of a few such phrases not only impose upon themselves but upon their friends and pass for persons of great sensibility As I have been confined to the house nearly the whole winter I have had to derive my spiritual support from books and as mother gradually recovered she enjoyed Leighton with me as I knew she would doctor Cabot comes to see us very often but I do not now find it possible to get the instruction from him I used to do I see that the Christian life must be individual as the natural character is and that I cannot be exactly like doctor Cabot or exactly like missus Campbell or exactly like mother though they all three stimulate and re an inspiration to me But I see too that the great points of similarity in Christ s disciples have always been the same This is the testimony of all the good books sermons hymns and memoirs I read that God s ways are infinitely perfect that we are to love Him for what He is and therefore equally as much when He afflicts as when He prospers us that there is no real happiness but in doing and suffering His will and that this life is but a scene of probation through which we pass to the real life above Chapter twenty one XXI MAY thirty ERNEST asked me to go with him to see one of his patients as he often does when there is a lull in the tempest at home We both feel that as we have so little money of our own to give away it is a privilege to give what services and what cheering words we can As I took it for granted that we were going to see some poor old woman I put up several little packages of tea and sugar with which Susan Green always keeps me supplied and added a bottle of my own raspberry vinegar which never comes amiss I find to old people Ernest drove to the door of an aristocratic looking house and helped me to alight in his usual silence It is probably one of the servants we are going to visit I thought within myself but I am surprised at his bringing me The family may not approve it The next thing I knew I found myself being introduced to a beautiful brilliant young lady who sat in a wheel chair like a queen on a throne in a room full of tasteful ornaments flowers and birds Now I had come away just as I was when Ernest called me and that was means a very plain gingham dress wherein I had been darning stockings all the morning I suppose a saint wouldn t have cared for that but I did and for a moment stood the picture of confusion my hands full of oddly shaped parcels and my face all in a flame My wife Miss Clifford I heard Ernest say and then I caught the curious puzzled look in her eyes which said as plainly as words could do What has the creature brought me I ask your pardon Miss Clifford I said thinking it best to speak out just the honest truth but I supposed the doctor was taking me to see some of his old women and so I have brought you a oneittle tea and a little sugar and a bottle of raspberry vinegar How delicious cried she It really rests me to meet with a genuine human being at last Why didn t you make some stiff prim speech instead of telling the truth out and out I declare I mean to keep all you have brought me just for the fun of the thing This put me at ease and I forgot all about my dress in a moment I see you are just what the doctor boasted you were she went on But he never would bring you to see me before I suppose he has told you why I could not go to see you To tell the truth he never speaks to me of his patients unless he thinks I can be of use to them I dare say I do not look much like an invalid said she but here I am tied to this chair It is six months since I could bear my own weight upon my feet I saw then that though her face was so bright and full of color her hand was thin and transparent But what a picture she made as she sat there in magnificent beauty relieved by such a back ground of foliage flowers and artistic objects I told the doctor the other day that life was nothing but a humbug and he said he should bring me a remedy against that false notion the next time he came and you I suppose are that remedy she continued Come begin I am ready to take any number of doses I could only laugh and try to look daggers at Ernest who sat looking over a magazine apparently absorbed in its contents Ah she cried nodding her head sagaciously I knew you would agree with me Agree with you in calling life a humbug I cried now fairly aroused Death itself is not more a reality I have not tried death yet she said more seriously but I have tried life twenty five years and I know all about it It is eat drink sleep yawn and be bored It is what shall I wear where shall I go how shall I get rid of the time it says How do you do how is your husband How are your children it means Now I have asked all the conventional questions and I don t care a fig what their answer may be This may be its meaning to some persons I replied for instance to mere pleasure seekers But of course it is interpreted quite differently by others To some it means nothing but a dull hopeless struggle with poverty and hardship and its whole aspect might be changed to them should those who do not know what to do to get rid of the time spend their surplus leisure in making this struggle less brutalizing Yes I have heard such doctrine and at one time I tried charity myself I picked up a dozen or so of dirty little wretches out of the streets and undertook to clothe and teach them I might as well have tried to instruct the chairs in my room Besides the whole house had to be aired after they had gone and mamma missed two teaspoons and a fork and was perfectly disgusted with the whole thing Then I fell to knitting socks for babies but they only occupied my hands and my head felt as empty as ever Mamma took me off on a journey as she always did when I took to moping and that diverted me for a while But after that everything went on in the old way I got rid of part of the day by changing my dress and putting on my pretty things it is a great thing to have a habit of wearing one s ornaments for instance and then in the evening one could go to the opera or the theater or some other place of amusement after which one could sleep all through the next morning and so get rid of that But I had been used to such things all my life and they had got to be about as flat as flat can be If I had been born a little earlier in the history of the world I would have gone into a convent but that sort of thing is out of fashion now The best convent I said for a woman is the seclusion of her own home There she may find vocation and fight her battles and there she may learn the reality and the earnestness of life Pshaw cried she Excuse me however saying that but some of the most brilliant girls I know have settled down into mere married women and spend their whole time in nursing babies Think how belittling Is it more so than spending it in dressing driving dancing and the like Of course it is I had a friend once who shone like a star in society She married and children as fast as she could Well what consequence She lost her beauty lost her spirit and animation lost her youth and lost her health The only earthly things she can talk about are teething dieting and the measles I laughed at this exaggeration and looked round to see what Ernest thought of such talk But he had disappeared As you have spoken plainly to me knowing me to be a wife and a mother you must allow me to speak plainly in return I began Oh speak plainly by all means I am quite sick and tired of having truth served up in pink cotton and scented with lavender Then you will permit me to say that when you speak contemptuously of the vocation of maternity you dishonor not only the mother who bore you but the Lord Jesus Himself who chose to be born of woman and to be ministered unto by her through a helpless infancy Miss Clifford was a little startled How terribly in earnest you are she said It is plain that to you at any rate life is indeed no humbug I thought of my dear ones of Ernest of my children of mother and of James and I thought of my love to them and of theirs to me And I thought of Him who alone gives reality to even such joys as these My face must have been illuminated by the thought for she dropped the bantering tone she had used hitherto and asked with real earnestness What is it you know and that I do not know that makes you so satisfied while I am so dissatisfied I hesitated before I answered feeling as I never felt before how ignorant how unfit to lead others I really am Then I said Perhaps you need to know God to know Christ She looked disappointed and tired So I came away first promising at her request to go to see her again I found Ernest just driving up and told him what had passed He listened in his usual silence and I longed to have him say whether I had spoken wisely and well JUNE one I have been to see Miss Clifford again and made mother go with me Miss Clifford took a fancy to her at once Ah she said after one glance at the dear loving face nobody need tell me that you are good and kind But I am a little afraid of good people I fancy they are always criticising me and expecting me to imitate their perfection Perfection does not exact perfection was mother s answer I would rather be judged by an angel than by a man And then mother led her on little by little and most adroitly to talk of herself and of her state of health She is an orphan and lives in this great stately house alone with her servants Until she was laid aside by the state pf her health she lived in the world and of it Now she is a prisoner and prisoners have time to think Here I sit she said all day long I never was fond of staying at home or of reading and needlework I absolutely hate In fact I do not know how to sew Some such pretty feminine work might beguile you of a few of the long hours of these long days said mother One can t be always reading But a lady came to see me a missus Goodhue one of your good sort I suppose and she preached me quite a sermon on the employment of time She said I had a solemn admonition of Providence and ought to devote myself entirely to religion I had just begun to he interested in a bit of embroidery but she frightened me out of it But I can t bear such dreadfully good people with faces a mile long Mother made her produce the collar or whatever it was showed her how to hold her needle and arrange her pattern and they both got so absorbed in it that I had leisure to look at some of the beautiful things with which the room was full Make the object of your life right I heard mother say at last and these little details will take care of themselves But I haven t any object Miss Clifford objected unless it is to get through these tedious days somehow Before I was taken ill my chief object was to make myself attractive to the people I met And the easiest way to do that was to dress becomingly and make myself look as well as I could I suppose said mother that most girls could say the same They have an instinctive desire to please and they take what they conceive to be the shortest and easiest road to that end It requires no talent no education no thought to dress tastefully the most empty hearted frivolous young person can do it provided she has money enough Those who can t get the money make up for it by fearful expenditure of precious time They plan they cut they fit they rip they trim till they can appear in society looking exactly like everybody else They think of nothing talk of nothing but how this shall be fashioned and that be trimmed and as to their hair Satan uses it as his favorite net and catches them in it every day of their lives But I never cut or trimmed said Miss Clifford No because you could afford to have it done for you But you acknowledge that you spent a great deal of time in dressing because you thought that the easiest way of making yourself attractive But it does not follow that the easiest way is the best way and sometimes the longest way round is the shortest way home For instance Well let us imagine a young lady living in the world as you say you lived She has never seriously reflected on any subject one half hour in her life She has been borne on by the current and let it take her where it would But at last some influence is brought to bear upon her which leads her to stop to look about her and to think She finds herself in a world of serious momentous events She see she cannot live in it was not meant to live in it forever and that her whole unknown future depends on what she is not on how she looks She begins to cast about for some plan of life and this leads A plan of life Miss Clifford interrupted I never heard of such a thing Yet you would smile at an architect who having a noble structure to build should begin to work on it in a haphazard way putting in a brick here and a stone there weaving in straws and sticks if they come to hand and when asked on what work he was engaged and what manner of building he intended to erect should reply he had no plan but thought something would come of it Miss Clifford made no reply She sat with her head resting on her band looking dreamily before her a truly beautiful but unconscious picture I too began to reflect that while I had really aimed to make the most out of life I had not done it methodically or intelligently We are going to try to stay in town this summer Hitherto Ernest would not listen to my suggestion of what an economy this would be He always said this would turn out anything but an economy in the end But now we have no teething baby little Raymond is a strong healthy child and Una remarkably well for her and money is so slow to come in and so fast to go out What discomforts we suffer in the country it would take a book to write down and here we shall have our own home as usual I shall not have to be separated from Ernest and shall have leisure to devote to two very interesting people who must stay in town all the year round no matter who goes out of it I mean dear missus Campbell and Miss Clifford who both attract me though in such different ways Chapter twenty two XXII OCTOBER WELL I had my own way and I am afraid it has been an unwise one for though I have enjoyed the leisure afforded by everybody being out of town and the opportunity it has given me to devote myself to the very sweetest work on earth the care of my darling little ones the heat and the stifling atmosphere have been trying for me and for them My pretty Rose went last May to bloom in a home of her own so I thought I would not look for a nurse but take the whole care of them myself This would not be much of a task to a strong person but I am not strong and a great deal of the time just dressing them and taking them out to walk has exhausted me Then all the mending and other sewing must be done and with the over exertion creeps in the fretful tone the impatient word Yet I never can be as impatient with little children as I should be but for the remembrance that I should count it only a joy to minister once more to my darling boy cost what weariness it might But now new cares are at hand and I have been searching for a person to whom I can safely trust my children when I am laid aside Thus far I have had in this capacity three different Temptations in human form The first a smart tidy looking woman informed me at the outset that she was perfectly competent to take the whole charge of the children and should prefer my attending to my own affairs while she attended to hers I replied that my affairs lay chiefly in caring for and being with my children to which she returned that she feared I should not suit her as she had her own views concerning the training of children She added with condescension that at all events she should expect in any case of difference of judgment between us that I being the younger and least experienced of the two should always yield to her She then went on to give me her views on the subject of nursery management In the first place she said I never pet or fondle children It makes them babyish and sickly Oh I see you will not suit me I cried You need go no farther I consider love the best educator for a little child Indeed I think I shall suit you perfectly she replied nothing daunted I have been in the business twenty years and have always suited wherever I lived You will be surprised to see how much sewing I shall accomplish and how quiet I shall keep the children But I don t want them kept quiet I persisted I want them to be as merry and cheerful as crickets and I care a great deal more to have them amused than to have the sewing done though that is important I confess Very well ma am I will sit and rock them by the hour if you wish it But I don t wish it I cried exasperated at the coolness which gave her such an advantage over me Let us say no more about it you do not suit me and the sooner we part the better I must be mistress of my own house and I want no advice in relation to my children I shall hardly leave you before you will regret parting with me she returned in a placid pitying way I was afraid I had not been quite dignified in my interview with this person with whom I ought to have had no discussion and my equanimity was not restored by her shaking hands with me a patronizing way at parting and expressing the hope that I should one day be a green tree in the Paradise of God Nor was it any too great a consolation to find that she had suggested to my cook that my intellect was not quite sound Temptation the second confessed that she knew nothing but was willing to be taught Yes she might be willing but she could not be taught She could not see why Herbert should not have everything he chose to cry for nor why she should not take the children to the kitchens where her friends abode instead of keeping them out in the air She could not understand why she must not tell Una every half hour that she was as fair as a lily and that the little angels in heaven cried for such hair as hers And there was no rhyme or reason to her mind why she could not have her friends visit in her nursery since as she declared the cook would hear all her secrets if she received them in the kitchen Her assurance that she thought me a very nice lady and that there never were two such children as mine failed to move my hard heart and I was thankful when I got her out of the house Temptation the third appeared for a time the perfection of a nurse She kept herself and the nursery and the children in most refreshing order she amused Una when she was more than usually unwell with a perfect fund of innocent stories the work flew from her nimble fingers as if by magic I boasted everywhere of my good luck and sang her praises in Ernest s ears till he believed in her with all his heart But one night we were out late we had been spending the evening at Aunty s and came in with Ernest s night key as quietly as possible in order not to arouse the children I stole softly to the nursery to see if all was going on well there Bridget it seems had taken the opportunity to wash her clothes in the nursery and they hung all about the room drying a hot fire raging for the purpose In the midst of them with a candle and prayer book on a chair Bridget knelt fast asleep the candle within an inch of her sleeve Her assurance when I aroused her that she was not asleep but merely rapt in devotion did not soften my hard heart nor was I moved by the representation that she was a saint and always wore black on that account I packed her off in anything but a saintly frame and felt that a fourth Temptation would scatter what little grace I possessed to the four winds These changes upstairs made discord too below My cook was displeased at so much coming and going and made the kitchen a sort of a purgatory which I dreaded to enter At last when her temper fairly ran away with her and she became impertinent to the last degree I said coolly If any lady should speak to me in this way I should resent it But no lady would so far forget herself And I overlook your rudeness on the ground that you do not know better than to use of such expressions This capped the climax She declared that she had never been told before that she was no and did not know how to behave and gave warning at once I wish I could help running to tell Ernest all these annoyances It does no good and only worries him But how much of a woman s life is made up of such trials and provocations and how easy is when on one s knees to bear them aright and how far easier to bear them wrong when one finds the coal going too fast the butter out just as sitting down to breakfast the potatoes watery and the bread sour or heavy And then when one is well nigh desperate does one s husband fail to say in bland tones My dear if you would just speak to Bridget I am sure she would improve Oh that there were indeed magic in a spoken word And do what I can the money Ernest gives me will not hold out He knows absolutely nothing about that hydra headed monster a household I have had to go back to sewing as furiously as ever And with the sewing the old pain in the side has come back and the sharp quick speech that I hate and that Ernest hates and that everybody hates I groan being burdened and am almost weary of my life And my prayers are all mixed up with worldly thoughts and cares I am appalled at all the things that have got to be done before winter and am tempted to cut short my devotions in order to have more time to accomplish what I must accomplish How have I got into this slough When was it that I came down from the Mount where I had seen the Lord and came back to make these miserable petty things as much my business as ever Oh these fluctuations in my religious life amaze me I cannot doubt that I am really God s child it would be dishonor to Him to doubt it I cannot doubt that I have held as real communion with Him as with any earthly friend and oh it has been far sweeter OCT twenty I made a parting visit to missus Campbell to day and as usual have come away strengthened and refreshed She said all sorts of kind things to cheer and encourage me and stimulated me to take up the burden of life cheerfully and patiently just as it comes She assures me that these fluctuations of feeling will by degrees give place to a calmer life especially if I avoid so far as I can do it all unnecessary work distraction and hurry And a few quiet resting words from her have given me courage to press on toward perfection no matter how much imperfection I see in myself and others And now I am waiting for my Father s next gift and the new cares and labors it will bring with it I am glad it is not left for me to decide my own lot I am afraid I should never see precisely the right moment for welcoming a new bird into my nest dearly as I love the rustle of their wings and the sound of their voices when they do come And surely He knows the right moments who knows all my struggles with a certain sort of poverty poor health and domestic care If I could feel that all the time as I do at this moment how happy I should always be JANUARY sixteen eighteen forty seven This is the tenth anniversary of our wedding day and it has been a delightful one If I were called upon to declare what has been the chief element of my happiness I should say it was not Ernest s love to me or mine to him or that I am once more the mother of three children or that my own dear mother still lives though I revel in each and all of these But underneath them all deeper stronger than all lies a peace with God that I can compare to no other joy which I guard as I would guard hid treasure and which must abide if all things else pass away My baby is two months old and her name is Ethel The three children together form a beautiful picture which I am never tired of admiring But they will not give me much time for writing This little new comer takes all there is of me Mother brings me pleasant reports of Miss Clifford who under her gentle wise influence is becoming an earnest Christian already rejoicing in the Providence that arrested her where it did and forced her to reflection Mother says we ought to study God s providence more than we do since He has a meaning and a purpose in everything He does Sometimes I can do this and find it a source of great happiness Then worldly cares seem mere worldly cares and I forget that His wise kind hand is in every one of them FEBRUARY Helen has been spending the whole day with me as she often does helping me with her skillful needle and with the children in a very sweet way I am almost ashamed to indulge in writing down how dearly she seems to love me and how disposed she is to sit at my feet as a learner at the very moment I am longing to possess her sweet gentle temper But one thing puzzles me in her and that is the difficulty she finds in getting hold of these simple truths her father used to grope after but never found till just as he was passing out of the world It seems as if God had compensated such turbulent fiery natures as mine by revealing Himself to them for the terrible hours of shame and sorrow through which their sins and follies cause them to pass I suffer far more than Helen does suffer bitterly painfully but I enjoy tenfold more For I know whom I have believed and I cannot doubt that I am truly united to Him Helen is naturally very reserved but by degrees she has come talk with me quite frankly To day as we sat together in the nursery little Raymond snatched a toy from Una who as usual yielded to him without a frown I called him to me he came reluctantly Raymond dear I said did you ever see papa snatch anything from me He smiled and shook his head Well then until you see him do it to me never do it to your sister Men are gentle and polite to women and little boys should be gentle and polite to little girls The children ran off to their play and Helen said Now how different that is from my mother s management with us She always made us girls yield to the boys They would not have thought they could go up to bed unless one of us got a candle for them That I suppose is the reason then that Ernest expected me to wait upon him after we were married I replied I was a little stiff about yielding to him for besides mother s precepts I was influenced by my father s example He was so courteous treating her with as much respect as if she were a queen and yet with as much love as if were always a girl I naturally expected the like from my husband You must have been disappointed then she said Yes I was It cost me a good many pouts and tears of which I am now ashamed And Ernest seldom annoys me now with the little neglects that I used to make so much of Sometimes I think there are no little neglects said Helen It takes less than nothing to annoy us And it takes more than everything to please us I cried But Ernest and I had one stronghold to which we always fled in our troublous times and that was our love for each other No matter how he provoked me by his little heedless ways I had to forgive him because I loved him so And he had to forgive me my faults for the same reason I had no idea husbands and wives loved each other so said Helen I thought they got over it as soon as their cares and troubles came on and just jogged on together somehow We both laughed and she went on If I thought I should be as happy as you are I should be tempted to be married myself Ah I thought your time would come I cried Don t ask me any questions she said her pretty face growing prettier with a bright warm glow Give me advice instead for instance tell me how I can be sure that if I love a man I shall go on loving him through all the wear and tear of married life and how can I be sure he can and will go on loving me Well then setting aside the fact that you are both lovable and loving I will say this Happiness in other words love in married life is not a mere accident When the union has been formed as most Christian unions are by God Himself it is His intention and His will that it shall prove the unspeakable joy of both husband and wife and become more and more so from year to year But we are imperfect creatures wayward and foolish as little children horribly unreasonable selfish and willful We are not capable of enduring the shock of finding at every turn that our idol is made of clay and that it is prone to tumble off its pedestal and lie in the dust till we pick it up and set it in its place again I was struck with Ernest s asking in the very first prayer he offered in my presence after our marriage that God would help us love each other I felt that love was the very foundation on which I was built and that there was no danger that I should ever fall short in giving to my husband all he wanted in full measure But as he went on day after day repeating this prayer and I naturally made it with him I came to see that this most precious of earthly blessings had been and must be God s gift and that while we both looked at it in that light and felt our dependence on Him for it we might safely encounter together all the assaults made upon us by the world the flesh and the devil I believe we owe it to this constant prayer that we have loved each other so uniformly and with such growing comfort in each other so that our little discords always have ended in fresh accord and our love has felt conscious of resting on a rock and that that rock was the will of God It is plain then said Helen that you and Ernest are sure of one source of happiness as long as you live whatever vicissitudes you may meet with I thank you so much for what you have said The fact is you have been brought up to carry religion into everything But I was not My mother was as good as she was lovely but I think she felt and taught us to feel that we were to put it on as we did our Sunday clothes and to wear it as we did them carefully and reverently but with pretty long grave faces But you mix everything up so that when I am with you I never know whether you are most like or most unlike other people And your mother is just so But you forget that it is to Ernest I owe my best ideas about married life I don t remember ever talking with my mother or any one else on the subject And as to carrying religion into everything how can one help it if one s religion is a vital part of one s self not a cloak put on to go to church in and hang up out of the way against next Sunday Helen laughed She has the merriest yet gentlest little laugh one can imagine I long to know who it is that has been so fortunate as to touch her heart MARCH I know now and glad I am The sly little puss is purring at this moment in James arms at least I suppose she is as I have discreetly come up to my room and left them to themselves So it seems I have had all these worries about Lucy for naught What made her so fond of James was simply the fact that a friend of his had looked on her with a favorable eye regarding her as a very proper mother for four or five children who are in need of a shepherd Yes Lucy is going to marry a man so much older than herself that on a pinch he might have been her father She does it from a sense of duty she says and to a nature like hers duty may perhaps suffice and no cry of the heart have to be stifled in its performance We are all so happy in the happiness of James and Helen that we are not in the mood to criticise Lucy s decision I have a strange and most absurd envy when I think what a good time they are having at this moment downstairs while I sit here alone vainly wishing I could see more of Ernest Just as if my happiness were not a deeper more blessed one than theirs which must be purged of much dross before it will prove itself to be like fine gold Yes I suppose I am as happy in my dear precious husband and children as a wife and mother can be in a world which must not be a real heaven lest we should love the land we journey through so well as to want to pitch our tents in it forever and cease to look and long for the home whither we are bound James will be married almost immediately I suppose as he sails for Syria early in April How much a missionary and his wife must be to each other when severing themselves from all they ever loved before they go forth hand in hand not merely to be foreigners in heathen lands but to be henceforth strangers in their own should they ever return to it Helen says playfully that she has not a missionary spirit and is not at all sure that she shall go with James But I don t think that he feels very anxious on that point MARCH It does one s heart good to see how happy they are And it does one s heart good to have one s husband set up an opposition to the goings on by behaving like a lover himself Chapter twenty three XXIII JANUARY one eighteen fifty one IT is a great while since I wrote that God has been just as good as ever I want to say that before I say another word But He has indeed smitten me very sorely While we were in the midst of our rejoicings about James and Helen and the bright future that seemed opening before them he came home one day very ill Ernest happened to be in and attended to him at once But the disease was at the very outset so violent and raged with such absolute fury that no remedies had any effect Everything even now seems confused in my mind It seems as if there was a sudden transition from the most brilliant joyous health to a brief but fearful struggle for life speedily followed by the awful mystery and stillness of death Is it possible I still ask myself that four short days wrought an event whose consequences must run through endless years Poor mother Poor Helen When it was all over I do not know what to say of mother but that she behaved and quieted herself like a weaned child Her sweet composure awed me I dared not give way to my own vehement terrible sorrow in the presence of this Christ like patience all noisy demonstrations seemed profane I thought no human being was less selfish more loving than she had been for many years but the spirit that now took possession of her flowed into her heart and life directly from that great Heart of love whose depth I had never even begun to sound There was therefore something absolutely divine in her aspect in the tones of her voice in the very smile on her face We could compare its expression to nothing but Stephen when he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God As soon as James was gone Helen came to our home there was never any discussion about it she came naturally to be one of us Mother s health already very frail gradually failed and encompassed as I was with cares I could not be with her constantly Helen took the place to her of a daughter and found herself welcomed like one The atmosphere in which we all lived was one which cannot be described the love for all of us and for every living thing that flowed in mother s words and tones passed all knowledge The children s little joys and sorrows interested her exactly as if she was one of themselves they ran to her with every petty grievance and every new pleasure During the time she lived with us she had won many warm friends particularly among the poor and the suffering As her strength would no longer allow her to go to them those who could do so came to her and I was struck to see she had ceased entirely from giving counsel and now gave nothing but the most beautiful tender compassion and sympathy I saw that she was failing but flattered myself that her own serenity and our care would prolong her life still for many years I longed to have my children become old enough to fully appreciate her sanctified character and I thought she would gradually fade away and be set free As light winds wandering through groves of bloom Detach the delicate blossoms from the tree But God s thoughts are not as our thoughts not His ways as our ways Her feeble body began to suffer from the rudest assaults of pain day and night night and day she lived through a martyrdom in which what might have been a lifetime of suffering was concentrated into a few months To witness these sufferings was like the sundering of joints and marrow and once only once thank God my faith in Him staggered and reeled to and fro How can He look down on such agonies I cried in my secret soul is this the work of a God of love of mercy Mother seemed to divine my thoughts for she took my hand tenderly in hers and said with great difficulty Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him He is just as good as ever And she smiled I ran away to Ernest crying Oh is there nothing you can do for her What should a poor mortal do where Christ has done so much my darling he said taking me in his arms Let us stand aside and see the glory of God with our shoes from off our feet But he went to her with one more desperate effort to relieve her yet in vain missus Embury of whom mother was fond and who is always very kind when we are in trouble came in just then and after looking on a moment in tears she said to me God knows whom He can trust He would not lay His hand thus on all His children Those few words quieted me Yes God knows And now it is all over My precious precious mother has been a saint in heaven more than two years and has forgotten all the battles she fought on earth and all her sorrows and all her sufferings in the presence of her Redeemer She knew that she was going and the last words she uttered and they were spoken with somewhat of the playful quaint manner in which she had spoken all her life and with her own bright smile still sound in my ears I have given God a great deal of trouble but He is driving me into pasture now And then with her cheek on her hand she fell asleep and slept on till just at sundown she awoke to find herself in the green pasture the driving all over for ever and ever Who by searching can find out God My dear father entered heaven after a prosperous life path wherein he was unconscious of a pang and beloved James went bright and fresh and untarnished by conflict straight to the Master s feast But what a long lifetime of bereavement sorrow and suffering was my darling mother s pathway to glory Surely her felicity must be greater than theirs and the crown she has won by such a struggle must be brighter than the stars And this crown she is even now while I sit here choked with tears casting joyfully at the feet of her Saviour My sweet sister my precious little Helen still nestles in our hearts and in our home Martha made one passionate appeal to her to return to her but Ernest interfered Let her stay with Katy he said James would have chosen to have her with the one human being like himself Does he then think me with all my faults the languor of frail health and the cares and burdens of life weighing upon me enough like that sparkling brave boy to be of use and comfort to dear Helen I take courage at the thought and rouse myself afresh to bear on with fidelity and patience My steadfast aim now is to follow in my mother s footsteps to imitate her cheerfulness her benevolence her bright inspiring ways and never to rest till in place of my selfish nature I become as full of Christ s love as she became I am glad she is at last relieved from the knowledge of all my cares and though I often and often yearn to throw myself into her arms and pour out my cares and trials into her sympathizing ears I would not have her back for all the world She has got away from all the turmoil and suffering of life let her stay The scenes of sorrow through which we have been passing have brought Ernest nearer to me than ever and I can see that this varied discipline has softened and sweetened his character Besides we have modified each other Ernest is more demonstrative more attentive to those little things that make the happiness of married life and I am less childish less vehement I wish I could say less selfish but here I seem to have come to a standstill But I do understand Ernest s trials in his profession far better than I did and can feel and show some sympathy in them Of course the life of a physician is necessarily one of self denial spent as it is amid scenes of suffering and sorrow which he is often powerless to alleviate But there is besides the wear and tear of years of poverty his bills are disputed or allowed to run on year after year unnoticed he is often dismissed because he cannot put himself in the place of Providence and save life and a truly grateful generous patient is almost an unknown rarity I do not speak of these things to complain of them I suppose they are a necessary part of that whole providential plan by which God moulds and fashions and tempers the human soul just as my petty but incessant household cares are If I had nothing to do but love my husband and children and perform for them without let or hindrance the sweet ideal duties of wife and mother how content I should be to live always in this world But what would become of me if I were not called in the pursuit of these duties and in contact with real life to bear restless nights ill health unwelcome news the faults of servants contempt ingratitude of friends my own failings lowness of spirits the struggle in overcoming my corruption and a score of kindred trials Bishop Wilson charges us to bear all these things as unto God and with the greatest privacy How seldom I have met them save as lions in my way that I would avoid if I could and how I have tormented my friends by tedious complaints about them Yet when compared with the great tragedies of suffering I have both witnessed and suffered how petty they seem Our household bereft of mother s and James bright presence now numbers just as many members as it did before they left us Another angel has flown into it though not on wings and I have four darling children the baby who can hardly be called a baby now being nearly two years old My hands and my heart are full but two of the children go to school and that certainly makes my day s work easier The little things are happier for having regular employment and we are so glad to meet each other again after the brief separation I try to be at home when it is time to expect them for I love to hear the eager voices ask in chorus the moment the door opens Is mamma at home Helen has taken Daisy to sleep with her which after so many years of ups and downs at night now with restless babies now to answer the bell when Ernest is out is a great relief to me Poor Helen She has never recovered her cheerfulness since James death It has crushed her energies and left her very sorrowful This is partly owing to a soft and tender nature easily borne down and overwhelmed partly to what seems an almost constitutional inability to find rest in God s will She assents to all we say to her about submission in a sweet gentle way and then comes the invariable mournful wail But it was so unexpected It came so suddenly But I love the little thing and her affection for us all is one of our greatest comforts Martha is greatly absorbed in her own household its cares and its pleasures She brings her little Underhills to see us occasionally when they put my children quite out of countenance by their consciousness of the fine clothes they wear and their knowledge of the world Even I find it hard not to feel abashed in the presence of so much of the sort of wisdom in which I am lacking As to Lucy she is exactly in her sphere the calm dignity with which she reigns in her husband s house and the moderation and self control with which she guides his children are really instructive She has a baby of her own and though it acts just like other babies and kicks scratches pulls and cries when it is washed and dressed she goes through that process with a serenity and deliberation that I envy with all my might Her predecessor in the nursery was all nerve and brain and has left four children made of the same material behind her But their wild spirits on one day and their depression and languor on the next have no visible effect upon her Her influence is always quieting she tones down their vehemence with her own calm decision and practical good sense It is amusing to see her seated among those four little furies who love each other in such a distracted way that somebody s feelings are always getting hurt and somebody always crying By a sort of magnetic influence she heals these wounds immediately and finds some prosaic occupation as an antidote to these poetical moods I confess that I am instructed and reproved whenever I go to see her and wish I were more like her But there is no use in trying to engraft an opposite nature on one s own What I am that I must be except as God changes me into His own image And everything brings me back to that as my supreme desire I see more and more that I must be myself what I want my children to be and that I cannot make myself over even for their sakes This must be His work and I wonder that it goes on so slowly that all the disappointments sorrows sicknesses I have passed through have left me still selfish still full of imperfections MARCH five eighteen fifty two This is the sixth anniversary of James death Thinking it all over after I went to bed last night his sickness his death and the weary months that followed for mother I could not get to sleep till long past midnight Then Una woke crying with the earache and I was up till nearly daybreak with her poor child I got up jaded and depressed almost ready to faint under the burden of life and dreading to meet Helen who is doubly sad on these anniversaries She came down to breakfast dressed as usual in deep mourning and looking as spiritless as I felt The prattle of the children relieved the sombre silence maintained by the rest of us each of whom acted depressingly on the others How things do flash into one s mind These words suddenly came to mine as we sat so gloomily at the table God had spread for us and which He had enlivened by the four young faces around it Why should the children of a King Go mourning all their days Why indeed Children of a King I felt grieved that I was so intent on my own sorrows as to lose sight of my relationship to Him And then I asked myself what I could do to make the day less wearisome and sorrowful to Helen She came after a time with her work to my room The children took their good by kisses and went off to school Ernest took his too and set forth on his day s work whionee Daisy played quietly about the room Helen dear I ventured at last to begin I want you to do me a favor to day Yes she said languidly I want you to go to see missus Campbell This is the day for her beef tea and she will be looking out for one of us You must not ask me to go to day Helen answered I think I must dear When other springs of comfort dry up there is one always left to us And that as mother often said is usefulness I do try to be useful she said Yes you are very kind to me and to the children If you were my own sister you could not do more But these little duties do not relieve that aching void in your heart which yearns so for relief No she said quickly I have no such yearning I just want to settle down as I am now Yes I suppose that is the natural tendency of sorrow But there is great significance in the prayer for a heart at leisure from itself to soothe and sympathize Oh Katy she said you don t know you can t know how I feel Until James began to love me so I did not know there was such a love as that in the world You know our family is different from yours And it is so delightful to be loved Or rather it was Don t say was I said You know we all love you dearly dearly Yes but not as James did That is true It was foolish in me to expect to console you by such suggestions But to go back to missus Campbell She will sympathize with you if you will let her as very few can for she has lost both husband and children Ah but she had a husband for a time at least It is not as if he were snatched away before they had lived together If anybody else had said this I should have felt that it was out of mere perverseness But dear little Helen is not perverse she is simply overburdened I grant that your disappointment was greater than hers I went on But the affliction was not Every day that a husband and wife walk hand in hand together upon earth makes of the twain more and more one flesh The selfish element which at first formed so large a part of their attraction to each other disappears and the union becomes so pure and beautiful as to form a fitting type of the union of Christ and His church There is nothing else on earth like it Helen sighed I find it hard to believe she said there can be anything more delicious than the months in which James and I were so happy together Suffering together would have brought you even nearer I replied Dear Helen I am very sorry for you I hope you feel that even when according to my want I fall into arguments as if one could argue a sorrow away You are so happy she answered Ernest loves you so dearly and is so proud of you and you have such lovely children I ought not to expect you to sympathize perfectly with my loneliness Yes I am happy I said after a pause but you must own dear that I have had my sorrows too Until you become a mother yourself you cannot comprehend what a mother can suffer riot merely for herself in losing her children but in seeing their sufferings I think I may say of my happiness that it rests on something higher and deeper than even Ernest and my children And what is that The will of God the sweet will of God If He should take them all away I might still possess a peace which would flow on forever I know this partly from my own experience and partly from that of others missus Campbell says that the three months that followed the death of her first child were the happiest she had ever known missus Wentworth whose husband was snatched from her almost without warning and while using expressions of affection for her such as a lover addresses to his bride said to me with tears rolling down her cheeks yet with a smile I thank my God and Saviour that He has not forgotten and passed me by but has counted me worthy to bear this sorrow for His sake And hear this passage from the life of Wesley which I lighted on this morning He visited one of his disciples who was ill in bed and after having buried seven of her family in six months had just heard that the eighth her husband whom she dearly loved had been cast away at sea I asked her he says do you not fret at any of those things She says with a lovely smile Oh no how can I fret at anything which is the will of God Let Him take all beside He has given me Himself I love I praise Him every moment Yes Helen objected I can imagine people as saying such things in moments of excitement but afterwards they have hours of terrible agony They have hours of terrible agony of course God s grace does not harden our hearts and make them proof against suffering like coats of mail They can all say Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee and it is they alone who have been down into the depths and had rich experience of what God could be to His children there who can utter such testimonials to His honor as those I have just repeated Katy Helen suddenly asked do you always submit to God s will thus In great things I do I said What grieves me is that I am constantly forgetting to recognize God s hand in the little every day trials of life and instead of receiving them as from Him find fault with the instruments by which He sends them I can give up my child my only brother my darling mother without a word but to receive every tire some visitor as sent expressly and directly to weary me by the Master Himself to meet every negligence on the part of the servants as His choice for me at the moment to be satisfied and patient when Ernest gets particularly absorbed in his books because my Father sees that little discipline suitable for me at the time all this I have not fully learned All you say discourages me said Helen in a tone of deep dejection Such perfection was only meant for a few favored ones and I do not dare so much as to aim at it I am perfectly sure that I must be satisfied with the low state of grace I am in now and always have been She was about to leave me but I caught her hand as she would have passed me and made one more attempt to reach her poor weary soul But are you satisfied dear Helen I asked as tenderly as I would speak to a little sick child Surely you crave happiness as every human soul does Yes I crave it she replied but God has taken it from me He has taken away your earthly happiness I know but only to convince you what better things He has in store for you Let me read you a letter which doctor Cabot wrote me many years ago but which has been an almost constant inspiration to me ever since She sat down resumed her work again and listened to the letter in silence As I came to its last sentence the three children rushed in from school at least the boys did and threw themselves upon me like men assaulting a fort I have formed the habit of giving myself entirely to them at the proper moment and now entered into their frolicsome mood as joyously as if I had never known a sorrow or lost an hour s sleep At last they went off to their play room and Una settled down by my side to amuse Daisy when Helen began again I should like to read that letter myself she said Meanwhile I want to ask you one question What are you made of that you can turn from one thing to another like lightning Talking one moment as if life depended on your every word and then frisking about with those wild boys as if you were a child yourself I saw Una look up curiously to hear my answer as I replied I have always aimed at this flexibility I think a mother especially ought to learn to enter into the gayer moods of her children at the very moment when her own heart is sad And it may be as religious an act for her to romp with them at the time as to pray with them at another Helen now went away to her room with doctor Cabot s letter which I silently prayed might bless her as it had blessed me And then a jaded disheartened mood came over me that made me feel that all I had been saying to her was but as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal since my life and my professions did not correspond Hitherto my consciousness of imperfection has made me hesitate to say much to Helen Why are we so afraid of those who live under the same roof with us It must be the conviction that those who daily see us acting in a petty selfish trifling way must find it hard to conceive that our prayers and our desires take a wider and higher aim Dear little Helen May the ice once broken remain broken forever Chapter twenty four

none	none	MARCH twenty HELEN returned doctor Cabot s letter in silence this morning but directly after breakfast set forth to visit missus Campbell with the little bottle of beef tea in her hands which ought to have gone yesterday 
4899_32658_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I had a busy day before me the usual Saturday baking and Sunday dinner to oversee the children s lessons for to morrow to superintend and hear them repeat their clean clothes to lay out and a basket of stockings to mend 
4899_32658_000003_000002	train-clean-360	My mind was somewhat distracted with these cares and I found it a little difficult to keep on with my morning devotions in spite of them 
4899_32658_000003_000003	train-clean-360	But I have learned at least to face and fight such distractions instead of running away from them as I used to do 
4899_32658_000003_000004	train-clean-360	My faith in prayer my resort to it becomes more and more the foundation of my life and I believe with one wiser and better than myself that nothing but prayer stands between my soul and the best gifts of God in other words that I can and shall get what I ask for 
4899_32658_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I went down into the kitchen put on my large baking apron and began my labors of course the door bell rang and a poor woman was announced 
4899_32658_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It is very sweet to follow Fenelon s counsel and give oneself to Christ in all these interruptions but this time I said oh dear before I thought 
4899_32658_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Then I wished I hadn t and went up with a cheerful face at any rate to my unwelcome visitor who proved to be one of my aggravating poor folks a great giant of a woman in perfect health and with a husband to support her if he will 
4899_32658_000004_000003	train-clean-360	I told her that I could do no more for her she answered me rudely and kept urging her claims 
none	none	I felt ruffled why should my time be thus frittered away I asked myself 
4899_32658_000004_000005	train-clean-360	At last she went off abusing me in a way that chilled my heart 
none	none	I could only beg God to forgive her and return to my work which I had hardly resumed when missus Embury sent for a pattern I had promised to lend her 
4899_32658_000004_000007	train-clean-360	Off came my apron and up two pairs of stairs I ran after a long search it came to light 
4899_32658_000004_000008	train-clean-360	Work resumed door bell again 
4899_32658_000004_000009	train-clean-360	Aunty wanted the children to come to an early dinner 
none	none	Going to Aunty s is next to going to Paradise to them Every thing was now hurry and flurry I tried to be patient and not to fret their temper by undue attention to nails ears and other susceptible parts of the human frame but after it was all over and I had kissed all the sweet dear faces good by and returned to the kitchen I felt sure that I had not been the perfect mother I want to be in all these little emergencies yes far from it 
4899_32658_000004_000011	train-clean-360	Bridget had let the milk I was going to use boil over and finally burn up 
4899_32658_000004_000012	train-clean-360	I was annoyed and irritated and already tired and did not see how I was to get more as Mary was cleaning the silver to be sure there is not much of it and had other extra Saturday work to do 
none	none	I thought Bridget might offer to run to the corner for it though it isn t her business hut she is not obliging and seemed as sulky as if I had burned the milk not she After all I said to myself what does it signify if Ernest gets no dessert 
4899_32658_000004_000015	train-clean-360	It isn t good for him and how much precious time is wasted over just this one thing However I reflected that arbitrarily refusing to indulge him in this respect is not exactly my mission as his wife he is perfectly well and likes his little luxuries as well as other people do 
4899_32658_000004_000016	train-clean-360	So I humbled my pride and asked Bridget to go for the milk which she did in a lofty way of her own 
4899_32658_000004_000017	train-clean-360	While she was gone the marketing came home and I had everything to dispose of 
4899_32658_000004_000018	train-clean-360	Ernest had sent home some apples which plainly said I want some apple pie Katy I looked nervously at the clock and undertook to gratify him 
none	none	Mary came down crying to say that her mother who lived in Brooklyn was very sick could she go to see her I looked at the clock once more told her she should go of course as soon as lunch was over this involved my doing all her absence left undone 
4899_32658_000005_000000	train-clean-360	At last I got through with the kitchen the Sunday dinner being well under way and ran upstairs to put away the host of little garments the children had left when they took their flight and to make myself presentable at lunch 
4899_32658_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Then I began to be uneasy lest Ernest should not be punctual and Mary be delayed but he came just as the clock struck one 
4899_32658_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I ran joyfully to meet him very glad now that I had something good to give him 
none	none	We bad just got through lunch and I was opening my mouth to tell Mary she might go when the doorbell rang once more and missus Fry of Jersey City was announced I told Mary to wait till I found whether she had lunched or not no she hadn t had come to town to see friends off was half famished and would I do her the favor et cetera et cetera 
4899_32658_000005_000005	train-clean-360	She had a fashionable young lady with her a stranger to me as well as a Miss Somebody else from Albany whose name I did not catch 
none	none	I apologized for having finished lunch missus Fry said all they wanted was a cup of tea and a bit of bread and butter nothing else dear now don t put yourself out
4899_32658_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Now be bright and animated and like yourself she whispered for I have brought these girls here on purpose to hear you talk and they are prepared to fall in love with you on the spot 
4899_32658_000007_000000	train-clean-360	This speech sufficed to shut my mouth 
4899_32658_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Mary had to get ready for these unexpected guests whose appetites proved equal to a raid on a good many things besides bread and butter 
4899_32658_000008_000001	train-clean-360	missus Fry said after she had devoured nearly half a loaf of cake that she would really try to eat a morsel more which Ernest remarked dryly was a great triumph of mind over matter 
4899_32658_000008_000002	train-clean-360	As they talked and laughed and ate leisurely on Mary stood looking the picture of despair 
none	none	At last I gave her a glance that said she might go when a new visitor was announced missus 
4899_32658_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Winthrop from Brooklyn one of Ernest s patients a few years ago when she lived here 
4899_32658_000008_000005	train-clean-360	She professed herself greatly indebted to him and said she had come at this hour because she should make sure of seeing him 
none	none	I tried to excuse him as I knew he would be thankful to have me do but no see him she must he was her pet doctor he had such sweet bedside manners and I am such a favorite with him you know 
4899_32658_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Ernest did not receive his favorite with any special warmth but invited her out to lunch and gallanted her to the table we had just left 
4899_32658_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Just like a man 
4899_32658_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Poor Mary she had to fly round and get up what she could missus Winthrop devoted herself to Ernest with a persistent ignoring of me that I thought rude and unwomanly 
none	none	She asked if he had read a certain book he had not she then said I need not ask then if missus Elliott has done so These charming dishes which she gets up so nicely must absorb all her time Of course replied Ernest
4899_32658_000009_000005	train-clean-360	 But she contrives to read the reports of all the murders of which the newspapers are full 
none	none	missus Winthrop took this speech literally drew away her skirts from me looked at me through her eye glass and said Yes At last she departed 
4899_32658_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Helen came home and Mary went 
4899_32658_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I gave Helen an account of my morning she laughed heartily and it did me good to hear that musical sound once more 
none	none	It is nearly five o clock I said as we at last had restored everything to order and this whole day has been frittered away in the veriest trifles 
4899_32658_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It isn t living to live so 
4899_32658_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Who is the better for my being in the world since six o clock this morning 
4899_32658_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I am for one she said kissing my hot cheeks and you have given a great deal of pleasure to several persons 
4899_32658_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Your and Ernest s hospitality is always graceful 
none	none	I admire it in you both and this is one of the little ways not to be despised of giving enjoyment It was nice in her to say that it quite rested me 
4899_32658_000013_000000	train-clean-360	At the dinner table Ernest complimented me on my good housekeeping 
none	none	I was proud of my little wife at lunch he said
4899_32658_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 And yet you said that outrageous thing about my reading about nothing but murders I said 
4899_32658_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh well you understood it he said laughingly 
4899_32658_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 But that dreadful missus Winthrop took it literally 
4899_32658_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 What do we care for missus Winthrop he returned 
4899_32658_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 If you could have seen the contrast between you two in my eyes 
4899_32658_000019_000000	train-clean-360	After all one must take life as it comes its homely details are so mixed up with its sweet charities and loves and friendships that one is forced to believe that God has joined them together and does not will that they should be put asunder 
4899_32658_000019_000001	train-clean-360	It is something that my husband has been satisfied with his wife and his home to day that does me good 
none	none	MARCH thirty A stormy day and the children home from school and no little frolicking and laughing going on 
4899_32658_000020_000001	train-clean-360	It must be delightful to feel well and strong while one s children are young there is so much to do for them 
4899_32658_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I do it but no one can tell the effort it costs me What a contrast there is between their vitality and the languor under which I suffer 
none	none	When their noise became intolerable I proposed to read to them of course they made ten times as much clamor of pleasure and of course they leaned on me ground their elbows into my lap and tired me all out 
4899_32658_000020_000004	train-clean-360	As I sat with this precious little group about me Ernest opened the door looked in gravely and without a word and instantly disappeared 
none	none	I felt uneasy and asked him this evening why he looked so 
4899_32658_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Was I indulging the children too much or what was it 
none	none	He took me into his arms and said My precious wife why will you torment yourself with such fancies My very heart was yearning over you at that moment as it did the first time I saw you surrounded by your little class at Sunday school years ago and I was asking myself why God had given me such a wife and my children such a mother 
4899_32658_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Oh I am glad I have got this written down 
none	none	I will read it over when the sense of my deficiencies overwhelms me while I ask God why He has given me such a patient forbearing husband 
4899_32658_000023_000000	train-clean-360	APRIL one This has been a sad day to our church 
4899_32658_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Our dear doctor Cabot has gone to his eternal home and left us as sheep without a shepherd 
4899_32658_000024_000000	train-clean-360	His death was sudden at the last and found us all unprepared for it But my tears of sorrow are mingled with tears of joy 
none	none	His heart had long been in heaven he was ready to go at a moment s warning never was a soul so constantly and joyously on the wing as his 
4899_32658_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Poor missus Cabot 
4899_32658_000024_000003	train-clean-360	She is left very desolate for all their children are married and settled at a distance 
4899_32658_000024_000004	train-clean-360	But she bears this sorrow like one who has long felt herself a pilgrim and a stranger on earth 
4899_32658_000024_000005	train-clean-360	How strange that we ever forget that we are all such 
4899_32658_000025_000000	train-clean-360	APRIL sixteen The desolate pilgrimage was not long 
none	none	Dear missus Cabot was this day laid away by the side of her beloved husband and it is delightful to think of them as not divided by death but united by it in a complete and eternal union I never saw a husband and wife more tenderly attached to each other and this is a beautiful close to their long and happy married life 
4899_32658_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I find it hard not to wish and pray that I may as speedily follow my precious husband should God call him away first 
4899_32658_000026_000002	train-clean-360	But it is not for me to choose 
none	none	How I shall miss these faithful friends who from my youth up have been my stay and my staff in the house of my pilgrimage 
4899_32658_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Almost all the disappointments and sorrows of my life have had their Christian sympathy particularly the daily wasting solicitude concerning my darling Una for they to watched for years over as delicate a flower and saw it fade and die 
4899_32658_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Only those who have suffered thus can appreciate the heart soreness through which no matter how outwardly cheerful I may be I am always passing 
4899_32658_000027_000003	train-clean-360	But what then 
4899_32658_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Have I not ten thousand times made this my prayer that in the words of Leighton my will might become identical with God s will 
none	none	And shall He not take me at my word Just as I was writing these words my canary burst forth with a song so joyous that a song was put also into my mouth 
4899_32658_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Something seemed to say this captive sings in his cage because it has never known liberty and cannot regret a lost freedom 
none	none	So the soul of my child limited by the restrictions of a feeble body never having known the gladness of exuberant health may sing songs that will enliven and cheer

none	none	Chapter twenty five XXV MAY four Miss CLIFFORD came to lunch with us on Wednesday Her remarkable restoration to health has attracted a good deal of attention and has given Ernest a certain reputation which does not come amiss to him Not that he is ambitious a more unworldly man does not live but his extreme reserve and modesty have obscured the light that is now beginning to shine We all enjoyed Miss Clifford s visit She is one of the freshest most original creatures I ever met with and kept us all laughing with her quaint speeches long after every particle of lunch had disappeared from the table But this mobile nature turns to the serious side of life with marvelous ease and celerity as perhaps all sound ones ought to do I took her up to my room where my work basket was and Helen followed with hers I have brought something to read to you dear missus Elliott Miss Clifford began the moment we had seated ourselves which I have just lighted on and I am sure you will like A nobleman writes to Fenelon asking certain questions and a part of these questions with the replies I want to enjoy with you as they cover a good deal of the ground we have often discussed together I How shall I offer my purely indifferent actions to God walks visits made and received dress little proprieties such as washing the hands et cetera the reading of books of history business with which I am charged for my friends other amusements such as shopping having clothes made and equipages I want to have some sort of prayer or method of offering each of these things to God REPLY The most indifferent actions cease to be such and become good as soon as one performs them with the intention of conforming one s self in them to the will of God They are often better and purer than certain actions which appear more virtuous first because they are less of our own choice and more in the order of Providence when one is obliged to perform them twod because they are simpler and less exposed to vain complaisance threed because if one yields to them with moderation one finds in them more of death to one s inclinations than in certain acts of fervor in which self love mingles finally because these little occasions occur more frequently and furnish a secret occasion for continually making every moment profitable It is not necessary to make great efforts nor acts of great reflection in order to offer what are called indifferent actions It is enough to lift the soul one instant to God to make a simple offering of it Everything which God wishes us to do and which enters into the course of occupation suitable to our position can and ought to be offered to God nothing is unworthy of Him but sin When you feel that an action cannot be offered to God conclude that it does not become a Christian it is at least necessary to suspect it and seek light concerning it I would not have a special prayer for each of these the elevation of the heart at the moment suffices As for visits commissions and the like as there is danger of following one s own taste too much I would add to this elevating of the heart a prayer to moderate myself and use precaution II In prayer I cannot fix my mind or I have intervals of time when it is elsewhere and it is often distracted for a long time before I perceive it I want to find some means of becoming its master REPLY Fidelity in following the rules that have been given you and in recalling your mind every time you perceive its distraction will gradually give you the grace of being more recollected Meanwhile bear your involuntary distractions with patience and humility you deserve nothing better Is it surprising that recollection is difficult to a man so long dissipated and far from God III I wish to know if it is best to record on my tablets the faults and the sins I have committed in order not to rum the risk of forgetting them I excite in myself to repentance for my faults as much as I can but I have never felt any real grief on account of them When I examine myself at night I see persons far more perfect than I complain of more sin as for me I seek I find nothing and yet it is impossible there should not be many points on which to implore pardon every day of my life REPLY You should examine yourself every night but simply and briefly In the disposition to which God has brought you you will not voluntarily commit any considerable fault without remembering and reproaching yourself for it As to little faults scarcely perceived even if you sometimes forget them this need not make you uneasy As to lively grief on account of your sins it is not necessary God gives it when it pleases Him True and essential conversion of the heart consists in a full will to sacrifice all to God What I call full will is a fixed immovable disposition of the will to resume none of the voluntary affections which may alter the purity of the love to God and to abandon itself to all the crosses which it will perhaps be necessary to bear in order to accomplish the will of God always and in all things As to sorrow for sin when one has it one ought to return thanks for it when one perceives it to be wanting one should humble one s self peacefully before God without trying to excite it by vain efforts You find in your self examination fewer faults than persons more advanced and more perfect do it is because your interior light is still feeble It will increase and the view of your infidelities will increase in proportion It suffices without making yourself uneasy to try to be faithful to the degree of light you possess and to instruct yourself by reading and meditation It will not do to try to forestall the grace that belongs to a more advanced period It would only serve to trouble and discourage you and even to exhaust you by continual anxiety the time that should be spent in loving God would be given to forced returns upon yourself which secretly nourish self love IV In my prayers my mind has difficulty in finding anything to say to God My heart is not in it or it is inaccessible to the thoughts of my mind REPLY It is not necessary to say much to God Oftentimes one does not speak much to a friend whom one is delighted to see one looks at him with pleasure one speaks certain short words to him which are mere expressions of feeling The mind has no part in them or next to none one keeps repeating the same words It is not so much a variety of thoughts that one seeks in intercourse with a friend as a certain repose and correspondence of heart It is thus we are with God who does not disdain to be our tenderest most cordial most familiar most intimate friend A word a sigh a sentiment says all to God it is not always necessary to have transports of sensible tenderness a will all naked and dry without life without vivacity without pleasure is often purest in the sight of God In fine it is necessary to content one s self with giving to Him what He gives it to give a fervent heart when it is fervent a heart firm and faithful in its aridity when He deprives it of sensible fervor It does not always depend on you to feel but it is necessary to wish to feel Leave it to God to choose to make you feel sometimes in order to sustain your weakness and infancy in Christian life sometimes weaning you from that sweet and consoling sentiment which is the milk of babes in order to humble you to make you grow and to make you robust in the violent exercise of faith by causing you to sweat the bread of the strong in the sweat of your brow Would you only love God according as He will make you take pleasure in loving Him You would be loving your own tenderness and feeling fancying that you were loving God Even while receiving sensible gifts prepare yourself by pure faith for the time when you might be deprived of them and you will suddenly succumb if you had only relied on such support O forgot to speak of some practices which may at the beginning facilitate the remembrance of the offering one ought to make to God of all the ordinary acts of the day one Form the resolution to do so every morning and call yourself to account in your self examination at night two Make no resolutions but for good reasons either from propriety or the necessity of relaxing the mind et cetera Thus in accustoming one s self to retrench the useless little by little one accustoms one s self to offer what is not proper to curtail three Renew one s self in this disposition whenever one is alone in order to be better prepared to recollect it when in company four Whenever one surprises one s self in too great dissipation or in speaking too freely of his neighbor let him collect himself and offer to God all the rest of the conversation five To flee with confidence to God to act according to His will when one enters company or engages in some occupation which may cause one to fall into temptation The sight of danger ought to warn of the need there is to lift the heart toward Him by one who may be preserved from it We both thanked her as she finished reading and I begged her to lend me the volume that I might make the above copy I hope I have gained some valuable hints from this letter and that I shall see more plainly than ever that it is a religion of principle that God wants from us not one of mere feeling Helen remarked that she was most struck by the assertion that one cannot forestall the graces that belong to a more advanced period She said she had assumed that she ought to experience all that the most mature Christian did and that it rested her to think of God as doing this work for her making repentance for instance a free gift not a conquest to be won for one s self Miss Clifford said that the whole idea of giving one s self to God in such little daily acts as visiting shopping and the like was entirely new to her But fancy she went on her beautiful face lighted up with enthusiasm what a blessed life that must be when the base things of this world and things that are despised are so many links to the invisible world and to the things God has chosen In other words I said the top of the ladder that rests on earth reaches to heaven and we may ascend it as the angels did in Jacob s dream And descend too as they did Helen put in despondently Now you shall not speak in that tone cried Miss Clifford Let us look at the bright side of life and believe that God means us to be always ascending always getting nearer to Himself always learning something new about Him always loving Him better and better To be sure our souls are sick and of themselves can t keep ever on the wing but I have had some delightful thoughts of late from just hearing the title of a book God s method with the maladies of the soul It gives one such a conception of the seeming ills of life to think of Him as our Physician the ills all remedies the deprivations only a wholesome regimen the losses all gains Why as I study this individual case and that see how patiently and persistently He tries now this remedy now that and how infallibly He cures the souls that submit to His remedies I love Him so I love Him so And I am so astonished that we are restive under His unerring hand Think how He dealt with me My soul was sick unto death sick with worldliness and self pleasing and folly There was only one way of making me listen to reason and that was just the way He took He snatched me right out of the world and shut me up in one room crippled helpless and alone and set me to thinking thinking thinking till I saw the emptiness and shallowness of all in which I had hitherto been involved And then He sent you and your mother to show me the reality of life and to reveal to me my invisible unknown Physician Can I love Him with half my heart Can I be asking questions as to how much I am to pay towards the debt I owe Him By this time Helen s work had fallen from her hands and tears were in her eyes How I thank you she said softly for what you have said You have interpreted life to me You have given me a new conception of my God and Saviour Miss Clifford seemed quenched and humbled by these words her enthusiasm faded away and she looked at Helen with a deprecatory air as she replied Don t say that I never felt so unfit for anything but to sit at the feet of Christ s disciples and learn of them Yet I so many years one of those disciples been sitting at her feet and had learned of her Never had I so realized the magnitude of the work to be done in this world nor the power and goodness of Him who has undertaken to do it all I was glad to be alone to walk my room singing praises to Him for every instance in which as my Physician He had disappointed my hope and defeated my joys and given me to drink of the cup of sorrow and bereavement MAY twenty four I read to Ernest the extract from Fenelon which has made such an impression on me Every business man in short every man leading an active life ought to read that he said We should have a new order of things as the result Instead of fancying that our ordinary daily work was one thing and our religion quite another thing we should transmute our drudgery into acts of worship Instead of going to prayer meetings to get into a good frame we should live in a good frame from morning till night from night till morning and prayer and praise would be only another form for expressing the love and faith and obedience we had been exercising amid the pressure of business I only wish I had understood this years ago I said I have made prayer too much of a luxury and have often inwardly chafed and fretted when the care of my children at times made it utterly impossible to leave them for private devotion when they have been sick for instance or in other like emergencies I reasoned this way Here is a special demand on my patience and I am naturally impatient I must have time to go away and entreat the Lord to equip me for this conflict But I see now that the simple act of cheerful acceptance of the duty imposed and the solace and support withdrawn would have united me more fully to Christ than the highest enjoyment of His presence in prayer could Yes every act of obedience is an act of worship he said But why don t we learn that sooner Why do we waste our lives before we learn how to live I am not sure he returned that we do not learn as fast as we are willing to learn God does not force instruction upon us but when we say as Luther did More light Lord more light the light comes I questioned myself after he had gone as to whether this could be true of me Is there not in my heart some secret reluctance to know the truth lest that knowledge should call to a higher and holier life than I have yet lived JUNE two I went to see missus Campbell a few days ago and found to my great joy that Helen had just been there and that they had had an earnest conversation together missus Campbell failed a good deal of late and it is not probable we shall have her with us much longer Her every look and word is precious to me when I think of her as one who is so soon to enter the unseen world and see our Saviour and be welcomed home by Him If it is so delightful to be with those who are on the way to heaven what would it be to have fellowship with one who had come thence and could tell us what it is She spoke freely about death and said Ernest had promised to take charge of her funeral and to see that she was buried by the side of her husband You see my dear she added with a smile though I am expecting to be so soon a saint in heaven I am a human being still with human weaknesses What can it really matter where this weary old body is laid away when I have done with it and gone and left it forever And yet I am leaving directions about its disposal I said I was glad that she was still human but that I did not think it a weakness to take thought for the abode in which her soul had dwelt so long I saw that she was tired and was coming away but she held me and would not let me go Yes I am tired she said but what of that It is only a question of days now and all my tired feelings will be over Then I shall be as young and fresh as ever and shall have strength to praise and to love God as I cannot do now But before I go I want once more to tell you how good He is how blessed it is to suffer with Him how infinitely happy He has made me in the very hottest heat of the furnace It will strengthen you in your trials to recall this my dying testimony There is no wilderness so dreary but that His love can illuminate it no desolation so desolate but that He can sweeten it I know what I am saying It is no delusion I believe that the highest purest happiness is known only to those who have learned Christ in sick rooms in poverty in racking suspense and anxiety amid hardships and at the open grave Yes the radiant face worn by sickness and suffering but radiant still said in language yet more unspeakably impressive To learn Christ this is life I came into the busy and noisy streets as one descending from the mount and on reaching home found my darling Una very ill in Ernest s arms She had fallen and injured her head How I had prayed that God would temper the wind to this shorn lamb and now she had had such a fall We watched over her till far into the night scarcely speaking to each other but I know by the way in which Ernest held my hand clasped in his that her precious life was in danger He consented at last to lie down but Helen stayed with me What a night it was God only knows what the human heart can experience in a space of time that men call hours I went over all the past history of the child recalling all her sweet looks and words and my own secret repining at the delicate health that cut her off from so many of the pleasures that belong to her age And the more I thought the more I clung to her on whom frail as she is I was beginning to lean and whose influence in our home I could not think of losing without a shudder Alas my faith seemed for a time to flee and I see just what a poor weak human being is without it But before daylight crept into my room light from on high streamed into my heart and I gave even this my ewe lamb away as my free will offering to God Could I refuse Him my child because she was the very apple of my eye Nay then but let me give to Him not what I value least but what I prize and delight in most Could I not endure heart sickness for Him who had given His only Son for me And just as I got to that sweet consent to suffer He who had only lifted the rod to try my faith laid it down My darling opened her eyes and looked at us intelligently and with her own loving smile But I dared not snatch her and press her to my heart for her sake I must be outwardly calm at least JUNE six I am at home with my precious Una all the rest having gone to church She lies peacefully on the bed sadly disfigured for the time but Ernest says he apprehends no danger now and we are a most happy a most thankful household The children have all been greatly moved by the events of the last few days and hover about their sister with great sympathy and tenderness Where she fell from or how she fell no one knows she remembers nothing about it herself and it will always remain a mystery This is the second time that this beloved child has been returned to us after we had given her away to God And as the giving cost us ten fold more now than it did when she was a feeble baby so we receive her as a fresh gift from our loving Father s hand with ten fold delight Ah we have no excuse for not giving ourselves entirely to Him He has revealed Himself to us in so many sorrows and in so many joys revealed Himself as He doth not unto the world Chapter twenty six XXVI MAY thirteen THIS has been a Sunday to be held in long remembrance We were summoned early this morning to missus Campbell and have seen her joyful release from the fetters that have bound her long Her loss to me is irreparable But I truly thank God that one more tired traveler had a sweet welcome home I can minister no longer to her bodily wants and listen to her counsels no more but she has entered as an inspiration into my life and through all eternity I shall bless God that He gave me that faithful praying friend How little they know who languish in what seems useless sick rooms or amid the restrictions of frail health what work they do for Christ by the power of saintly living and by even fragmentary prayers Before her words fade out of my memory I want to write down from hasty notes made at the time her answer to some of the last questions I asked her on earth She had always enjoyed intervals of comparative ease and it was in one of these that I asked her what she conceived to be the characteristics of an advanced state of grace She replied I think that the mature Christian is always at all times and in all circumstances what he was in his best moments in the progressive stages of his life There were seasons all along his course when he loved God supremely when he embraced the cross joyfully and penitently when he held intimate communion with Christ and loved his neighbor as himself But he was always in terror lest under the force of temptation all this should give place to deadness and dullness when he should chafe and rebel in the hour of trial and judge his fellow man with a harsh and bitter judgment and give way to angry passionate emotions But these fluctuations cease after a time to disturb his peace Love to Christ becomes the abiding inmost principle of his life he loves Him rather for what He is than for what He has done or will do for him individually and God s honor becomes so dear to him that he feels personally wounded when that is called in question And the will of God becomes so dear to him that he loves it best when it triumphs at his cost Once he only prayed at set times and seasons and idolized good frames and fervent emotions Nninew he prays without ceasing and whether on the mount or down in the depths depends wholly upon His Saviour His old self confidence has now given place to child like humility that will not let him take a step alone and the sweet peace that is now habitual to him combined with the sense of his own imperfections fills him with love to his fellow man He hears and believes and hopes and endures all things and thinketh no evil The tones of his voice the very expression of his countenance become changed love now controlling where human passions held sway In short he is not only a new creature in Jesus Christ but the habitual and blessed consciousness that this is so These words were spoken deliberately and with reflection You have described my mother just as she was from the moment her only son the last of six was taken from her I said at last I never quite understood how that final sorrow weaned her so to say from herself and made her life all love to God and all love to man But I see it now Dear missus Campbell pray for me that I may yet wear her mantle She smiled with a significance that said she had already done so and then we parted parted that she might end her pilgrimage and go to her rest parted that I might pursue mine I know not how long nor amid how many cares and sorrows nor with what weariness and heart sickness parted to meet again in the presence of Him we love with those who have come out of great tribulation whose robes have been made white in the blood of the Lamb and who are before the throne of God and serve Him day and night in His temple to hunger no more neither thirst any more for the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall lead them into living fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes MAY twenty five We were talking of missus Campbell and of her blessed life and blessed death Helen said it discouraged and troubled her to see and hear such things The last time I saw her when she was able to converse said she I told her that when I reflected on my want of submission to God s will I doubted whether I really could be His child She said in her gentle sweet way Would you venture to resist His will if you could Would you really have your dear James back again in this world if could I would I certainly would I said She returned I sometimes find it a help when dull and cramped in my devotions to say to myself Suppose Christ should now appear before you and you could see Him as He appeared to His disciples on earth what would you say to Him This brings Him near and I say what I would say if He were visibly present I do the same when a new sorrow threatens me I imagine my Redeemer as coming personally to say to me For your sake I am a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief now for My sake give me this child bear this burden submit to this loss Can I refuse Him Now dear he has really come thus to you and asked you to show your love to Him your faith in Him by giving Him the most precious of your treasures If He were here at this moment and offered to restore it to you would you dare to say Yea Lord I know far better than Thou dost what is good for him and good for me I will have him return to me cost what it may in this world of uncertainties and disappointments I shall be sure of happiness in his society and he will enjoy more here on earth with me than he could enjoy in the companionship of saints and angels and of the Lord Himself in heaven Could you dare to say this Oh Katy what straits she drove me into No I could not dare to say that Then my darling little sister I cried you will give up this struggle You will let God do what He will with His own I have to let Him she replied but I submit because I must I looked at her gentle pure face as she uttered these words and could only marvel at the will that had no expression there Tell me she said do you think a real Christian can feel as I do For my part I doubt it I doubt everything Doubt everything but believe in Christ I said Suppose for argument s sake you are not a Christian You can become one now The color rose in her lovely face she clasped her hands in a sort of ecstasy Yes she said I can At last God had sent her the word she wanted MAY twenty eight Helen came to breakfast this morning in a simple white dress I had not time to tell the children not to allude to it so they began in chorus Why Aunt Helen you have put on a white dress Why Aunty how queer you look Hurrah if she don t look like other folks She bore it all with her usual gentleness or rather with a positive sweetness that captivated them as her negative patience had never done I said nothing to her nor did she to me till late In the day when she came to me and said Katy God taught you what to say All these years I have been tormenting myself with doubts as to whether I could be His child while so unable to say Thy will be done If you had said Why yes you must be His child for you professed yourself one a long time ago and ever since have lived like one I should have remained as wretched as ever As it is a mountain has been rolled off my heart Yes if I was not His child yesterday I can become one to day if I did not love Him then I can begin now I do not doubt that she was His child yesterday and last year and years ago But let her think what she pleases A new life is opening before her I believe it is to be a life of entire devotion to God and that out of her sorrow there shall spring up a wondrous joy SEPT two Sweet Briar Farm Ernest spent Sunday with us and I have just driven him to the station and seen him safely off Things have prospered with us to such a degree that he has been extravagant enough to give me the use for the summer of a bonnie little nag and an antiquated vehicle and I have learned to drive To be sure I broke one of the shafts of the poor old thing the first time I ventured forth alone and the other day nearly upset my cargo of children in a pond where I was silly enough to undertake to water my horse But Ernest as usual had patience with me and begged me to spend as much time as possible in driving about with the children It is a new experience and I enjoy it quite as much as he hoped I should Helen is not with us she has spent the whole summer with Martha for Martha poor thing is suffering terribly from rheumatism and is almost entirely helpless I am so sorry for her after so many years of vigorous health how hard it must be to endure this pain With this drawback we have had a delightful summer not one sick day nor one sick night With no baby to keep me awake I sleep straight through as Raymond says and wake in the morning refreshed and cheerful We shall have to go home soon how cruel it seems to bring up children in a great city Yet what can be done about it Wherever there are men and women there must be children what a howling wilderness either city or country would be without them The only drawback on my felicity is the separation from Ernest which becomes more painful every year to us both God has blessed our married life it has had its waves and its billows but thanks unto Him it has at last settled down into a calm sea of untroubled peace While I was secretly braiding my dear husband for giving so attention to his profession as to neglect me and my children he was becoming every day more the ideal of a physician cool calm thoughtful studious ready to sacrifice his life at any moment in the interests of humanity How often I have mistaken his preoccupied air for indifference how many times I have inwardly accused him of coldness when his whole heart and soul were filled with the grave problem of life aye and of death likewise But we understand each other now and I am sure that God dealt wisely and kindly with us when He brought together two such opposite natures No man of my vehement nature could have borne with me as Ernest has done and if he had married a woman as calm as undemonstrative as himself what a strange home his would have been for the nurture of little children But the heart was in him and only wanted to be waked up and my life has called forth music from his Ah there are no partings and meetings now that leave discords in the remembrance no neglected birthdays no forgotten courtesies It is beautiful to see the thoughtful brow relax in presence of wife and children and to know that ours is at last the happy home I so long sighed for Is the change all in Ernest Is it not possible that I have grown more reasonable less childish and aggravating We are at a farm house Everything is plain but neat and nice I asked missus Brown our hostess the other day if she did not envy me my four little pets she smiled said they were the best children she ever saw and that it was well to have a family if you have means to start them in the world for her part she lived from hand to mouth as it was and was sure she could never stand the worry and care of a house full of young ones But the worry and care is only half the story I said The other half is pure joy and delight Perhaps so to people that are well to do she replied but to poor folks driven to death as we are it s another thing I was telling him yesterday what a mercy it was there wasn t any young ones round under my feet and I could take city boarders and help work off the mortgage on the farm And what did your husband say to that Well he said we were young and hearty and there was no such tearing hurry about the mortgage and that he d give his right hand to have a couple of boys like yours Well Why I said supposing we had a couple of boys they wouonedn t be like yours dressed to look genteel and to have their genteel ways but a pair of wild colts into everything tearing their clothes off their backs and wasting faster than we could earn He said twasn t the clothes twas the flesh and blood he wanted and twasn t no use to argufy about it a man that hadn t got any children wasn t mor n half a man Well says I supposing you had a pack of em what have you got to give em Jest exactly what my father and mother gave me says he two hands to earn their bread with and a welcome you could have heard from Dan to Beersheba I like to hear that I said And I hope many such welcomes will resound in this house Suppose money does come in while little goes out suppose you get possession of the whole farm what then Who will enjoy it with you Who will you leave it to when you die And in your old age who will care for you You seem awful earnest she said Yes I am in earnest I want to see little children adorning every home as flowers adorn every meadow and every wayside I want to see them welcomed to the homes they enter to see their parents grow less and less selfish and more and more loving because they have come I want to see God s precious gifts accepted not frowned upon and refused mister Brown came in so I could say no more But my heart warmed towards him as I looked at his frank good humored face and I should have been glad to give him the right hand of fellowship As it was I could only say a word or two about the beauty of his farm and the scenery of this whole region Yes he said gratified that I appreciated his fields and groves it is a tormented pretty laying farm Part of it was her father s and part of it was my father s there ain t another like it in the country As to the scenery I don t know as I ever looked at it city folks talk a good deal about it but they ve nothing to do but look round Walter came trotting in on two bare white feet and with his shoes in his hand He had had his nap felt as bright and fresh as he looked rosy and I did not wonder at mister Brown s catching him up and clasping his sunburnt arms about the little fellow and pressing him against the warm heart that yearned for nestlings of its own Sept twenty three Home again and the full of the thousand cares that follow the summer and precede the winter But let mothers and wives fret as they will they enjoy these labors of love and would feel lost without them For what amount of leisure ease and comfort would I exchange husband and children and this busy home Martha is better and Helen has come back to us I don t know how we have lived without her so long Her life seems necessary to the completion of every one of ours Some others have fancied it necessary to the completion of theirs but she has not a greed with them We are glad enough to keep her and yet I hope the day will come when she so worthy of it will taste the sweet joys of wifehood and motherhood JANUARY one eighteen fifty three It is not always so easy to practice as it is to preach I can see in my wisdom forty reasons for having four children and no more The comfort of sleeping in peace of having a little time to read and to keep on with my music strength with which to look after Ernest s poor people when they are sick and to tell the truth strength to be bright and fresh and lovable to him all these little joys have been growing very precious to me and now I must give them up I want to do it cheerfully and without a frown But I find I love to have my own way and that at the very moment I was asking God to appoint my work for me I was secretly marking it out for myself It is mortifying to find my will less in harmony with His than I thought it was and that I want to prescribe to Him how I shall spend the time and the health and the strength which are His not mine But I will not rest until till this struggle is over till I can say with a smile Not my will Not my will But Thine We have been this winter one of the happiest families on earth Our love to each other Ernest s and mine though not perfect nothing on earth is has grown less selfish more Christlike it has been sanctified by prayer and by the sorrows we have borne together Then the children have been well and happy and the source of almost unmitigated joy and comfort And Helen s presence in this home her sisterly affection her patience with the children and her influence over them is a benediction for which I cannot be thankful enough How delightful it is to have a sister I think it is not often the case that own sisters have such perfect Christian sympathy with each other as we have Ever since the day she ceased to torment herself with the fear that she was not a child of God and laid aside the sombre garments she had worn so long she has had a peace that has hardly known a cloud She says in a note written me about the time I want you to know my darling sister that the despondency that made my affliction so hard to bear fled before those words of yours which as I have already told you God taught you to speak I do not know whether I was really His child at the time or not I had certainly had an experience very different from yours prayer had never been much more to me than a duty and I had never felt the sweetness of that harmony between God and I the human soul that I now know can take away all the bitterness from the cup of sorrow I knew who can help knowing it that reads God s word that he required submission from His children and that His children gave it no matter what it cost The Bible is full of beautiful expressions of it so are our hymns so are the written lives of all good men and good women and I have seen it in you my dear Katy at the very moment you were accusing yourself of the want of it Entire oneness of the will with the Divine Will seem to me to be the law and the gospel of the Christian life and this evidence of a renewed nature I found wanting in myself At any moment during the three years following James death I would have snatched away from God if I could I was miserably lonely and desolate without him not merely because he had been so much to me but because his loss revealed to me the distance between Christ and my soul All I could do was to go on praying year after year in a dreary hopeless way that I might learn to say as David did I opened not my mouth because Thou didst it When you suggested that instead of trying to figure out whether I had loved God I should begin to love Him now light broke in upon my soul I gave myself to Him that instant and as soon as I could get away by myself I fell upon my knees and gave myself up to the sense of His sovereignty for the first time in my life Then too I looked at my light affliction and at the weight of glory side by side and thanked Him that through the one He had revealed to me the other Katy I know the human heart is deceitful above all things but I think it would be a dishonor to God to doubt that He then revealed Himself to me as He doth not to the world and that the sweet peace I then found in yielding to Him will be more or less mine so long as I live Oh if all sufferers could learn what I have learned that every broken heart could be healed as mine has been healed My precious sister cannot we make this one part of our mission on earth to pray for every sorrow stricken soul and whenever we have influence over such to lead it to honor God by instant obedience to His will whatever that may be I have dishonored Him by years of rebellious carefully nursed sorrow I want to honor Him now by years of resignation and grateful joy Reading this letter over in my present mood has done me good More beautiful faith in God than Helen s I have never seen let me have it too May this prayer which under the inspiration of the moment I can offer without a misgiving become the habitual deep seated desire of my soul Bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ Take what I cannot give my heart body thoughts time abilities money health strength nights days youth age and spend them in Thy service O my crucified Master Redeemer God Oh let these not be mere words Whom have I in heaven but Thee and there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison of Thee My heart is athirst for God for the living God When shall I come and appear before God Chapter twenty seven XXVII AUGUST one I HAVE just written to missus Brown to know whether she will take us for the rest of the summer A certain little man not a very old little man either has kept us in town till now Since he has come we are all very glad of him though he came on his own invitation brought no wardrobe with him does not pay for his board never speaks a word takes no notice of us and wants more waiting on than any one else in the house The children are full of delicious curiosity about him and overwhelm him with presents of the most heterogeneous character Sweet Briar Farm AUG nine We got there this afternoon bag and baggage I had not said a word to missus Brown about the addition to our family circle knowing she had plenty of room and as we alighted from the carriage I snatched my baby from his nurse s arms and ran gaily up the walk with him in mine If this splendid fellow doesn t convert her nothing will I said to myself At that instant what should I see but missus Brown running to meet me with a boy in her arms exactly like mister Brown only not quite six feet long and not sun burnt There I cried holding up my little old man There said she holding up hers We laughed till we cried she took my baby and I took hers after looking at him I liked mine better than ever after looking at mine she was perfectly satisfied with hers We got into the house at last that is to say we mothers did the children darted through it and out of the door that led to the fields and woods and vanished in the twinkling of an eye missus Brown had always been a pretty woman with bright eyes shining well kept hair and a color in her cheeks like the rose which had given its name to her farm But there was now a new beauty in her face the mysterious and sacred sufferings and joys of maternity had given it thought and feeling I had no idea I should be so fond of a baby she said kissing it whenever she stopped to put in a comma but I don t know how I ever got along without one He s off at work nearly the whole day and when I had got through with mine and had put on my afternoon dress and was ready to sit down you can t think how lonesome it was But now by the time I am dressed baby is ready to go out to get the air he knows the minute he sees me bring out his little hat that he is going to see his father and he s awful fond of his father Though that isn t so strange either for his father s awful fond of him All his little ways are so pretty and he never cries unless he s hungry or tired Tell mother a pretty story now yes mother hears bless his little heart Then when mister Brown came home to his supper his face was a sight to see as he caught sight of me at my open window and came to it with the child s white arms clinging to his neck looking as happy and as bashful as a girl You see she must needs go to quartering this bouncing young one on to me he said as if I didn t have to work hard enough before Well maybe he ll get his feed off the farm we ll see what we can do Mamma Una whispered as he went off his facsimile to kiss it rapturously behind a woodpile do you think missus Brown s baby very pretty Which was so mild a way of suggesting the fact of the case that I kissed her without trying to hide my amusement AUG ten After being cooped up in town so large a part of the summer the children are nearly wild with delight at being in the country once more Even our demure Una skips about with a buoyancy I have never seen in her she never has her ill turns when out of the city and I wish for her sake we could always live here As to Raymond and Walter I never pretend to see them except at their meals and their bedtime they just live outdoors following the men at their work asking all sorts of absurd questions which mister Brown reports to me every night with shouts of delighted laughter Two gay and gladsome boys they are really good without being priggish I don t think I could stand that People ask me how it happens that my children are all so promptly obedient and so happy As if it chanced that some parents have such children or chanced that some have not I am afraid it is only too true as some one has remarked that this is the age of obedient parents What then will be the future of their children How can they yield to God who have never been taught to yield to human authority And how well fitted will they be to rule their own households who have never learned to rule themselves AUG thirty one This has been one of those cold dismal rainy days which are not infrequent during the month of August So the children have been obliged to give up the open air of which they are so fond and fall back upon what entertainment could be found within the house I have read to them the little journal I kept during the whole life of the brother I am not willing they should forget His quaint and sagacious sayings were delicious to them the history of his first steps his first words sounded to them like a fairy tale And the story of his last steps his last words on earth had for them such a tender charm that there was a cry of disappointment from them all when I closed the little book and told them we should have to wait till we got to heaven before we could know anything more about his precious life How thankful I am that I kept this journal and that I have almost as charming ones about most of my other children What I speedily forgot amid the pressure of cares and of new events is safely written down and will be the source of endless pleasure to them long after the hand that wrote has ceased from its labors and lies inactive and at rest Ah it is a blessed thing to be a mother SEPTEMBER one This baby of mine is certainly the sweetest and best I ever had I feel an inexpressible tenderness for it which I cannot quite explain to myself for I have loved them all dearly most dearly Perhaps it is so with all mothers perhaps they all grow more loving more forbearing more patient as they grow older and yearn over these helpless little ones with an ever increasing yet chastened delight One cannot help sheltering their tender infancy who will so soon pass forth to fight the battle of life each one waging an invisible warfare against invisible foes How thankfully we would fight it for them if we might SEPTEMBER twenty The mornings and evenings are very cool now while in the middle of the day it is quite hot Ernest comes to see us very often under the pretense that he can t trust me with so young a baby He is so tender and thoughtful and spoils me so that this world is very bright to me I am a little jealous of it I don t want to be so happy in Ernest or in my children as to forget for one instant that I am a pilgrim and a stranger on earth EVENING There is no danger that I shall Ernest suddenly made his appearance tonight and in a great burst of distress quite unlike anything I ever saw in him revealed to me that he had been feeling the greatest anxiety about me ever since the baby came It is all nonsense I cough to be sure but that it is owing to the varying temperature we always have at this season I shall get over it as soon as we get home I dare say But suppose I should not what then Could I leave this precious little flock uncared for untended Have I faith to believe that if God calls me away from them it will be in love to them I do not know The thought of getting away from the sin that still so easily besets me is very delightful and I have enjoyed so many many such foretastes of the bliss of heaven that I know I should be happy there but then my children all of them under twelve years old I will not choose I dare not My married life has been a beautiful one It is true that sin and folly and sickness and sorrow have marred its perfection but it has been adorned by a love which has never faltered My faults have never alienated Ernest his faults for like other human beings he has them have never overcome my love to him This has been the gift of God in answer to our constant prayer that whatever other bereavement we might have to suffer we might never be bereft of this benediction It has been the glad secret of a happy marriage and I wish I could teach it to every human being who enters upon a state that must bring with it the depth of misery or life s most sacred and mysterious joy OCTOBER six Ernest has let me stay here to see the autumnal foliage in its ravishing beauty for the first perhaps for the last time The woods and fields and groves are lighting up my very soul It seems as if autumn had caught the inspiration and the glow of summer had hidden its floral beauty its gorgeous sunsets and its bow of promise in its heart of hearts and was now flashing it forth upon the world with a lavish and opulent hand I can hardly tear myself away and return to the prose of city life But Ernest has come for us and is eager to get us home before colder weather I laugh at his anxiety about his old wife Why need he fancy that this trifling cough is not to give way as it often has done before Dear Ernest I never knew that he loved me so OCTOBER thirty one Ernest s fear that he had let me stay too long in the country does not seem to be justified We went so late that I wanted to indulge the children by staying late So we have only just got home I feel about as well as usual it is true I have a little soreness a bout the chest but it does not signify anything I never was so happy in my husband and children in other words in my home as I am now Life looks very attractive I am glad that I am going to get well But Ernest watches me carefully and want me as a precautionary measure to give up music writing sewing and painting the very things that occupy me and lead an idle useless life for a time I cannot refuse what he asks so tenderly and as a personal favor to himself Yet I should like to fill the remaining pages of my journal I never like to leave things incomplete JUNE one eighteen fifty eight I wrote that seven years ago little dreaming how long it would be before I should use a pen Seven happy years ago I suppose that some who have known what my outward life has been during this period would think of me as a mere object of pity There has certainly been suffering and deprivation enough to justify the sympathy of my dear husband and children and the large circle of friends who have rallied about us How little we knew we had so many God has dealt very tenderly with me I was not stricken down by sudden disease nor were the things I delighted in all taken away at once There was a gradual loss of strength and gradual increase of suffering and it was only by degrees that I was asked to give up the employments in which I d delighted my household duties my visits to the sick and suffering the society of beloved friends Perhaps Ernest perceived and felt my deprivations sooner than I did his sympathy always seemed to out run my disappointments When I compare him as he is now with what he was when I first knew him I bless God for all the precious lessons He has taught him at my cost There is a tenacity and persistence about his love for me that has made these years almost as wearisome to him as they have been to me As to myself if I had been told what I was to learn through these protracted sufferings I am afraid I should have shrunk back in terror and so have lost all the sweet lessons God proposed to teach me As it is He has led me on step by step answering my prayers in His own way and I cannot bear to have a single human being doubt that it has been a perfect way I love and adore it just as it is Perhaps the suspense has been one of the most trying features of my case Just as I have unclasped my hand from my dear Ernest s just as I have let go my almost frantic hold of my darling children just as heaven opened before me and I fancied my weariness over and my wanderings done just then almost every alarming symptom would disappear and life recall me from the threshold of heaven itself Thus I have been emptied from vessel to vessel til I have learned that he only is truly happy who has no longer a choice of his own and lies passive in God s hand Even now no one can foretell the issue of this sickness We live a day at a time not knowing what shall be on the morrow But whether I live or die my happiness is secure and so I believe is of my beloved ones This is a true picture of our home A sick room full of the suffering ravages the body but cannot touch the soul A worn wasting mother ministered unto by a devoted husband and by unselfish Christian children Some of the peace of God if not all of it shines in every face is heard in every tone It is a home that typifies and foreshadows the home that is perfect and eternal Our dear Helen has been given us for this emergency Is it not strange that seeing our domestic life should have awakened in her some yearnings for a home and a heart and children of her own She has said that there was a weary point in her life when she made up her mind that she was never to know these joys But she accepted her lot gracefully I do not know any other word that describes so well the beautiful offering she made of her life to God and then to us He accepted it and as given her all the cares and responsibilities of domestic life without the transcendent joys that sustain the wife and the mother She has been all in all to our children and God has been all in all to her And she is happy in His service and in our love JUNE twenty It took me nearly two weeks to write the above at intervals as my strength allowed Ernest has consented to my finishing this volume of which so few pages yet remain And he let me see a dear old friend who came all the way from my native town to see me doctor Eaton our family physician as long as I could remember He is of an advanced age but full of vigor his eye bright and with a healthful glow on his cheek But he says he is waiting and longing for his summons home About that home we had a delightful talk together that did my very heart good Then he made me tell him about this long sickness and the years of frail health and some of the sorrows through which I had toiled Ah these lovely children are explained now he said Do you really think I asked that it has been good for my children to have a feeble afflicted mother Yes I really think so A disciplined mother disciplined children This comforting thought is one of the last drops in a cup of felicity already full JUNE two Another Sunday and all at church except my darling Una who keeps watch over her mother These Sundays when I have had them each alone in turn have been blessed days to them and to me Surely this is some compensation for what they lose in me of health and vigor I know the state of each soul as far as it can be known and have every reason to believe that my children all love my Saviour and are trying to live for Him I have learned at last not to despise the day of small things to cherish the tenderest blossom and to expect my dear ones to be imperfect before they become perfect Christians Una is a sweet composed young girl now eighteen years old and what can I say more of the love her brothers bear her than this they never tease her She has long ceased asking why she must have delicate health when so many others of her age are full of animal life and vigor but stands in her lot and place doing what she can suffering what she must with a meekness that makes her lovely in my eyes and that I am sure unites her closely to Christ JUNE twenty seven It was Raymond s turn to stay with me today He opened his heart to me more freely than he had ever done before Mamma he began if papa is willing I have made up my mind that is to say if I get decently good to go on a mission I said playfully And mamma s consent is not to be asked No he said getting hold of what there is left of my hand I know you wouldn t say a word Don t you remember telling me once when I was a little boy that I might go and welcome And don t you remember I returned that you cried for joy and then relieved your mind still farther by walking on your hands with your feet in the air We both laughed heartily at this remembrance and then I said My dear boy you know your fathers plan for you Yes I know he expects me to study with him and take his place in the world And it is a very important place His countenance fell as he fancied I was not entering heartily into his wishes Dear Raymond I went on I gave you to God long before you gave yourself to Him If He can make you useful in your own or in other lands I bless His name Whether I live to see you a man or not I hope you will work in the Lord s vineyard wherever He calls I never asked anything but usefulness in all my prayers for you never once His eyes filled with tears he kissed me and walked away to the window to compose himself My poor dear lovable loving boy He has all his mother s trials and struggles to contend with but what matter it if they bring him the same peace JUNE thirty Everybody wonders to see me once more interested in my long closed Journal and becoming able to see the dear friends from whom I have been in a measure cut off We cannot ask the meaning of this remarkable increase of strength I have no wish to choose But I have come to the last page of my Journal and living or dying shall write in this volume no more It closes upon a life of much childishness and great sinfulness whose record makes me blush with shame but I no longer need to relieve my heart with seeking sympathy in its unconscious pages nor do I believe it well to go on analyzing it as I have done I have had large experience of both joy and sorrow I have the nakedness and the emptiness and I have seen the beauty and sweetness of life What I say now let me say to Jesus What time and strength I used to spend in writing here let me spend in praying for all men for all sufferers who are out of the way for all whom I love And their name is Legion for I love everybody Yes I love everybody That crowning joy has come to me at last Christ is in my soul He is mine I am as conscious of it as that my husband and children are mine and His Spirit flows from mine in the calm peace of a river whose banks are green with grass and glad with flowers If I die it will be to leave a wearied and worn body and a sinful soul to go joyfully to be with Christ to weary and to sin no more If I live I shall find much blessed work to do for Him So living or dying I shall be the Lord s But I wish oh how earnestly that whether I go or stay I could inspire some lives with the joy that is now mine For many years I have been rich in faith rich in an unfaltering confidence that I was beloved of my God and Saviour But something was wanting I was ever groping for a mysterious grace the want of which made me often sorrowful in the very midst of my most sacred joy imperfect when I most longed for perfection It was that personal love to Christ of which my precious mother so often spoke to me which she often urged me to seek upon my knees If I had known then as I know now what this priceless treasure could be to a sinful human soul I would have sold all that I had to buy the field wherein it lay hidden But not till I was shut up to prayer and to the study of Gods word by the loss of earthly joys sickness destroying the flavor of them all did I begin to penetrate the mystery that is learned under the cross And wondrous as it is how simple is this mystery To love Christ and to know that I love Him this is all And when I entered upon the sacred yet oft times homely duties of married life if this love had been mine how would that life have been transfigured The petty faults of my husband under which I chafed would not have moved me I should have welcomed Martha and her father to my home and made them happy there I should have had no conflicts with my servants shown no petulance to my children For it would not have been I who spoke and acted but Christ who lived in me Alas I have had less than seven years in which to atone for a sinful wasted past and to live a new and a Christ like life If I am to have yet more thanks be to Him who has given me the victory that Life will be Love Not the love that rests in the contemplation and adoration of its object but the love that gladdens sweetens solaces other lives O gifts of gifts O grace of faith My God how can it be That Thou who hast discerning love Shouldst give that gift to me How many hearts thou mightst have had More innocent than mine How many souls more worthy far Of that sweet touch of Thine Oh grace into unlikeliest hearts It is thy boast to come The glory of Thy light to find In darkest spots a home Oh happy happy that I am If thou canst be O faith The treasure that thou art in life What wilt thou be in death STEPPING WESTWARD WHILE my fellow traveler and I were walking by the side of Loch Katrine one fine evening after sunset in our road to a hut where in the course of our tour we had been hospitably entertained some weeks before we met in one of the loneliest parts of that solitary region two well dressed women one of whom said to us by way of greeting What you are stepping westward What you are stepping westward Yea Twould be a wildish destiny If we who thus together roam In a strange land and far from home Were in this place the guests of chance Yet who would stop or fear to advance Though home or shelter he had none With such a sky to lead him on The dewy ground was dark and cold Behind all gloomy to behold And stepping westward seemed to be A kind of heavenly destiny I liked the greeting twas a sound Of something without place and bound And seemed to give me spiritual right To travel through that region bright The voice was soft and she who spake Was walking by her native lake The salutation had to me The very sound of courtesy Its power was felt and while my eye Was fixed upon the glowing sky The echo of the voice enwrought A human sweetness with the thought Of traveling through the world that lay Before me in my endless way WORDSWORTH The End End of the Project Gutenberg Etext of Stepping Heavenward by missus
