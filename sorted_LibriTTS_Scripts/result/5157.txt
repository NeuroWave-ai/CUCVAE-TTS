HOW I FOUND LIVINGSTONE Produced by Geoffrey Cowling HOW I FOUND LIVINGSTONE Travels Adventures and Discoveries in Central Africa including four months residence with doctor Livingstone By Sir Henry M Stanley G C B Abridged CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY MY INSTRUCTIONS TO FIND AND RELIEVE LIVINGSTONE On the sixteenth day of October in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty nine I was in Madrid fresh from the carnage at Valencia At ten A M Jacopo at No Calle de la Cruz handed me a telegram It read Come to Paris on important business The telegram was from mister James Gordon Bennett jun the young manager of the New York Herald Down came my pictures from the walls of my apartments on the second floor into my trunks went my books and souvenirs my clothes were hastily collected some half washed some from the clothes line half dry and after a couple of hours of hasty hard work my portmanteaus were strapped up and labelled Paris At three P M I was on my way and being obliged to stop at Bayonne a few hours did not arrive at Paris until the following night I went straight to the Grand Hotel and knocked at the door of mister Bennett s room Come in I heard a voice say Entering I found mister Bennett in bed Who are you he asked My name is Stanley I answered Ah yes sit down I have important business on hand for you After throwing over his shoulders his robe de chambre mister Bennett asked Where do you think Livingstone is I really do not know sir Do you think he is alive He may be and he may not be I answered Well I think he is alive and that he can be found and I am going to send you to find him What said I do you really think I can find doctor Livingstone Do you mean me to go to Central Africa Yes I mean that you shall go and find him wherever you may hear that he is and to get what news you can of him and perhaps delivering himself thoughtfully and deliberately the old man may be in want take enough with you to help him should he require it Of course you will act according to your own plans and do what you think best BUT FIND LIVINGSTONE Said I wondering at the cool order of sending one to Central Africa to search for a man whom I in common with almost all other men believed to be dead Have you considered seriously the great expense you are likely to incur on account of this little journey What will it cost he asked abruptly Burton and Speke s journey to Central Africa cost between Lthree thousand and Lfive thousand and I fear it cannot be done under Ltwenty five hundred Well I will tell you what you will do Draw a thousand pounds now and when you have gone through that draw another thousand and when that is spent draw another thousand and when you have finished that draw another thousand and so on but FIND LIVINGSTONE Surprised but not confused at the order for I knew that mister Bennett when once he had made up his mind was not easily drawn aside from his purpose I yet thought seeing it was such a gigantic scheme that he had not quite considered in his own mind the pros and cons of the case I said I have heard that should your father die you would sell the Herald and retire from business Whoever told you that is wrong for there is not money enough in New York city to buy the New York Herald My father has made it a great paper but I mean to make it greater I mean that it shall be a newspaper in the true sense of the word I mean that it shall publish whatever news will be interesting to the world at no matter what cost After that said I I have nothing more to say Do you mean me to go straight on to Africa to search for doctor Livingstone No I wish you to go to the inauguration of the Suez Canal first and then proceed up the Nile I hear Baker is about starting for Upper Egypt Find out what you can about his expedition and as you go up describe as well as possible whatever is interesting for tourists and then write up a guide a practical one for Lower Egypt tell us about whatever is worth seeing and how to see it Then you might as well go to Jerusalem I hear Captain Warren is making some interesting discoveries there Then visit Constantinople and find out about that trouble between the Khedive and the Sultan Then let me see you might as well visit the Crimea and those old battle grounds Then go across the Caucasus to the Caspian Sea I hear there is a Russian expedition bound for Khiva From thence you may get through Persia to India you could write an interesting letter from Persepolis Bagdad will be close on your way to India suppose you go there and write up something about the Euphrates Valley Railway Then when you have come to India you can go after Livingstone Probably you will hear by that time that Livingstone is on his way to Zanzibar but if not go into the interior and find him If alive get what news of his discoveries you can and if you find he is dead bring all possible proofs of his being dead That is all Good night and God be with you Good night Sir I said what it is in the power of human nature to do I will do and on such an errand as I go upon God will be with me I lodged with young Edward King who is making such a name in New England He was just the man who would have delighted to tell the journal he was engaged upon what young mister Bennett was doing and what errand I was bound upon I should have liked to exchange opinions with him upon the probable results of my journey but I dared not do so Though oppressed with the great task before me I had to appear as if only going to be present at the Suez Canal Young King followed me to the express train bound for Marseilles and at the station we parted he to go and read the newspapers at Bowles Reading room I to Central Africa and who knows There is no need to recapitulate what I did before going to Central Africa I went up the Nile and saw mister Higginbotham chief engineer in Baker s Expedition at Philae and was the means of preventing a duel between him and a mad young Frenchman who wanted to fight mister Higginbotham with pistols because that gentleman resented the idea of being taken for an Egyptian through wearing a fez cap I had a talk with captain Warren at Jerusalem and descended one of the pits with a sergeant of engineers to see the marks of the Tyrian workmen on the foundation stones of the Temple of Solomon I visited the mosques of Stamboul with the Minister Resident of the United States and the American Consul General I travelled over the Crimean battle grounds with Kinglake s glorious books for reference in my hand I dined with the widow of General Liprandi at Odessa I saw the Arabian traveller Palgrave at Trebizond and Baron Nicolay the Civil Governor of the Caucasus at Tiflis I lived with the Russian Ambassador while at Teheran and wherever I went through Persia I received the most hospitable welcome from the gentlemen of the Indo European Telegraph Company and following the examples of many illustrious men I wrote my name upon one of the Persepolitan monuments In the month of August eighteen seventy I arrived in India On the twelfth of October I sailed on the barque Polly from Bombay to Mauritius As the Polly was a slow sailer the passage lasted thirty seven days On board this barque was a William Lawrence Farquhar hailing from Leith Scotland in the capacity of first mate He was an excellent navigator and thinking he might be useful to me I employed him his pay to begin from the date we should leave Zanzibar for Bagamoyo As there was no opportunity of getting to Zanzibar direct I took ship to Seychelles Three or four days after arriving at Mahe one of the Seychelles group I was fortunate enough to get a passage for myself William Lawrence Farquhar and an Arab boy from Jerusalem who was to act as interpreter on board an American whaling vessel bound for Zanzibar at which port we arrived on the sixth of January eighteen seventy one I have skimmed over my travels thus far because these do not concern the reader They led over many lands but this book is only a narrative of my search after Livingstone the great African traveller It is an Icarian flight of journalism I confess some even have called it Quixotic but this is a word I can now refute as will be seen before the reader arrives at the Finis I have used the word soldiers in this book The armed escort a traveller engages to accompany him into East Africa is composed of free black men natives of Zanzibar or freed slaves from the interior who call themselves askari an Indian name which translated means soldiers They are armed and equipped like soldiers though they engage themselves also as servants but it would be more pretentious in me to call them servants than to use the word soldiers and as I have been more in the habit of calling them soldiers than my watuma servants this habit has proved too much to be overcome I have therefore allowed the word soldiers to appear accompanied however with this apology But it must be remembered that I am writing a narrative of my own adventures and travels and that until I meet Livingstone I presume the greatest interest is attached to myself my marches my troubles my thoughts and my impressions Yet though I may sometimes write my expedition or my caravan it by no means follows that I arrogate to myself this right For it must be distinctly understood that it is the New York Herald Expedition and that I am only charged with its command by mister James Gordon Bennett the proprietor of the New York Herald as a salaried employ of that gentleman One thing more I have adopted the narrative form of relating the story of the search on account of the greater interest it appears to possess over the diary form and I think that in this manner I avoid the great fault of repetition for which some travellers have been severely criticised CHAPTER II ZANZIBAR On the morning of the sixth January eighteen seventy one we were sailing through the channel that separates the fruitful island of Zanzibar from Africa The high lands of the continent loomed like a lengthening shadow in the grey of dawn The island lay on our left distant but a mile coming out of its shroud of foggy folds bit by bit as the day advanced until it finally rose clearly into view as fair in appearance as the fairest of the gems of creation It appeared low but not flat there were gentle elevations cropping hither and yon above the languid but graceful tops of the cocoa trees that lined the margin of the island and there were depressions visible at agreeable intervals to indicate where a cool gloom might be found by those who sought relief from a hot sun With the exception of the thin line of sand over which the sap green water rolled itself with a constant murmur and moan the island seemed buried under one deep stratum of verdure The noble bosom of the strait bore several dhows speeding in and out of the bay of Zanzibar with bellying sails Towards the south above the sea line of the horizon there appeared the naked masts of several large ships and to the east of these a dense mass of white flat topped houses This was Zanzibar the capital of the island which soon resolved itself into a pretty large and compact city with all the characteristics of Arab architecture Above some of the largest houses lining the bay front of the city streamed the blood red banner of the Sultan Seyd Burghash and the flags of the American English North German Confederation and French Consulates In the harbor were thirteen large ships four Zanzibar men of war one English man of war the Nymphe two American one French one Portuguese two English and two German merchantmen besides numerous dhows hailing from Johanna and Mayotte of the Comoro Islands dhows from Muscat and Cutch traders between India the Persian Gulf and Zanzibar It was with the spirit of true hospitality and courtesy that captain Francis R Webb United States Consul formerly of the United States Navy received me Had this gentleman not rendered me such needful service I must have condescended to take board and lodging at a house known as Charley s called after the proprietor a Frenchman who has won considerable local notoriety for harboring penniless itinerants and manifesting a kindly spirit always though hidden under such a rugged front or I should have been obliged to pitch my double clothed American drill tent on the sandbeach of this tropical island which was by no means a desirable thing But captain Webb s opportune proposal to make his commodious and comfortable house my own to enjoy myself with the request that I would call for whatever I might require obviated all unpleasant alternatives One day s life at Zanzibar made me thoroughly conscious of my ignorance respecting African people and things in general I imagined I had read Burton and Speke through fairly well and that consequently I had penetrated the meaning the full importance and grandeur of the work I was about to be engaged upon But my estimates for instance based upon book information were simply ridiculous fanciful images of African attractions were soon dissipated anticipated pleasures vanished and all crude ideas began to resolve themselves into shape I strolled through the city My general impressions are of crooked narrow lanes white washed houses mortar plastered streets in the clean quarter of seeing alcoves on each side with deep recesses with a fore ground of red turbaned Banyans and a back ground of flimsy cottons prints calicoes domestics and what not or of floors crowded with ivory tusks or of dark corners with a pile of unginned and loose cotton or of stores of crockery nails cheap Brummagem ware tools c in what I call the Banyan quarter of streets smelling very strong in fact exceedingly malodorous with steaming yellow and black bodies and woolly heads sitting at the doors of miserable huts chatting laughing bargaining scolding with a compound smell of hides tar filth and vegetable refuse in the negro quarter of streets lined with tall solid looking houses flat roofed of great carved doors with large brass knockers with baabs sitting cross legged watching the dark entrance to their masters houses of a shallow sea inlet with some dhows canoes boats an odd steam tub or two leaning over on their sides in a sea of mud which the tide has just left behind it of a place called M nazi Moya One Cocoa tree whither Europeans wend on evenings with most languid steps to inhale the sweet air that glides over the sea while the day is dying and the red sun is sinking westward of a few graves of dead sailors who paid the forfeit of their lives upon arrival in this land of a tall house wherein lives doctor Tozer Missionary Bishop of Central Africa and his school of little Africans and of many other things which got together into such a tangle that I had to go to sleep lest I should never be able to separate the moving images the Arab from the African the African from the Banyan the Banyan from the Hindi the Hindi from the European c Zanzibar is the Bagdad the Ispahan the Stamboul if you like of East Africa It is the great mart which invites the ivory traders from the African interior To this market come the gum copal the hides the orchilla weed the timber and the black slaves from Africa Bagdad had great silk bazaars Zanzibar has her ivory bazaars Bagdad once traded in jewels Zanzibar trades in gum copal Stamboul imported Circassian and Georgian slaves Zanzibar imports black beauties from Uhiyow Ugindo Ugogo Unyamwezi and Galla The same mode of commerce obtains here as in all Mohammedan countries nay the mode was in vogue long before Moses was born The Arab never changes He brought the custom of his forefathers with him when he came to live on this island He is as much of an Arab here as at Muscat or Bagdad wherever he goes to live he carries with him his harem his religion his long robe his shirt his slippers and his dagger If he penetrates Africa not all the ridicule of the negroes can make him change his modes of life Yet the land has not become Oriental the Arab has not been able to change the atmosphere The land is semi African in aspect the city is but semi Arabian To a new comer into Africa the Muscat Arabs of Zanzibar are studies There is a certain empressement about them which we must admire They are mostly all travellers There are but few of them who have not been in many dangerous positions as they penetrated Central Africa in search of the precious ivory and their various experiences have given their features a certain unmistakable air of self reliance or of self sufficiency there is a calm resolute defiant independent air about them which wins unconsciously one s respect The stories that some of these men could tell I have often thought would fill many a book of thrilling adventures For the half castes I have great contempt They are neither black nor white neither good nor bad neither to be admired nor hated They are all things at all times they are always fawning on the great Arabs and always cruel to those unfortunates brought under their yoke If I saw a miserable half starved negro I was always sure to be told he belonged to a half caste Cringing and hypocritical cowardly and debased treacherous and mean I have always found him He seems to be for ever ready to fall down and worship a rich Arab but is relentless to a poor black slave When he swears most you may be sure he lies most and yet this is the breed which is multiplied most at Zanzibar The Banyan is a born trader the beau ideal of a sharp money making man Money flows to his pockets as naturally as water down a steep No pang of conscience will prevent him from cheating his fellow man He excels a Jew and his only rival in a market is a Parsee an Arab is a babe to him It is worth money to see him labor with all his energy soul and body to get advantage by the smallest fraction of a coin over a native Possibly the native has a tusk and it may weigh a couple of frasilahs but though the scales indicate the weight and the native declares solemnly that it must be more than two frasilahs yet our Banyan will asseverate and vow that the native knows nothing whatever about it and that the scales are wrong he musters up courage to lift it it is a mere song not much more than a frasilah Come he will say close man take the money and go thy way Art thou mad If the native hesitates he will scream in a fury he pushes him about spurns the ivory with contemptuous indifference never was such ado about nothing but though he tells the astounded native to be up and going he never intends the ivory shall leave his shop The Banyans exercise of all other classes most influence on the trade of Central Africa With the exception of a very few rich Arabs almost all other traders are subject to the pains and penalties which usury imposes A trader desirous to make a journey into the interior whether for slaves or ivory gum copal or orchilla weed proposes to a Banyan to advance him five thousand dollars at fifty sixty or seventy per cent interest The Banyan is safe enough not to lose whether the speculation the trader is engaged upon pays or not An experienced trader seldom loses or if he has been unfortunate through no deed of his own he does not lose credit with the help of the Banyan he is easily set on his feet again We will suppose for the sake of illustrating how trade with the interior is managed that the Arab conveys by his caravan five thousand dollars s worth of goods into the interior At Unyanyembe the goods are worth ten thousand dollars at Ujiji they are worth fifteen thousand dollars they have trebled in price Five doti or seven dollars fifty cents will purchase a slave in the markets of Ujiji that will fetch in Zanzibar thirty dollars Ordinary menslaves may be purchased for six dollars which would sell for twenty five dollars on the coast We will say he purchases slaves to the full extent of his means after deducting fifteen hundred dollars expenses of carriage to Ujiji and back viz three thousand five hundred dollars the slaves four hundred sixty four in number at seven dollars fifty per head would realize thirteen thousand nine hundred twenty dollars at Zanzibar Again let us illustrate trade in ivory A merchant takes five thousand dollars to Ujiji and after deducting fifteen hundred dollars for expenses to Ujiji and back to Zanzibar has still remaining three thousand five hundred dollars in cloth and beads with which he purchases ivory At Ujiji ivory is bought at twenty dollars the frasilah or thirty five lbs by which he is enabled with three thousand five hundred dollars to collect one hundred seventy five frasilahs which if good ivory is worth about sixty dollars per frasilah at Zanzibar The merchant thus finds that he has realized ten thousand five hundred dollars net profit Arab traders have often done better than this but they almost always have come back with an enormous margin of profit The next people to the Banyans in power in Zanzibar are the Mohammedan Hindis Really it has been a debateable subject in my mind whether the Hindis are not as wickedly determined to cheat in trade as the Banyans But if I have conceded the palm to the latter it has been done very reluctantly This tribe of Indians can produce scores of unconscionable rascals where they can show but one honest merchant One of the honestest among men white or black red or yellow is a Mohammedan Hindi called Tarya Topan Among the Europeans at Zanzibar he has become a proverb for honesty and strict business integrity He is enormously wealthy owns several ships and dhows and is a prominent man in the councils of Seyd Burghash Tarya has many children two or three of whom are grown up sons whom he has reared up even as he is himself But Tarya is but a representative of an exceedingly small minority The Arabs the Banyans and the Mohammedan Hindis represent the higher and the middle classes These classes own the estates the ships and the trade To these classes bow the half caste and the negro The next most important people who go to make up the mixed population of this island are the negroes They consist of the aborigines Wasawahili Somalis Comorines Wanyamwezi and a host of tribal representatives of Inner Africa To a white stranger about penetrating Africa it is a most interesting walk through the negro quarters of the Wanyamwezi and the Wasawahili For here he begins to learn the necessity of admitting that negroes are men like himself though of a different colour that they have passions and prejudices likes and dislikes sympathies and antipathies tastes and feelings in common with all human nature The sooner he perceives this fact and adapts himself accordingly the easier will be his journey among the several races of the interior The more plastic his nature the more prosperous will be his travels Though I had lived some time among the negroes of our Southern States my education was Northern and I had met in the United States black men whom I was proud to call friends I was thus prepared to admit any black man possessing the attributes of true manhood or any good qualities to my friendship even to a brotherhood with myself and to respect him for such as much as if he were of my own colour and race Neither his colour nor any peculiarities of physiognomy should debar him with me from any rights he could fairly claim as a man Have these men these black savages from pagan Africa I asked myself the qualities which make man loveable among his fellows Can these men these barbarians appreciate kindness or feel resentment like myself was my mental question as I travelled through their quarters and observed their actions Need I say that I was much comforted in observing that they were as ready to be influenced by passions by loves and hates as I was myself that the keenest observation failed to detect any great difference between their nature and my own The negroes of the island probably number two thirds of the entire population They compose the working class whether enslaved or free Those enslaved perform the work required on the plantations the estates and gardens of the landed proprietors or perform the work of carriers whether in the country or in the city Outside the city they may be seen carrying huge loads on their heads as happy as possible not because they are kindly treated or that their work is light but because it is their nature to be gay and light hearted because they have conceived neither joys nor hopes which may not be gratified at will nor cherished any ambition beyond their reach and therefore have not been baffled in their hopes nor known disappointment Within the city negro carriers may be heard at all hours in couples engaged in the transportation of clove bags boxes of merchandise c from store to godown and from go down to the beach singing a kind of monotone chant for the encouragement of each other and for the guiding of their pace as they shuffle through the streets with bare feet You may recognise these men readily before long as old acquaintances by the consistency with which they sing the tunes they have adopted Several times during a day have I heard the same couple pass beneath the windows of the Consulate delivering themselves of the same invariable tune and words Some might possibly deem the songs foolish and silly but they had a certain attraction for me and I considered that they were as useful as anything else for the purposes they were intended The town of Zanzibar situate on the south western shore of the island contains a population of nearly one hundred thousand inhabitants that of the island altogether I would estimate at not more than two hundred thousand inhabitants including all races The greatest number of foreign vessels trading with this port are American principally from New York and Salem After the American come the German then come the French and English They arrive loaded with American sheeting brandy gunpowder muskets beads English cottons brass wire china ware and other notions and depart with ivory gum copal cloves hides cowries sesamum pepper and cocoa nut oil The value of the exports from this port is estimated at three million dollars and the imports from all countries at three million five hundred thousand dollars The Europeans and Americans residing in the town of Zanzibar are either Government officials independent merchants or agents for a few great mercantile houses in Europe and America The climate of Zanzibar is not the most agreeable in the world I have heard Americans and Europeans condemn it most heartily I have also seen nearly one half of the white colony laid up in one day from sickness A noxious malaria is exhaled from the shallow inlet of Malagash and the undrained filth the garbage offal dead mollusks dead pariah dogs dead cats all species of carrion remains of men and beasts unburied assist to make Zanzibar a most unhealthy city and considering that it it ought to be most healthy nature having pointed out to man the means and having assisted him so far it is most wonderful that the ruling prince does not obey the dictates of reason The bay of Zanzibar is in the form of a crescent and on the south western horn of it is built the city On the east Zanzibar is bounded almost entirely by the Malagash Lagoon an inlet of the sea It penetrates to at least two hundred and fifty yards of the sea behind or south of Shangani Point Were these two hundred and fifty yards cut through by a ten foot ditch and the inlet deepened slightly Zanzibar would become an island of itself and what wonders would it not effect as to health and salubrity I have never heard this suggestion made but it struck me that the foreign consuls resident at Zanzibar might suggest this work to the Sultan and so get the credit of having made it as healthy a place to live in as any near the equator But apropos of this I remember what captain Webb the American Consul told me on my first arrival when I expressed to him my wonder at the apathy and inertness of men born with the indomitable energy which characterises Europeans and Americans of men imbued with the progressive and stirring instincts of the white people who yet allow themselves to dwindle into pallid phantoms of their kind into hypochondriacal invalids into hopeless believers in the deadliness of the climate with hardly a trace of that daring and invincible spirit which rules the world Oh said captain Webb it is all very well for you to talk about energy and all that kind of thing but I assure you that a residence of four or five years on this island among such people as are here would make you feel that it was a hopeless task to resist the influence of the example by which the most energetic spirits are subdued and to which they must submit in time sooner or later We were all terribly energetic when we first came here and struggled bravely to make things go on as we were accustomed to have them at home but we have found that we were knocking our heads against granite walls to no purpose whatever These fellows the Arabs the Banyans and the Hindis you can t make them go faster by ever so much scolding and praying and in a very short time you see the folly of fighting against the unconquerable Be patient and don t fret that is my advice or you won t live long here There were three or four intensely busy men though at Zanzibar who were out at all hours of the day I know one an American I fancy I hear the quick pit pat of his feet on the pavement beneath the Consulate his cheery voice ringing the salutation Yambo to every one he met and he had lived at Zanzibar twelve years I know another one of the sturdiest of Scotchmen a most pleasant mannered and unaffected man sincere in whatever he did or said who has lived at Zanzibar several years subject to the infructuosities of the business he has been engaged in as well as to the calor and ennui of the climate who yet presents as formidable a front as ever to the apathetic native of Zanzibar No man can charge captain H C Fraser formerly of the Indian Navy with being apathetic I might with ease give evidence of the industry of others but they are all my friends and they are all good The American English German and French residents have ever treated me with a courtesy and kindness I am not disposed to forget Taken as a body it would be hard to find a more generous or hospitable colony of white men in any part of the world CHAPTER III ORGANIZATION OF THE EXPEDITION I was totally ignorant of the interior and it was difficult at first to know what I needed in order to take an Expedition into Central Africa Time was precious also and much of it could not be devoted to inquiry and investigation In a case like this it would have been a godsend I thought had either of the three gentlemen Captains Burton Speke or Grant given some information on these points had they devoted a chapter upon How to get ready an Expedition for Central Africa The purpose of this chapter then is to relate how I set about it that other travellers coming after me may have the benefit of my experience These are some of the questions I asked myself as I tossed on my bed at night How much money is required How many pagazis or carriers How many soldiers How much cloth How many beads How much wire What kinds of cloth are required for the different tribes Ever so many questions to myself brought me no clearer the exact point I wished to arrive at I scribbled over scores of sheets of paper made estimates drew out lists of material calculated the cost of keeping one hundred men for one year at so many yards of different kinds of cloth et cetera I studied Burton Speke and Grant in vain A good deal of geographical ethnological and other information appertaining to the study of Inner Africa was obtainable but information respecting the organization of an expedition requisite before proceeding to Africa was not in any book The Europeans at Zanzibar knew as little as possible about this particular point There was not one white man at Zanzibar who could tell how many dotis a day a force of one hundred men required to buy food for one day on the road Neither indeed was it their business to know But what should I do at all at all This was a grand question I decided it were best to hunt up an Arab merchant who had been engaged in the ivory trade or who was fresh from the interior Sheikh Hashid was a man of note and of wealth in Zanzibar He had himself despatched several caravans into the interior and was necessarily acquainted with several prominent traders who came to his house to gossip about their adventures and gains He was also the proprietor of the large house captain Webb occupied besides he lived across the narrow street which separated his house from the Consulate Of all men Sheikh Hashid was the man to be consulted and he was accordingly invited to visit me at the Consulate From the grey bearded and venerable looking Sheikh I elicited more information about African currency the mode of procedure the quantity and quality of stuffs I required than I had obtained from three months study of books upon Central Africa and from other Arab merchants to whom the ancient Sheikh introduced me I received most valuable suggestions and hints which enabled me at last to organize an Expedition The reader must bear in mind that a traveller requires only that which is sufficient for travel and exploration that a superfluity of goods or means will prove as fatal to him as poverty of supplies It is on this question of quality and quantity that the traveller has first to exercise his judgment and discretion My informants gave me to understand that for one hundred men ten doti or forty yards of cloth per diem would suffice for food The proper course to pursue I found was to purchase two thousand doti of American sheeting one thousand doti of Kaniki and six hundred fifty doti of the coloured cloths such as Barsati a great favourite in Unyamwezi Sohari taken in Ugogo Ismahili Taujiri Joho Shash Rehani Jamdani or Kunguru Cutch blue and pink These were deemed amply sufficient for the subsistence of one hundred men for twelve months Two years at this rate would require four thousand doti sixteen thousand yards of American sheeting two thousand doti eight thousand yards of Kaniki thirteen hundred doti five thousand two hundred yards of mixed coloured cloths This was definite and valuable information to me and excepting the lack of some suggestions as to the quality of the sheeting Kaniki and coloured cloths I had obtained all I desired upon this point Second in importance to the amount of cloth required was the quantity and quality of the beads necessary Beads I was told took the place of cloth currency among some tribes of the interior One tribe preferred white to black beads brown to yellow red to green green to white and so on Thus in Unyamwezi red sami sami beads would readily be taken where all other kinds would be refused black bubu beads though currency in Ugogo were positively worthless with all other tribes the egg sungomazzi beads though valuable in Ujiji and Uguhha would be refused in all other countries the white Merikani beads though good in Ufipa and some parts of Usagara and Ugogo would certainly be despised in Useguhha and Ukonongo Such being the case I was obliged to study closely and calculate the probable stay of an expedition in the several countries so as to be sure to provide a sufficiency of each kind and guard against any great overplus Burton and Speke for instance were obliged to throw away as worthless several hundred fundo of beads For example supposing the several nations of Europe had each its own currency without the means of exchange and supposing a man was about to travel through Europe on foot before starting he would be apt to calculate how many days it would take him to travel through France how many through Prussia Austria and Russia then to reckon the expense he would be likely to incur per day If the expense be set down at a napoleon per day and his journey through France would occupy thirty days the sum required forgoing and returning might be properly set down at sixty napoleons in which case napoleons not being current money in Prussia Austria or Russia it would be utterly useless for him to burden himself with the weight of a couple of thousand napoleons in gold My anxiety on this point was most excruciating Over and over I studied the hard names and measures conned again and again the polysyllables hoping to be able to arrive some time at an intelligible definition of the terms I revolved in my mind the words Mukunguru Ghulabio Sungomazzi Kadunduguru Mutunda Samisami Bubu Merikani Hafde Lunghio Rega and Lakhio until I was fairly beside myself Finally however I came to the conclusion that if I reckoned my requirements at fifty khete or five fundo per day for two years and if I purchased only eleven varieties I might consider myself safe enough The purchase was accordingly made and twenty two sacks of the best species were packed and brought to captain Webb s house ready for transportation to Bagamoyo After the beads came the wire question I discovered after considerable trouble that Nos five and six almost of the thickness of telegraph wire were considered the best numbers for trading purposes While beads stand for copper coins in Africa cloth measures for silver wire is reckoned as gold in the countries beyond the Tan ga ni ka Ten frasilah or three hundred fifty lbs of brass wire my Arab adviser thought would be ample It will be seen that I differ from captain Burton in the spelling of this word as I deem the letter y superfluous Having purchased the cloth the beads and the wire it was with no little pride that I surveyed the comely bales and packages lying piled up row above row in captain Webb s capacious store room Yet my work was not ended it was but beginning there were provisions cooking utensils boats rope twine tents donkeys saddles bagging canvas tar needles tools ammunition guns equipments hatchets medicines bedding presents for chiefs in short a thousand things not yet purchased The ordeal of chaffering and haggling with steel hearted Banyans Hindis Arabs and half castes was most trying For instance I purchased twenty two donkeys at Zanzibar forty dollars and fifty dollars were asked which I had to reduce to fifteen dollars or twenty dollars by an infinite amount of argument worthy I think of a nobler cause As was my experience with the ass dealers so was it with the petty merchants even a paper of pins was not purchased without a five per cent reduction from the price demanded involving of course a loss of much time and patience After collecting the donkeys I discovered there were no pack saddles to be obtained in Zanzibar Donkeys without pack saddles were of no use whatever I invented a saddle to be manufactured by myself and my white man Farquhar wholly from canvas rope and cotton Three or four frasilahs of cotton and ten bolts of canvas were required for the saddles A specimen saddle was made by myself in order to test its efficiency A donkey was taken and saddled and a load of one hundred forty lbs was fastened to it and though the animal a wild creature of Unyamwezi struggled and reared frantic ally not a particle gave way After this experiment Farquhar was set to work to manufacture twenty one more after the same pattern Woollen pads were also purchased to protect the animals from being galled It ought to be mentioned here perhaps that the idea of such a saddle as I manufactured was first derived from the Otago saddle in use among the transport trains of the English army in Abyssinia A man named John William Shaw a native of London England lately third mate of the American ship Nevada applied to me for work Though his discharge from the Nevada was rather suspicious yet he possessed all the requirements of such a man as I needed and was an experienced hand with the palm and needle could cut canvas to fit anything was a pretty good navigator ready and willing so far as his professions went I saw no reason to refuse his services and he was accordingly engaged at three hundred dollars per annum to rank second to William L Farquhar Farquhar was a capital navigator and excellent mathematician was strong energetic and clever The next thing I was engaged upon was to enlist arm and equip a faithful escort of twenty men for the road Johari the chief dragoman of the American Consulate informed me that he knew where certain of Speke s Faithfuls were yet to be found The idea had struck me before that if I could obtain the services of a few men acquainted with the ways of white men and who could induce other good men to join the expedition I was organizing I might consider myself fortunate More especially had I thought of Seedy Mbarak Mombay commonly called Bombay who though his head was woodeny and his hands clumsy was considered to be the faithfulest of the Faithfuls With the aid of the dragoman Johari I secured in a few hours the services of Uledi captain Grant s former valet Ulimengo Baruti Ambari Mabruki Muinyi Mabruki Bull headed Mabruki captain Burton s former unhappy valet five of Speke s Faithfuls When I asked them if they were willing to join another white man s expedition to Ujiji they replied very readily that they were willing to join any brother of Speke s doctor John Kirk Her Majesty s Consul at Zanzibar who was present told them that though I was no brother of Speke s I spoke his language This distinction mattered little to them and I heard them with great delight declare their readiness to go anywhere with me or do anything I wished Mombay as they called him or Bombay as we know him had gone to Pemba an island lying north of Zanzibar Uledi was sure Mombay would jump with joy at the prospect of another expedition Johari was therefore commissioned to write to him at Pemba to inform him of the good fortune in store for him On the fourth morning after the letter had been despatched the famous Bombay made his appearance followed in decent order and due rank by the Faithfuls of Speke I looked in vain for the woodeny head and alligator teeth with which his former master had endowed him I saw a slender short man of fifty or thereabouts with a grizzled head an uncommonly high narrow forehead with a very large mouth showing teeth very irregular and wide apart An ugly rent in the upper front row of Bombay s teeth was made with the clenched fist of captain Speke in Uganda when his master s patience was worn out and prompt punishment became necessary That captain Speke had spoiled him with kindness was evident from the fact that Bombay had the audacity to stand up for a boxing match with him But these things I only found out when months afterwards I was called upon to administer punishment to him myself But at his first appearance I was favourably impressed with Bombay though his face was rugged his mouth large his eyes small and his nose flat Salaam aliekum were the words he greeted me with Aliekum salaam I replied with all the gravity I could muster I then informed him I required him as captain of my soldiers to Ujiji His reply was that he was ready to do whatever I told him go wherever I liked in short be a pattern to servants and a model to soldiers He hoped I would give him a uniform and a good gun both of which were promised Upon inquiring for the rest of the Faithfuls who accompanied Speke into Egypt I was told that at Zanzibar there were but six Ferrajji Maktub Sadik Sunguru Manyu Matajari Mkata and Almas were dead Uledi and Mtamani were in Unyanyembe Hassan had gone to Kilwa and Ferahan was supposed to be in Ujiji Out of the six Faithfuls each of whom still retained his medal for assisting in the Discovery of the Sources of the Nile one poor Mabruki had met with a sad misfortune which I feared would incapacitate him from active usefulness Mabruki the Bull headed owned a shamba or a house with a garden attached to it of which he was very proud Close to him lived a neighbour in similar circumstances who was a soldier of Seyd Majid with whom Mabruki who was of a quarrelsome disposition had a feud which culminated in the soldier inducing two or three of his comrades to assist him in punishing the malevolent Mabruki and this was done in a manner that only the heart of an African could conceive They tied the unfortunate fellow by his wrists to a branch of a tree and after indulging their brutal appetite for revenge in torturing him left him to hang in that position for two days At the expiration of the second day he was accidentally discovered in a most pitiable condition His hands had swollen to an immense size and the veins of one hand having been ruptured he had lost its use It is needless to say that when the affair came to Seyd Majid s ears the miscreants were severely punished doctor Kirk who attended the poor fellow succeeded in restoring one hand to something of a resemblance of its former shape but the other hand is sadly marred and its former usefulness gone for ever However I engaged Mabruki despite his deformed hands his ugliness and vanity because he was one of Speke s Faithfuls For if he but wagged his tongue in my service kept his eyes open and opened his mouth at the proper time I assured myself I could make him useful Bombay my captain of escort succeeded in getting eighteen more free men to volunteer as askari soldiers men whom he knew would not desert and for whom he declared himself responsible They were an exceedingly fine looking body of men far more intelligent in appearance than I could ever have believed African barbarians could be They hailed principally from Uhiyow others from Unyamwezi some came from Useguhha and Ugindo Their wages were set down at thirty six dollars each man per annum or three dollars each per month Each soldier was provided with a flintlock musket powder horn bullet pouch knife and hatchet besides enough powder and ball for two hundred rounds Bombay in consideration of his rank and previous faithful services to Burton Speke and Grant was engaged at eighty dollars a year half that sum in advance a good muzzle loading rifle besides a pistol knife and hatchet were given to him while the other five Faithfuls Ambari Mabruki Ulimengo Baruti and Uledi were engaged at forty dollars a year with proper equipments as soldiers Having studied fairly well all the East African travellers books regarding Eastern and Central Africa my mind had conceived the difficulties which would present themselves during the prosecution of my search after doctor Livingstone To obviate all of these as well as human wit could suggest was my constant thought and aim Shall I permit myself while looking from Ujiji over the waters of the Tanganika Lake to the other side to be balked on the threshold of success by the insolence of a King Kannena or the caprice of a Hamed bin Sulayyam was a question I asked myself To guard against such a contingency I determined to carry my own boats Then I thought if I hear of Livingstone being on the Tanganika I can launch my boat and proceed after him I procured one large boat capable of carrying twenty persons with stores and goods sufficient for a cruise from the American Consul for the sum of eighty dollars and a smaller one from another American gentleman for forty dollars The latter would hold comfortably six men with suitable stores I did not intend to carry the boats whole or bodily but to strip them of their boards and carry the timbers and thwarts only As a substitute for the boards I proposed to cover each boat with a double canvas skin well tarred The work of stripping them and taking them to pieces fell to me This little job occupied me five days I also packed them up for the pagazis Each load was carefully weighed and none exceeded sixty eight lbs in weight John Shaw excelled himself in the workmanship displayed on the canvas boats when finished they fitted their frames admirably The canvas six bolts of English hemp No three was procured from Ludha Damji who furnished it from the Sultan s storeroom An insuperable obstacle to rapid transit in Africa is the want of carriers and as speed was the main object of the Expedition under my command my duty was to lessen this difficulty as much as possible My carriers could only be engaged after arriving at Bagamoyo on the mainland I had over twenty good donkeys ready and I thought a cart adapted for the footpaths of Africa might prove an advantage Accordingly I had a cart constructed eighteen inches wide and five feet long supplied with two fore wheels of a light American wagon more for the purpose of conveying the narrow ammunition boxes I estimated that if a donkey could carry to Unyanyembe a load of four frasilahs or one hundred forty lbs he ought to be able to draw eight frasilahs on such a cart which would be equal to the carrying capacity of four stout pagazis or carriers Events will prove how my theories were borne out by practice When my purchases were completed and I beheld them piled up tier after tier row upon row here a mass of cooking utensils there bundles of rope tents saddles a pile of portmanteaus and boxes containing every imaginable thing I confess I was rather abashed at my own temerity Here were at least six tons of material How will it ever be possible I thought to move all this inert mass across the wilderness stretching between the sea and the great lakes of Africa Bah cast all doubts away man and have at them Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof without borrowing from the morrow The traveller must needs make his way into the African interior after a fashion very different from that to which he has been accustomed in other countries He requires to take with him just what a ship must have when about to sail on a long voyage He must have his slop chest his little store of canned dainties and his medicines besides which he must have enough guns powder and ball to be able to make a series of good fights if necessary He must have men to convey these miscellaneous articles and as a man s maximum load does not exceed seventy lbs to convey eleven thousand lbs requires nearly one hundred sixty men Europe and the Orient even Arabia and Turkestan have royal ways of travelling compared to Africa Specie is received in all those countries by which a traveller may carry his means about with him on his own person Eastern and Central Africa however demand a necklace instead of a cent two yards of American sheeting instead of half a dollar or a florin and a kitindi of thick brass wire in place of a gold piece The African traveller can hire neither wagons nor camels neither horses nor mules to proceed with him into the interior His means of conveyance are limited to black and naked men who demand at least fifteen dollars a head for every seventy lbs weight carried only as far as Unyanyembe One thing amongst others my predecessors omitted to inform men bound for Africa which is of importance and that is that no traveller should ever think of coming to Zanzibar with his money in any other shape than gold coin Letters of credit circular notes and such civilized things I have found to be a century ahead of Zanzibar people Twenty and twenty five cents deducted out of every dollar I drew on paper is one of the unpleasant if not unpleasantest things I have committed to lasting memory For Zanzibar is a spot far removed from all avenues of European commerce and coin is at a high premium A man may talk and entreat but though he may have drafts cheques circular notes letters of credit a carte blanche to get what he wants out of every dollar must be deducted twenty twenty five and thirty cents so I was told and so was my experience What a pity there is no branch bank here I had intended to have gone into Africa incognito But the fact that a white man even an American was about to enter Africa was soon known all over Zanzibar This fact was repeated a thousand times in the streets proclaimed in all shop alcoves and at the custom house The native bazaar laid hold of it and agitated it day and night until my departure The foreigners including the Europeans wished to know the pros and cons of my coming in and going out My answer to all questions pertinent and impertinent was I am going to Africa Though my card bore the words HENRY M STANLEY New York Herald very few I believe ever coupled the words New York Herald with a search after Doctor Livingstone It was not my fault was it Ah me what hard work it is to start an expedition alone What with hurrying through the baking heat of the fierce relentless sun from shop to shop strengthening myself with far reaching and enduring patience far the haggling contest with the livid faced Hindi summoning courage and wit to brow beat the villainous Goanese and match the foxy Banyan talking volumes throughout the day correcting estimates making up accounts superintending the delivery of purchased articles measuring and weighing them to see that everything was of full measure and weight overseeing the white men Farquhar and Shaw who were busy on donkey saddles sails tents and boats for the Expedition I felt when the day was over as though limbs and brain well deserved their rest Such labours were mine unremittingly for a month Having bartered drafts on mister James Gordon Bennett to the amount of several thousand dollars for cloth beads wire donkeys and a thousand necessaries having advanced pay to the white men and black escort of the Expedition having fretted captain Webb and his family more than enough with the din of preparation and filled his house with my goods there was nothing further to do but to leave my formal adieus with the Europeans and thank the Sultan and those gentlemen who had assisted me before embarking for Bagamoyo The day before my departure from Zanzibar the American Consul having just habited himself in his black coat and taking with him an extra black hat in order to be in state apparel proceeded with me to the Sultan s palace The prince had been generous to me he had presented me with an Arab horse had furnished me with letters of introduction to his agents his chief men and representatives in the interior and in many other ways had shown himself well disposed towards me The palace is a large roomy lofty square house close to the fort built of coral and plastered thickly with lime mortar In appearance it is half Arabic and half Italian The shutters are Venetian blinds painted a vivid green and presenting a striking contrast to the whitewashed walls Before the great lofty wide door were ranged in two crescents several Baluch and Persian mercenaries armed with curved swords and targes of rhinoceros hide Their dress consisted of a muddy white cotton shirt reaching to the ancles girdled with a leather belt thickly studded with silver bosses As we came in sight a signal was passed to some person inside the entrance When within twenty yards of the door the Sultan who was standing waiting came down the steps and passing through the ranks advanced toward us with his right hand stretched out and a genial smile of welcome on his face On our side we raised our hats and shook hands with him after which doing according as he bade us we passed forward and arrived on the highest step near the entrance door He pointed forward we bowed and arrived at the foot of an unpainted and narrow staircase to turn once more to the Sultan The Consul I perceived was ascending sideways a mode of progression which I saw was intended for a compromise with decency and dignity At the top of the stairs we waited with our faces towards the up coming Prince Again we were waved magnanimously forward for before us was the reception hall and throne room I noticed as I marched forward to the furthest end that the room was high and painted in the Arabic style that the carpet was thick and of Persian fabric that the furniture consisted of a dozen gilt chairs and a chandelier We were seated Ludha Damji the Banyan collector of customs a venerable looking old man with a shrewd intelligent face sat on the right of the Sultan next to him was the great Mohammedan merchant Tarya Topan who had come to be present at the interview not only because he was one of the councillors of His Highness but because he also took a lively interest in this American Expedition Opposite to Ludha sat captain Webb and next to him I was seated opposite Tarya Topan The Sultan sat in a gilt chair between the Americans and the councillors Johari the dragoman stood humbly before the Sultan expectant and ready to interpret what we had to communicate to the Prince The Sultan so far as dress goes might be taken for a Mingrelian gentleman excepting indeed for the turban whose ample folds in alternate colours of red yellow brown and white encircled his head His long robe was of dark cloth cinctured round the waist with his rich sword belt from which was suspended a gold hilted scimitar encased in a scabbard also enriched with gold His legs and feet were bare and had a ponderous look about them since he suffered from that strange curse of Zanzibar elephantiasis His feet were slipped into a pair of watta Arabic for slippers with thick soles and a strong leathern band over the instep His light complexion and his correct features which are intelligent and regular bespeak the Arab patrician They indicate however nothing except his high descent and blood no traits of character are visible unless there is just a trace of amiability and perfect contentment with himself and all around Such is Prince or Seyd Burghash Sultan of Zanzibar and Pemba and the East coast of Africa from Somali Land to the Mozambique as he appeared to me Coffee was served in cups supported by golden finjans also some cocoa nut milk and rich sweet sherbet The conversation began with the question addressed to the Consul Are you well Consul Yes thank you How is His Highness Highness Quite well Highness to me Are you well Answer Quite well thanks The Consul now introduces business and questions about my travels follow from His Highness How do you like Persia Have you seen Kerbela Bagdad Masr Stamboul Have the Turks many soldiers How many has Persia Is Persia fertile How do you like Zanzibar Having answered each question to his Highness satisfaction he handed me letters of introduction to his officers at Bagamoyo and Kaole and a general introductory letter to all Arab merchants whom I might meet on the road and concluded his remarks to me with the expressed hope that on whatever mission I was bound I should be perfectly successful We bowed ourselves out of his presence in much the same manner that we had bowed ourselves in he accompanying us to the great entrance door mister Goodhue of Salem an American merchant long resident in Zanzibar presented me as I gave him my adieu with a blooded bay horse imported from the Cape of Good Hope and worth at least at Zanzibar five hundred dollars Feb four By the fourth of February twenty eight days from the date of my arrival at Zanzibar the organization and equipment of the New York Herald Expedition was complete tents and saddles had been manufactured boats and sails were ready The donkeys brayed and the horses neighed impatiently for the road Etiquette demanded that I should once more present my card to the European and American Consuls at Zanzibar and the word farewell was said to everybody On the fifth day four dhows were anchored before the American Consulate Into one were lifted the two horses into two others the donkeys into the fourth the largest the black escort and bulky moneys of the Expedition A little before noon we set sail The American flag a present to the Expedition by that kind hearted lady missus Webb was raised to the mast head the Consul his lady and exuberant little children Mary and Charley were on the housetop waving the starry banner hats and handkerchiefs a token of farewell to me and mine Happy people and good may their course and ours be prosperous and may God s blessing rest on us all CHAPTER IV LIFE AT BAGAMOYO The isle of Zanzibar with its groves of cocoa nut mango clove and cinnamon and its sentinel islets of Chumbi and French with its whitewashed city and jack fruit odor with its harbor and ships that tread the deep faded slowly from view and looking westward the African continent rose a similar bank of green verdure to that which had just receded till it was a mere sinuous line above the horizon looming in a northerly direction to the sublimity of a mountain chain The distance across from Zanzibar to Bagamoyo may be about twenty five miles yet it took the dull and lazy dhows ten hours before they dropped anchor on the top of the coral reef plainly visible a few feet below the surface of the water within a hundred yards of the beach The newly enlisted soldiers fond of noise and excitement discharged repeated salvos by way of a salute to the mixed crowd of Arabs Banyans and Wasawahili who stood on the beach to receive the Musungu white man which they did with a general stare and a chorus of Yambo bana how are you master In our own land the meeting with a large crowd is rather a tedious operation as our independent citizens insist on an interlacing of fingers and a vigorous shaking thereof before their pride is satisfied and the peaceful manifestation endorsed but on this beach well lined with spectators a response of Yambo bana sufficed except with one who of all there was acknowledged the greatest and who claiming like all great men individual attention came forward to exchange another Yambo on his own behalf and to shake hands This personage with a long trailing turban was Jemadar Esau commander of the Zanzibar force of soldiers police or Baluch gendarmes stationed at Bagamoyo He had accompanied Speke and Grant a good distance into the interior and they had rewarded him liberally He took upon himself the responsibility of assisting in the debarkation of the Expedition and unworthy as was his appearance disgraceful as he was in his filth I here commend him for his influence over the rabble to all future East African travellers Foremost among those who welcomed us was a Father of the Society of saint Esprit who with other Jesuits under Father Superior Horner have established a missionary post of considerable influence and merit at Bagamoyo We were invited to partake of the hospitality of the Mission to take our meals there and should we desire it to pitch our camp on their grounds But however strong the geniality of the welcome and sincere the heartiness of the invitation I am one of those who prefer independence to dependence if it is possible Besides my sense of the obligation between host and guest had just had a fine edge put upon it by the delicate forbearance of my kind host at Zanzibar who had betrayed no sign of impatience at the trouble I was only too conscious of having caused him I therefore informed the hospitable Padre that only for one night could I suffer myself to be enticed from my camp I selected a house near the western outskirts of the town where there is a large open square through which the road from Unyanyembe enters Had I been at Bagamoyo a month I could not have bettered my location My tents were pitched fronting the tembe house I had chosen enclosing a small square where business could be transacted bales looked over examined and marked free from the intrusion of curious sightseers After driving the twenty seven animals of the Expedition into the enclosure in the rear of the house storing the bales of goods and placing a cordon of soldiers round I proceeded to the Jesuit Mission to a late dinner being tired and ravenous leaving the newly formed camp in charge of the white men and captain Bombay The Mission is distant from the town a good half mile to the north of it it is quite a village of itself numbering some fifteen or sixteen houses There are more than ten padres engaged in the establishment and as many sisters and all find plenty of occupation in educing from native crania the fire of intelligence Truth compels me to state that they are very successful having over two hundred pupils boys and girls in the Mission and from the oldest to the youngest they show the impress of the useful education they have received The dinner furnished to the padres and their guest consisted of as many plats as a first class hotel in Paris usually supplies and cooked with nearly as much skill though the surroundings were by no means equal I feel assured also that the padres besides being tasteful in their potages and entrees do not stultify their ideas for lack of that element which Horace Hafiz and Byron have praised so much The champagne think of champagne Cliquot in East Africa Lafitte La Rose Burgundy and Bordeaux were of first rate quality and the meek and lowly eyes of the fathers were not a little brightened under the vinous influence Ah those fathers understand life and appreciate its duration Their festive board drives the African jungle fever from their doors while it soothes the gloom and isolation which strike one with awe as one emerges from the lighted room and plunges into the depths of the darkness of an African night enlivened only by the wearying monotone of the frogs and crickets and the distant ululation of the hyena It requires somewhat above human effort unaided by the ruby liquid that cheers to be always suave and polite amid the dismalities of native life in Africa After the evening meal which replenished my failing strength and for which I felt the intensest gratitude the most advanced of the pupils came forward to the number of twenty with brass instruments thus forming a full band of music It rather astonished me to hear instrumental sounds issue forth in harmony from such woolly headed youngsters to hear well known French music at this isolated port to hear negro boys that a few months ago knew nothing beyond the traditions of their ignorant mothers stand forth and chant Parisian songs about French valor and glory with all the sangfroid of gamins from the purlieus of Saint Antoine I had a most refreshing night s rest and at dawn I sought out my camp with a will to enjoy the new life now commencing On counting the animals two donkeys were missing and on taking notes of my African moneys one coil of No six wire was not to be found Everybody had evidently fallen on the ground to sleep oblivious of the fact that on the coast there are many dishonest prowlers at night Soldiers were despatched to search through the town and neighbourhood and Jemadar Esau was apprised of our loss and stimulated to discover the animals by the promise of a reward Before night one of the missing donkeys was found outside the town nibbling at manioc leaves but the other animal and the coil of wire were never found Among my visitors this first day at Bagamoyo was Ali bin Salim a brother of the famous Sayd bin Salim formerly Ras Kafilah to Burton and Speke and subsequently to Speke and Grant His salaams were very profuse and moreover his brother was to be my agent in Unyamwezi so that I did not hesitate to accept his offer of assistance But alas for my white face and too trustful nature this Ali bin Salim turned out to be a snake in the grass a very sore thorn in my side I was invited to his comfortable house to partake of coffee I went there the coffee was good though sugarless his promises were many but they proved valueless Said he to me I am your friend I wish to serve you what can I do for you Replied I I am obliged to you I need a good friend who knowing the language and Customs of the Wanyamwezi can procure me the pagazis I need and send me off quickly Your brother is acquainted with the Wasungu white men and knows that what they promise they make good Get me a hundred and forty pagazis and I will pay you your price With unctuous courtesy the reptile I was now warmly nourishing said I do not want anything from you my friend for such a slight service rest content and quiet you shall not stop here fifteen days To morrow morning I will come and overhaul your bales to see what is needed I bade him good morning elated with the happy thought that I was soon to tread the Unyanyembe road The reader must be made acquainted with two good and sufficient reasons why I was to devote all my energy to lead the Expedition as quickly as possible from Bagamoyo First I wished to reach Ujiji before the news reached Livingstone that I was in search of him for my impression of him was that he was a man who would try to put as much distance as possible between us rather than make an effort to shorten it and I should have my long journey for nothing Second the Masika or rainy season would soon be on me which if it caught me at Bagamoyo would prevent my departure until it was over which meant a delay of forty days and exaggerated as the rains were by all men with whom I came in contact it rained every day for forty days without intermission This I knew was a thing to dread for I had my memory stored with all kinds of rainy unpleasantnesses For instance there was the rain of Virginia and its concomitant horrors wetness mildew agues rheumatics and such like then there were the English rains a miserable drizzle causing the blue devils then the rainy season of Abyssinia with the flood gates of the firmament opened and an universal down pour of rain enough to submerge half a continent in a few hours lastly there was the pelting monsoon of India a steady shut in house kind of rain To which of these rains should I compare this dreadful Masika of East Africa Did not Burton write much about black mud in Uzaramo Well a country whose surface soil is called black mud in fine weather what can it be called when forty days rain beat on it and feet of pagazis and donkeys make paste of it These were natural reflections induced by the circumstances of the hour and I found myself much exercised in mind in consequence Ali bin Salim true to his promise visited my camp on the morrow with a very important air and after looking at the pile of cloth bales informed me that I must have them covered with mat bags He said he would send a man to have them measured but he enjoined me not to make any bargain for the bags as he would make it all right While awaiting with commendable patience the one hundred forty pagazis promised by Ali bin Salim we were all employed upon everything that thought could suggest needful for crossing the sickly maritime region so that we might make the transit before the terrible fever could unnerve us and make us joyless A short experience at Bagamoya showed us what we lacked what was superfluous and what was necessary We were visited one night by a squall accompanied by furious rain I had fifteen hundred dollars worth of pagazi cloth in my tent In the morning I looked and lo the drilling had let in rain like a sieve and every yard of cloth was wet It occupied two days afterwards to dry the cloths and fold them again The drill tent was condemned and a No five hemp canvas tent at onto prepared After which I felt convinced that my cloth bales and one year s ammunition were safe and that I could defy the Masika In the hurry of departure from Zanzibar and in my ignorance of how bales should be made I had submitted to the better judgment and ripe experience of one Jetta a commission merchant to prepare my bales for carriage Jetta did not weigh the bales as he made them up but piled the Merikani Kaniki Barsati Jamdani Joho Ismahili in alternate layers and roped the same into bales One or two pagazis came to my camp and began to chaffer they wished to see the bales first before they would make a final bargain They tried to raise them up ugh ugh it was of no use and withdrew A fine Salter s spring balance was hung up and a bale suspended to the hook the finger indicated one hundred five lbs or three frasilah which was just thirty five lbs or one frasilah overweight Upon putting all the bales to this test I perceived that Jetta s guess work with all his experience had caused considerable trouble to me The soldiers were set to work to reopen and repack which latter task is performed in the following manner We cut a doti or four yards of Merikani ordinarily sold at Zanzibar for two dollars seventy five cents the piece of thirty yards and spread out We take a piece or bolt of good Merikani and instead of the double fold given it by the Nashua and Salem mills we fold it into three parts by which the folds have a breadth of a foot this piece forms the first layer and will weigh nine pounds the second layer consists of six pieces of Kaniki a blue stuff similar to the blouse stuff of France and the blue jeans of America though much lighter the third layer is formed of the second piece of Merikani the fourth of six more pieces of Kaniki the fifth of Merikani the sixth of Kaniki as before and the seventh and last of Merikani We have thus four pieces of Merikani which weigh thirty six lbs and eighteen pieces of Kaniki weighing also thirty six lbs making a total of seventy two lbs or a little more than two frasilahs the cloth is then folded singly over these layers each corner tied to another A bundle of coir rope is then brought and two men provided with a wooden mallet for beating and pressing the bale proceed to tie it up with as much nicety as sailors serve down rigging When complete a bale is a solid mass three feet and a half long a foot deep and a foot wide Of these bales I had to convey eighty two to Unyanyembe forty of which consisted solely of the Merikani and Kaniki The other forty two contained the Merikani and coloured cloths which latter were to serve as honga or tribute cloths and to engage another set of pagazis from Unyanyembe to Ujiji and from Ujiji to the regions beyond The fifteenth day asked of me by Ali bin Salim for the procuring of the pagazis passed by and there was not the ghost of a pagazi in my camp I sent Mabruki the Bullheaded to Ali bin Salim to convey my salaams and express a hope that he had kept his word In half an hour s time Mabruki returned with the reply of the Arab that in a few days he would be able to collect them all but added Mabruki slyly Bana I don t believe him He said aloud to himself in my hearing Why should I get the Musungu pagazis Seyd Burghash did not send a letter to me but to the Jemadar Why should I trouble myself about him Let Seyd Burghash write me a letter to that purpose and I will procure them within two days To my mind this was a time for action Ali bin Salim should see that it was ill trifling with a white man in earnest to start I rode down to his house to ask him what he meant His reply was Mabruki had told a lie as black as his face He had never said anything approaching to such a thing He was willing to become my slave to become a pagazi himself But here I stopped the voluble Ali and informed him that I could not think of employing him in the capacity of a pagazi neither could I find it in my heart to trouble Seyd Burghash to write a direct letter to him or to require of a man who had deceived me once as Ali bin Salim had any service of any nature whatsoever It would be better therefore if Ali bin Salim would stay away from my camp and not enter it either in person or by proxy I had lost fifteen days for Jemadar Sadur at Kaole had never stirred from his fortified house in that village in my service save to pay a visit after the receipt of the Sultan s letter Naranji custom house agent at Kaoie solely under the thumb of the great Ludha Damji had not responded to Ludha s worded request that he would procure pagazis except with winks nods and promises and it is but just stated how I fared at the hands of Ali bin Salim In this extremity I remembered the promise made to me by the great merchant of Zanzibar Tarya Topan a Mohammedan Hindi that he would furnish me with a letter to a young man named Soor Hadji Palloo who was said to be the best man in Bagamoyo to procure a supply of pagazis I despatched my Arab interpreter by a dhow to Zanzibar with a very earnest request to captain Webb that he would procure from Tarya Topan the introductory letter so long delayed It was the last card in my hand On the third day the Arab returned bringing with him not only the letter to Soor Hadji Palloo but an abundance of good things from the ever hospitable house of mister Webb In a very short time after the receipt of his letter the eminent young man Soor Hadji Palloo came to visit me and informed me he had been requested by Tarya Topan to hire for me one hundred and forty pagazis to Unyanyembe in the shortest time possible This he said would be very expensive for there were scores of Arabs and Wasawabili merchants on the look out for every caravan that came in from the interior and they paid twenty doti or eighty yards of cloth to each pagazi Not willing or able to pay more many of these merchants had been waiting as long as six months before they could get their quota If you continued he desire to depart quickly you must pay from twenty five to forty doti and I can send you off before one month is ended In reply I said Here are my cloths for pagazis to the amount of seventeen fifty dollars or three thousand five hundred doti sufficient to give one hundred and forty men twenty five doti each The most I am willing to pay is twenty five doti send one hundred and forty pagazis to Unyanyembe with my cloth and wire and I will make your heart glad with the richest present you have ever received With a refreshing naivete the young man said he did not want any present he would get me my quota of pagazis and then I could tell the Wasungu what a good young man he was and consequently the benefit he would receive would be an increase of business He closed his reply with the astounding remark that he had ten pagazis at his house already and if I would be good enough to have four bales of cloth two bags of beads and twenty coils of wire carried to his house the pagazis could leave Bagamoyo the next day under charge of three soldiers For he remarked it is much better and cheaper to send many small caravans than one large one Large caravans invite attack or are delayed by avaricious chiefs upon the most trivial pretexts while small ones pass by without notice The bales and the beads were duly carried to Soor Hadji Palloo s house and the day passed with me in mentally congratulating myself upon my good fortune in complimenting the young Hindi s talents for business the greatness and influence of Tarya Topan and the goodness of mister Webb in thus hastening my departure from Bagamoyo I mentally vowed a handsome present and a great puff in my book to Soor Hadji Palloo and it was with a glad heart that I prepared these soldiers for their march to Unyayembe The task of preparing the first caravan for the Unyanyembe road informed me upon several things that have escaped the notice of my predecessors in East Africa a timely knowledge of which would have been of infinite service to me at Zanzibar in the purchase and selection of sufficient and proper cloth The setting out of the first caravan enlightened me also on the subject of honga or tribute Tribute had to be packed by itself all of choice cloth for the chiefs besides being avaricious are also very fastidious They will not accept the flimsy cloth of the pagazi but a royal and exceedingly high priced dabwani Ismahili Rehani or a Sohari or dotis of crimson broad cloth The tribute for the first caravan cost twenty five dollars Having more than one hundred and forty pagazis to despatch this tribute money would finally amount to three hundred thirty dollars in gold with a minimum of twenty fivec on each dollar Ponder on this O traveller I lay bare these facts for your special instruction But before my first caravan was destined to part company with me Soor Hadji Palloo worthy young man and I were to come to a definite understanding about money matters The morning appointed for departure Soor Hadji Palloo came to my hut and presented his bill with all the gravity of innocence for supplying the pagazis with twenty five doti each as their hire to Unyanyembe begging immediate payment in money Words fail to express the astonishment I naturally felt that this sharp looking young man should so soon have forgotten the verbal contract entered into between him and myself the morning previous which was to the effect that out of the three thousand doti stored in my tent and bought expressly for pagazi hire each and every man hired for me as carriers from Bagamoyo to Unyanyembe should be paid out of the store there in my tent when I asked if he remembered the contract he replied in the affirmative his reasons for breaking it so soon were that he wished to sell his cloths not mine and for his cloths he should want money not an exchange But I gave him to comprehend that as he was procuring pagazis for me he was to pay my pagazis with my cloths that all the money I expected to pay him should be just such a sum I thought adequate for his trouble as my agent and that only on those terms should he act for me in this or any other matter and that the Musungu was not accustomed to eat his words The preceding paragraph embodies many more words than are contained in it It embodies a dialogue of an hour an angry altercation of half an hour s duration a vow taken on the part of Soor Hadji Palloo that if I did not take his cloths he should not touch my business many tears entreaties woeful penitence and much else all of which were responded to with Do as I want you to do or do nothing Finally came relief and a happy ending Soor Hadji Palloo went away with a bright face taking with him the three soldiers posho food and honga tribute for the caravan Well for me that it ended so and that subsequent quarrels of a similar nature terminated so peaceably otherwise I doubt whether my departure from Bagamoyo would have happened so early as it did While I am on this theme and as it really engrossed every moment of my time at Bagamoyo I may as well be more explicit regarding Boor Hadji Palloo and his connection with my business Boor Hadji Palloo was a smart young man of business energetic quick at mental calculation and seemed to be born for a successful salesman His eyes were never idle they wandered over every part of my person over the tent the bed the guns the clothes and having swung clear round began the silent circle over again His fingers were never at rest they had a fidgety nervous action at their tips constantly in the act of feeling something while in the act of talking to me he would lean over and feel the texture of the cloth of my trousers my coat or my shoes or socks then he would feel his own light jamdani shirt or dabwain loin cloth until his eyes casually resting upon a novelty his body would lean forward and his arm was stretched out with the willing fingers His jaws also were in perpetual motion caused by vile habits he had acquired of chewing betel nut and lime and sometimes tobacco and lime They gave out a sound similar to that of a young shoat in the act of sucking He was a pious Mohammedan and observed the external courtesies and ceremonies of the true believers He would affably greet me take off his shoes enter my tent protesting he was not fit to sit in my presence and after being seated would begin his ever crooked errand Of honesty literal and practical honesty this youth knew nothing to the pure truth he was an utter stranger the falsehoods he had uttered during his short life seemed already to have quenched the bold gaze of innocence from his eyes to have banished the colour of truthfulness from his features to have transformed him yet a stripling of twenty into a most accomplished rascal and consummate expert in dishonesty During the six weeks I encamped at Bagamoyo waiting for my quota of men this lad of twenty gave me very much trouble He was found out half a dozen times a day in dishonesty yet was in no way abashed by it He would send in his account of the cloths supplied to the pagazis stating them to be twenty five paid to each on sending a man to inquire I would find the greatest number to have been twenty and the smallest twelve Soor Hadji Palloo described the cloths to be of first class quality Ulyah cloths worth in the market four times more than the ordinary quality given to the pagazis yet a personal examination would prove them to be the flimsiest goods sold such as American sheeting two one two feet broad and worth two dollars seventy five cents per thirty yards a piece at Zanzibar or the most inferior Kaniki which is generally sold at nine dollars per score He would personally come to my camp and demand forty lbs of Sami Sami Merikani and Bubu beads for posho or caravan rations an inspection of their store before departure from their first camp from Bagamoyo would show a deficiency ranging from five to thirty lbs Moreover he cheated in cash money such as demanding four dollars for crossing the Kingani Ferry for every ten pagazis when the fare was two dollars for the same number and an unconscionable number of pice copper coins equal in value to three four of a cent were required for posho It was every day for four weeks that this system of roguery was carried out Each day conceived a dozen new schemes every instant of his time he seemed to be devising how to plunder until I was fairly at my wits end how to thwart him Exposure before a crowd of his fellows brought no blush of shame to his sallow cheeks he would listen with a mere shrug of the shoulders and that was all which I might interpret any way it pleased me A threat to reduce his present had no effect a bird in the hand was certainly worth two in the bush for him so ten dollars worth of goods stolen and in his actual possession was of more intrinsic value than the promise of twenty dollars in a few days though it was that of a white man Readers will of course ask themselves why I did not after the first discovery of these shameless proceedings close my business with him to which I make reply that I could not do without him unless his equal were forthcoming that I never felt so thoroughly dependent on any one man as I did upon him without his or his duplicate s aid I must have stayed at Bagamoyo at least six months at the end of which time the Expedition would have become valueless the rumour of it having been blown abroad to the four winds It was immediate departure that was essential to my success departure from Bagamoyo after which it might be possible for me to control my own future in a great measure These troubles were the greatest that I could at this time imagine I have already stated that I had seventeen fifty dollars worth of pagazis clothes or three thousand five hundred doti stored in my tent and above what my bales contained Calculating one hundred and forty pagazis at twenty five doti each I supposed I had enough yet though I had been trying to teach the young Hindi that the Musungu was not a fool nor blind to his pilfering tricks though the three thousand five hundred doti were all spent though I had only obtained one hundred and thirty pagazis at twenty five doti each which in the aggregate amounted to three thousand two hundred doti Soor Hadji Palloo s bill was fourteen hundred dollars cash extra His plea was that he had furnished Ulyah clothes for Muhongo two hundred forty doti equal in value to nine hundred sixty of my doti that the money was spent in ferry pice in presents to chiefs of caravans of tents guns red broad cloth in presents to people on the Mrima coast to induce them to hunt up pagazis Upon this exhibition of most ruthless cheating I waxed indignant and declared to him that if he did not run over his bill and correct it he should go without a pice But before the bill could be put into proper shape my words threats and promises falling heedlessly on a stony brain a man Kanjee by name from the store of Tarya Topan of Zanzibar had to come over when the bill was finally reduced to seven hundred thirty eight dollars Without any disrespect to Tarya Topan I am unable to decide which is the most accomplished rascal Kanjee or young Soor Hadji Palloo in the words of a white man who knows them both there is not the splitting of a straw between them Kanjee is deep and sly Soor Hadji Palloo is bold and incorrigible But peace be to them both may their shaven heads never be covered with the troublous crown I wore at Bagamoyo My dear friendly reader do not think if I speak out my mind in this or in any other chapter upon matters seemingly trivial and unimportant that seeming such they should be left unmentioned Every tittle related is a fact and to knew facts is to receive knowledge How could I ever recite my experience to you if I did not enter upon these miserable details which sorely distract the stranger upon his first arrival Had I been a Government official I had but wagged my finger and my quota of pagazis had been furnished me within a week but as an individual arriving without the graces of official recognition armed with no Government influence I had to be patient bide my time and chew the cud of irritation quietly but the bread I ate was not all sour as this was The white men Farquhar and Shaw were kept steadily at work upon water proof tents of hemp canvas for I perceived by the premonitory showers of rain that marked the approach of the Masika that an ordinary tent of light cloth would subject myself to damp and my goods to mildew and while there was time to rectify all errors that had crept into my plans through ignorance or over haste I thought it was not wise to permit things to rectify themselves Now that I have returned uninjured in health though I have suffered the attacks of twenty three fevers within the short space of thirteen months I must confess I owe my life first to the mercy of God secondly to the enthusiasm for my work which animated me from the beginning to the end thirdly to having never ruined my constitution by indulgence in vice and intemperance fourthly to the energy of my nature fifthly to a native hopefulness which never died and sixthly to having furnished myself with a capacious water and damp proof canvas house And here if my experience may be of value I would suggest that travellers instead of submitting their better judgment to the caprices of a tent maker who will endeavour to pass off a handsomely made fabric of his own which is unsuited to all climes to use his own judgment and get the best and strongest that money will buy In the end it will prove the cheapest and perhaps be the means of saving his life On one point I failed and lest new and young travellers fall into the same error which marred much of my enjoyment this paragraph is written One must be extremely careful in his choice of weapons whether for sport or defence A traveller should have at least three different kinds of guns One should be a fowling piece the second should be a double barrelled rifle No ten or twelve the third should be a magazine rifle for defence For the fowling piece I would suggest No twelve bore with barrels at least four feet in length For the rifle for larger game I would point out with due deference to old sportsmen of course that the best guns for African game are the English Lancaster and Reilly rifles and for a fighting weapon I maintain that the best yet invented is the American Winchester repeating rifle or the sixteen shooter as it is called supplied with the London Eley s ammunition If I suggest as a fighting weapon the American Winchester I do not mean that the traveller need take it for the purpose of offence but as the beat means of efficient defence to save his own life against African banditti when attacked a thing likely to happen any time I met a young man soon after returning from the interior who declared his conviction that the Express rifle was the most perfect weapon ever invented to destroy African game Very possibly the young man may be right and that the Express rifle is all he declares it to be but he had never practised with it against African game and as I had never tried it I could not combat his assertion but I could relate my experiences with weapons having all the penetrating powers of the Express and could inform him that though the bullets penetrated through the animals they almost always failed to bring down the game at the first fire On the other hand I could inform him that during the time I travelled with doctor Livingstone the Doctor lent me his heavy Reilly rifle with which I seldom failed to bring an animal or two home to the camp and that I found the Fraser shell answer all purposes for which it was intended The feats related by captain Speke and Sir Samuel Baker are no longer matter of wonderment to the young sportsman when he has a Lancaster or a Reilly in his hand After very few trials he can imitate them if not excel their Leeds provided he has a steady hand And it is to forward this end that this paragraph is written African game require bone crushers for any ordinary carbine possesses sufficient penetrative qualities yet has not he disabling qualities which a gun must possess to be useful in the hands of an African explorer I had not been long at Bagamoyo before I went over to Mussoudi s camp to visit the Livingstone caravan which the British Consul had despatched on the first day of November eighteen seventy to the relief of Livingstone The number of packages was thirty five which required as many men to convey them to Unyanyembe The men chosen to escort this caravan were composed of Johannese and Wahiyow seven in number Out of the seven four were slaves They lived in clover here thoughtless of the errand they had been sent upon and careless of the consequences What these men were doing at Bagamoyo all this time I never could conceive except indulging their own vicious propensities It would be nonsense to say there were no pagazis because I know there were at least fifteen caravans which had started for the interior since the Ramadan December fifteenth eighteen seventy Yet Livingstone s caravan had arrived at this little town of Bagamoyo November second and here it had been lying until the tenth February in all one hundred days for lack of the limited number of thirty five pagazis a number that might be procured within two days through consular influence Bagamoyo has a most enjoyable climate It is far preferable in every sense to that of Zanzibar We were able to sleep in the open air and rose refreshed and healthy each morning to enjoy our matutinal bath in the sea and by the time the sun had risen we were engaged in various preparations for our departure for the interior Our days were enlivened by visits from the Arabs who were also bound for Unyanyembe by comical scenes in the camp sometimes by court martials held on the refractory by a boxing match between Farquhar and Shaw necessitating my prudent interference when they waxed too wroth by a hunting excursion now and then to the Kingani plain and river by social conversation with the old Jemadar and his band of Baluches who were never tired of warning me that the Masika was at hand and of advising me that my best course was to hurry on before the season for travelling expired Among the employees with the Expedition were two Hindi and two Goanese They had conceived the idea that the African interior was an El Dorado the ground of which was strewn over with ivory tusks and they had clubbed together while their imaginations were thus heated to embark in a little enterprise of their own Their names were Jako Abdul Kader Bunder Salaam and Aranselar Jako engaged in my service as carpenter and general help Abdul Kader as a tailor Bunder Salaam as cook and Aranselar as chief butler But Aranselar with an intuitive eye foresaw that I was likely to prove a vigorous employer and while there was yet time he devoted most of it to conceive how it were possible to withdraw from the engagement He received permission upon asking for it to go to Zanzibar to visit his friends Two days afterwards I was informed he had blown his right eye out and received a medical confirmation of the fact and note of the extent of the injury from doctor Christie the physician to His Highness Seyd Burghash His compatriots I imagined were about planning the same thing but a peremptory command to abstain from such folly issued after they had received their advance pay sufficed to check any sinister designs they may have formed A groom was caught stealing from the bales one night and the chase after him into the country until he vanished out of sight into the jungle was one of the most agreeable diversions which occurred to wear away the interval employed in preparing for the march I had now despatched four caravans into the interior and the fifth which was to carry the boats and boxes personal luggage and a few cloth and bead loads was ready to be led by myself The following is the order of departure of the caravans eighteen seventy one Feb six Expedition arrived at Bagamoyo eighteen seventy one Feb eighteen First caravan departs with twenty four pagazis and three soldiers eighteen seventy one Feb twenty one Second caravan departs with twenty eight pagazis two chiefs and two soldiers eighteen seventy one Feb twenty five Third caravan departs

seventy one March twenty one Fifth caravan departs with twenty eight pagazis twelve soldiers two white men one tailor one cook one interpreter one gun bearer seventeen asses two horses and one dog Total number inclusive of all souls comprised in caravans connected with the New York Herald Expedition one hundred ninety two CHAPTER V THROUGH UKWERE UKAMI AND UDOE TO USEGUHHA Leaving Bagamoyo for the interior Constructing a Bridge Our first troubles Shooting Hippopotami A first view of the Game Land Anticipating trouble with the Wagogo The dreadful poison flies Unlucky adventures while hunting The cunning chief of Kingaru Sudden death of my two horses A terrible experience The city of the Lion Lord On the twenty first of March exactly seventy three days after my arrival at Zanzibar the fifth caravan led by myself left the town of Bagamoyo for our first journey westward with Forward for its mot du guet As the kirangozi unrolled the American flag and put himself at the head of the caravan and the pagazis animals soldiers and idlers were lined for the march we bade a long farewell to the dolce far niente of civilised life to the blue ocean and to its open road to home to the hundreds of dusky spectators who were there to celebrate our departure with repeated salvoes of musketry Our caravan is composed of twenty eight pagazis including the kirangozi or guide twelve soldiers under captain Mbarak Bombay in charge of seventeen donkeys and their loads Selim my interpreter in charge of the donkey and cart and its load one cook and sub who is also to be tailor and ready hand for all and leads the grey horse Shaw once mate of a ship now transformed into rearguard and overseer for the caravan who is mounted on a good riding donkey and wearing a canoe like tepee and sea boots and lastly on the splendid bay horse presented to me by mister Goodhue myself called Bana Mkuba the big master by my people the vanguard the reporter the thinker and leader of the Expedition Altogether the Expedition numbers on the day of departure three white men twenty three soldiers four supernumeraries four chiefs and one hundred and fifty three pagazis twenty seven donkeys and one cart conveying cloth beads and wire boat fixings tents cooking utensils and dishes medicine powder small shot musket balls and metallic cartridges instruments and small necessaries such as soap sugar tea coffee Liebig s extract of meat pemmican candles c which make a total of one hundred fifty three loads The weapons of defence which the Expedition possesses consist of one double barrel breech loading gun smooth bore one American Winchester rifle or sixteen shooter one Henry rifle or sixteen shooter two Starr s breech loaders one Jocelyn breech loader one elephant rifle carrying balls eight to the pound two breech loading revolvers twenty four muskets flint locks six single barrelled pistols one battle axe two swords two daggers Persian kummers purchased at Shiraz by myself one boar spear two American axes four lbs each twenty four hatchets and twenty four butcher knives The Expedition has been fitted with care whatever it needed was not stinted everything was provided Nothing was done too hurriedly yet everything was purchased manufactured collected and compounded with the utmost despatch consistent with efficiency and means Should it fail of success in its errand of rapid transit to Ujiji and back it must simply happen from an accident which could not be controlled So much for the personnel of the Expedition and its purpose until its point de mire be reached We left Bagamoyo the attraction of all the curious with much eclat and defiled up a narrow lane shaded almost to twilight by the dense umbrage of two parallel hedges of mimosas We were all in the highest spirits The soldiers sang the kirangozi lifted his voice into a loud bellowing note and fluttered the American flag which told all on lookers Lo a Musungu s caravan and my heart I thought palpitated much too quickly for the sober face of a leader But I could not check it the enthusiasm of youth still clung to me despite my travels my pulses bounded with the full glow of staple health behind me were the troubles which had harassed me for over two months With that dishonest son of a Hindi Soor Hadji Palloo I had said my last word of the blatant rabble of Arabs Banyans and Baluches I had taken my last look with the Jesuits of the French Mission I had exchanged farewells and before me beamed the sun of promise as he sped towards the Occident Loveliness glowed around me I saw fertile fields riant vegetation strange trees I heard the cry of cricket and pee wit and sibilant sound of many insects all of which seemed to tell me At last you are started What could I do but lift my face toward the pure glowing sky and cry God be thanked The first camp Shamba Gonera we arrived at in one hour thirty minutes equal to three one four miles This first or little journey was performed very well considering as the Irishman says The boy Selim upset the cart not more than three times Zaidi the soldier only once let his donkey which carried one bag of my clothes and a box of ammunition lie in a puddle of black water The clothes have to be re washed the ammunition box thanks to my provision was waterproof Kamna perhaps knew the art of donkey driving but overjoyful at the departure had sung himself into oblivion of the difficulties with which an animal of the pure asinine breed has naturally to contend against such as not knowing the right road and inability to resist the temptation of straying into the depths of a manioc field and the donkey ignorant of the custom in vogue amongst ass drivers of flourishing sticks before an animal s nose and misunderstanding the direction in which he was required to go ran off at full speed along an opposite road until his pack got unbalanced and he was fain to come to the earth But these incidents were trivial of no importance and natural to the first little journey in East Africa The soldiers point of character leaked out just a little Bombay turned out to be honest and trusty but slightly disposed to be dilatory Uledi did more talking than work while the runaway Ferajji and the useless handed Mabruki Burton turned out to be true men and staunch carrying loads the sight of which would have caused the strong limbed hamals of Stamboul to sigh The saddles were excellent surpassing expectation The strong hemp canvas bore its one hundred and fifty pounds burden with the strength of bull hide and the loading and unloading of miscellaneous baggage was performed with systematic despatch In brief there was nothing to regret the success of the journey proved our departure to be anything but premature The next three days were employed in putting the finishing touches to our preparations for the long land journey and our precautions against the Masika which was now ominously near and in settling accounts Shamba Gonera means Gonera s Field Gonera is a wealthy Indian widow well disposed towards the Wasungu whites She exports much cloth beads and wire into the far interior and imports in return much ivory Her house is after the model of the town houses with long sloping roof and projecting eaves affording a cool shade under which the pagazis love to loiter On its southern and eastern side stretch the cultivated fields which supply Bagamoyo with the staple grain matama of East Africa on the left grow Indian corn and muhogo a yam like root of whitish colour called by some manioc when dry it is ground and compounded into cakes similar to army slapjacks On the north just behind the house winds a black quagmire a sinuous hollow which in its deepest parts always contains water the muddy home of the brake and rush loving kiboko or hippopotamus Its banks crowded with dwarf fan palm tall water reeds acacias and tiger grass afford shelter to numerous aquatic birds pelicans c After following a course north easterly it conflows with the Kingani which at distance of four miles from Gonera s country house bends eastward into the sea To the west after a mile of cultivation fall and recede in succession the sea beach of old in lengthy parallel waves overgrown densely with forest grass and marsh reeds On the spines of these land swells flourish ebony calabash and mango Sofari sofari leo Pakia pakia A journey a journey to day Set out set out rang the cheery voice of the kirangozi echoed by that of my servant Selim on the morning of the fourth day which was fixed for our departure in earnest As I hurried my men to their work and lent a hand with energy to drop the tents I mentally resolved that if my caravans a should give me clear space Unyanyembe should be our resting place before three months expired By six A M our early breakfast was despatched and the donkeys and pagazis were defiling from Camp Gonera Even at this early hour and in this country place there was quite a collection of curious natives to whom we gave the parting Kwaheri with sincerity My bay horse was found to be invaluable for the service of a quarter master of a transport train for to such was I compelled to compare myself I could stay behind until the last donkey had quitted the camp and by a few minutes gallop I could put myself at the head leaving Shaw to bring up the rear The road was a mere footpath and led over a soil which though sandy was of surprising fertility producing grain and vegetables a hundredfold the sowing and planting of which was done in the most unskilful manner In their fields at heedless labor were men and women in the scantiest costumes compared to which Adam and Eve in their fig tree apparel must have been en grande tenue We passed them with serious faces while they laughed and giggled and pointed their index fingers at this and that which to them seemed so strange and bizarre In about half an hour we had left the tall matama and fields of water melons cucumbers and manioc and crossing a reedy slough were in an open forest of ebony and calabash In its depths are deer in plentiful numbers and at night it is visited by the hippopotami of the Kingani for the sake of its grass In another hour we had emerged from the woods and were looking down upon the broad valley of the Kingani and a scene presented itself so utterly different from what my foolish imagination had drawn that I felt quite relieved by the pleasing disappointment Here was a valley stretching four miles east and west and about eight miles north and south left with the richest soil to its own wild growth of grass which in civilization would have been a most valuable meadow for the rearing of cattle invested as it was by dense forests darkening the horizon at all points of the compass and folded in by tree clad ridges At the sound of our caravan the red antelope bounded away to our right and the left and frogs hushed their croak The sun shone hot and while traversing the valley we experienced a little of its real African fervour About half way across we came to a sluice of stagnant water which directly in the road of the caravan had settled down into an oozy pond The pagazis crossed a hastily constructed bridge thrown up a long time ago by some Washensi Samaritans It was an extraordinary affair rugged tree limbs resting on very unsteady forked piles and it had evidently tested the patience of many a loaded Mnyamwezi as it did those porters of our caravan Our weaker animals were unloaded the puddle between Bagamoyo and Genera having taught us prudence But this did not occasion much delay the men worked smartly under Shaw s supervision The turbid Kingani famous for its hippopotami was reached in a short time and we began to thread the jungle along its right bank until we were halted point blank by a narrow sluice having an immeasurable depth of black mud The difficulty presented by this was very grave though its breadth was barely eight feet the donkeys and least of all the horses could not be made to traverse two poles like our biped carriers neither could they be driven into the sluice where they would quickly founder The only available way of crossing it in safety was by means of a bridge to endure in this conservative land for generations as the handiwork of the Wasungu So we set to work there being no help for it with American axes the first of their kind the strokes of which ever rang in this part of the world to build a bridge Be sure it was made quickly for where the civilized white is found a difficulty must vanish The bridge was composed of six stout trees thrown across over these were laid crosswise fifteen pack saddles covered again with a thick layer of grass All the animals crossed it safely and then for a third time that morning the process of wading was performed The Kingani flowed northerly here and our course lay down its right bank A half mile in that direction through a jungle of giant reeds and extravagant climbers brought us to the ferry where the animals had to be again unloaded verily I wished when I saw its deep muddy waters that I possessed the power of Moses with his magic rod or what would have answered my purpose as well Aladdin s ring for then I could have found myself and party on the opposite side without further trouble but not having either of these gifts I issued orders for an immediate crossing for it was ill wishing sublime things before this most mundane prospect Kingwere the canoe paddler espying us from his brake covert on the opposite side civilly responded to our halloos and brought his huge hollowed tree skilfully over the whirling eddies of the river to where we stood waiting for him While one party loaded the canoe with our goods others got ready a long rape to fasten around the animals necks wherewith to haul them through the river to the other bank After seeing the work properly commenced I sat down on a condemned canoe to amuse myself with the hippopotami by peppering their thick skulls with my No twelve smooth bore The Winchester rifle calibre forty four a present from the honorable Edward Joy Morris our minister at Constantinople did no more than slightly tap them causing about as much injury as a boy s sling it was perfect in its accuracy of fire for ten times in succession I struck the tops of their heads between the ears One old fellow with the look of a sage was tapped close to the right ear by one of these bullets Instead of submerging himself as others had done he coolly turned round his head as if to ask Why this waste of valuable cartridges on us The response to the mute inquiry of his sageship was an ounce and a quarter bullet from the smooth bore which made him bellow with pain and in a few moments he rose up again tumbling in his death agonies As his groans were so piteous I refrained from a useless sacrifice of life and left the amphibious horde in peace A little knowledge concerning these uncouth inmates of the African waters was gained even during the few minutes we were delayed at the ferry When undisturbed by foreign sounds they congregate in shallow water on the sand bars with the fore half of their bodies exposed to the warm sunshine and are in appearance when thus somnolently reposing very like a herd of enormous swine When startled by the noise of an intruder they plunge hastily into the depths lashing the waters into a yellowish foam and scatter themselves below the surface when presently the heads of a few reappear snorting the water from their nostrils to take a fresh breath and a cautious scrutiny around them when thus we see but their ears forehead eyes and nostrils and as they hastily submerge again it requires a steady wrist and a quick hand to shoot them I have heard several comparisons made of their appearance while floating in this manner some Arabs told me before I had seen them that they looked like dead trees carried down the river others who in some country had seen hogs thought they resembled them but to my mind they look more like horses when swimming their curved necks and pointed ears their wide eyes and expanded nostrils favor greatly this comparison At night they seek the shore and wander several miles over the country luxuriating among its rank grasses To within four miles of the town of Bagamoyo the Kingani is eight miles distant their wide tracks are seen Frequently if not disturbed by the startling human voice they make a raid on the rich corn stalks of the native cultivators and a dozen of them will in a few minutes make a frightful havoc in a large field of this plant Consequently we were not surprised while delayed at the ferry to hear the owners of the corn venting loud halloos like the rosy cheeked farmer boys in England when scaring the crows away from the young wheat The caravan in the meanwhile had crossed safely bales baggage donkeys and men I had thought to have camped on the bank so as to amuse myself with shooting antelope and also for the sake of procuring their meat in order to save my goats of which I had a number constituting my live stock of provisions but thanks to the awe and dread which my men entertained of the hippopotami I was hurried on to the outpost of the Baluch garrison at Bagamoyo a small village called Kikoka distant four miles from the river The western side of the river was a considerable improvement upon the eastern The plain slowly heaving upwards as smoothly as the beach of a watering place for the distance of a mile until it culminated in a gentle and rounded ridge presented none of those difficulties which troubled us on the other side There were none of those cataclysms of mire and sloughs of black mud and over tall grasses none of that miasmatic jungle with its noxious emissions it was just such a scene as one may find before an English mansion a noble expanse of lawn and sward with boscage sufficient to agreeably diversify it After traversing the open plain the road led through a grove of young ebony trees where guinea fowls and a hartebeest were seen it then wound with all the characteristic eccentric curves of a goat path up and down a succession of land waves crested by the dark green foliage of the mango and the scantier and lighter coloured leaves of the enormous calabash The depressions were filled with jungle of more or less density while here and there opened glades shadowed even during noon by thin groves of towering trees At our approach fled in terror flocks of green pigeons jays ibis turtledoves golden pheasants quails and moorhens with crows and hawks while now and then a solitary pelican winged its way to the distance Nor was this enlivening prospect without its pairs of antelope and monkeys which hopped away like Australian kangaroos these latter were of good size with round bullet heads white breasts and long tails tufted at the end We arrived at Kikoka by five P M having loaded and unloaded our pack animals four times crossing one deep puddle a mud sluice and a river and performed a journey of eleven miles The settlement of Kikoka is a collection of straw huts not built after any architectural style but after a bastard form invented by indolent settlers from the Mrima and Zanzibar for the purpose of excluding as much sunshine as possible from the eaves and interior A sluice and some wells provide them with water which though sweet is not particularly wholesome or appetizing owing to the large quantities of decayed matter which is washed into it by the rains and is then left to corrupt in it A weak effort has been made to clear the neighbourhood for providing a place for cultivation but to the dire task of wood chopping and jungle clearing the settlers prefer occupying an open glade which they clear of grass so as to be able to hoe up two or three inches of soil into which they cast their seed confident of return The next day was a halt at Kikoka the fourth caravan consisting solely of Wanyamwezi proving a sore obstacle to a rapid advance Maganga its chief devised several methods of extorting more cloth and presents from me he having cost already more than any three chiefs together but his efforts were of no avail further than obtaining promises of reward if he would hurry on to Unyanyembe so that I might find my road clear On the two seven th the Wanyamwezi having started we broke camp soon after at seven am The country was of the same nature as that lying between the Kingani and Kikokaa park land attractive and beautiful in every feature I rode in advance to secure meat should a chance present itself but not the shadow of vert or venison did I see Ever in our front westerly rolled the land waves now rising now subsiding parallel one with the other like a ploughed field many times magnified Each ridge had its knot of jungle or its thin combing of heavily foliaged trees until we arrived close to Rosako our next halting place when the monotonous wavure of the land underwent a change breaking into independent hummocks clad with dense jungle On one of these veiled by an impenetrable jungle of thorny acacia rested Rosako girt round by its natural fortification neighbouring another village to the north of it similarly protected Between them sank a valley extremely fertile and bountiful in its productions bisected by a small stream which serves as a drain to the valley or low hills surrounding it Rosako is the frontier village of Ukwere while Kikoka is the north western extremity of Uzaramo We entered this village and occupied its central portion with our tents and animals A kitanda or square light bedstead without valance fringe or any superfluity whatever but nevertheless quite as comfortable as with them was brought to my tent for my use by the village chief The animals were immediately after being unloaded driven out to feed and the soldiers to a man set to work to pile the baggage up lest the rain which during the Masika season always appears imminent might cause irreparable damage Among other experiments which I was about to try in Africa was that of a good watch dog on any unmannerly people who would insist upon coming into my tent at untimely hours and endangering valuables Especially did I wish to try the effect of its bark on the mighty Wagogo who I was told by certain Arabs would lift the door of the tent and enter whether you wished them or not who would chuckle at the fear they inspired and say to you Hi hi white man I never saw the like of you before are there many more like you where do you come from Also would they take hold of your watch and ask you with a cheerful curiosity What is this for white man to which you of course would reply that it was to tell you the hour and minute But the Mgogo proud of his prowess and more unmannerly than a brute would answer you with a snort of insult I thought of a watch dog and procured a good one at Bombay not only as a faithful companion but to threaten the heels of just such gentry But soon after our arrival at Rosako it was found that the dog whose name was Omar given him from his Turkish origin was missing he had strayed away from the soldiers during a rain squall and had got lost I despatched Mabruki Burton back to Kikoka to search for him On the following morning just as we were about to leave Rosako the faithful fellow returned with the lost dog having found him at Kikoka Previous to our departure on the morning after this Maganga chief of the fourth caravan brought me the unhappy report that three of his pagazis were sick and he would like to have some dowa medicine Though not a doctor or in any way connected with the profession I had a well supplied medicine chest without which no traveller in Africa could live for just such a contingency as was now present On visiting Maganga s sick men I found one suffering from inflammation of the lungs another from the mukunguru African intermittent They all imagined themselves about to die and called loudly for Mama Mama though they were all grown men It was evident that the fourth caravan could not stir that day so leaving word with Magauga to hurry after me as soon as possible I issued orders for the march of my own Excepting in the neighbourhood of the villages which we have passed there were no traces of cultivation The country extending between the several stations is as much a wilderness as the desert of Sahara though it possesses a far more pleasing aspect Indeed had the first man at the time of the Creation gazed at his world and perceived it of the beauty which belongs to this part of Africa he would have had no cause of complaint In the deep thickets set like islets amid a sea of grassy verdure he would have found shelter from the noonday heat and a safe retirement for himself and spouse during the awesome darkness In the morning he could have walked forth on the sloping sward enjoyed its freshness and performed his ablutions in one of the many small streams flowing at its foot His garden of fruit trees is all that is required the noble forests deep and cool are round about him and in their shade walk as many animals as one can desire For days and days let a man walk in any direction north south east and west and he will behold the same scene Earnestly as I wished to hurry on to Unyanyembe still a heart felt anxiety about the arrival of my goods carried by the fourth caravan served as a drag upon me and before my caravan had marched nine miles my anxiety had risen to the highest pitch and caused me to order a camp there and then The place selected for it was near a long straggling sluice having an abundance of water during the rainy season draining as it does two extensive slopes No sooner had we pitched our camp built a boma of thorny acacia and other tree branches by stacking them round our camp and driven our animals to grass than we were made aware of the formidable number and variety of the insect tribe which for a time was another source of anxiety until a diligent examination of the several species dispelled it As it was a most interesting hunt which I instituted for the several specimens of the insects I here append the record of it for what it is worth My object in obtaining these specimens was to determine whether the genus Glossina morsitans of the naturalist or the tsetse sometimes called setse of Livingstone Vardon and Gumming said to be deadly to horses was amongst them Up to this date I had been nearly two months in East Africa and had as yet seen no tsetse and my horses instead of becoming emaciated for such is one of the symptoms of a tsetse bite had considerably improved in condition There were three different species of flies which sought shelter in my tent which unitedly kept up a continual chorus of sounds one performed the basso profondo another a tenor and the third a weak contralto The first emanated from a voracious and fierce fly an inch long having a ventral capacity for blood quite astonishing This larger fly was the one chosen for the first inspection which was of the intensest I permitted one to alight on my flannel pyjamas which I wore while en deshabille in camp No sooner had he alighted than his posterior was raised his head lowered and his weapons consisting of four hair like styles unsheathed from the proboscis like bag which concealed them and immediately I felt pain like that caused by a dexterous lancet cut or the probe of a fine needle I permitted him to gorge himself though my patience and naturalistic interest were sorely tried I saw his abdominal parts distend with the plenitude of the repast until it had swollen to three times its former shrunken girth when he flew away of his own accord laden with blood On rolling up my flannel pyjamas to see the fountain whence the fly had drawn the fluid I discovered it to be a little above the left knee by a crimson bead resting over the incision After wiping the blood the wound was similar to that caused by a deep thrust of a fine needle but all pain had vanished with the departure of the fly Having caught a specimen of this fly I next proceeded to institute a comparison between it and the tsetse as described by doctor Livingstone on pp fifty six fifty seven Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa Murray s edition of eighteen sixty eight The points of disagreement are many and such as to make it entirely improbable that this fly is the true tsetse though my men unanimously stated that its bite was fatal to horses as well as to donkeys A descriptive abstract of the tsetse would read thus Not much larger than a common house fly nearly of the same brown colour as the honey bee After part of the body has yellow bars across it It has a peculiar buzz and its bite is death to the horse ox and dog On man the bite has no effect neither has it on wild animals When allowed to feed on the hand it inserts the middle prong of three portions into which the proboscis divides it then draws the prong out a little way and it assumes a crimson colour as the mandibles come into brisk operation a slight itching irritation follows the bite The fly which I had under inspection is called mabunga by the natives It is much larger than the common housefly fully a third larger than the common honey bee and its colour more distinctly marked its head is black with a greenish gloss to it the after part of the body is marked by a white line running lengthwise from its junction with the trunk and on each side of this white line are two other lines one of a crimson colour the other of a light brown As for its buzz there is no peculiarity in it it might be mistaken for that of a honey bee When caught it made desperate efforts to get away but never attempted to bite This fly along with a score of others attacked my grey horse and bit it so sorely in the legs that they appeared as if bathed in blood Hence I might have been a little vengeful if with more than the zeal of an entomologist I caused it to disclose whatever peculiarities its biting parts possessed In order to bring this fly as life like as possible before my readers I may compare its head to most tiny miniature of an elephant s because it has a black proboscis and a pair of horny antennae which in colour and curve resemble tusks The black proboscis however the simply a hollow sheath which encloses when not in the act of biting four reddish and sharp lancets Under the microscope these four lancets differ in thickness two are very thick the third is slender but the fourth of an opal colour and almost transparent is exceedingly fine This last must be the sucker When the fly is about to wound the two horny antennae are made to embrace the part the lancets are unsheathed and on the instant the incision is performed This I consider to be the African horse fly The second fly which sang the tenor notes more nearly resembled in size and description the tsetse It was exceedingly nimble and it occupied three soldiers nearly an hour to capture a specimen and when it was finally caught it stung most ravenously the hand and never ceased its efforts to attack until it was pinned through It had three or four white marks across the after part of its body but the biting parts of this fly consisted of two black antennae and an opal coloured style which folded away under the neck When about to bite this style was shot out straight and the antennae embraced it closely After death the fly lost its distinctive white marks Only one of this species did we see at this camp The third fly called chufwa pitched a weak alto crescendo note was a third larger than the house fly and had long wings If this insect sang the feeblest note it certainly did the most work and inflicted the most injury Horses and donkeys streamed with blood and reared and kicked through the pain So determined was it not to be driven before it obtained its fill that it was easily despatched but this dreadful enemy to cattle constantly increased in numbers The three species above named are according to natives fatal to cattle and this may perhaps be the reason why such a vast expanse of first class pasture is without domestic cattle of any kind a few goats only being kept by the villagers This fly I subsequently found to be the tsetse On the second morning instead of proceeding I deemed it more prudent to await the fourth caravan Burton experimented sufficiently for me on the promised word of the Banyans of Kaole and Zanzibar and waited eleven months before he received the promised articles As I did not expect to be much over that time on my errand altogether it would be ruin absolute and irremediable should I be detained at Unyanyembe so long a time by my caravan Pending its arrival I sought the pleasures of the chase I was but a tyro in hunting I confess though I had shot a little on the plains of America and Persia yet I considered myself a fair shot and on game ground and within a reasonable proximity to game I doubted not but I could bring some to camp After a march of a mile through the tall grass of the open we gained the glades between the jungles Unsuccessful here after ever so much prying into fine hiding places and lurking corners I struck a trail well traversed by small antelope and hartebeest which we followed It led me into a jungle and down a watercourse bisecting it but after following it for an hour I lost it and in endeavouring to retrace it lost my way However my pocket compass stood me in good stead and by it I steered for the open plain in the centre of which stood the camp But it was terribly hard work this of plunging through an African jungle ruinous to clothes and trying to the cuticle In order to travel quickly I had donned a pair of flannel pyjamas and my feet were encased in canvas shoes As might be expected before I had gone a few paces a branch of the acacia horrida only one of a hundred such annoyances caught the right leg of my pyjamas at the knee and ripped it almost clean off succeeding which a stumpy kolquall caught me by the shoulder and another rip was the inevitable consequence A few yards farther on a prickly aloetic plant disfigured by a wide tear the other leg of my pyjamas and almost immediately I tripped against a convolvulus strong as ratline and was made to measure my length on a bed of thorns It was on all fours like a hound on a scent that I was compelled to travel my solar topee getting the worse for wear every minute my skin getting more and more wounded my clothes at each step becoming more and more tattered Besides these discomforts there was a pungent acrid plant which apart from its strong odorous emissions struck me smartly on the face leaving a burning effect similar to cayenne and the atmosphere pent in by the density of the jungle was hot and stifling and the perspiration transuded through every pore making my flannel tatters feel as if I had been through a shower When I had finally regained the plain and could breathe free I mentally vowed that the penetralia of an African jungle should not be visited by me again save under most urgent necessity The second and third day passed without any news of Maganga Accordingly Shaw and Bombay were sent to hurry him up by all means On the fourth morning Shaw and Bombay returned followed by the procrastinating Maganga and his laggard people Questions only elicited an excuse that his men had been too sick and he had feared to tax their strength before they were quite equal to stand the fatigue Moreover he suggested that as they would be compelled to stay one day more at the camp I might push on to Kingaru and camp there until his arrival Acting upon which suggestion I broke camp and started for Kingaru distant five miles On this march the land was more broken and the caravan first encountered jungle which gave considerable trouble to our cart Pisolitic limestone cropped out in boulders and sheets and we began to imagine ourselves approaching healthy highlands and as if to give confirmation to the thought to the north and north west loomed the purple cones of Udoe and topmost of all Dilima Peak about fifteen hundred feet in height above the sea level But soon after sinking into a bowl like valley green with tall corn the road slightly deviated from north west to west the country still rolling before us in wavy undulations In one of the depressions between these lengthy land swells stood the village of Kingaru with surroundings significant in their aspect of ague and fever Perhaps the clouds surcharged with rain and the overhanging ridges and their dense forests dulled by the gloom made the place more than usually disagreeable but my first impressions of the sodden hollow pent in by those dull woods with the deep gully close by containing pools of stagnant water were by no means agreeable Before we could arrange our camp and set the tents up down poured the furious harbinger of the Masika season in torrents sufficient to damp the ardor and newborn love for East Africa I had lately manifested However despite rain we worked on until our camp was finished and the property was safely stored from weather and thieves and we could regard with resignation the raindrops beating the soil into mud of a very tenacious kind and forming lakelets and rivers of our camp ground Towards night the scene having reached its acme of unpleasantness the rain ceased and the natives poured into camp from the villages in the woods with their vendibles Foremost among these as if in duty bound came the village sultan lord chief or head bearing three measures of matama and half a measure of rice of which he begged with paternal smiles my acceptance But under his smiling mask bleared eyes and wrinkled front was visible the soul of trickery which was of the cunningest kind Responding under the same mask adopted by this knavish elder I said The chief of Kingaru has called me a rich sultan If I am a rich sultan why comes not the chief with a rich present to me that he might get a rich return Said he with another leer of his wrinkled visage Kingaru is poor there is no matama in the village To which I replied that since there was no matama in the village I would pay him half a shukka or a yard of cloth which would be exactly equivalent to his present that if he preferred to call his small basketful a present I should be content to call my yard of cloth a present With which logic he was fain to be satisfied April first To day the Expedition suffered a loss in the death of the grey Arab horse presented by Seyd Burghash Sultan of Zanzibar The night previous I had noticed that the horse was suffering Bearing in mind what has been so frequently asserted namely that no horses could live in the interior of Africa because of the tsetse I had him opened and the stomach which I believed to be diseased examined Besides much undigested matama and grass there were found twenty five short thick white worms sticking like leeches into the coating of the stomach while the intestines were almost alive with the numbers of long white worms I was satisfied that neither man nor beast could long exist with such a mass of corrupting life within him In order that the dead carcase might not taint the valley I had it buried deep in the ground about a score of yards from the encampment From such a slight cause ensued a tremendous uproar from Kingaru chief of the village who with his brother chiefs of neighbouring villages numbering in the aggregate two dozen wattled huts had taken counsel upon the best means of mulcting the Musungu of a full doti or two of Merikani and finally had arrived at the conviction that the act of burying a dead horse in their soil without By your leave sir was a grievous and fineable fault Affecting great indignation at the unpardonable omission he Kingaru concluded to send to the Musungu four of his young men to say to him that since you have buried your horse in my ground it is well let him remain there but you must pay me two doti of Merikani For reply the messengers were told to say to the chief that I would prefer talking the matter over with himself face to face if he would condescend to visit me in my tent once again As the village was but a stone s throw from our encampment before many minutes had elapsed the wrinkled elder made his appearance at the door of my tent with about half the village behind him The following dialogue which took place will serve to illustrate the tempers of the people with whom I was about to have a year s trading intercourse White Man Are you the great chief of Kingaru Kingaru Huh uh Yes W M The great great chief Kingaru Huh uh Yes W M How many soldiers have you Kingaru Why W M How many fighting men have you Kingaru None W M Oh I thought you might have a thousand men with you by your going to fine a strong white man who has plenty of guns and soldiers two doti for burying a dead horse Kingaru rather perplexed No I have no soldiers I have only a few young men W M Why do you come and make trouble then Kingaru It was not I it was my brothers who said to me Come here come here Kingaru see what the white man has done Has he not taken possession of your soil in that he has put his horse into your ground without your permission Come go to him and see by what right Therefore have I come to ask you who gave you permission to use my soil for a burying ground W M I want no man s permission to do what is right My horse died had I left him to fester and stink in your valley sickness would visit your village your water would become unwholesome and caravans would not stop here for trade for they would say This is an unlucky spot let us go away But enough said I understand you to say that you do not want him buried in your ground the error I have fallen into is easily put right This minute my soldiers shall dig him out again and cover up the soil as it was before and the horse shall be left where he died Then shouting to Bombay Ho Bombay take soldiers with jembes to dig my horse out of the ground drag him to where he died and make everything ready for a march to morrow morning Kingaru his voice considerably higher and his head moving to and fro with emotion cries out Akuna akuna bana No no master Let not the white man get angry The horse is dead and now lies buried let him remain so since he is already there and let us be friends again The Sheikh of Kingaru being thus brought to his senses we bid each other the friendly Kwaheri and I was left alone to ruminate over my loss Barely half an hour had elapsed it was nine P M the camp was in a semi doze when I heard deep groans issuing from one of the animals Upon inquiry as to what animal was suffering I was surprised to hear that it was my bay horse With a bull s eye lantern I visited him and perceived that the pain was located in the stomach but whether it was from some poisonous plant he had eaten while out grazing or from some equine disease I did not know He discharged copious quantities of loose matter but there was nothing peculiar in its colour The pain was evidently very great for his struggles were very violent I was up all night hoping that it was but a temporary effect of some strange and noxious plant but at six o clock the next morning after a short period of great agony he also died exactly fifteen hours after his companion When the stomach was opened it was found that death was caused by the internal rupture of a large cancer which had affected the larger half of the coating of his stomach and had extended an inch or two up the larynx The contents of the stomach and intestines were deluged with the yellow viscous efflux from the cancer I was thus deprived of both my horses and that within the short space of fifteen hours With my limited knowledge of veterinary science however strengthened by the actual and positive proofs obtained by the dissection of the two stomachs I can scarcely state that horses can live to reach Unyanyembe or that they can travel with ease through this part of East Africa But should I have occasion at some future day I should not hesitate to take four horses with me though I should certainly endeavour to ascertain previous to purchase whether they were perfectly sound and healthy and to those travellers who cherish a good horse I would say Try one and be not discouraged by my unfortunate experiences The first second and third of April passed and nothing had we heard or seen of the ever lagging fourth caravan In the meanwhile the list of casualties was being augmented Besides the loss of this precious time through the perverseness of the chief of the other caravan and the loss of my two horses a pagazi carrying boat fixtures improved the opportunity and deserted Selim was struck down with a severe attack of ague and fever and was soon after followed by the cook then by the assistant cook and tailor Abdul Kader Finally before the third day was over Bombay had rheumatism Uledi Grant s old valet had a swollen throat Zaidi had the flux Kingaru had the mukunguru Khamisi a pagazi suffered from a weakness of the loins Farjalla had a bilious fever and before night closed Makoviga was very ill Out of a force of twenty five men one had deserted and ten were on the sick list and the presentiment that the ill looking neighbourhood of Kingaru would prove calamitous to me was verified On the fourth April Maganga and his people appeared after being heralded by musketry shots and horn blowing the usual signs of an approaching caravan in this land His sick men were considerably improved but they required one more day of rest at Kingaru In the afternoon he came to lay siege to my generosity by giving details of Soor Hadji Palloo s heartless cheats upon him but I informed him that since I had left Bagamoyo I could no longer be generous we were now in a land where cloth was at a high premium that I had no more cloth than I should need to furnish food for myself and men that he and his caravan had cost me more money and trouble than any three caravans I had as indeed was the case With this counter statement he was obliged to be content But I again solved his pecuniary doubts by promising that if he hurried his caravan on to Unyanyembe he should have no cause of complaint The fifth of April saw the fourth caravan vanish for once in our front with a fair promise that however fast we should follow we should not see them the hither side of Sinbamwenni The following morning in order to rouse my people from the sickened torpitude they had lapsed into I beat an exhilarating alarum on a tin pan with an iron ladle intimating that a sofari was about to be undertaken This had a very good effect judging from the extraordinary alacrity with which it was responded to Before the sun rose we started The Kingaru villagers were out with the velocity of hawks for any rags or refuse left behind us The long march to Imbiki fifteen miles proved that our protracted stay at Kingaru had completely demoralized my soldiers and pagazis Only a few of them had strength enough to reach Imbiki before night The others attending the laden donkeys put in an appearance next morning in a lamentable state of mind and body Khamisi the pagazi with the weak loins had deserted taking with him two goats the property tent and the whole of Uledi s personal wealth consisting of his visiting dish dasheh a long shirt of the Arabic pattern ten lbs of beads and a few fine cloths which Uledi in a generous fit had intrusted to him while he carried the pagazi s load seventy lbs of Bubu beads This defalcation was not to be overlooked nor should Khamisi be permitted to return without an effort to apprehend him Accordingly Uledi and Ferajji were despatched in pursuit while we rested at Imbiki in order to give the dilapidated soldiers and animals time to recruit On the eighth we continued our journey and arrived at Msuwa This march will be remembered by our caravan as the most fatiguing of all though the distance was but ten miles It was one continuous jungle except three interjacent glades of narrow limits which gave us three breathing pauses in the dire task of jungle travelling The odour emitted from its fell plants was so rank so pungently acrid and the miasma from its decayed vegetation so dense that I expected every moment to see myself and men drop down in paroxysms of acute fever Happily this evil was not added to that of loading and unloading the frequently falling packs Seven soldiers to attend seventeen laden donkeys were entirely too small a number while passing through a jungle for while the path is but a foot wide with a wall of thorny plants and creepers bristling on each side and projecting branches darting across it with knots of spikey twigs stiff as spike nails ready to catch and hold anything above four feet in height it is but reasonable to suppose that donkeys standing four feet high with loads measuring across from bale to bale four feet would come to grief This grief was of frequent recurrence here causing us to pause every few minutes for re arrangements So often had this task to be performed that the men got perfectly discouraged and had to bespoken to sharply before they set to work By the time I reached Msuwa there was nobody with me and the ten donkeys I drove but Mabruk the Little who though generally stolid stood to his work like a man Bombay and Uledi were far behind with the most jaded donkeys Shaw was in charge of the cart and his experiences were most bitter as he informed me he had expended a whole vocabulary of stormy abuse known to sailors and a new one which he had invented ex tempore He did not arrive until two o clock next morning and was completely worn out Another halt was fixed at Msuwa that we and our animals might recuperate The chief of the village a white man in everything but colour sent me and mine the fattest broad tailed sheep of his flock with five measures of matama grain The mutton was excellent unapproachable For his timely and needful present I gave him two doti and amused him with an exhibition of the wonderful mechanism of the Winchester rifle and my breechloading revolvers He and his people were intelligent enough to comprehend the utility of these weapons at an emergency and illustrated in expressive pantomime the powers they possessed against numbers of people armed only with spears and bows by extending their arms with an imaginary gun and describing a clear circle Verily said they the Wasungu are far wiser than the Washensi What heads they have What wonderful things they make Look at their tents their guns their time pieces their clothes and that little rolling thing the cart which carries more than five men que On the tenth recovered from the excessive strain of the last march the caravan marched out of Msuwa accompanied by the hospitable villagers as far as their stake defence receiving their unanimous Kwaheris Outside the village the march promised to be less arduous than between Imbiki and Msuwa After crossing a beautiful little plain intersected by a dry gully or mtoni the route led by a few cultivated fields where the tillers greeted us with one grand unwinking stare as if fascinated Soon after we met one of those sights common in part of the world to wit a chain slave gang bound east The slaves did not appear to be in any way down hearted on the contrary they seemed imbued with the philosophic jollity of the jolly servant of Martin Chuzzlewit Were it not for their chains it would have been difficult to discover master from slave the physiognomic traits were alike the mild benignity with which we were regarded was equally visible on all faces The chains were ponderous they might have held elephants captive but as the slaves carried nothing but themselves their weight could not have been insupportable The jungle was scant on this march and though in some places the packs met with accidents they were not such as seriously to retard progress By ten A M we were in camp in the midst of an imposing view of green sward and forest domed by a cloudless sky We had again pitched our camp in the wilderness and as is the custom of caravans fired two shots to warn any Washensi having grain to sell that we were willing to trade Our next halting place was Kisemo distant but eleven miles from Msuwa a village situated in a populous district having in its vicinity no less than five other villages each fortified by stakes and thorny abattis with as much fierce independence as if their petty lords were so many Percys and Douglasses Each topped a ridge or a low hummock with an assumption of defiance of the cock on its own dunghill type Between these humble eminences and low ridges of land wind narrow vales which are favored with the cultivation of matama and Indian corn Behind the village flows the Ungerengeri River an impetuous stream during the Masika season capable of overflowing its steep banks but in the dry season it subsides into its proper status which is that of a small stream of very clear sweet water Its course from Kisemo is south west then easterly it is the main feeder of the Kingani River The belles of Kisemo are noted for their vanity in brass wire which is wound in spiral rings round their wrists and ankles and the varieties of style which their hispid heads exhibit while their poor lords obliged to be contented with dingy torn clouts and split ears show what wide sway Asmodeus holds over this terrestrial sphere for it must have been an unhappy time when the hard besieged husbands finally gave way before their spouses Besides these brassy ornaments on their extremities and the various hair dressing styles the women of Kisemo frequently wear lengthy necklaces which run in rivers of colours down their bodies A more comical picture is seldom presented than that of one of these highly dressed females engaged in the homely and necessary task of grinding corn for herself and family The grinding apparatus consists of two portions one a thick pole of hard wood about six feet long answering for a pestle the other a capacious wooden mortar three feet in height While engaged in setting his tent Shaw was obliged to move a small flat stone to drive a peg into the ground The village chief who saw him do it rushed up in a breathless fashion and replaced the stone instantly then stood on it in an impressive manner indicative of the great importance attached to that stone and location Bombay seeing Shaw standing in silent wonder at the act volunteered to ask the chief what was the matter The Sheikh solemnly answered with a finger pointing downward Uganga Whereupon I implored him to let me see what was under the stone With a graciousness quite affecting he complied My curiosity was gratified with the sight of a small whittled stick which pinned fast to the ground an insect the cause of a miscarriage to a young female of the village During the afternoon Uledi and Ferajji who had been despatched after the truant Khamisi returned with him and all the missing articles Khamisi soon after leaving the road and plunging into the jungle where he was mentally triumphing in his booty was met by some of the plundering Washensi who are always on the qui vive for stragglers and unceremoniously taken to their village in the woods and bound to a tree preparatory to being killed Khamisi said that he asked them why they tied him up to which they answered that they were about to kill him because he was a Mgwana whom they were accustomed to kill as soon as they were caught But Uledi and Ferajji shortly after coming upon the scene both well armed put an end to the debates upon Khamisi s fate by claiming him as an absconding pagazi from the Musungu s camp as well as all the articles he possessed at the time of capture The robbers did not dispute the claim for the pagazi goats tent or any other valuable found with him but intimated that they deserved a reward for apprehending him The demand being considered just a reward to the extent of two doti and a fundo or ten necklaces of beads was given Khamisi for his desertion and attempted robbery could not be pardoned without first suffering punishment He had asked at Bagamoyo before enlisting in my service an advance of five dollars in money and had received it and a load of Bubu beads no heavier than a pagazis load had been given him to carry he had therefore no excuse for desertion Lest I should overstep prudence however in punishing him I convened a court of eight pagazis and four soldiers to sit in judgment and asked them to give me their decision as to what should be done Their unanimous verdict was that he was guilty of a crime almost unknown among the Wanyamwezi pagazis and as it was likely to give bad repute to the Wanyamwezi carriers they therefore sentenced him to be flogged with the Great Master s donkey whip which was accordingly carried out to poor Khamisi s crying sorrow On the twelfth the caravan reached Mussoudi on the Ungerengeri river Happily for our patient donkeys this march was free from all the annoying troubles of the jungle Happily for ourselves also for we had no more the care of the packs and the anxiety about arriving at camp before night The packs once put firmly on the backs of our good donkeys they marched into camp the road being excellent without a single displacement or cause for one impatient word soon after leaving Kisemo A beautiful prospect glorious in its wild nature fragrant with its numerous flowers and variety of sweetly smelling shrubs among which I recognised the wild sage the indigo plant c terminated only at the foot of Kira Peak and sister cones which mark the boundaries between Udoe and Ukami yet distant twenty miles Those distant mountains formed a not unfit background to this magnificent picture of open plain forest patches and sloping lawns there was enough of picturesqueness and sublimity in the blue mountains to render it one complete whole Suppose a Byron saw some of these scenes he would be inclined to poetize in this manner Morn dawns and with it stern Udoe s hills Dark Urrugum s rocks and Kira s peak Robed half in mist bedewed with various rills Arrayed in many a dun and purple streak When drawing near the valley of Ungerengeri granite knobs and protuberances of dazzling quartz showed their heads above the reddish soil Descending the ridge where these rocks were prominent we found ourselves in the sable loam deposit of the Ungerengeri and in the midst of teeming fields of sugar cane and matama Indian corn muhogo and gardens of curry egg and cucumber plants On the banks of the Ungerengeri flourished the banana and overtopping it by seventy feet and more shot up the stately mparamusi the rival in beauty of the Persian chenar and Abyssinian plane Its trunk is straight and comely enough for the mainmast of a first class frigate while its expanding crown of leafage is distinguished from all others by its density and vivid greenness There were a score of varieties of the larger kind of trees whose far extending branches embraced across the narrow but swift river The depressions of the valley and the immediate neighbourhood of the river were choked with young forests of tiger grass and stiff reeds Mussoudi is situated on a higher elevation than the average level of the village and consequently looks down upon its neighbours which number a hundred and more It is the western extremity of Ukwere On the western bank of the Ungerengeri the territory of the Wakami commences We had to halt one day at Mussoudi because the poverty of the people prevented us from procuring the needful amount of grain The cause of this scantiness in such a fertile and populous valley was that the numerous caravans which had preceded us had drawn heavily for their stores for the upmarches On the fourteenth we crossed the Ungerengeri which here flows southerly to the southern extremity of the valley where it bends easterly as far as Kisemo After crossing the river here fordable at all times and only twenty yards in breadth we had another mile of the valley with its excessively moist soil and rank growth of grass It then ascended into a higher elevation and led through a forest of mparamusi tamarind tamarisk acacia and the blooming mimosa This ascent was continued for two hours when we stood upon the spine of the largest ridge where we could obtain free views of the wooded plain below and the distant ridges of Kisemo which we had but lately left A descent of a few hundred feet terminated in a deep but dry mtoni with a sandy bed on the other side of which we had to regain the elevation we had lost and a similar country opened into view until we found a newly made boma with well built huts of grass rear a pool of water which we at once occupied as a halting place for the night The cart gave us considerable trouble not even our strongest donkey though it carried with ease on its back one hundred ninety six lbs could draw the cart with a load of only two hundred twenty five lbs weight Early on the morning of the fifteenth we broke camp and started for Mikeseh By eight point thirty A M we were ascending the southern face of the Kira Peak When we had gained the height of two hundred feet above the level of the surrounding country we were gratified with a magnificent view of a land whose soil knows no Sabbath After travelling the spine of a ridge abutting against the southern slope of Kira we again descended into the little valley of Kiwrima the first settlement we meet in Udoe where there is always an abundant supply of water Two miles west of Kiwrima is Mikiseh On the sixteenth we reached Ulagalla after a few hours march Ulagalla is the name of a district or a portion of a district lying between the mountains of Uruguru which bound it southerly and the mountains of Udoe lying northerly and parallel with them and but ten miles apart The principal part of the basin thus formed is called Ulagalla Muhalleh is the next settlement and here we found ourselves in the territory of the Waseguhha On this march we were hemmed in by mountains on our left by those of Uruguru on our right by those of Udoe and Useguhha a most agreeable and welcome change to us after the long miles of monotonous level we had hitherto seen When tired of looking into the depths of the forest that still ran on either side of the road we had but to look up to the mountain s base to note its strange trees its plants and vari coloured flowers we had but to raise our heads to vary this pleasant occupation by observing the lengthy and sinuous spine of the mountains and mentally report upon their outline their spurs their projections and ravines their bulging rocks and deep clefts and above all the dark green woods clothing them from summit to base And when our attention was not required for the mundane task of regarding the donkeys packs or the pace of the cautious stepping pagazis it was gratifying to watch the vapours play about the mountain summits to see them fold into fleecy crowns and fantastic clusters dissolve gather together into a pall that threatened rain and sail away again before the brightening sun At Muhalleh was the fourth caravan under Maganga with three more sick men who turned with eager eyes to myself the dispenser of medicine as I approached Salvos of small arms greeted me and a present of rice and ears of Indian corn for roasting were awaiting my acceptance but as I told Maganga I would have preferred to hear that his party were eight or ten marches ahead At this camp also we met Salim bin Rashid bound eastward with a huge caravan carrying three hundred ivory tusks This good Arab besides welcoming the new comer with a present of rice gave me news of Livingstone He had met the old traveller at Ujiji had lived in the next but to him for two weeks described him as looking old with long grey moustaches and beard just recovered from severe illness looking very wan when fully recovered Livingstone intended to visit a country called Manyema by way of Marungu The valley of the Ungerengeri with Muhalleh exhibits wonderful fertility Its crops of matama were of the tallest and its Indian corn would rival the best crops ever seen in the Arkansas bottoms The numerous mountain fed streams rendered the great depth of loam very sloppy in consequence of which several accidents occurred before we reached the camp such as wetting cloth mildewing tea watering sugar and rusting tools but prompt attention to these necessary things saved us from considerable loss There was a slight difference noticed in the demeanour and bearing of the Waseguhha compared with the Wadoe Wakami and Wakwere heretofore seen There was none of that civility we had been until now pleased to note their express desire to barter was accompanied with insolent hints that we ought to take their produce at their own prices If we remonstrated they became angry retorting fiercely impatient of opposition they flew into a passion and were glib in threats This strange conduct so opposite to that of the calm and gentle Wakwere may be excellently illustrated by comparing the manner of the hot headed Greek with that of the cool and collected German Necessity compelled us to purchase eatables of them and to the credit of the country and its productions be it said their honey had the peculiar flavour of that of famed Hymettus Following the latitudinal valley of the Ungerengeri within two hours on the following morning we passed close under the wall of the capital of Useguhha Simbamwenni The first view of the walled town at the western foot of the Uruguru mountains with its fine valley abundantly beautiful watered by two rivers and several pellucid streams of water distilled by the dew and cloud enriched heights around was one that we did not anticipate to meet in Eastern Africa In Mazanderan Persia such a scene would have answered our expectations but here it was totally unexpected The town may contain a population of three thousand having about one thousand houses being so densely crowded perhaps five thousand would more closely approximate The houses in the town are eminently African but of the best type of construction The fortifications are on an Arabic Persic model combining Arab neatness with Persian plan Through a ride of nine hundred fifty miles in Persia I never met a town outside of the great cities better fortified than Simbamwenni In Persia the fortifications were of mud even those of Kasvin Teheran Ispahan and Shiraz those of Simbamwenni are of stone pierced with two rows of loopholes for musketry The area of the town is about half a square mile its plan being quadrangular Well built towers of stone guard each corner four gates one facing each cardinal point and set half way between the several towers permit ingress and egress for its inhabitants The gates are closed with solid square doors made of African teak and carved with the infinitesimally fine and complicated devices of the Arabs from which I suspect that the doors were made either at Zanzibar or on the coast and conveyed to Simbamwenni plank by plank yet as there is much communication between Bagamoyo and Simbamwenni it is just possible that native artisans are the authors of this ornate workmanship as several doors chiselled and carved in the same manner though not quite so elaborately were visible in the largest houses The palace of the Sultan is after the style of those on the coast with long sloping roof wide eaves and veranda in front The Sultana is the eldest daughter of the famous Kisabengo a name infamous throughout the neighbouring countries of Udoe Ukami Ukwere Kingaru Ukwenni and Kiranga Wanna for his kidnapping propensities Kisabengo was another Theodore on a small scale Sprung from humble ancestry he acquired distinction for his personal strength his powers of harangue and his amusing and versatile address by which he gained great ascendency over fugitive slaves and was chosen a leader among them Fleeing from justice which awaited him at the hands of the Zanzibar Sultan he arrived in Ukami which extended at that time from Ukwere to Usagara and here he commenced a career of conquest the result of which was the cession by the Wakami of an immense tract of fertile country in the valley of the Ungerengeri On its most desirable site with the river flowing close under the walls he built his capital and called it Simbamwenni which means The Lion or the strongest City In old age the successful robber and kidnapper changed his name of Kisabengo which had gained such a notoriety to Simbamwenni after his town and when dying after desiring that his eldest daughter should succeed him he bestowed the name of the town upon her also which name of Simbamwenni the Sultana now retains and is known by While crossing a rapid stream which as I said before flowed close to the walls the inhabitants of Simbamwenni had a fine chance of gratifying their curiosity of seeing the Great Musungu whose several caravans had preceded him and who unpardonably because unlicensed had spread a report of his great wealth and power I was thus the object of a universal stare At one time on the banks there were considerably over a thousand natives going through the several tenses and moods of the verb to stare or exhibiting every phase of the substantive viz the stare peremptory insolent sly cunning modest and casual The warriors of the Sultana holding in one hand the spear the bow and sheaf or musket embraced with the other their respective friends like so many models of Nisus and Euryalus Theseus and Pirithous Damon and Pythias or Achilles and Patroclus to whom they confidentially related their divers opinions upon my dress and colour The words Musungu kuba had as much charm for these people as the music of the Pied Piper had for the rats of Hamelin since they served to draw from within the walls across their stream so large a portion of the population and when I continued the journey to the Ungerengeri distant four miles I feared that the Hamelin catastrophe might have to be repeated before I could rid myself of them But fortunately for my peace of mind they finally proved vincible under the hot sun and the distance we had to go to camp As we were obliged to overhaul the luggage and repair saddles as well as to doctor a few of the animals whose backs had by this time become very sore I determined to halt here two days Provisions were very plentiful also at Simbamwenni though comparatively dear On the second day I was for the first time made aware that my acclimatization in the ague breeding swamps of Arkansas was powerless against the mukunguru of East Africa The premonitory symptoms of the African type were felt in my system at ten A M First general lassitude prevailed with a disposition to drowsiness secondly came the spinal ache which commencing from the loins ascended the vertebrae and extended around the ribs until it reached the shoulders where it settled into a weary pain thirdly came a chilliness over the whole body which was quickly followed by a heavy head swimming eyes and throbbing temples with vague vision which distorted and transformed all objects of sight This lasted until ten P M and the mukunguru left me much prostrated in strength The remedy applied for three mornings in succession after the attack was such as my experience in Arkansas had taught me was the most powerful corrective viz a quantum of fifteen grains of quinine taken in three doses of five grains each every other hour from dawn to meridian the first dose to be taken immediately after the first effect of the purging medicine taken at bedtime the night previous I may add that this treatment was perfectly successful in my case and in all others which occurred in my camp After the mukunguru had declared itself there was no fear with such a treatment of it of a second attack until at least some days afterwards On the third day the camp was visited by the ambassadors of Her Highness the Sultana of Simbamwenni who came as her representatives to receive the tribute which she regards herself as powerful enough to enforce But they as well as Madame Simbamwenni were informed that as we knew it was their custom to charge owners of caravans but one tribute and as they remembered the Musungu Farquhar had paid already it was not fair that I should have to pay again The ambassadors replied with a Ngema very well and promised to carry my answer back to their mistress Though it was by no means very well in fact as it will be seen in a subsequent chapter how the female Simbamwenni took advantage of an adverse fortune which befell me to pay herself With this I close the chapter of incidents experienced during our transit across the maritime region CHAPTER VI TO UGOGO A valley of despond and hot bed of malaria Myriads of vermin The Makata swamp A sorrowful experience catching a deserter A far embracing prospect Illness of William Farquhar Lake Ugombo A land of promise The great Kisesa The plague of earwigs The distance from Bagamoyo to Simbamwenni we found to be one hundred nineteen miles and was accomplished in fourteen marches But these marches owing to difficulties arising from the Masika season and more especially to the lagging of the fourth caravan under Maganga extended to twenty nine days thus rendering our progress very slow indeed but a little more than four miles a day I infer from what I have seen of the travelling that had I not been encumbered by the sick Wanyamwezi porters I could have accomplished the distance in sixteen days For it was not the donkeys that proved recreant to my confidence they poor animals carrying a weight of one hundred fifty lbs each arrived at Simbamwenni in first rate order but it was Maganga composed of greed and laziness and his weakly bodied tribe who were ever falling sick In dry weather the number of marches might have been much reduced Of the half dozen of Arabs or so who preceded this Expedition along this route two accomplished the entire distance in eight days From the brief descriptions given of the country as it day by day expanded to our view enough may be gleaned to give readers a fair idea of it The elevation of Simbamwenni cannot be much over one thousand feet above the level the rise of the land having been gradual It being the rainy season about which so many ominous statements were doled out to us by those ignorant of the character of the country we naturally saw it under its worst aspect but even in this adverse phase of it with all its depth of black mud its excessive dew its dripping and chill grass its density of rank jungle and its fevers I look back upon the scene with pleasure for the wealth and prosperity it promises to some civilized nation which in some future time will come and take possession of it A railroad from Bagamoyo to Simbamwenni might be constructed with as much ease and rapidity as and at far less cost than the Union Pacific Railway whose rapid strides day by day towards completion the world heard of and admired A residence in this part of Africa after a thorough system of drainage had been carried out would not be attended with more discomfort than generally follows upon the occupation of new land The temperature at this season during the day never exceeded eighty five degrees Fahrenheit The nights were pleasant too cold without a pair of blankets for covering and as far as Simbamwenni they were without that pest which is so dreadful on the Nebraska and Kansas prairies the mosquito The only annoyances I know of that would tell hard on the settler is the determined ferocity of the mabungu or horse fly the chufwa c already described which until the dense forests and jungles were cleared would be certain to render the keeping of domestic cattle unremunerative Contrary to expectation the Expedition was not able to start at the end of two days the third and the fourth days were passed miserably enough in the desponding valley of Ungerengeri This river small as it is in the dry seasons becomes of considerable volume and power during the Masika as we experienced to our sorrow It serves as a drain to a score of peaks and two long ranges of mountains winding along their base it is the recipient of the cascades seen flashing during the few intervals of sunlight of all the nullahs and ravines which render the lengthy frontage of the mountain slopes so rugged and irregular until it glides into the valley of Simbamwenni a formidable body of water opposing a serious obstacle to caravans without means to build bridges added to which was an incessant downfall of rain such a rain as shuts people in doors and renders them miserable and unamiable a real London rain an eternal drizzle accompanied with mist and fog When the sun shone it appeared but a pale image of itself and old pagazis wise in their traditions as old whaling captains shook their heads ominously at the dull spectre and declared it was doubtful if the rain would cease for three weeks yet The site of the caravan camp on the hither side of the Ungerengeri was a hot bed of malaria unpleasant to witness an abomination to memory The filth of generations of pagazis had gathered innumerable hosts of creeping things Armies of black white and red ants infest the stricken soil centipedes like worms of every hue clamber over shrubs and plants hanging to the undergrowth are the honey combed nests of yellow headed wasps with stings as harmful as scorpions enormous beetles as large as full grown mice roll dunghills over the ground of all sorts shapes sizes and hues are the myriad fold vermin with which the ground teems in short the richest entomological collection could not vie in variety and numbers with the species which the four walls of my tent enclosed from morning until night On the fifth morning or the twenty third April the rain gave us a few hours respite during which we managed to wade through the Stygian quagmire reeking with noisomeness to the inundated river bank The soldiers commenced at five A M to convey the baggage across from bank to bank over a bridge which was the most rustic of the rustic kind Only an ignorant African would have been satisfied with its small utility as a means to cross a deep and rapid body of water Even for light footed Wanyamwezi pagazis it was anything but comfortable to traverse Only a professional tight rope performer could have carried a load across with ease To travel over an African bridge requires first a long leap from land to the limb of a tree which may or may not be covered by water followed by a long jump ashore With seventy lbs weight on his back the carrier finds it difficult enough Sometimes he is assisted by ropes extemporized from the long convolvuli which hang from almost every tree but not always these being deemed superfluities by the Washensi Fortunately the baggage was transferred without a single accident and though the torrent was strong the donkeys were dragged through the flood by vigorous efforts and much objurgation without a casualty This performance of crossing the Ungerengeri occupied fully five hours though energy abuse and fury enough were expended for an army Reloading and wringing our clothes dry we set out from the horrible neighbourhood of the river with its reek and filth in a northerly direction following a road which led up to easy and level ground Two obtruding hills were thus avoided on our left and after passing them we had shut out the view of the hateful valley I always found myself more comfortable and lighthearted while travelling than when chafing and fretting in camp at delays which no effort could avoid and consequently I fear that some things while on a march may be tinted somewhat stronger than their appearance or merit may properly warrant But I thought that the view opening before us was much more agreeable than the valley of Simbamwenni with all its indescribable fertility It was a series of glades opening one after another between forest clumps of young trees hemmed in distantly by isolated peaks and scattered mountains Now and again as we crested low eminences we caught sight of the blue Usagara mountains bounding the horizon westerly and northerly and looked down upon a vast expanse of plain which lay between At the foot of the lengthy slope well watered by bubbling springs and mountain rills we found a comfortable khambi with well made huts which the natives call Simbo It lies just two hours or five miles north west of the Ungerengeri crossing The ground is rocky composed principally of quartzose detritus swept down by the constant streams In the neighbourhood of these grow bamboo the thickest of which was about two and a half inches in diameter the myombo a very shapely tree with a clean trunk like an ash the imbite with large fleshy leaves like the mtamba sycamore plum tree the ugaza ortamarisk and the mgungu a tree containing several wide branches with small leaves clustered together in a clump and the silk cotton tree Though there are no villages or settlements in view of Simbo Khambi there are several clustered within the mountain folds inhabited by Waseguhha somewhat prone to dishonest acts and murder The long broad plain visible from the eminences crossed between the Ungerengeri and Simbo was now before us and became known to sorrowful memory subsequently as the Makata Valley The initial march was from Simbo its terminus at Rehenneko at the base of the Usagara mountains six marches distant The valley commences with broad undulations covered with young forests of bamboo which grow thickly along the streams the dwarf fan palm the stately Palmyra and the mgungu These undulations soon become broken by gullies containing water nourishing dense crops of cane reeds and broad bladed grass and emerging from this district wide savannah covered with tall grass open into view with an isolated tree here and there agreeably breaking the monotony of the scene The Makata is a wilderness containing but one village of the Waseguhha throughout its broad expanse Venison consequently abounds within the forest clumps and the kudu hartebeest antelope and zebra may be seen at early dawn emerging into the open savannahs to feed At night the cyn hyaena prowls about with its hideous clamour seeking for sleeping prey man or beast The slushy mire of the savannahs rendered marching a work of great difficulty its tenacious hold of the feet told terribly on men and animals A ten mile march required ten hours we were therefore compelled to camp in the middle of this wilderness and construct a new khambi a measure which was afterwards adopted by half a dozen caravans The cart did not arrive until nearly midnight and with it besides three or four broken down pagazis came Bombay with the dolorous tale that having put his load consisting of the property tent one large American axe his two uniform coats his shirts beads and cloth powder pistol and hatchet on the ground to go and assist the cart out of a quagmire he had returned to the place where he had left it and could not find it that he believed that some thieving Washensi who always lurk in the rear of caravans to pick up stragglers had decamped with it Which dismal tale told me at black midnight was not received at all graciously but rather with most wrathful words all of which the penitent captain received as his proper due Working myself into a fury I enumerated his sins to him he had lost a goat at Muhalleh he had permitted Khamisi to desert with valuable property at Imbiki he had frequently shown culpable negligence in not looking after the donkeys permitting them to be tied up at night without seeing that they had water and in the mornings when about to march he preferred to sleep until seven o clock rather than wake up early and saddle the donkeys that we might start at six o clock he had shown of late great love for the fire cowering like a bloodless man before it torpid and apathetic he had now lost the property tent in the middle of the Masika season by which carelessness the cloth bales would rot and become valueless he had lost the axe which I should want at Ujiji to construct my boat and finally he had lost a pistol and hatchet and a flaskful of the best powder Considering all these things how utterly incompetent he was to be captain I would degrade him from his office and appoint Mabruki Burton instead Uledi also following the example of Bombay instead of being second captain should give no orders to any soldiers in future but should himself obey those given by Mabruki the said Mabruki being worth a dozen Bombays and two dozen Uledis and so he was dismissed with orders to return at daylight to find the tent axe pistol powder and hatchet The next morning the caravan thoroughly fatigued with the last day s exertions was obliged to halt Bombay was despatched after the lost goods Kingaru Mabruki the Great and Mabruki the Little were despatched to bring back three doti worth of grain on which we were to subsist in the wilderness Three days passed away and we were still at camp awaiting with what patience we possessed the return of the soldiers In the meantime provisions ran very low no game could be procured the birds were so wild Two days shooting procured but two potfuls of birds consisting of grouse quail and pigeons Bombay returned unsuccessfully from his search after the missing property and suffered deep disgrace On the fourth day I despatched Shaw with two more soldiers to see what had become of Kingaru and the two Mabrukis Towards night he returned completely prostrated with a violent attack of the mukunguru or ague but bringing the missing soldiers who were thus left to report for themselves With most thankful hearts did we quit our camp where so much anxiety of mind and fretfulness had been suffered not heeding a furious rain which after drenching us all night might have somewhat damped our ardor for the march under other circumstances The road for the first mile led over reddish ground and was drained by gentle slopes falling east and west but leaving the cover of the friendly woods on whose eastern margin we had been delayed so long we emerged into one of the savannahs whose soil during the rain is as soft as slush and tenacious as thick mortar where we were all threatened with the fate of the famous Arkansas traveller who had sunk so low in one of the many quagmires in Arkansas county that nothing but his tall stove pipe hat was left visible Shaw was sick and the whole duty of driving the foundering caravan devolved upon myself The Wanyamwezi donkeys stuck in the mire as if they were rooted to it As fast as one was flogged from his stubborn position prone to the depths fell another giving me a Sisyphean labour which was maddening trader pelting rain assisted by such men as Bombay and Uledi who could not for a whole skin s sake stomach the storm and mire Two hours of such a task enabled me to drag my caravan over a savannah one mile and a half broad and barely had I finished congratulating myself over my success before I was halted by a deep ditch which filled with rain water from the inundated savannahs had become a considerable stream breast deep flowing swiftly into the Makata Donkeys had to be unloaded led through a torrent and loaded again on the other bank an operation which consumed a full hour Presently after straggling through a wood clump barring our progress was another stream swollen into a river The bridge being swept away we were obliged to swim and float our baggage over which delayed us two hours more Leaving this second river bank we splashed waded occasionally half swimming and reeled through mire water dripping grass and matama stalks along the left bank of the Makata proper until farther progress was effectually prevented for that day by a deep bend of the river which we should be obliged to cross the next day Though but six miles were traversed during that miserable day the march occupied ten hours Half dead with fatigue I yet could feel thankful that it was not accompanied by fever which it seemed a miracle to avoid for if ever a district was cursed with the ague the Makata wilderness ranks foremost of those afflicted Surely the sight of the dripping woods enveloped in opaque mist of the inundated country with lengthy swathes of tiger grass laid low by the turbid flood of mounds of decaying trees and canes of the swollen river and the weeping sky was enough to engender the mukunguru The well used khambi and the heaps of filth surrounding it were enough to create a cholera The Makata a river whose breadth during the dry season is but forty feet in the Masika season assumes the breadth depth and force of an important river Should it happen to be an unusually rainy season it inundates the great plain which stretches on either side and converts it into a great lake It is the main feeder of the Wami river which empties into the sea between the ports of Saadani and Whinde About ten miles north east of the Makata crossing the Great Makata the Little Makata a nameless creek and the Rudewa river unite and the river thus formed becomes known as the Wami Throughout Usagara the Wami is known as the Mukondokwa Three of these streams take their rise from the crescent like Usagara range which bounds the Makata plain south and south westerly while the Rudewa rises in the northern horn of the same range So swift was the flow of the Makata and so much did its unsteady bridge half buried in the water imperil the safety of the property that its transfer from bank to bank occupied fully five hours No sooner had we landed every article on the other side undamaged by the water than the rain poured down in torrents that drenched them all as if they had been dragged through the river To proceed through the swamp which an hour s rain had formed was utterly out of the question We were accordingly compelled to camp in a place where every hour furnished its quota of annoyance One of the Wangwana soldiers engaged at Bagamoyo named Kingaru improved an opportunity to desert with another Mgwana s kit My two detectives Uledi Grant s valet and Sarmean were immediately despatched in pursuit both being armed with American breech loaders They went about their task with an adroitness and celerity which augured well for their success In an hour they returned with the runaway having found him hidden in the house of a Mseguhha chief called Kigondo who lived about a mile from the eastern bank of the river and who had accompanied Uledi and Sarmean to receive his reward and render an account of the incident Kigondo said when he had been seated I saw this man carrying a bundle and running hard by which I knew that he was deserting you We my wife and one were sitting in our little watch hut watching our corn and as the road runs close by this man was obliged to come close to us We called to him when he was near saying Master where are you going so fast Are you deserting the Musungu for we know you belong to him since you bought from us yesterday two doti worth of meat Yes said he I am running away I want to get to Simbamwenni If you will take me there I will give you a doti We said to him then Come into our house and we will talk it over quietly When he was in our house in an inner room we locked him up and went out again to the watch but leaving word with the women to look out for him We knew that if you wanted him you would send askari soldiers after him We had but lit our pipes when we saw two men armed with short guns and having no loads coming along the road looking now and then on the ground as if they were looking at footmarks We knew them to be the men we were expecting so we hailed them and said Masters what are ye looking for \ They said We are looking for a man who has deserted our master Here are his footsteps If you have been long in your hut you must have seen him Can you tell us where he is We said yes he is in our house If you will come with us we will give him up to you but your master must give us something for catching him As Kigondo had promised to deliver Kingaru up there remained nothing further to do for Uledi and Sarmean but to take charge of their prisoner and bring him and his captors to my camp on the western bank of the Makata Kingaru received two dozen lashes and was chained his captor a doti besides five khete of red coral beads for his wife That down pour of rain which visited us the day we crossed the Makata proved the last of the Masika season As the first rainfall which we had experienced occurred on the twenty third March and the last on the thirtieth April its duration was thirty nine days The seers of Bagamoyo had delivered their vaticinations concerning this same Masika with solemnity For forty days said they rain would fall incessantly whereas we had but experienced eighteen days rain Nevertheless we were glad that it was over for we were tired of stopping day after day to dry the bales and grease the tools and ironware and of seeing all things of cloth and leather rot visibly before our eyes The first of May found us struggling through the mire and water of the Makata with a caravan bodily sick from the exertion and fatigue of crossing so many rivers and wading through marshes Shaw was still suffering from his first mukunguru Zaidi a soldier was critically ill with the small pox the kichuma chuma little irons had hold of Bombay across the chest rendering him the most useless of the unserviceables Mabruk Saleem a youth of lusty frame following the example of Bombay laid himself down on the marshy ground professing his total inability to breast the Makata swamp Abdul Kader the Hindi tailor and adventurer the weakliest of mortal bodies was ever ailing for lack of force as he expressed it in French i e strength ever indisposed to work shiftless mock sick but ever hungry Oh God was the cry of my tired soul were all the men of my Expedition like this man I should be compelled to return Solomon was wise perhaps from inspiration perhaps from observation I was becoming wise by experience and I was compelled to observe that when mud and wet sapped the physical energy of the lazily inclined a dog whip became their backs restoring them to a sound some times to an extravagant activity For thirty miles from our camp was the Makata plain an extensive swamp The water was on an average one foot in depth in some places we plunged into holes three four and even five feet deep Plash splash plash splash were the only sounds we heard from the commencement of the march until we found the bomas occupying the only dry spots along the line of march This kind of work continued for two days until we came in sight of the Rudewa river another powerful stream with banks brimful of rushing rain water Crossing a branch of the Rudewa and emerging from the dank reedy grass crowding the western bank the view consisted of an immense sheet of water topped by clumps of grass tufts and foliage of thinly scattered trees bounded ten or twelve miles off by the eastern front of the Usagara mountain range The acme of discomfort and vexation was realized on the five mile march from the Rudewa branch As myself and the Wangwana appeared with the loaded donkeys the pagazis were observed huddled on a mound When asked if the mound was the camp they replied No Why then do you stop here Ugh water plenty One drew a line across his loins to indicate the depth of water before us another drew a line across his chest another across his throat another held his hand over his head by which he meant that we should have to swim Swim five miles through a reedy marsh It was impossible it was also impossible that such varied accounts could all be correct Without hesitation therefore I ordered the Wangwana to proceed with the animals After three hours of splashing through four feet of water we reached dry land and had traversed the swamp of Makata But not without the swamp with its horrors having left a durable impression upon our minds no one was disposed to forget its fatigues nor the nausea of travel which it almost engendered Subsequently we had to remember its passage still more vividly and to regret that we had undertaken the journey during the Masika season when the animals died from this date by twos and threes almost every day until but five sickly worn out beasts remained when the Wangwana soldiers and pagazis sickened of diseases innumerable when I myself was finally compelled to lie a bed with an attack of acute dysentery which brought me to the verge of the grave I suffered more perhaps than I might have done had I taken the proper medicine but my over confidence in that compound called Collis Brown s Chlorodyne delayed the cure which ultimately resulted from a judicious use of Dover s powder In no one single case of diarrhoea or acute dysentery had this Chlorodyne about which so much has been said and written any effect of lessening the attack whatever though I used three bottles To the dysentery contracted during the transit of the Makata swamp only two fell victims and those were a pagazi and my poor little dog Omar my companion from India The only tree of any prominence in the Makata valley was the Palmyra palm Borassus flabelliformis and this grew in some places in numbers sufficient to be called a grove the fruit was not ripe while we passed otherwise we might have enjoyed it as a novelty The other vegetation consisted of the several species of thorn bush and the graceful parachute topped and ever green mimosa The fourth of May we were ascending a gentle slope towards the important village of Rehenneko the first village near to which we encamped in Usagara It lay at the foot of the mountain and its plenitude and mountain air promised us comfort and health It was a square compact village surrounded by a thick wall of mud enclosing cone topped huts roofed with bamboo and holcus stalks and contained a population of about a thousand souls It has several wealthy and populous neighbours whose inhabitants are independent enough in their manner but not unpleasantly so The streams are of the purest water fresh and pellucid as crystal bubbling over round pebbles and clean gravel with a music delightful to hear to the traveller in search of such a sweetly potable element The bamboo grows to serviceable size in the neighbourhood of Rehenneko strong enough for tent and banghy poles and in numbers sufficient to supply an army The mountain slopes are densely wooded with trees that might supply very good timber for building purposes We rested four days at this pleasant spot to recruit ourselves and to allow the sick and feeble time to recover a little before testing their ability in the ascent of the Usagara mountains The eighth of May saw us with our terribly jaded men and animals winding up the steep slopes of the first line of hills gaining the summit of which we obtained a view remarkably grand which exhibited as in a master picture the broad valley of the Makata with its swift streams like so many cords of silver as the sunshine played on the unshadowed reaches of water with its thousands of graceful palms adding not a little to the charm of the scene with the great wall of the Uruguru and Uswapanga mountains dimly blue but sublime in their loftiness and immensity forming a fit background to such an extensive far embracing prospect Turning our faces west we found ourselves in a mountain world fold rising above fold peak behind peak cone jostling cone away to the north to the west to the south the mountain tops rolled like so many vitrified waves not one adust or arid spot was visible in all this scene The diorama had no sudden changes or striking contrasts for a universal forest of green trees clothed every peak cone and summit To the men this first day s march through the mountain region of Usagara was an agreeable interlude after the successive journey over the flats and heavy undulations of the maritime region but to the loaded and enfeebled animals it was most trying We were minus two by the time we had arrived at our camp but seven miles from Rehenneko our first instalment of the debt we owed to Makata Water sweet and clear was abundant in the deep hollows of the mountains flowing sometimes over beds of solid granite sometimes over a rich red sandstone whose soft substance was soon penetrated by the aqueous element and whose particles were swept away constantly to enrich the valley below and in other ravines it dashed and roared miniature thunder as it leaped over granite boulders and quartz rock The ninth of May after another such an up and down course ascending hills and descending into the twilight depths of deepening valleys we came suddenly upon the Mukondokwa and its narrow pent up valley crowded with rank reedy grass cane and thorny bushes and rugged tamarisk which grappled for existence with monster convolvuli winding their coils around their trunks with such tenacity and strength that the tamarisk seemed grown but for their support The valley was barely a quarter of a mile broad in some places at others it widened to about a mile The hills on either side shot up into precipitous slopes clothed with mimosa acacia and tamarisk enclosing a river and valley whose curves and folds were as various as a serpent s Shortly after debouching into the Mukondokwa valley we struck the road traversed by Captains Buxton and Speke in eighteen fifty seven between Mbumi and Kadetamare the latter place should be called Misonghi Kadetamare being but the name of a chief After following the left bank of the Mukondokwa during which our route diverged to every point from south east to west north and northeast for about an hour we came to the ford Beyond the ford a short half hour s march we came to Kiora At this filthy village of Kiora which was well grounded with goat dung and peopled with a wonderful number of children for a hamlet that did not number twenty families with a hot sun pouring on the limited open space with a fury that exceeded one hundred twenty eight degrees Fahrenheit which swarmed with flies and insects of known and unknown species I found as I had been previously informed the third caravan which had started out of Bagamoyo so well fitted and supplied The leader who was no other than the white man Farquhar was sick a bed with swollen legs Bright s disease unable to move As he heard my voice Farquhar staggered out of his tent so changed from my spruce mate who started from Bagamoyo that I hardly knew him at first His legs were ponderous elephantine since his leg illness was of elephantiasis or dropsy His face was of a deathly pallor for he had not been out of his tent for two weeks A breezy hill overlooking the village of Kiora was chosen by me for my camping ground and as soon as the tents were pitched the animals attended to and a boma made of thorn bushes Farquhar was carried up by four men into my tent Upon being questioned as to the cause of his illness he said he did not know what had caused it He had no pain he thought anywhere I asked Do you not sometimes feel pain on the right side Yes I think I do but I don t know Nor over the left nipple sometimes a quick throbbing with a shortness of breath Yes I think I have I know I breathe quick sometimes He said his only trouble was in the legs which were swollen to an immense size Though he had a sound appetite he yet felt weak in the legs From the scant information of the disease and its peculiarities as given by Farquhar himself I could only make out by studying a little medical book I had with me that a swelling of the legs and sometimes of the body might result from either heart liver or kidney disease But I did not know to what to ascribe the disease unless it was to elephantiasis a disease most common in Zanzibar nor did I know how to treat it in a man who could not tell me whether he felt pain in his head or in his back in his feet or in his chest It was therefore fortunate for me that I overtook him at Kiora though he was about to prove a sore incumbrance to me for he was not able to walk and the donkey carriage after the rough experience of the Makata valley was failing I could not possibly leave him at Kiora death would soon overtake him there but how long I could convey a man in such a state through a country devoid of carriage was a question to be resolved by circumstances On the eleventh of May the third and fifth caravans now united followed up the right bank of the Mukondokwa through fields of holcus the great Mukondokwa ranges rising in higher altitude as we proceeded west and enfolding us in the narrow river valley round about We left Muniyi Usagara on our right and soon after found hill spurs athwart our road which we were obliged to ascend and descend A march of eight miles from the ford of Misonghi brought us to another ford of the Mukondokwa where we bid a long adieu to Burton s road which led up to the Goma pass and up the steep slopes of Rubeho Our road left the right bank and followed the left over a country quite the reverse of the Mukondokwa Valley enclosed between mountain ranges Fertile soils and spontaneous vegetation reeking with miasma and overpowering from their odour we had exchanged for a drouthy wilderness of aloetic and cactaceous plants where the kolquall and several thorn bushes grew paramount Instead of the tree clad heights slopes and valleys instead of cultivated fields we saw now the confines of uninhabited wilderness The hill tops were bared of their bosky crowns and revealed their rocky natures bleached white by rain and sun Nguru Peak the loftiest of the Usagara cones stood right shoulderwards of us as we ascended the long slope of dun grey soil which rose beyond the brown Mukondokwa on the left At the distance of two miles from the last ford we found a neat khambi situated close to the river where it first broke into a furious rapid The next morning the caravan was preparing for the march when I was informed that the Bana Mdogo little master Shaw had not yet arrived with the cart and the men in charge of it Late the previous night I had despatched one donkey for Shaw who had said he was too ill to walk and another for the load that was on the cart and had retired satisfied that they would soon arrive My conclusion when I learned in the morning that the people had not yet come in was that Shaw was not aware that for five days we should have to march through a wilderness totally uninhabited I therefore despatched Chowpereh a Mgwana soldier with the following note to him You will upon receipt of this order pitch the cart into the nearest ravine gully or river as well as all the extra pack saddles and come at once for God s sake for we must not starve here One two three and four hours were passed by me in the utmost impatience waiting but in vain for Shaw Having a long march before us I could wait no longer but went to meet his party myself About a quarter of mile from the ford I met the van of the laggards stout burly Chowpereh and O cartmakers listen he carried the cart on his head wheels shafts body axle and all complete he having found that carrying it was much easier than drawing it The sight was such a damper to my regard for it as an experiment that the cart was wheeled into the depths of the tall reeds and there left The central figure was Shaw himself riding at a gait which seemed to leave it doubtful on my mind whether he or his animal felt most sleepy Upon expostulating with him for keeping the caravan so long waiting when there was a march on hand in a most peculiar voice which he always assumed when disposed to be ugly tempered he said he had done the best he could but as I had seen the solemn pace at which he rode I felt dubious about his best endeavours and of course there was a little scene but the young European mtongi of an East African expedition must needs sup with the fellows he has chosen We arrived at Madete at four P M minus two donkeys which had stretched their weary limbs in death We had crossed the Mukondokwa about three P M and after taking its bearings and course I made sure that its rise took place near a group of mountains about forty miles north by west of Nguru Peak Our road led W N W and at this place finally diverged from the river On the fourteenth after a march of seven miles over hills whose sandstone and granite formation cropped visibly here and there above the surface whose stony and dry aspect seemed reflected in every bush and plant and having gained an altitude of about eight hundred feet above the flow of the Mukondokwa we sighted the Lake of Ugombo a grey sheet of water lying directly at the foot of the hill from whose summit we gazed at the scene The view was neither beautiful nor pretty but what I should call refreshing it afforded a pleasant relief to the eyes fatigued from dwelling on the bleak country around Besides the immediate neighbourhood of the lake was too tame to call forth any enthusiasm there were no grandly swelling mountains no smiling landscapes nothing but a dun brown peak about one thousand feet high above the surface of the lake at its western extremity from which the lake derived its name Ugombo nothing but a low dun brown irregular range running parallel with its northern shore at the distance of a mile nothing but a low plain stretching from its western shore far away towards the Mpwapwa Mountains and Marenga Mkali then apparent to us from our coign of vantage from which extensive scene of dun brownness we were glad to rest our eyes on the quiet grey water beneath Descending from the summit of the range which bounded the lake east for about four hundred feet we travelled along the northern shore The time occupied in the journey from the eastern to the western extremity was exactly one hour and thirty minutes As this side represents its greatest length I conclude that the lake is three miles long by two miles greatest breadth The immediate shores of the lake on all sides for at least fifty feet from the water s edge is one impassable morass nourishing rank reeds and rushes where the hippopotamus ponderous form has crushed into watery trails the soft composition of the morass as he passes from the lake on his nocturnal excursions the lesser animals such as the mbogo buffalo the punda terra zebra the twiga giraffe the boar the kudu the hyrax or coney and the antelope come here also to quench their thirst by night The surface of the lake swarms with an astonishing variety of water fowl such as black swan duck ibis sacra cranes pelicans and soaring above on the look out for their prey are fish eagles and hawks while the neighbourhood is resonant with the loud chirps of the guinea fowls calling for their young with the harsh cry of the toucan the cooing of the pigeon and the to whit to whoo of the owl From the long grass in its vicinity also issue the grating and loud cry of the florican woodcock and grouse Being obliged to halt here two days owing to the desertion of the Hindi cooper Jako with one of my best carbines I improved the opportunity of exploring the northern and southern shores of the lake At the rocky foot of a low humpy hill on the northern side about fifteen feet above the present surface of the water I detected in most distinct and definite lines the agency of waves From its base could be traced clear to the edge of the dank morass tiny lines of comminuted shell as plainly marked as the small particles which lie in rows on a beech after a receding tide There is no doubt that the wave marks on the sandstone might have been traced much higher by one skilled in geology it was only its elementary character that was visible to me Nor do I entertain the least doubt after a two days exploration of the neighbourhood especially of the low plain at the western end that this Lake of Ugombo is but the tail of what was once a large body of water equal in extent to the Tanganika and after ascending half way up Ugombo Peak this opinion was confirmed when I saw the long depressed line of plain at its base stretching towards the Mpwapwa Mountains thirty miles off and thence round to Marenga Mkali and covering all that extensive surface of forty miles in breadth and an unknown length A depth of twelve feet more I thought as I gazed upon it would give the lake a length of thirty miles and a breadth of ten A depth of thirty feet would increase its length over a hundred miles and give it a breadth of fifty for such was the level nature of the plain that stretched west of Ugombo and north of Marenga Mkali Besides the water of the lake partook slightly of the bitter nature of the Matamombo creek distant fifteen miles and in a still lesser degree of that of Marenga Mkali forty miles off Towards the end of the first day of our halt the Hindi cooper Jako arrived in camp alleging as an excuse that feeling fatigued he had fallen asleep in some bushes a few feet from the roadside Having been the cause of our detention in the hungry wilderness of Ugombo I was not in a frame of mind to forgive him so to prevent any future truant tricks on his part I was under the necessity of including him with the chained gangs of runaways Two more of our donkeys died and to prevent any of the valuable baggage being left behind I was obliged to send Farquhar off on my own riding ass to the village of Mpwapwa thirty miles off under charge of Mabruki Burton To save the Expedition from ruin I was reluctantly compelled to come to the conclusion that it were better for me for him and concerned that he be left with some kind chief of a village with a six months supply of cloth and beads until he got well than that he make his own recovery impossible The sixteenth of May saw us journeying over the plain which lies between Ugombo and Mpwapwa skirting close at intervals a low range of trap rock out of which had become displaced by some violent agency several immense boulders On its slopes grew the kolquall to a size which I had not seen in Abyssinia In the plain grew baobab and immense tamarind and a variety of thorn Within five hours from Ugombo the mountain range deflected towards the north east while we continued on a north westerly course heading for the lofty mountain line of the Mpwapwa To our left towered to the blue clouds the gigantic Rubeho The adoption of this new road to Unyanyembe by which we were travelling was now explained we were enabled to avoid the passes and stiff steeps of Rubeho and had nothing worse to encounter than a broad smooth plain which sloped gently to Ugogo After a march of fifteen miles we camped at a dry mtoni called Matamombo celebrated for its pools of bitter water of the colour of ochre Monkeys and rhinoceroses besides kudus steinboks and antelopes were numerous in the vicinity At this camp my little dog Omar died of inflammation of the bowels almost on the threshold of the country Ugogo where his faithful watchfulness would have been invaluable to me The next day s march was also fifteen miles in length through one interminable jungle of thorn bushes Within two miles of the camp the road led up a small river bed broad as an avenue clear to the khambi of Mpwapwa which was situated close to a number of streams of the purest water The following morning found us much fatigued after the long marches from Ugombo and generally disposed to take advantage of the precious luxuries Mpwapwa offered to caravans fresh from the fly plagued lands of the Waseguhha and Wadoe Sheikh Thani clever but innocently speaking old Arab was encamped under the grateful umbrage of a huge Mtamba sycamore and had been regaling himself with fresh milk luscious mutton and rich bullock humps ever since his arrival here two days before and as he informed me it did not suit his views to quit such a happy abundance so soon for the saline nitrous water of Marenga Mkali with its several terekezas and manifold disagreeables No said he to me emphatically better stop here two or three days give your tired animals some rest collect all the pagazis you can fill your inside with fresh milk sweet potatoes beef mutton ghee honey beans matama maweri and nuts then Inshallah we shall go together through Ugogo without stopping anywhere As the advice tallied accurately with my own desired and keen appetite for the good things he named he had not long to wait for my assent to his counsel Ugogo continued he is rich with milk and honey rich in flour beans and almost every eatable thing and Inshallah before another week is gone we shall be in Ugogo I had heard from passing caravans so many extremely favourable reports respecting Ugogo and its productions that it appeared to me a very Land of Promise and I was most anxious to refresh my jaded stomach with some of the precious esculents raised in Ugogo but when I heard that Mpwapwa also furnished some of those delicate eatables and good things most of the morning hours were spent in inducing the slow witted people to part with them and when finally eggs milk honey mutton ghee ground matama and beans had been collected in sufficient quantities to produce a respectable meal my keenest attention and best culinary talents were occupied for a couple of hours in converting this crude supply into a breakfast which could be accepted by and befit a stomach at once fastidious and famished such as mine was The subsequent healthy digestion of it proved my endeavours to have been eminently successful At the termination of this eventful day the following remark was jotted down in my diary Thank God After fifty seven days of living upon matama porridge and tough goat I have enjoyed with unctuous satisfaction a real breakfast and dinner It was in one of the many small villages which are situated upon the slopes of the Mpwapwa that a refuge and a home for Farquhar was found until he should be enabled by restored health to start to join us at Unyanyembe Food was plentiful and of sufficient variety to suit the most fastidious cheap also much cheaper than we had experienced for many a day Leucole the chief of the village with whom arrangements for Farquhar s protection and comfort were made was a little old man of mild eye and very pleasing face and on being informed that it was intended to leave the Musungu entirely under his charge suggested that some man should be left to wait on him and interpret his wishes to his people As Jako was the only one who could speak English except Bombay and Selim Jako was appointed and the chief Leucole was satisfied Six months provisions of white beads Merikani and Kaniki cloth together with two doti of handsome cloth to serve as a present to Leucole after his recovery were taken to Farquhar by Bombay together with a Starr s carbine three hundred rounds of cartridge a set of cooking pots and three lbs of tea Abdullah bin Nasib who was found encamped here with five hundred pagazis and a train of Arab and Wasawahili satellites who revolved around his importance treated me in somewhat the same manner that Hamed bin Sulayman treated Speke at Kasenge Followed by his satellites he came a tall nervous looking man of fifty or thereabouts to see me in my camp and asked me if I wished to purchase donkeys As all my animals were either sick or moribund I replied very readily in the affirmative upon which he graciously said he would sell me as many as I wanted and for payment I could give him a draft on Zanzibar I thought him a very considerate and kind person fully justifying the encomiums lavished on him in Burton s Lake Regions of Central Africa and accordingly I treated him with the consideration due to so great and good a man The morrow came and with it went Abdullah bin Nasib or Kisesa as he is called by the Wanyamwezi with all his pagazis his train of followers and each and every one of his donkeys towards Bagamoyo without so much as giving a Kwaheri or good bye At this place there are generally to be found from ten to thirty pagazis awaiting up caravans I was fortunate enough to secure twelve good people who upon my arrival at Unyanyembe without an exception voluntarily engaged themselves as carriers to Ujiji With the formidable marches of Marenga Mkali in front I felt thankful for this happy windfall which resolved the difficulties I had been anticipating for I had but ten donkeys left and four of these were so enfeebled that they were worthless as baggage animals Mpwapwa so called by the Arabs who have managed to corrupt almost every native word is called Mbambwa by the Wasagara It is a mountain range rising over six thousand feet above the sea bounding on the north the extensive plain which commences at Ugombo lake and on the east that part of the plain which is called Marenga Mkali which stretches away beyond the borders of Uhumba Opposite Mpwapwa at the distance of thirty miles or so rises the Anak peak of Rubeho with several other ambitious and tall brethren cresting long lines of rectilinear scarps which ascend from the plain of Ugombo and Marenga Mkali as regularly as if they had been chiselled out by the hands of generations of masons and stonecutters Upon looking at Mpwapwa s greenly tinted slopes dark with many a densely foliaged tree its many rills flowing sweet and clear nourishing besides thick patches of gum and thorn bush giant sycamore and parachute topped mimosa and permitting my imagination to picture sweet views behind the tall cones above I was tempted to brave the fatigue of an ascent to the summit Nor was my love for the picturesque disappointed One sweep of the eyes embraced hundreds of square miles of plain and mountain from Ugombo Peak away to distant Ugogo and from Rubeho and Ugogo to the dim and purple pasture lands of the wild untamable Wahumba The plain of Ugombo and its neighbour of Marenga Mkali apparently level as a sea was dotted here and there with hillocks dropt in Nature s careless haste which appeared like islands amid the dun and green expanse Where the jungle was dense the colour was green alternating with dark brown where the plain appeared denuded of bush and brake it had a whity brown appearance on which the passing clouds now and again cast their deep shadows Altogether this side of the picture was not inviting it exhibited too plainly the true wilderness in its sternest aspect but perhaps the knowledge that in the bosom of the vast plain before me there was not one drop of water but was bitter as nitre and undrinkable as urine prejudiced me against it The hunter might consider it a paradise for in its depths were all kinds of game to attract his keenest instincts but to the mere traveller it had a stern outlook Nearer however to the base of the Mpwapwa the aspect of the plain altered At first the jungle thinned openings in the wood appeared then wide and naked clearings then extensive fields of the hardy holcus Indian corn and maweri or bajri with here and there a square tembe or village Still nearer ran thin lines of fresh young grass great trees surrounded a patch of alluvial meadow A broad river bed containing several rivulets of water ran through the thirsty fields conveying the vivifying element which in this part of Usagara was so scarce and precious Down to the river bed sloped the Mpwapwa roughened in some places by great boulders of basalt or by rock masses which had parted from a precipitous scarp where clung the kolquall with a sure hold drawing nourishment where every other green thing failed clad in others by the hardy mimosa which rose like a sloping bank of green verdure almost to the summit And happy sight to me so long a stranger to it there were hundreds of cattle grazing imparting a pleasing animation to the solitude of the deep folds of the mountain range But the fairest view was obtained by looking northward towards the dense group of mountains which buttressed the front range facing towards Rubeho It was the home of the winds which starting here and sweeping down the precipitous slopes and solitary peaks on the western side and gathering strength as they rushed through the prairie like Marenga Mkali howled through Ugogo and Unyamwezi with the force of a storm It was also the home of the dews where sprang the clear springs which cheered by their music the bosky dells below and enriched the populous district of Mpwapwa One felt better stronger on this breezy height drinking in the pure air and feasting the eyes on such a varied landscape as it presented on spreading plateaus green as lawns on smooth rounded tops on mountain vales containing recesses which might charm a hermit s soul on deep and awful ravines where reigned a twilight gloom on fractured and riven precipices on huge fantastically worn boulders which overtopped them on picturesque tracts which embraced all that was wild and all that was poetical in Nature Mpwapwa though the traveller from the coast will feel grateful for the milk it furnished after being so long deprived of it will be kept in mind as a most remarkable place for earwigs In my tent they might be counted by thousands in my slung cot they were by hundreds on my clothes they were by fifties on my neck and head they were by scores The several plagues of locusts fleas and lice sink into utter insignificance compared with this fearful one of earwigs It is true they did not bite and they did not irritate the cuticle but what their presence and numbers suggested was something so horrible that it drove one nearly insane to think of it Who will come to East Africa without reading the experiences of Burton and Speke Who is he that having read them will not remember with horror the dreadful account given by Speke of his encounters with these pests My intense nervous watchfulness alone I believe saved me from a like calamity Second to the earwigs in importance and in numbers were the white ants whose powers of destructiveness were simply awful Mats cloth portmanteaus clothes in short every article I possessed seemed on the verge of destruction and as I witnessed their voracity I felt anxious lest my tent should be devoured while I slept This was the first khambi since leaving the coast where their presence became a matter of anxiety at all other camping places hitherto the red and black ants had usurped our attention but at Mpwapwa the red species were not seen while the black were also very scarce After a three days halt at Mpwapwa I decided of a march to Marenga Mkali which should be uninterrupted until we reached Mvumi in Ugogo where I should be inducted into the art of paying tribute to the Wagogo chiefs The first march to Kisokweh was purposely made short being barely four miles in order to enable Sheikh Thani Sheikh Hamed and five or six Wasawahili caravans to come up with me at Chunyo on the confines of Marenga Mkali CHAPTER VII MARENGA MKALI UGOGO AND UYANZI TO UNYANYEMBE Mortality amongst the baggage animals The contumacious Wagogo Mobs of Maenads Tribute paying Necessity of prudence Oration of the guide The genuine Ugogians Vituperative power A surprised chief The famous Mizanza Killing hyaenas The Greeks and Romans of Africa A critical moment The elephant s back The wilderness of Ukimbu End of the first stage of the search Arrival at Unyanyembe The twenty second of May saw Thani and Hamed s caravans united with my own at Chunyo three and a half hours march from Mpwapwa The road from the latter place ran along the skirts of the Mpwapwa range at three or four places it crossed outlying spurs that stood isolated from the main body of the range The last of these hill spurs joined by an elevated cross ridge to the Mpwapwa shelters the tembe of Chunyo situated on the western face from the stormy gusts that come roaring down the steep slopes The water of Chunyo is eminently bad in fact it is its saline nitrous nature which has given the name Marenga Mkali bitter water to the wilderness which separates Usagara from Ugogo Though extremely offensive to the palate Arabs and the natives drink it without fear and without any bad results but they are careful to withhold their baggage animals from the pits Being ignorant of its nature and not exactly understanding what precise location was meant by Marenga Mkali I permitted the donkeys to be taken to water as usual after a march and the consequence was calamitous in the extreme What the fearful swamp of Makata had spared the waters of Marenga Mkali destroyed In less than five days after our departure from Chunyo or Marenga Mali five out of the nine donkeys left to me at the time the five healthiest animals fell victims We formed quite an imposing caravan as we emerged from inhospitable Chunyo in number amounting to about four hundred souls We were strong in guns flags horns sounding drums and noise To Sheikh Hamed by permission of Sheikh Thani and myself was allotted the task of guiding and leading this great caravan through dreaded Ugogo which was a most unhappy selection as will be seen hereafter Marenga Mali over thirty miles across was at last before us This distance had to be traversed within thirty six hours so that the fatigue of the ordinary march would be more than doubled by this From Chunyo to Ugogo not one drop of water was to be found As a large caravan say over two hundred souls seldom travels over one and three quarter miles per hour a march of thirty miles would require seventeen hours of endurance without water and but little rest East Africa generally possessing unlimited quantities of water caravans have not been compelled for lack of the element to have recourse to the mushok of India and the khirbeh of Egypt Being able to cross the waterless districts by a couple of long marches they content themselves for the time with a small gourdful and with keeping their imaginations dwelling upon the copious quantities they will drink upon arrival at the watering place The march through this waterless district was most monotonous and a dangerous fever attacked me which seemed to eat into my very vitals The wonders of Africa that bodied themselves forth in the shape of flocks of zebras giraffes elands or antelopes galloping over the jungleless plain had no charm for me nor could they serve to draw my attention from the severe fit of sickness which possessed me Towards the end of the first march I was not able to sit upon the donkey s back nor would it do when but a third of the way across the wilderness to halt until the next day soldiers were therefore detailed to carry me in a hammock and when the terekeza was performed in the afternoon I lay in a lethargic state unconscious of all things With the night passed the fever and at three o clock in the morning when the march was resumed I was booted and spurred and the recognized mtongi of my caravan once more At eight A M we had performed the thirty two miles The wilderness of Marenga Mkali had been passed and we had entered Ugogo which was at once a dreaded land to my caravan and a Land of Promise to myself The transition from the wilderness into this Promised Land was very gradual and easy Very slowly the jungle thinned the cleared land was a long time appearing and when it had finally appeared there were no signs of cultivation until we could clearly make out the herbage and vegetation on some hill slopes to our right running parallel with our route then we saw timber on the hills and broad acreage under cultivation and lo as we ascended a wave of reddish earth covered with tall weeds and cane but a few feet from us and directly across our path were the fields of matama and grain we had been looking for and Ugogo had been entered an hour before The view was not such as I expected I had imagined a plateau several hundred feet higher than Marenga Mkali and an expansive view which should reveal Ugogo and its characteristics at once But instead while travelling from the tall weeds which covered the clearing which had preceded the cultivated parts we had entered into the depths of the taller matama stalks and excepting some distant hills near Mvumi where the Great Sultan lived the first of the tribe to whom we should pay tribute the view was extremely limited However in the neighbourhood of the first village a glimpse at some of the peculiar features of Ugogo was obtained and there was a vast plain now flat now heaving upwards here level as a table there tilted up into rugged knolls bristling with scores of rough boulders of immense size which lay piled one above another as if the children of a Titanic race had been playing at house building Indeed these piles of rounded angular and riven rock formed miniature hills of themselves and appeared as if each body had been ejected upwards by some violent agency beneath There was one of these in particular near Mvumi which was so large and being slightly obscured from view by the outspreading branches of a gigantic baobab bore such a strong resemblance to a square tower of massive dimensions that for a long time I cherished the idea that I had discovered something most interesting which had strangely escaped the notice of my predecessors in East Africa A nearer view dispelled the illusion and proved it to be a huge cube of rock measuring about forty feet each way The baobabs were also particularly conspicuous on this scene no other kind of tree being visible in the cultivated parts These had probably been left for two reasons first want of proper axes for felling trees of such enormous growth secondly because during a famine the fruit of the baobab furnishes a flour which in the absence of anything better is said to be eatable and nourishing The first words I heard in Ugogo were from a Wagogo elder of sturdy form who in an indolent way tended the flocks but showed a marked interest in the stranger clad in white flannels with a Hawkes patent cork solar topee on his head a most unusual thing in Ugogo who came walking past him and there were Yambo Musungu Yambo bana bana delivered with a voice loud enough to make itself heard a full mile away No sooner had the greeting been delivered than the word Musungu seemed to electrify his entire village and the people of other villages situated at intervals near the road noting the excitement that reigned at the first also participated in the general frenzy which seemed suddenly to have possessed them I consider my progress from the first village to Mvumi to have been most triumphant for I was accompanied by a furious mob of men women and children all almost as naked as Mother Eve when the world first dawned upon her in the garden of Eden fighting quarrelling jostling staggering against each other for the best view of the white man the like of whom was now seen for the first time in this part of Ugogo The cries of admiration such as Hi le which broke often and in confused uproar upon my ear were not gratefully accepted inasmuch as I deemed many of them impertinent A respectful silence and more reserved behaviour would have won my esteem but ye powers who cause etiquette to be observed in Usungu respectful silence reserved behaviour and esteem are terms unknown in savage Ugogo Hitherto I had compared myself to a merchant of Bagdad travelling among the Kurds of Kurdistan selling his wares of Damascus silk kefiyehs c but now I was compelled to lower my standard and thought myself not much better than a monkey in a zoological collection One of my soldiers requested them to lessen their vociferous noise but the evil minded race ordered him to shut up as a thing unworthy to speak to the Wagogo When I imploringly turned to the Arabs for counsel in this strait old Sheikh Thani always worldly wise said Heed them not they are dogs who bite besides barking White man s land At nine A M we were in our boma near Mvumi village but here also crowds of Wagogo came to catch a glimpse of the Musungu whose presence was soon made known throughout the district of Mvumi But two hours later I was oblivious of their endeavours to see me for despite repeated doses of quinine the mukunguru had sure hold of me The next day was a march of eight miles from East Mvumi to West Mvumi where lived the Sultan of the district The quantity and variety of provisions which arrived at our boma did not belie the reports respecting the productions of Ugogo Milk sour and sweet honey beans matama maweri Indian corn ghee pea nuts and a species of bean nut very like a large pistachio or an almond water melons pumpkins mush melons and cucumbers were brought and readily exchanged for Merikani Kaniki and for the white Merikani beads and Sami Sami or Sam Sam The trade and barter which progressed in the camp from morning till night reminded me of the customs existing among the Gallas and Abyssinians Eastward caravans were obliged to despatch men with cloth to purchase from the villagers This was unnecessary in Ugogo where the people voluntarily brought every vendible they possessed to the camp The smallest breadth of white or blue cloth became saleable and useful in purchasing provisions even a loin cloth worn threadbare The day after our march was a halt We had fixed this day for bearing the tribute to the Great Sultan of Mvumi Prudent and cautious Sheikh Thani early began this important duty the omission of which would have been a signal for war Hamed and Thani sent two faithful slaves well up to the eccentricities of the Wagogo sultans well spoken having glib tongues and the real instinct for trade as carried on amongst Orientals They bore six doti of cloths viz one doti of Dabwani Ulyah contributed by myself also one doti of Barsati from me two doti Merikani Satine from Sheikh Thani and two doti of Kaniki from Sheikh Hamed as a first instalment of the tribute The slaves were absent a full hour but having wasted their powers of pleading in vain they returned with the demand for more which Sheikh Thani communicated to me in this wise Auf this Sultan is a very bad man a very bad man indeed he says the Musungu is a great man I call him a sultan the Musungu is very rich for he has several caravans already gone past the Musungu must pay forty doti and the Arabs must pay twelve doti each for they have rich caravans It is of no use for you to tell me you are all one caravan otherwise why so many flags and tents Go and bring me sixty doti with less I will not be satisfied I suggested to Sheikh Thani upon hearing this exorbitant demand that had I twenty Wasungu armed with Winchester repeating rifles the Sultan might be obliged to pay tribute to me but Thani prayed and begged me to be cautious lest angry words might irritate the Sultan and cause him to demand a double tribute as he was quite capable of doing so and if you preferred war said he your pagazis would all desert and leave you and your cloth to the small mercy of the Wagogo But I hastened to allay his fears by telling Bombay in his presence that I had foreseen such demands on the part of the Wagogo and that having set aside one hundred and twenty doti of honga cloths I should not consider myself a sufferer if the Sultan demanded and I paid forty cloths to him that he must therefore open the honga bale and permit Sheikh Thani to extract such cloths as the Sultan might like Sheikh Thani having put on the cap of consideration and joined heads with Hamed and the faithful serviles thought if I paid twelve doti out of which three should be of Ulyah quality that the Sultan might possibly condescend to accept our tribute supposing he was persuaded by the oratorical words of the Faithfuls that the Musungu had nothing with him but the mashiwa boat which would be of no use to him come what might with which prudent suggestion the Musungu concurred seeing its wisdom White men Best or superior The slaves departed bearing this time from our boma thirty doti with our best wishes for their success In an hour they returned with empty hands but yet unsuccessful The Sultan demanded six doti of Merikani and a fundo of bubu from the Musungu and from the Arabs and other caravans twelve doti more For the third time the slaves departed for the Sultan s tembe carrying with them six doti Merikani and a fundo of bubu from myself and ten doti from the Arabs Again they returned to us with the Sultan s words That as the doti of the Musungu were short measure and the cloths of the Arabs of miserable quality the Musungu must send three doti full measure and the Arabs five doti of Kaniki My three doti were at once measured out with the longest fore arm according to Kigogo measure and sent off by Bombay but the Arabs almost in despair declared they would be ruined if they gave way to such demands and out of the five doti demanded sent only two with a pleading to the Sultan that he would consider what was paid as just and fair Muhongo and not ask any more But the Sultan of Mvumi was by no means disposed to consider any such proposition but declared he must have three doti and these to be two of Ulyah cloth and one Kitambi Barsati which as he was determined to obtain were sent to him heavy with the deep maledictions of Sheikh Hamed and the despairing sighs of sheikh Thani Altogether the sultanship of a district in Ugogo must be very remunerative besides being a delightful sinecure so long as the Sultan has to deal with timid Arab merchants who fear to exhibit anything approaching to independence and self reliance lest they might be mulcted in cloth In one day from one camp the sultan received forty seven doti consisting of Merikani Kaniki Barsati and Dabwani equal to thirty five dollars twenty five cents besides seven doti of superior cloths consisting of Rehani Sohari and Daobwani Ulyah and one fundo of Bubu equal to fourteen dollars making a total of forty nine dollars twenty five cents a most handsome revenue for a Mgogo chief On the twenty seventh May we gladly shook the dust of Mvumi from our feet and continued on our route ever westward Five of my donkeys had died the night before from the effects of the water of Marenga Mkali Before leaving the camp of Mvumi I went to look at their carcases but found them to have been clean picked by the hyaenas and the bones taken possession of by an army of white necked crows As we passed the numerous villages and perceived the entire face of the land to be one vast field of grain and counted the people halted by scores on the roadside to feast their eyes with a greedy stare on the Musungu I no longer wondered at the extortionate demands of the Wagogo For it was manifest that they had but to stretch out their hands to possess whatever the wealth of a caravan consisted of and I began to think better of the people who knowing well their strength did not use it of people who were intellectual enough to comprehend that their interest lay in permitting the caravans to pass on without attempting any outrage Between Mvumi and the nest Sultan s district that of Matamburu I counted no less than twenty five villages scattered over the clayey coloured plain Despite the inhospitable nature of the plain it was better cultivated than any part of any other country we had seen since leaving Bagamoyo When we had at last arrived at our boma of Matamburu the same groups of curious people the same eager looks the same exclamations of surprise the same peals of laughter at something they deemed ludicrous in the Musungu s dress or manner awaited us as at Mvumi The Arabs being Wakonongo travellers whom they saw every day enjoyed a complete immunity from the vexations which we had to endure The Sultan of Matamburu a man of herculean form and massive head well set on shoulders that might vie with those of Milo proved to be a very reasonable person Not quite so powerful as the Sultan of Mvumi he yet owned a fair share of Ugogo and about forty villages and could if he chose have oppressed the mercantile souls of my Arab companions in the same way as he of Mvumi Four doti of cloth were taken to him as a preliminary offering to his greatness which he said he would accept if the Arabs and Musungu would send him four more As his demands were so reasonable this little affair was soon terminated to everybody s satisfaction and soon after the kirangozi of Sheikh Hamed sounded the signal for the morrow s march At the orders of the same Sheikh the kirangozi stood up to speak before the assembled caravans Words words from the Bana he shouted Give ear kirangozis Listen children of Unyamwezi The journey is for to morrow The road is crooked and bad bad The jungle is there and many Wagogo lie hidden within it Wagogo spear the pagazis and cut the throats of those who carry mutumba bales and ushanga beads The Wagogo have been to our camp they have seen your bales to night they seek the jungle to morrow watch well O Wanyamwezi Keep close together lag not behind Kirangozis walk slow that the weak the sick and the young may keep up with the strong Take two rests on the journey These are the words of the Bana master Do you hear them Wanyamwezi A loud shout in the affirmative from all Do you understand them well another chorus then Bas having said which the eloquent kirangozi retired into the dark night and his straw hut The march to Bihawana our next camp was rugged and long through a continuous jungle of gums and thorns up steep hills and finally over a fervid plain while the sun waxed hotter and hotter as it drew near the meridian until it seemed to scorch all vitality from inanimate nature while the view was one white blaze unbearable to the pained sight which sought relief from the glare in vain Several sandy watercourses on which were impressed many a trail of elephants were also passed on this march The slope of these stream beds trended south east and south In the middle of this scorching plain stood the villages of Bihawana almost undistinguishable from the extreme lowness of the huts which did not reach the height of the tall bleached grass which stood smoking in the untempered heat Our camp was in a large boma about a quarter of a mile from the Sultan s tembe Soon after arriving at the camp I was visited by three Wagogo who asked me if I had seen a Mgogo on the road with a woman and child I was about to answer very innocently Yes when Mabruki cautious and watchful always for the interests of the master requested me not to answer as the Wagogo as customary would charge me with having done away with them and would require their price from me Indignant at the imposition they were about to practise upon me I was about to raise my whip to flog them out of the camp when again Mabruki with a roaring voice bade me beware for every blow would cost me three or four doti of cloth As I did not care to gratify my anger at such an expense I was compelled to swallow my wrath and consequently the Wagogo escaped chastisement We halted for one day at this place which was a great relief to me as I was suffering severely from intermittent fever which lasted in this case two weeks and entirely prevented my posting my diary in full as was my custom every evening after a march The Sultan of Bihawana though his subjects were evil disposed and ready handed at theft and murder contented himself with three doti as honga From this chief I received news of my fourth caravan which had distinguished itself in a fight with some outlawed subjects of his my soldiers had killed two who had attempted after waylaying a couple of my pagazis to carry away a bale of cloth and a bag of beads coming up in time the soldiers decisively frustrated the attempt The Sultan thought that if all caravans were as well guarded as mine were there would be less depredations committed on them while on the road with which I heartily agreed The next sultan s tembe through whose territory we marched this being on the thirtieth May was at Kididimo but four miles from Bihawna The road led through a flat elongated plain lying between two lengthy hilly ridges thickly dotted with the giant forms of the baobab Kididimo is exceedingly bleak in aspect Even the faces of the Wagogo seemed to have contracted a bleak hue from the general bleakness around The water of the pits obtained in the neighbourhood had an execrable flavor and two donkeys sickened and died in less than an hour from its effects Man suffered nausea and a general irritability of the system and accordingly revenged himself by cursing the country and its imbecile ruler most heartily The climax came however when Bombay reported after an attempt to settle the Muhongo that the chief s head had grown big since he heard that the Musungu had come and that its bigness could not be reduced unless he could extract ten doti as tribute Though the demand was large I was not in a humour being feeble and almost nerveless from repeated attacks of the Mukunguru to dispute the sum consequently it was paid without many words But the Arabs continued the whole afternoon negotiating and at the end had to pay eight doti each Between Kididimo and Nyambwa the district of the Sultan Pembera Pereh was a broad and lengthy forest and jungle inhabited by the elephant rhinoceros zebra deer antelope and giraffe Starting at dawn of the thirty first we entered the jungle whose dark lines and bosky banks were clearly visible from our bower at Kididimo and travelling for two hours halted for rest and breakfast at pools of sweet water surrounded by tracts of vivid green verdure which were a great resort for the wild animals of the jungle whose tracks were numerous and recent A narrow nullah shaded deeply with foliage afforded excellent retreats from the glaring sunshine At meridian our thirst quenched our hunger satisfied our gourds refilled we set out from the shade into the heated blaze of hot noon The path serpentined in and out of jungle and thin forest into open tracts of grass bleached white as stubble into thickets of gums and thorns which emitted an odour as rank as a stable through clumps of wide spreading mimosa and colonies of baobab through a country teeming with noble game which though we saw them frequently were yet as safe from our rifles as if we had been on the Indian Ocean A terekeza such as we were now making admits of no delay Water we had left behind at noon until noon of the next day not a drop was to be obtained and unless we marched fast and long on this day raging thirst would demoralize everybody So for six long weary hours we toiled bravely and at sunset we camped and still a march of two hours to be done before the sun was an hour high intervened between us and our camp at Nyambwa That night the men bivouacked under the trees surrounded by many miles of dense forest enjoying the cool night unprotected by hat or tent while I groaned and tossed throughout the night in a paroxysm of fever The morn came and while it was yet young the long caravan or string of caravans was under way It was the same forest admitting on the narrow line which we threaded but one man at a time Its view was as limited To our right and left the forest was dark and deep Above was a riband of glassy sky flecked by the floating nimbus We heard nothing save a few stray notes from a flying bird or the din of the caravans as the men sang or hummed or conversed or shouted as the thought struck them that we were nearing water One of my pagazis wearied and sick fell and never rose again The last of the caravan passed him before he died At seven A M we were encamped at Nyambwa drinking the excellent water found here with the avidity of thirsty camels Extensive fields of grain had heralded the neighbourhood of the villages at the sight of which we were conscious that the caravan was quickening its pace as approaching its halting place As the Wasungu drew within the populated area crowds of Wagogo used their utmost haste to see them before they passed by Young and old of both genders pressed about us in a multitude a very howling mob This excessive demonstrativeness elicited from my sailor overseer the characteristic remark Well I declare these must be the genuine Ugogians for they stare stare there is no end to their staring I m almost tempted to slap em in the face In fact the conduct of the Wagogo of Nyambwa was an exaggeration of the general conduct of Wagogo Hitherto those we had met had contented themselves with staring and shouting but these outstepped all bounds and my growing anger at their excessive insolence vented itself in gripping the rowdiest of them by the neck and before he could recover from his astonishment administering a sound thrashing with my dog whip which he little relished This proceeding educed from the tribe of starers all their native power of vituperation and abuse in expressing which they were peculiar Approaching in manner to angry tom cats they jerked their words with something of a splitting hiss and a half bark The ejaculation as near as I can spell it phonetically was hahcht uttered in a shrill crescendo tone They paced backwards and forwards asking themselves Are the Wagoga to be beaten like slaves by this Musungu A Mgogo is a Mgwana a free man he is not used to be beaten hahcht But whenever I made motion flourishing my whip towards them these mighty braggarts found it convenient to move to respectable distances from the irritated Musungu Perceiving that a little manliness and show of power was something which the Wagogo long needed and that in this instance it relieved me from annoyance I had recourse to my whip whose long lash cracked like a pistol shot whenever they overstepped moderation So long as they continued to confine their obtrusiveness to staring and communicating to each other their opinions respecting my complexion and dress and accoutrements I philosophically resigned myself in silence for their amusement but when they pressed on me barely allowing me to proceed a few vigorous and rapid slashes right and left with my serviceable thong soon cleared the track Pembera Pereh is a queer old man very small and would be very insignificant were he not the greatest sultan in Ugogo and enjoying a sort of dimediate power over many other tribes Though such an important chief he is the meanest dressed of his subjects is always filthy ever greasy eternally foul about the mouth but these are mere eccentricities as a wise judge he is without parallel always has a dodge ever ready for the abstraction of cloth from the spiritless Arab merchants who trade with Unyanyembe every year and disposes with ease of a judicial case which would overtask ordinary men Sheikh Hamed who was elected guider of the united caravans now travelling through Ugogo was of such a fragile and small make that he might be taken for an imitation of his famous prototype Dapper Being of such dimensions what he lacked for weight and size he made up by activity No sooner had he arrived in camp than his trim dapper form was seen frisking about from side to side of the great boma fidgeting arranging disturbing everything and everybody He permitted no bales or packs to be intermingled or to come into too close proximity to his own he had a favourite mode of stacking his goods which he would see carried out he had a special eye for the best place for his tent and no one else must trespass on that ground One would imagine that walking ten or fifteen miles a day he would leave such trivialities to his servants but no nothing could be right unless he had personally superintended it in which work he was tireless and knew no fatigue Another not uncommon peculiarity pertained to Sheikh Hamed as he was not a rich man he laboured hard to make the most of every shukka and doti expended and each fresh expenditure seemed to gnaw his very vitals he was ready to weep as he himself expressed it at the high prices of Ugogo and the extortionate demands of its sultans For this reason being the leader of the caravans so far as he was able we were very sure not to be delayed in Ugogo where food was so dear The day we arrived at Nyambwa will be remembered by Hamed as long as he lives for the trouble and vexation which he suffered His misfortunes arose from the fact that being too busily engaged in fidgeting about the camp he permitted his donkeys to stray into the matama fields of Pembera Pereh the Sultan For hours he and his servants sought for the stray donkeys returning towards evening utterly unsuccessful Hamed bewailing as only an Oriental can do when hard fate visits him with its inflictions the loss of a hundred do dollars worth of Muscat donkeys Sheikh Thani older more experienced and wiser suggested to him that he should notify the Sultan of his loss Acting upon the sagacious advice Hamed sent an embassy of two slaves and the information they brought back was that Pembera Pereh s servants had found the two donkeys eating the unripened matama and that unless the Arab who owned them would pay nine doti of first class cloths he Pembera Pereh would surely keep them to remunerate him for the matama they had eaten Hamed was in despair Nine doti of first class cloths worth twenty five dollars in Unyanyembe for half a chukka s worth of grain was as he thought an absurd demand but then if he did not pay it what would become of the hundred dollars worth of donkeys He proceeded to the Sultan to show him the absurdity of the damage claim and to endeavour to make him accept one chukka which would be more than double the worth of what grain the donkeys had consumed But the Sultan was sitting on pombe he was drunk which I believe to be his normal state too drunk to attend to business consequently his deputy a renegade Mnyamwezi gave ear to the business With most of the Wagogo chiefs lives a Mnyamwezi as their right hand man prime minister counsellor executioner ready man at all things save the general good a sort of harlequin Unyamwezi who is such an intriguing restless unsatisfied person that as soon as one hears that this kind of man forms one of and the chief of a Mgogo sultan s council one feels very much tempted to do damage to his person Most of the extortions practised upon the Arabs are suggested by these crafty renegades Sheikh Hamed found that the Mnyamwezi was far more obdurate than the Sultan nothing under nine doti first class cloths would redeem the donkeys The business that day remained unsettled and the night following was as one may imagine a very sleepless one to Hamed As it turned out however the loss of the donkeys the after heavy fine and the sleepless night proved to be blessings in disguise for towards midnight a robber Mgogo visited his camp and while attempting to steal a bale of cloth was detected in the act by the wide awake and irritated Arab and was made to vanish instantly with a bullet whistling in close proximity to his ear From each of the principals of the caravans the Mnyamwezi had received as tribute for his drunken master fifteen doti and from the other six caravans six doti each altogether fifty one doti yet on the next morning when we took the road he was not a whit disposed to deduct a single cloth from the fine imposed on Hamed and the unfortunate Sheikh was therefore obliged to liquidate the claim or leave his donkeys behind After travelling through the corn fields of Pembera Pereh we emerged upon a broad flat plain as level as the still surface of a pond whence the salt of the Wagogo is obtained From Kanyenyi on the southern road to beyond the confines of Uhumba and Ubanarama this saline field extends containing many large ponds of salt bitter water whose low banks are covered with an effervescence partaking of the nature of nitrate Subsequently two days afterwards having ascended the elevated ridge which separates Ugogo from Uyanzi I obtained a view of this immense saline plain embracing over a hundred square miles I may have been deceived but I imagined I saw large expanses of greyish blue water which causes me to believe that this salina is but a corner of a great salt lake The Wahumba who are numerous from Nyambwa to the Uyanzi border informed my soldiers that there was a Maji Kuba away to the north Mizanza our next camp after Nyambwa is situated in a grove of palms about thirteen miles from the latter place Soon after arriving I had to bury myself under blankets plagued with the same intermittent fever which first attacked me during the transit of Marenga Mkali Feeling certain that one day s halt which would enable me to take regular doses of the invaluable sulphate of quinine would cure me I requested Sheikh Thani to tell Hamed to halt on the morrow as I should be utterly unable to continue thus long under repeated attacks of a virulent disease which was fast reducing me into a mere frame of skin and bone Hamed in a hurry to arrive at Unyanyembe in order to dispose of his cloth before other caravans appeared in the market replied at first that he would not that he could not stop for the Musungu Upon Thani s reporting his answer to me I requested him to inform Hamed that as the Musungu did not wish to detain him or any other caravan it was his express wish that Hamed would march and leave him as he was quite strong enough in guns to march through Ugogo alone Whatever cause modified the Sheikh s resolution and his anxiety to depart Hamed s horn signal for the march was not heard that night and on the morrow he had not gone Early in the morning I commenced on my quinine doses at six A M I took a second dose before noon I had taken four more altogether fifty measured grains the effect of which was manifest in the copious perspiration which drenched flannels linen and blankets After noon I arose devoutly thankful that the disease which had clung to me for the last fourteen days had at last succumbed to quinine On this day the lofty tent and the American flag which ever flew from the centre pole attracted the Sultan of Mizanza towards it and was the cause of a visit with which he honoured me As he was notorious among the Arabs for having assisted Manwa Sera in his war against Sheikh Sny bin Amer high eulogies upon whom have been written by Burton and subsequently by Speke and as he was the second most powerful chief in Ugogo of course he was quite a curiosity to me As the tent door was uplifted that he might enter the ancient gentleman was so struck with astonishment at the lofty apex and internal arrangements that the greasy Barsati cloth which formed his sole and only protection against the chills of night and the heat of noon in a fit of abstraction was permitted to fall down to his feet exposing to the Musungu s unhallowed gaze the sad and aged wreck of what must once have been a towering form His son a youth of about fifteen attentive to the infirmities of his father hastened with filial duty to remind him of his condition upon which with an idiotic titter at the incident he resumed his scanty apparel and sat down to wonder and gibber out his admiration at the tent and the strange things which formed the Musungu s personal baggage and furniture After gazing in stupid wonder at the table on which was placed some crockery and the few books I carried with me at the slung hammock which he believed was suspended by some magical contrivance at the portmanteaus which contained my stock of clothes he ejaculated Hi le the Musungu is a great sultan who has come from his country to see Ugogo He then noticed me and was again wonder struck at my pale complexion and straight hair and the question now propounded was How on earth was I white when the sun had burned his people s skins into blackness Whereupon he was shown my cork topee which he tried on his woolly head much to his own and to our amusement The guns were next shown to him the wonderful repeating rifle of the Winchester Company which was fired thirteen times in rapid succession to demonstrate its remarkable murderous powers If he was astonished before he was a thousand times more so now and expressed his belief that the Wagogo could not stand before the Musungu in battle for wherever a Mgogo was seen such a gun would surely kill him Then the other firearms were brought forth each with its peculiar mechanism explained until in a burst of enthusiasm at my riches and power he said he would send me a sheep or goat and that he would be my brother I thanked him for the honour and promised to accept whatever he was pleased to send me At the instigation of Sheikh Thani who acted as interpreter who said that Wagogo chiefs must not depart with empty hands I cut off a shukka of Kaniki and presented it to him which after being examined and measured was refused upon the ground that the Musungu being a great sultan should not demean himself so much as to give him only a shukka This after the twelve doti received as muhongo from the caravans I thought was rather sore but as he was about to present me with a sheep or goat another shukka would not matter much Shortly after he departed and true to his promise I received a large fine sheep with a broad tail heavy with fat but with the words That being now his brother I must send him three doti of good cloth As the price of a sheep is but a doti and a half I refused the sheep and the fraternal honour upon the ground that the gifts were all on one side and that as I had paid muhongo and given him a doti of Kaniki as a present I could not afford to part with any more cloth without an adequate return During the afternoon one more of my donkeys died and at night the hyaenas came in great numbers to feast upon the carcase Ulimengo the chasseur and best shot of my Wangwana stole out and succeeded in shooting two which turned out to be some of the largest of their kind One of them measured six feet from the tip of the nose to the extremity of the tail and three feet around the girth On the fourth June we struck camp and after travelling westward for about three miles passing several ponds of salt water we headed north by west skirting the range of low hills which separates Ugogo from Uyanzi After a three hours march we halted for a short time at Little Mukondoku to settle tribute with the brother of him who rules at Mukondoku Proper Three doti satisfied the Sultan whose district contains but two villages mostly occupied by pastoral Wahumba and renegade Wahehe The Wahumba live in plastered cow dung cone huts shaped like the tartar tents of Turkestan The Wahumba so far as I have seen them are a fine and well formed race The men are positively handsome tall with small heads the posterior parts of which project considerably One will look in vain for a thick lip or a flat nose amongst them on the contrary the mouth is exceedingly well cut delicately small the nose is that of the Greeks and so universal was the peculiar feature that I at once named them the Greeks of Africa Their lower limbs have not the heaviness of the Wagogo and other tribes but are long and shapely clean as those of an antelope Their necks are long and slender on which their small heads are poised most gracefully Athletes from their youth shepherd bred and intermarrying among themselves thus keeping the race pure any of them would form a fit subject for the sculptor who would wish to immortalize in marble an Antinous a Hylas a Daphnis or an Apollo The women are as beautiful as the men are handsome They have clear ebon skins not coal black but of an inky hue Their ornaments consist of spiral rings of brass pendent from the ears brass ring collars about the necks and a spiral cincture of brass wire about their loins for the purpose of retaining their calf and goat skins which are folded about their bodies and depending from the shoulder shade one half of the bosom and fall to the knees The Wahehe may be styled the Romans of Africa Resuming our march after a halt of an hour in foul hours more we arrived at Mukondoku Proper This extremity of Ugogo is most populous The villages which surround the central tembe where the Sultan Swaruru lives amount to thirty six The people who flocked from these to see the wonderful men whose faces were white who wore the most wonderful things on their persons and possessed the most wonderful weapons guns which bum bummed as fast as you could count on your fingers formed such a mob of howling savages that I for an instant thought there was something besides mere curiosity which caused such commotion and attracted such numbers to the roadside Halting I asked what was the matter and what they wanted and why they made such noise One burly rascal taking my words for a declaration of hostilities promptly drew his bow but as prompt as he had fixed his arrow my faithful Winchester with thirteen shots in the magazine was ready and at the shoulder and but waited to see the arrow fly to pour the leaden messengers of death into the crowd But the crowd vanished as quickly as they had come leaving the burly Thersites and two or three irresolute fellows of his tribe standing within pistol range of my levelled rifle Such a sudden dispersion of the mob which but a moment before was overwhelming in numbers caused me to lower my rifle and to indulge in a hearty laugh at the disgraceful flight of the men destroyers The Arabs who were as much alarmed at their boisterous obtrusiveness now came up to patch a truce in which they succeeded to everybody s satisfaction A few words of explanation and the mob came back in greater numbers than before and the Thersites who had been the cause of the momentary disturbance was obliged to retire abashed before the pressure of public opinion A chief now came up whom I afterwards learned was the second man to Swaruru and lectured the people upon their treatment of the White Stranger Know ye not Wagogo shouted he that this Musungu is a sultan mtemi a most high title He has not come to Ugogo like the Wakonongo Arabs to trade in ivory but to see us and give presents Why do you molest him and his people Let them pass in peace If you wish to see him draw near but do not mock him The first of you who creates a disturbance let him beware our great mtemi shall know how you treat his friends This little bit of oratorical effort on the part of the chief was translated to me there and then by the old Sheik Thani which having understood I bade the Sheikh inform the chief that after I had rested I should like him to visit me in my tent Having arrived at the khambi which always surrounds some great baobab in Ugogo at the distance of about half a mile from the tembe of the Sultan the Wagogo pressed in such great numbers to the camp that Sheikh Thani resolved to make an effort to stop or mitigate the nuisance Dressing himself in his best clothes he went to appeal to the Sultan for protection against his people The Sultan was very much inebriated and was pleased to say What is it you want you thief You have come to steal my ivory or my cloth Go away thief But the sensible chief whose voice had just been heard reproaching the people for their treatment of the Wasungu beckoned to Thani to come out of the tembe and then proceeded with him towards the khambi The camp was in a great uproar the curious Wagogo monopolized almost every foot of ground there was no room to turn anywhere The Wanyamwezi were quarreling with the Wagogo the Wasawahili servants were clamoring loud that the Wagogo pressed down their tents and that the property of the masters was in danger while I busy on my diary within my tent cared not how great was the noise and confusion outside as long as it confined itself to the Wagogo Wanyamwezi and Wangwana The presence of the chief in the camp was followed by a deep silence that I was prevailed upon to go outside to see what had caused it The chief s words were few and to the point He said To your tembes Wagogo to your tembes Why do you come to trouble the Wakonongo What have you to do with them To your tembes go Each Mgogo found in the khambi without meal without cattle to sell shall pay to the mtemi cloth or cows Away with you Saying which he snatched up a stick and drove the hundreds out of the khambi who were as obedient to him as so many children During the two days we halted at Mukondoku we saw no more of the mob and there was peace The muhongo of the Sultan Swaruru was settled with few words The chief who acted for the Sultan as his prime minister having been made glad with a doti of Rehani Ulyah from me accepted the usual tribute of six doti only one of which was of first class cloth There remained but one more sultan to whom muhongo must be paid after Mukondoku and this was the Sultan of Kiwyeh whose reputation was so bad that owners of property who had control over their pagazis seldom passed by Kiwyeh preferring the hardships of long marches through the wilderness to the rudeness and exorbitant demands of the chief of Kiwyeh But the pagazis on whom no burden or responsibility fell save that of carrying their loads who could use their legs and show clean heels in the case of a hostile outbreak preferred the march to Kiwyeh to enduring thirst and the fatigue of a terekeza Often the preference of the pagazis won the day when their employers were timid irresolute men like Sheikh Hamed The seventh of June was the day fixed for our departure from Mukondoku so the day before the Arabs came to my tent to counsel with me as to the route we should adopt On calling together the kirangozis of the respective caravans and veteran Wanyamwezi pagazis we learned there were three roads leading from Mukondoku to Uyanzi The first was the southern road and the one generally adopted for the reasons already stated and led by Kiwyeh To this Hamed raised objections The Sultan was bad he said he sometimes charged a caravan twenty doti our caravan would have to pay about sixty doti The Kiwyeh road would not do at all Besides he added we have to make a terekeza to reach Kiwyeh and then we will not reach it before the day after to morrow The second was the central road We should arrive at Munieka on the morrow the day after would be a terekeza from Mabunguru Nullah to a camp near Unyambogi two hours the next day would bring us to Kiti where there was plenty of water and food As neither of the kirangozis or Arabs knew this road and its description came from one of my ancient pagazis Hamed said he did not like to trust the guidance of such a large caravan in the hands of an old Mnyamwezi and would therefore prefer to hear about the third road before rendering his decision The third road was the northern It led past numerous villages of the Wagogo for the first two hours then we should strike a jungle and a three hours march would then bring us to Simbo where there was water but no village Starting early next morning we would travel six hours when we would arrive at a pool of water Here taking a short rest an afternoon march of five hours would bring us within three hours of another village As this last road was known to many Hamed said Sheikh Thani tell the Sahib that I think this is the best road Sheikh Thani was told after he had informed me that as I had marched with them through Ugogo if they decided upon going by Simbo my caravan would follow Immediately after the discussion among the principals respecting the merits of the several routes arose a discussion among the pagazis which resulted in an obstinate clamor against the Simbo road for its long terekeza and scant prospects of water the dislike to the Simbo road communicated itself to all the caravans and soon it was magnified by reports of a wilderness reaching from Simbo to Kusuri where there was neither food nor water to be obtained Hamed s pagazis and those of the Arab servants rose in a body and declared they could not go on that march and if Hamed insisted upon adopting it they would put their packs down and leave him to carry them himself Hamed Kimiani as he was styled by the Arabs rushed up to Sheikh Thani and declared that he must take the Kiwyeh road otherwise his pagazis would all desert Thani replied that all the roads were the same to him that wherever Hamed chose to go he would follow They then came to my tent and informed me of the determination at which the Wanyamwezi had arrived Calling my veteran Mnyamwezi who had given me the favourable report once more to my tent I bade him give a correct account of the Kiti road It was so favourable that my reply to Hamed was that I was the master of my caravan that it was to go wherever I told the kirangozi not where the pagazis chose that when I told them to halt they must halt and when I commanded a march a march should be made and that as I fed them well and did not overwork them I should like to see the pagazi or soldier that disobeyed me You made up your mind just now that you would take the Simbo road and we were agreed upon it now your pagazis say they will take the Kiwyeh road or desert Go on the Kiwyeh road and pay twenty doti muhongo I and my caravan to morrow morning will take the Kiti road and when you find me in Unyanyembe one day ahead of you you will be sorry you did not take the same road This resolution of mine had the effect of again changing the current of Hamed s thoughts for he instantly said That is the best road after all and as the Sahib is determined to go on it and we have all travelled together through the bad land of the Wagogo Inshallah let us all go the same way and Thani good old man not objecting and Hamed having decided they both joyfully went out of the tent to communicate the news On the seventh the caravans apparently unanimous that the Kiti road was to be taken were led as usual by Hamed s kirangozi We had barely gone a mile before I perceived that we had left the Simbo road had taken the direction of Kiti and by a cunning detour were now fast approaching the defile of the mountain ridge before us which admitted access to the higher plateau of Kiwyeh Instantly halting my caravan I summoned the veteran who had travelled by Kiti and asked him whether we were not going towards Kiwyeh He replied that we were Calling my pagazis together I bade Bombay tell them that the Musuugu never changed his mind that as I had said my caravan should march by Kiti to Kiti it must go whether the Arabs followed or not I then ordered the veteran to take up his load and show the kirangozi the proper road to Kiti The Wanyamwezi pagazis put down their bales and then there was every indication of a mutiny The Wangwana soldiers were next ordered to load their guns and to flank the caravan and shoot the first pagazis who made an attempt to run away Dismounting I seized my whip and advancing towards the first pagazi who had put down his load I motioned to him to take up his load and march It was unnecessary to proceed further without an exception all marched away obediently after the kirangozi I was about bidding farewell to Thani and Hamed when Thani said Stop a bit Sahib I have had enough of this child s play I come with you and his caravan was turned after mine Hamed s caravan was by this time close to the defile and he himself was a full mile behind it weeping like a child at what he was pleased to call our desertion of him Pitying his strait for he was almost beside himself as thoughts of Kiwyeh s sultan his extortion and rudeness swept across his mind I advised him to run after his caravan and tell it as all the rest had taken the other road to think of the Sultan of Kiwyeh Before reaching the Kiti defile I was aware that Hamed s caravan was following us The ascent of the ridge was rugged and steep thorns of the prickliest nature punished us severely the acacia horrida was here more horrid than usual the gums stretched out their branches and entangled the loads the mimosa with its umbrella like top served to shade us from the sun but impeded a rapid advance Steep outcrops of syenite and granite worn smooth by many feet had to be climbed over rugged terraces of earth and rock had to be ascended and distant shots resounding through the forest added to the alarm and general discontent and had I not been immediately behind my caravan watchful of every manoeuvre my Wanyamwezi had deserted to a man Though the height we ascended was barely eight hundred feet above the salina we had just left the ascent occupied two hours Having surmounted the plateau and the worst difficulties we had a fair road comparatively which ran through jungle forest and small open tracts which in three hours more brought us to Munieka a small village surrounded by a clearing richly cultivated by a colony of subjects of Swaruru of Mukondoku By the time we had arrived at camp everybody had recovered his good humour and content except Hamed Thani s men happened to set his tent too close to Hamed s tree around which his bales were stacked Whether the little Sheikh imagined honest old Thani capable of stealing one is not known but it is certain that he stormed and raved about the near neighbourhood of his best friend s tent until Thani ordered its removal a hundred yards off This proceeding even it seems did not satisfy Hamed for it was quite midnight as Thani said when Hamed came and kissing his hands and feet on his knees implored forgiveness which of course Thani being the soul of good nature and as large hearted as any man willingly gave Hamed was not satisfied however until with the aid of his slaves he had transported his friend s tent to where it had at first been pitched The water at Munieka was obtained from a deep depression in a hump of syenite and was as clear as crystal and cold as ice water a luxury we had not experienced since leaving Simbamwenni We were now on the borders of Uyanzi or as it is better known Magunda Mkali the Hot ground or Hot field We had passed the village populated by Wagogo and were about to shake the dust of Ugogo from our feet We had entered Ugogo full of hopes believing it a most pleasant land a land flowing with milk and honey We had been grievously disappointed it proved to be a land of gall and bitterness full of trouble and vexation of spirit where danger was imminent at every step where we were exposed to the caprice of inebriated sultans Is it a wonder then that all felt happy at such a moment With the prospect before us of what was believed by many to be a real wilderness our ardor was not abated but was rather strengthened The wilderness in Africa proves to be in many instances more friendly than the populated country The kirangozi blew his kudu horn much more merrily on this morning than he was accustomed to do while in Ugogo We were about to enter Magunda Mkali At nine A M three hours after leaving Munieka and two hours since we had left the extreme limits of Ugogo we were halted at Mabunguru Nullah The Nullah runs southwesterly after leaving its source in the chain of hills dividing Ugogo from Magunda Mkali During the rainy season it must be nearly impassable owing to the excessive slope of its bed Traces of the force of the torrent are seen in the syenite and basalt boulders which encumber the course Their rugged angles are worn smooth and deep basins are excavated where the bed is of the rock which in the dry season serve as reservoirs Though the water contained in them has a slimy and greenish appearance and is well populated with frogs it is by no means unpalatable At noon we resumed our march the Wanyamwezi cheering shouting and singing the Wangwana soldiers servants and pagazis vieing with them in volume of voice and noise making the dim forest through which we were now passing resonant with their voices The scenery was much more picturesque than any we had yet seen since leaving Bagamoyo The ground rose into grander waves hills cropped out here and there great castles of syenite appeared giving a strange and weird appearance to the forest From a distance it would almost seem as if we were approaching a bit of England as it must have appeared during feudalism the rocks assumed such strange fantastic shapes Now they were round boulders raised one above another apparently susceptible to every breath of wind anon they towered like blunt pointed obelisks taller than the tallest trees again they assumed the shape of mighty waves vitrified here they were a small heap of fractured and riven rock there they rose to the grandeur of hills By five P M we had travelled twenty miles and the signal was sounded for a halt At one A M the moon being up Hamed s horn and voice were heard throughout the silent camp awaking his pagazis for the march Evidently Sheikh Hamed was gone stark mad otherwise why should he be so frantic for the march at such an early hour The dew was falling heavily and chilled one like frost and an ominous murmur of deep discontent responded to the early call on all sides Presuming however that he had obtained better information than we had Sheikh Thani and I resolved to be governed as the events proved him to be right or wrong As all were discontented this night march was performed in deep silence The thermometer was at fifty three deg we being about four thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea The pagazis almost naked walked quickly in order to keep warm and by so doing many a sore foot was made by stumbling against obtrusive roots and rocks and treading on thorns At three A M we arrived at the village of Unyambogi where we threw ourselves down to rest and sleep until dawn should reveal what else was in store for the hard dealt with caravans It was broad daylight when I awoke the sun was flaring his hot beams in my face Sheikh Thani came soon after to inform me that Hamed had gone to Kiti two hours since but he when asked to accompany him positively refused exclaiming against it as folly and utterly unnecessary When my advice was asked by Thani I voted the whole thing as sheer nonsense and in turn asked him what a terekeza was for Was it not an afternoon march to enable caravans to reach water and food Thani replied than it was I then asked him if there was no water or food to be obtained in Unyambogi Thani replied that he had not taken pains to inquire but was told by the villagers that there was an abundance of matamia hindi maweri sheep goats and chickens in their village at cheap prices such as were not known in Ugogo Well then said I if Hamed wants to be a fool and kill his pagazis why should we I have as much cause for haste as Sheikh Hamed but Unyanyembe is far yet and I am not going to endanger my property by playing the madman As Thani had reported we found an abundance of provisions at the village and good sweet water from some pits close by A sheep cost one chukka six chickens were also purchased at that price six measures of matama maweri or hindi were procurable for the same sum in short we were coming at last into the land of plenty On the tenth June we arrived at Kiti after a journey of four hours and a half where we found the irrepressible Hamed halted in sore trouble He who would be a Caesar proved to be an irresolute Antony He had to sorrow over the death of a favourite slave girl the loss of five dish dashes Arab shirts silvered sleeve and gold embroidered jackets with which he had thought to enter Unyanyembe in state as became a merchant of his standing which had disappeared with three absconding servants besides copper trays rice and pilau dishes and two bales of cloth with runaway Wangwana pagazis Selim my Arab servant asked him What are you doing here Sheikh Hamed I thought you were well on the road to Unyanyembe Said he Could I leave Thani my friend behind Kiti abounded in cattle and grain and we were able to obtain food at easy rates The Wakimbu emigrants from Ukimbu near Urori are a quiet race preferring the peaceful arts of agriculture to war of tending their flocks to conquest At the least rumor of war they remove their property and family and emigrate to the distant wilderness where they begin to clear the land and to hunt the elephant for his ivory Yet we found them to be a fine race and well armed and seemingly capable by their numbers and arms to compete with any tribe But here as elsewhere disunion makes them weak They are mere small colonies each colony ruled by its own chief whereas were they united they might make a very respectable front before an enemy Our next destination was Msalalo distant fifteen miles from Kiti Hamed after vainly searching for his runaways and the valuable property he had lost followed us and tried once more when he saw us encamped at Msalalo to pass us but his pagazis failed him the march having been so long Welled Ngaraiso was reached on the fifteenth after a three and a half hours march It is a flourishing little place where provisions were almost twice as cheap as they were at Unyambogi Two hours march south is Jiweh la Mkoa on the old road towards which the road which we have been travelling since leaving Bagamoyo was now rapidly leading Unyanyembe being near the pagazis and soldiers having behaved excellently during the lengthy marches we had lately made I purchased a bullock for three doti and had it slaughtered for their special benefit I also gave each a khete of red beads to indulge his appetite for whatever little luxury the country afforded Milk and honey were plentiful and three frasilah of sweet potatoes were bought for a shukka equal to about forty cents of our money The thirteenth June brought us to the last village of Magunda Mkali in the district of Jiweh la Singa after a short march of eight miles and three quarters Kusuri so called by the Arabs is called Konsuli by the Wakimbu who inhabit it This is however but one instance out of many where the Arabs have misnamed or corrupted the native names of villages and districts Between Ngaraiso and Kusuri we passed the village of Kirurumo now a thriving place with many a thriving village near it As we passed it the people came out to greet the Musungu whose advent had been so long heralded by his loud mouthed caravans and whose soldiers had helped them win the day in a battle against their fractious brothers of Jiweh la Mkoa A little further on we came across a large khambi occupied by Sultan bin Mohammed an Omani Arab of high descent who as soon as he was notified of my approach came out to welcome me and invite me to his khambi As his harem lodged in his tent of course I was not invited thither but a carpet outside was ready for his visitor After the usual questions had been asked about my health the news of the road the latest from Zanzibar and Oman he asked me if I had much cloth with me This was a question often asked by owners of down caravans and the reason of it is that the Arabs in their anxiety to make as much as possible of their cloth at the ivory ports on the Tanganika and elsewhere are liable to forget that they should retain a portion for the down marches As indeed I had but a bale left of the quantity of cloth retained for provisioning my party on the road when outfitting my caravans on the coast I could unblushingly reply in the negative I halted a day at Kusuri to give my caravan a rest after its long series of marches before venturing on the two days march through the uninhabited wilderness that separates the district of Jiweh la Singa Uyanzi from the district of Tura in Unyanyembe Hamed preceded promising to give Sayd bin Salim notice of my coming and to request him to provide a tembe for me On the fifteenth having ascertained that Sheikh Thani would be detained several days at Kusuri owing to the excessive number of his people who were laid up with that dreadful plague of East Africa the small pox I bade him farewell and my caravan struck out of Kusuri once more for the wilderness and the jungle A little before noon we halted at the Khambi of Mgongo Tembo or the Elephant s Back so called from a wave of rock whose back stained into dark brownness by atmospheric influences is supposed by the natives to resemble the blue brown back of this monster of the forest My caravan had quite an argument with me here as to whether we should make the terekeza on this day or on the next The majority was of the opinion that the next day would be the best for a terekeza but I being the bana consulting my own interests insisted not without a flourish or two of my whip that the terekeza should be made on this day Mgongo Tembo when Burton and Speke passed by was a promising settlement cultivating many a fair acre of ground But two years ago war broke out for some bold act of its people upon caravans and the Arabs came from Unyanyembe with their Wangwana servants attacked them burnt the villages and laid waste the work of years Since that time Mgongo Tembo has been but blackened wrecks of houses and the fields a sprouting jungle A cluster of date palm trees overtopping a dense grove close to the mtoni of Mgongo Tembo revived my recollections of Egypt The banks of the stream with their verdant foliage presented a strange contrast to the brown and dry appearance of the jungle which lay on either side At one P M we resumed our loads and walking staffs and in a short time were en route for the Ngwhalah Mtoni distant eight and three quarter miles from the khambi The sun was hot like a globe of living seething flame it flared its heat full on our heads then as it descended towards the west scorched the air before it was inhaled by the lungs which craved it Gourds of water were emptied speedily to quench the fierce heat that burned the throat and lungs One pagazi stricken heavily with the small pox succumbed and threw himself down on the roadside to die We never saw him afterwards for the progress of a caravan on a terekeza is something like that of a ship in a hurricane The caravan must proceed woe befall him who lags behind for hunger and thirst will overtake him so must a ship drive before the fierce gale to escape foundering woe befall him who falls overboard An abundance of water good sweet and cool was found in the bed of the mtoni in deep stony reservoirs Here also the traces of furious torrents were clearly visible as at Mabunguru The Nghwhalah commences in Ubanarama to the north a country famous for its fine breed of donkeys and after running south south south west crosses the Unyanyembe road from which point it has more of a westerly turn On the sixteenth we arrived at Madedita so called from a village which was but is now no more Madedita is twelve and a half miles from the Nghwhalah Mtoni A pool of good water a few hundred yards from the roadside is the only supply caravans can obtain nearer than Tura in Unyamwezi The tsetse or chufwa fly as called by the Wasawahili stung us dreadfully which is a sign that large game visit the pool sometimes but must not be mistaken for an indication that there is any in the immediate neighbourhood of the water A single pool so often frequented by passing caravans which must of necessity halt here could not be often visited by the animals of the forest who are shy in this part of Africa of the haunts of man At dawn the neat day we were on the road striding at a quicker pace than on most days since we were about to quit Magunda Mali for the more populated and better land of Unyamwezi The forest held its own for a wearisomely long time but at the end of two hours it thinned then dwarfed into low jungle and finally vanished altogether and we had arrived on the soil of Unyamwezi with a broad plain swelling subsiding and receding in lengthy and grand undulations in our front to one indefinite horizontal line which purpled in the far distance The view consisted of fields of grain ripening which followed the contour of the plain and which rustled merrily before the morning breeze that came laden with the chills of Usagara At eight A M we had arrived at the frontier village of Unyamwezi Eastern Tura which we invaded without any regard to the disposition of the few inhabitants who lived there Here we found Nondo a runaway of Speke s one of those who had sided with Baraka against Bombay who desiring to engage himself with me was engaging enough to furnish honey and sherbet to his former companions and lastly to the pagazis It was only a short breathing pause we made here having another hour s march to reach Central Tura The road from Eastern Tura led through vast fields of millet Indian corn holcus sorghum maweri or panicum or bajri as called by the Arabs gardens of sweet potatoes large tracts of cucumbers water melons mush melons and pea nuts which grew in the deep furrows between the ridges of the holcus Some broad leafed plantain plants were also seen in the neighbourhood of the villages which as we advanced became very numerous The villages of the Wakimbu are like those of the Wagogo square flat roofed enclosing an open area which is sometimes divided into three or four parts by fences or matama stalks At central Tura where we encamped we had evidence enough of the rascality of the Wakimbu of Tura Hamed who despite his efforts to reach Unyanyembe in time to sell his cloths before other Arabs came with cloth supplies was unable to compel his pagazis to the double march every day was also encamped at Central Tura together with the Arab servants who preferred Hamed s imbecile haste to Thani s cautious advance Our first night in Unyamwezi was very exciting indeed The Musungu s camp was visited by two crawling thieves but they were soon made aware by the portentous click of a trigger that the white man s camp was well guarded Hamed s camp was next visited but here also the restlessness of the owner frustrated their attempts for he was pacing backwards and forwards through his camp with a loaded gun in his hand and the thieves were obliged to relinquish the chance of stealing any of his bales From Hamed s they proceeded to Hassan s camp one of the Arab servants where they were successful enough to reach and lay hold of a couple of bales but unfortunately they made a noise which awoke the vigilant and quick eared slave who snatched his loaded musket and in a moment had shot one of them through the heart Such were our experiences of the Wakimbu of Tura On the eighteenth the three caravans Hamed s Hassan s and my own left Tura by a road which zig zagged towards all points through the tall matama fields In an hour s time we had passed Tura Perro or Western Tura and had entered the forest again whence the Wakimbu of Tura obtain their honey and where they excavate deep traps for the elephants with which the forest is said to abound An hour s march from Western Tura brought us to a ziwa or pond There were two situated in the midst of a small open mbuga or plain which even at this late season was yet soft from the water which overflows it during the rainy season After resting three hours we started on the terekeza or afternoon march It was one and the same forest that we had entered soon after leaving Western Tura that we travelled through until we reached the Kwala Mtoni or as Burton has misnamed it on his map Kwale The water of this mtoni is contained in large ponds or deep depressions in the wide and crooked gully of Kwala In these ponds a species of mud fish was found off one of which I made a meal by no means to be despised by one who had not tasted fish since leaving Bagamoyo Probably if I had my choice being when occasion demands it rather fastidious in my tastes I would not select the mud fish From Tura to the Kwala Mtoni is seventeen and a half miles a distance which however easy it may be traversed once a fortnight assumes a prodigious length when one has to travel it almost every other day at least so my pagazis soldiers and followers found it and their murmurs were very loud when I ordered the signal to be sounded on the march Abdul Kader the tailor who had attached himself to me as a man ready handed at all things from mending a pair of pants making a delicate entremets or shooting an elephant but whom the interior proved to be the weakliest of the weakly unfit for anything except eating and drinking almost succumbed on this march Long ago the little stock of goods which Abdul had brought from Zanzibar folded in a pocket handkerchief and with which he was about to buy ivory and slaves and make his fortune in the famed land of Unyamwezi had disappeared with the great eminent hopes he had built on them like those of Alnaschar the unfortunate owner of crockery in the Arabian tale He came to me as we prepared for the march with a most dolorous tale about his approaching death which he felt in his bones and weary back his legs would barely hold him up in short he had utterly collapsed would I take mercy on him and let him depart The cause of this extraordinary request so unlike the spirit with which he had left Zanzibar eager to possess the ivory and slaves of Unyamwezi was that on the last long march two of my donkeys being dead I had ordered that the two saddles which they had carried should be Abdul Kader s load to Unyanyembe The weight of the saddles was sixteen lbs as the spring balance scale indicated yet Abdul Kader became weary of life as he counted the long marches that intervened between the mtoni and Unyanyembe On the ground he fell prone to kiss my feet begging me in the name of God to permit him to depart As I had had some experience of Hindoos Malabarese and coolies in Abyssinia I knew exactly how to deal with a case like this Unhesitatingly I granted the request as soon as asked for as much tired as Abdul Kader said he was of life I was with Abdul Kader s worthlessness But the Hindi did not want to be left in the jungle he said but after arriving in Unyanyembe Oh said I then you must reach Unyanyembe first in the meanwhile you will carry those saddles there for the food which you must eat As the march to Rubuga was eighteen and three quarter miles the pagazis walked fast and long without resting Rubuga in the days of Burton according to his book was a prosperous district Even when we passed the evidences of wealth and prosperity which it possessed formerly were plain enough in the wide extent of its grain fields which stretched to the right and left of the Unyanyembe road for many a mile But they were only evidences of what once were numerous villages a well cultivated and populous district rich in herds of cattle and stores of grain All the villages are burnt down the people have been driven north three or four days from Rubuga the cattle were taken by force the grain fields were left standing to be overgrown with jungle and rank weeds We passed village after village that had been burnt and were mere blackened heaps of charred timber and smoked clay field after field of grain ripe years ago was yet standing in the midst of a crop of gums and thorns mimosa and kolquall We arrived at the village occupied by about sixty Wangwana who have settled here to make a living by buying and selling ivory Food is provided for them in the deserted fields of the people of Rubuga We were very tired and heated from the long march but the pagazis had all arrived by three p m At the Wangwana village we met Amer bin Sultan the very type of an old Arab sheikh such as we read of in books with a snowy beard and a clean reverend face who was returning to Zanzibar after a ten years residence in Unyanyembe He presented me with a goat and a goatskin full of rice a most acceptable gift in a place where a goat costs five cloths After a day s halt at Rubuga during which I despatched soldiers to notify Sheikh Sayd bin Salim and Sheikh bin Nasib the two chief dignitaries of Unyanyembe of my coming on the twenty first of June we resumed the march for Kigwa distant five hours The road ran through another forest similar to that which separated Tura from Rubuga the country rapidly sloping as we proceeded westward Kigwa we found to have been visited by the same vengeance which rendered Rubuga such a waste The next day after a three and a half hours rapid march we crossed the mtoni which was no mtoni separating Kigwa from Unyanyembe district and after a short halt to quench our thirst in three and a half hours more arrived at Shiza It was a most delightful march though a long one for its picturesqueness of scenery which every few minutes was revealed and the proofs we everywhere saw of the peaceable and industrious disposition of the people A short half hour from Shiza we beheld the undulating plain wherein the Arabs have chosen to situate the central depot which commands such wide and extensive field of trade The lowing of cattle and the bleating of the goats and sheep were everywhere heard giving the country a happy pastoral aspect The Sultan of Shiza desired me to celebrate my arrival in Unyanyembe with a five gallon jar of pombe which he brought for that purpose As the pombe was but stale ale in taste and milk and water in colour after drinking a small glassful I passed it to the delighted soldiers and pagazis At my request the Sultan brought a fine fat bullock for which he accepted four and a half doti of Merikani The bullock was immediately slaughtered and served out to the caravan as a farewell feast No one slept much that night and long before the dawn the fires were lit and great steaks were broiling that their stomachs might rejoice before parting with the Musungu whose bounty they had so often tasted Six rounds of powder were served to each soldier and pagazi who owned a gun to fire away when we should be near the Arab houses The meanest pagazi had his best cloth about his loins and some were exceedingly brave in gorgeous Ulyah Coombeesa Poonga and crimson Jawah the glossy Rehani and the neat Dabwani The soldiers were mustered in new tarbooshes and the long white shirts of the Mrima and the Island For this was the great and happy day which had been on our tongues ever since quitting the coast for which we had made those noted marches latterly one hundred and seventy eight and a half miles in sixteen days including pauses something over eleven miles a day The signal sounded and the caravan was joyfully off with banners flying and trumpets and horns blaring A short two and a half hours march brought us within sight of Kwikuru which is about two miles south of Tabora the main Arab town on the outside of which we saw a long line of men in clean shirts whereat we opened our charged batteries and fired a volley of small arms such as Kwikuru seldom heard before The pagazis closed up and adopted the swagger of veterans the soldiers blazed away uninterruptedly while I seeing that the Arabs were advancing towards me left the ranks and held out my hand which was immediately grasped by Sheikh Sayd bin Salim and then by about two dozen people and thus our entree into Unyanyembe was effected CHAPTER VIII MY LIFE AND TROUBLES DURING MY RESIDENCE IN UNYAS NYEMBE I BECOME ENGAGED IN A WAR I received a noiseless ovation as I walked side by side with the governor Sayd bin Salim towards his tembe in Kwikuru or the capital The Wanyamwezi pagazis were out by hundreds the warriors of Mkasiwa the sultan hovered around their chief the children were seen between the legs of their parents even infants a few months old slung over their mothers backs all paid the tribute due to my colour with one grand concentrated stare The only persons who talked with me were the Arabs and aged Mkasiwa ruler of Unyanyembe Sayd bin Salim s house was at the north western corner of the inclosure a stockaded boma of Kwikuru We had tea made in a silver tea pot and a bountiful supply of dampers were smoking under a silver cover and to this repast I was invited When a man has walked eight miles or so without any breakfast and a hot tropical sun has been shining on him for three or four hours he is apt to do justice to a meal especially if his appetite is healthy I think I astonished the governor by the dexterous way in which I managed to consume eleven cups of his aromatic concoction of an Assam herb and the easy effortless style with which I demolished his high tower of slap jacks that but a minute or so smoked hotly under their silver cover For the meal I thanked the Sheikh as only an earnest and sincerely hungry man now satisfied could thank him Even if I had not spoken my gratified looks had well informed him under what obligations I had been laid to him Out came my pipe and tobacco pouch My friendly Sheikh wilt thou smoke No thanks Arabs never smoke Oh if you don t perhaps you would not object to me smoking in order to assist digestion Ngema good go on master Then began the questions the gossipy curious serious light questions How came the master By the Mpwapwa road It is good Was the Makata bad Very bad What news from Zanzibar Good Syed Toorkee has possession of Muscat and Azim bin Ghis was slain in the streets Is this true Wallahi by God It is true Heh heh h This is news stroking his beard Have you heard master of Suleiman bin Ali Yes the Bombay governor sent him to Zanzibar in a man of war and Suleiman bin Ali now lies in the gurayza fort Heh that is very good Did you have to pay much tribute to the Wagogo Eight times Hamed Kimiani wished me to go by Kiwyeh but I declined and struck through the forest to Munieka Hamed and Thani thought it better to follow me than brave Kiwyeh by themselves Where is that Hajji Abdullah Captain Burton that came here and Spiki Speke Hajji Abdullah What Hajji Abdullah Ah Sheikh Burton we call him Oh he is a great man now a balyuz a consul at El Scham Damascus Heh heh balyuz Heh at El Scham Is not that near Betlem el Kuds Jerusalem Yes about four days Spiki is dead He shot himself by accident Ah ah Wallah by God but this is bad news Spiki dead Mash Allah Ough he was a good man a good man Dead But where is this Kazeh Sheikh Sayd Kazeh Kazeh I never heard the name before But you were with Burton and Speke at Kazeh you lived there several months when you were all stopping in Unyanyembe it must be close here somewhere Where did Hajji Abdullah and Spiki live when they were in Unyanyembe Was it not in Musa Mzuri s house That was in Tabora Well then where is Kazeh I have never seen the man yet who could tell me where that place is and yet the three white men have that word down as the name of the place they lived at when you were with them You must know where it is Wallahi bana I never heard the name but stop Kazeh in Kinyamwezi means kingdom Perhaps they gave that name to the place they stopped at But then I used to call the first house Sny bin Amer s house and Speke lived at Musa Mzuri s house but both houses as well as all the rest are in Tabora Thank you sheikh I should like to go and look after my people they must all be wanting food I shall go with you to show you your house The tembe is in Kwihara only an hour s walk from Tabora On leaving Kwikuru we crossed a low ridge and soon saw Kwihara lying between two low ranges of hills the northernmost of which was terminated westward by the round fortress like hill of Zimbili There was a cold glare of intense sunshine over the valley probably the effect of an universal bleakness or an autumnal ripeness of the grass unrelieved by any depth of colour to vary the universal sameness The hills were bleached or seemed to be under that dazzling sunshine and clearest atmosphere The corn had long been cut and there lay the stubble and fields a browny white expanse the houses were of mud and their fiat roofs were of mud and the mud was of a browny whiteness the huts were thatched and the stockades around them of barked timber and these were of a browny whiteness The cold fierce sickly wind from the mountains of Usagara sent a deadly chill to our very marrows yet the intense sunshiny glare never changed a black cow or two or a tall tree here and there caught the eye for a moment but they never made one forget that the first impression of Kwihara was as of a picture without colour or of food without taste and if one looked up there was a sky of a pale blue spotless and of an awful serenity As I approached the tembe of Sayd bin Salim Sheikh bin Nasib and other great Arabs joined us Before the great door of the tembe the men had stacked the bales and piled the boxes and were using their tongues at a furious rate relating to the chiefs and soldiers of the first second and fourth caravans the many events which had befallen them and which seemed to them the only things worth relating Outside of their own limited circles they evidently cared for nothing Then the several chiefs of the other caravans had in turn to relate their experiences of the road and the noise of tongues was loud and furious But as we approached all this loud sounding gabble ceased and my caravan chiefs and guides rushed to me to hail me as master and to salute me as their friend One fellow faithful Baruti threw himself at my feet the others fired their guns and acted like madmen suddenly become frenzied and a general cry of welcome was heard on all sides Walk in master this is your house now here are your men s quarters here you will receive the great Arabs here is the cook house here is the store house here is the prison for the refractory here are your white man s apartments and these are your own see here is the bedroom here is the gun room bath room c so Sheikh Sayd talked as he showed me the several places On my honour it was a most comfortable place this in Central Africa One could almost wax poetic but we will keep such ambitious ideas for a future day Just now however we must have the goods stored and the little army of carriers paid off and disbanded Bombay was ordered to unlock the strong store room to pile the bales in regular tiers the beads in rows one above another and the wire in a separate place The boats canvas c were to be placed high above reach of white ants and the boxes of ammunition and powder kegs were to be stored in the gun room out of reach of danger Then a bale of cloth was opened and each carrier was rewarded according to his merits that each of them might proceed home to his friends and neighbours and tell them how much better the white man behaved than the Arabs The reports of the leaders of the first second and fourth caravans were then received their separate stores inspected and the details and events of their marches heard The first caravan had been engaged in a war at Kirurumo and had come out of the fight successful and had reached Unyanyembe without loss of anything The second had shot a thief in the forest between Pembera Pereh and Kididimo the fourth had lost a bale in the jungle of Marenga Mkali and the porter who carried it had received a very sore head from a knob stick wielded by one of the thieves who prowl about the jungle near the frontier of Ugogo I was delighted to find that their misfortunes were no more and each leader was then and there rewarded with one handsome cloth and five doti of Merikani Just as I began to feel hungry again came several slaves in succession bearing trays full of good things from the Arabs first an enormous dish of rice with a bowlful of curried chicken another with a dozen huge wheaten cakes another with a plateful of smoking hot crullers another with papaws another with pomegranates and lemons after these came men driving five fat hump backed oxen eight sheep and ten goats and another man with a dozen chickens and a dozen fresh eggs This was real practical noble courtesy munificent hospitality which quite took my gratitude by storm My people now reduced to twenty five were as delighted at the prodigal plenitude visible on my tables and in my yard as I was myself And as I saw their eyes light up at the unctuous anticipations presented to them by their riotous fancies I ordered a bullock to be slaughtered and distributed The second day of the arrival of the Expedition in the country which I now looked upon as classic ground since Capts Burton Speke and Grant years ago had visited it and described it came the Arab magnates from Tabora to congratulate me Tabora is the principal Arab settlement in Central Africa It contains over a thousand huts and tembes and one may safely estimate the population Arabs Wangwana and natives at five thousand people Between Tabora and the next settlement Kwihara rise two rugged hill ridges separated from each other by a low saddle over the top of which Tabora is always visible from Kwihara There is no such recognised place as Kazeh They were a fine handsome body of men these Arabs They mostly hailed from Oman others were Wasawahili and each of my visitors had quite a retinue with him At Tabora they live quite luxuriously The plain on which the settlement is situated is exceedingly fertile though naked of trees the rich pasturage it furnishes permits them to keep large herds of cattle and goats from which they have an ample supply of milk cream butter and ghee Rice is grown everywhere sweet potatoes yams muhogo holcus sorghum maize or Indian corn sesame millet field peas or vetches called choroko are cheap and always procurable Around their tembes the Arabs cultivate a little wheat for their own purposes and have planted orange lemon papaw and mangoes which thrive here fairly well Onions and garlic chilies cucumbers tomatoes and brinjalls may be procured by the white visitor from the more important Arabs who are undoubted epicureans in their way Their slaves convey to them from the coast once a year at least their stores of tea coffee sugar spices jellies curries wine brandy biscuits sardines salmon and such fine cloths and articles as they require for their own personal use Almost every Arab of any eminence is able to show a wealth of Persian carpets and most luxurious bedding complete tea and coffee services and magnificently carved dishes of tinned copper and brass lavers Several of them sport gold watches and chains mostly all a watch and chain of some kind And as in Persia Afghanistan and Turkey the harems form an essential feature of every Arab s household the sensualism of the Mohammedans is as prominent here as in the Orient The Arabs who now stood before the front door of my tembe were the donors of the good things received the day before As in duty bound of course I greeted Sheikh Sayd first then Sheikh bin Nasib his Highness of Zanzibar s consul at Karagwa then I greeted the noblest Trojan amongst the Arab population noblest in bearing noblest in courage and manly worth Sheikh Khamis bin Abdullah then young Amram bin Mussoud who is now making war on the king of Urori and his fractious people then handsome courageous Soud the son of Sayd bin Majid then dandified Thani bin Abdullah then Mussoud bin Abdullah and his cousin Abdullah bin Mussoud who own the houses where formerly lived Burton and Speke then old Suliman Dowa Sayd bin Sayf and the old Hetman of Tabora Sheikh Sultan bin Ali As the visit of these magnates under whose loving protection white travellers must needs submit themselves was only a formal one such as Arab etiquette ever of the stateliest and truest impelled them to it is unnecessary to relate the discourse on my health and their wealth my thanks and their professions of loyalty and attachment to me After having expended our mutual stock of congratulations and nonsense they departed having stated their wish that I should visit them at Tabora and partake of a feast which they were about to prepare for me Three days afterwards I sallied out of my tembe escorted by eighteen bravely dressed men of my escort to pay Tabora a visit On surmounting the saddle over which the road from the valley of Kwihara leads to Tabora the plain on which the Arab settlement is situated lay before us one expanse of dun pasture land stretching from the base of the hill on our left as far as the banks of the northern Gombe which a few miles beyond Tabora heave into purple coloured hills and blue cones Within three quarters of an hour we were seated on the mud veranda of the tembe of Sultan bin Ali who because of his age his wealth and position being a colonel in Seyd Burghash s unlovely army is looked upon by his countrymen high and low as referee and counsellor His boma or enclosure contains quite a village of hive shaped huts and square tembes From here after being presented with a cup of Mocha coffee and some sherbet we directed our steps towards Khamis bin Abdullah s house who had in anticipation of my coming prepared a feast to which he had invited his friends and neighbours The group of stately Arabs in their long white dresses and jaunty caps also of a snowy white who stood ready to welcome me to Tabora produced quite an effect on my mind I was in time for a council of war they were holding and I was requested to attend Khamis bin Abdullah a bold and brave man ever ready to stand up for the privileges of the Arabs and their rights to pass through any countries for legitimate trade is the man who in Speke s Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile is reported to have shot Maula an old chief who sided with Manwa Sera during the wars of eighteen sixty and who subsequently after chasing his relentless enemy for five years through Ugogo and Unyamwezi as far as Ukonongo had the satisfaction of beheading him was now urging the Arabs to assert their rights against a chief called Mirambo of Uyoweh in a crisis which was advancing This Mirambo of Uyoweh it seems had for the last few years been in a state of chronic discontent with the policies of the neighbouring chiefs Formerly a pagazi for an Arab he had now assumed regal power with the usual knack of unconscionable rascals who care not by what means they step into power When the chief of Uyoweh died Mirambo who was head of a gang of robbers infesting the forests of Wilyankuru suddenly entered Uyoweh and constituted himself lord paramount by force Some feats of enterprise which he performed to the enrichment of all those who recognised his authority established him firmly in his position This was but a beginning he carried war through Ugara to Ukonongo through Usagozi to the borders of Uvinza and after destroying the populations over three degrees of latitude he conceived a grievance against Mkasiwa and against the Arabs because they would not sustain him in his ambitious projects against their ally and friend with whom they were living in peace The first outrage which this audacious man committed against the Arabs was the halting of an Ujiji bound caravan and the demand for five kegs of gunpowder five guns and five bales of cloth This extraordinary demand after expending more than a day in fierce controversy was paid but the Arabs if they were surprised at the exorbitant black mail demanded of them were more than ever surprised when they were told to return the way they came and that no Arab caravan should pass through his country to Ujiji except over his dead body On the return of the unfortunate Arabs to Unyanyembe they reported the facts to Sheikh Sayd bin Salim the governor of the Arab colony This old man being averse to war of course tried every means to induce Mirambo as of old to be satisfied with presents but Mirambo this time was obdurate and sternly determined on war unless the Arabs aided him in the warfare he was about to wage against old Mkasiwa sultan of the Wanyamwezi of Unyanyembe This is the status of affairs said Khamis bin Abdullah Mirambo says that for years he has been engaged in war against the neighbouring Washensi and has come out of it victorious he says this is a great year with him that he is going to fight the Arabs and the Wanyamwezi of Unyanyembe and that he shall not stop until every Arab is driven from Unyanyembe and he rules over this country in place of Mkasiwa Children of Oman shall it be so Speak Salim son of Sayf shall we go to meet this Mshensi pagan or shall we return to our island A murmur of approbation followed the speech of Khamis bin Abdullah the majority of those present being young men eager to punish the audacious Mirambo Salim the son of Sayf an old patriarch slow of speech tried to appease the passions of the young men scions of the aristocracy of Muscat and Muttrah and Bedaweens of the Desert but Khamis s bold words had made too deep an impression on their minds Soud the handsome Arab whom I have noticed already as the son of Sayd the son of Majid spoke My father used to tell me that he remembered the days when the Arabs could go through the country from Bagamoyo to Ujiji and from Kilwa to Lunda and from Usenga to Uganda armed with canes Those days are gone by We have stood the insolence of the Wagogo long enough Swaruru of Usui just takes from us whatever he wants and now here is Mirambo who says after taking more than five bales of cloth as tribute from one man that no Arab caravan shall go to Ujiji but over his body Are we prepared to give up the ivory of Ujiji of Urundi of Karagwah of Uganda because of this one man I say war war until we have got his beard under our feet war until the whole of Uyoweh and Wilyankuru is destroyed war until we can again travel through any part of the country with only our walking canes in our hands The universal assent that followed Send s speech proved beyond a doubt that we were about to have a war I thought of Livingstone What if he were marching to Unyanyembe directly into the war country Having found from the Arabs that they intended to finish the war quickly at most within fifteen days as Uyoweh was only four marches distant I volunteered to accompany them take my loaded caravan with me as far as Mfuto and there leave it in charge of a few guards and with the rest march on with the Arab army And my hope was that it might be possible after the defeat of Mirambo and his forest banditti the Ruga Ruga to take my Expedition direct to Ujiji by the road now closed The Arabs were sanguine of victory and I partook of their enthusiasm The council of war broke up A great dishful of rice and curry in which almonds citron raisins and currants were plentifully mixed was brought in and it was wonderful how soon we forgot our warlike fervor after our attention had been drawn to this royal dish I of course not being a Mohammedan had a dish of my own of a similar composition strengthened by platters containing roast chicken and kabobs crullers cakes sweetbread fruit glasses of sherbet and lemonade dishes of gum drops and Muscat sweetmeats dry raisins prunes and nuts Certainly Khamis bin Abdullah proved to me that if he had a warlike soul in him he could also attend to the cultivated tastes acquired under the shade of the mangoes on his father s estates in Zanzibar the island After gorging ourselves on these uncommon dainties some of the chief Arabs escorted me to other tembes of Tabora When we went to visit Mussoud bin Abdullah he showed me the very ground where Burton and Speke s house stood now pulled down and replaced by his office Sny bin Amer s house was also torn down and the fashionable tembe of Unyanyembe now in vogue built over it finely carved rafters huge carved doors brass knockers and lofty airy rooms a house built for defence and comfort The finest house in Unyanyembe belongs to Amram bin Mussoud who paid sixty frasilah of ivory over three thousand dollars for it Very fair houses can be purchased for from twenty to thirty frasilah of ivory Amram s house is called the Two Seas Baherein It is one hundred feet in length and twenty feet high with walls four feet thick neatly plastered over with mud mortar The great door is a marvel of carving work for Unyanyembe artisans Each rafter within is also carved with fine designs Before the front of the house is a young plantation of pomegranate trees which flourish here as if they were indigenous to the soil A shadoof such as may be seen on the Nile serves to draw water to irrigate the gardens Towards evening we walked back to our own finely situated tembe in Kwihara well satisfied with what we had seen at Tabora My men drove a couple of oxen and carried three sacks of native rice a most superior kind the day s presents of hospitality from Khamis bin Abdullah In Unyanyembe I found the Livingstone caravan which started off in a fright from Bagamoyo upon the rumour that the English Consul was coming As all the caravans were now halted at Unyanyembe because of the now approaching war I suggested to Sayd bin Salim that it were better that the men of the Livingstone caravan should live with mine in my tembe that I might watch over the white man s goods Sayd bin Salim agreed with me and the men and goods were at once brought to my tembe One day Asmani who was now chief of Livingstone s caravan the other having died of small pox two or three days before brought out a tent to the veranda where I was sitting writing and shewed me a packet of letters which to my surprise was marked To doctor Livingstone Ujiji November first eighteen seventy Registered letters From November first eighteen seventy to February ten eighteen seventy one just one hundred days at Bagamoyo A miserable small caravan of thirty three men halting one hundred days at Bagamoyo only twenty five miles by water from Zanzibar Poor Livingstone Who knows but he maybe suffering for want of these very supplies that were detained so long near the sea The caravan arrived in Unyanyembe some time about the middle of May About the latter part of May the first disturbances took place Had this caravan arrived here in the middle of March or even the middle of April they might have travelled on to Ujiji without trouble On the seventh of July about two P M I was sitting on the burzani as usual I felt listless and languid and a drowsiness came over me I did not fall asleep but the power of my limbs seemed to fail me Yet the brain was busy all my life seemed passing in review before me when these retrospective scenes became serious I looked serious when they were sorrowful I wept hysterically when they were joyous I laughed loudly Reminiscences of yet a young life s battles and hard struggles came surging into the mind in quick succession events of boyhood of youth and manhood perils travels scenes joys and sorrows loves and hates friendships and indifferences My mind followed the various and rapid transition of my life s passages it drew the lengthy erratic sinuous lines of travel my footsteps had passed over If I had drawn them on the sandy floor what enigmatical problems they had been to those around me and what plain readable intelligent histories they had been to me The loveliest feature of all to me was the form of a noble and true man who called me son Of my life in the great pine forests of Arkansas and in Missouri I retained the most vivid impressions The dreaming days I passed under the sighing pines on the Ouachita s shores the new clearing the block house our faithful black servant the forest deer and the exuberant life I led were all well remembered And I remembered how one day after we had come to live near the Mississipi I floated down down hundreds of miles with a wild fraternity of knurly giants the boatmen of the Mississipi and how a dear old man welcomed me back as if from the grave I remembered also my travels on foot through sunny Spain and France with numberless adventures in Asia Minor among Kurdish nomads I remembered the battle fields of America and the stormy scenes of rampant war I remembered gold mines and broad prairies Indian councils and much experience in the new western lands I remembered the shock it gave me to hear after my return from a barbarous country of the calamity that had overtaken the fond man whom I called father and the hot fitful life that followed it Stop Dear me is it the twenty first of July Yes Shaw informed me that it was the twenty first of July after I recovered from my terrible attack of fever the true date was the fourteenth of July but I was not aware that I had jumped a week until I met doctor Livingstone We two together examined the Nautical Almanack which I brought with me We found that the Doctor was three weeks out of his reckoning and to my great surprise I was also one week out or one week ahead of the actual date The mistake was made by my being informed that I had been two weeks sick and as the day I recovered my senses was Friday and Shaw and the people were morally sure that I was in bed two weeks I dated it on my Diary the twenty first of July However on the tenth day after the first of my illness I was in excellent trim again only however to see and attend to Shaw who was in turn taken sick By the twenty second July Shaw was recovered then Selim was prostrated and groaned in his delirium for four days but by the twenty eighth we were all recovered and were beginning to brighten up at the prospect of a diversion in the shape of a march upon Mirambo s stronghold The morning of the twenty ninth I had fifty men loaded with bales beads and wire for Ujiji When they were mustered for the march outside the tembe the only man absent was Bombay While men were sent to search for him others departed to get one more look and one more embrace with their black Delilahs Bombay was found some time about two P M his face faithfully depicting the contending passions under which he was labouring sorrow at parting from the fleshpots of Unyanyembe regret at parting from his Dulcinea of Tabora to be bereft of all enjoyment now nothing but marches hard long marches to go to the war to be killed perhaps Oh Inspired by such feelings no wonder Bombay was inclined to be pugnacious when I ordered him to his place and I was in a shocking bad temper for having been kept waiting from eight A M to two P M for him There was simply a word and a savage look and my cane was flying around Bombay s shoulders as if he were to be annihilated I fancy that the eager fury of my onslaught broke his stubbornness more than anything else for before I had struck him a dozen times he was crying for pardon At that word I ceased belaboring him for this was the first time he had ever uttered that word Bombay was conquered at last March and the guide led off followed in solemn order by forty nine of his fellows every man carrying a heavy load of African moneys besides his gun hatchet and stock of ammunition and his ugali pot We presented quite an imposing sight while thus marching on in silence and order with our flags flying and the red blanket robes of the men streaming behind them as the furious north easter blew right on our flank The men seemed to feel they were worth seeing for I noticed that several assumed a more martial tread as they felt their royal Joho cloth tugging at their necks as it was swept streaming behind by the wind Maganga a tall Mnyamwezi stalked along like a very Goliah about to give battle alone to Mirambo and his thousand warriors Frisky Khamisi paced on under his load imitating a lion and there was the rude jester the incorrigible Ulimengo with a stealthy pace like a cat But their silence could not last long Their vanity was so much gratified the red cloaks danced so incessantly before their eyes that it would have been a wonder if they could have maintained such serious gravity or discontent one half hour longer Ulimengo was the first who broke it He had constituted himself the kirangozi or guide and was the standard bearer bearing the American flag which the men thought would certainly strike terror into the hearts of the enemy Growing confident first then valorous then exultant he suddenly faced the army he was leading and shouted Hoy Hoy Chorus Hoy Hoy Hoy Hoy Chorus Hoy Hoy Hoy Hoy Chorus Hoy Hoy Where are ye going Chorus Going to war Against whom Chorus Against Mirambo Who is your master Chorus The White Man Ough Ough Chorus Ough Ough Hyah Hyah Chorus Hyah Hyah This was the ridiculous song they kept up all day without intermission We camped the first day at Bomboma s village situated a mile to the south west of the natural hill fortress of Zimbili Bombay was quite recovered from his thrashing and had banished the sullen thoughts that had aroused my ire and the men having behaved themselves so well a five gallon pot of pombe was brought to further nourish the valour which they one and all thought they possessed The second day we arrived at Masangi I was visited soon afterwards by Soud the son of Sayd bin Majid who told me the Arabs were waiting for me that they would not march from Mfuto until I had arrived Eastern Mfuto after a six hours march was reached on the third day from Unyanyembe Shaw gave in laid down in the road and declared he was dying This news was brought to me about four P M by one of the last stragglers I was bound to despatch men to carry him to me into my camp though every man was well tired after the long march A reward stimulated half a dozen to venture into the forest just at dusk to find Shaw who was supposed to be at least three hours away from camp About two o clock in the morning my men returned having carried Shaw on their backs the entire distance I was roused up and had him conveyed to my tent I examined him and I assured myself he was not suffering from fever of any kind and in reply to my inquiries as to how he felt he said he could neither walk nor ride that he felt such extreme weakness and lassitude that he was incapable of moving further After administering a glass of port wine to him in a bowlful of sago gruel we both fell asleep We arrived early the following morning at Mfuto the rendezvous of the Arab army A halt was ordered the next day in order to make ourselves strong by eating the beeves which we freely slaughtered The personnel of our army was as follows Sheikh Sayd bin Salim twenty five half caste Khamis bin Abdullah two hundred fifty slaves Thani bin Abdullah eighty Mussoud bin Abdullah seventy five Abdullah bin Mussoud eighty Ali bin Sayd bin Nasib two hundred fifty Nasir bin Mussoud fifty Hamed Kimiami seventy Hamdam thirty Sayd bin Habib fifty Salim bin Sayf one hundred Sunguru twenty five Sarboko twenty five Soud bin Sayd bin Majid fifty Mohammed bin Mussoud thirty Sayd bin Hamed ninety The Herald Expedition fifty soldiers Mkasiwa s Wanyamwezi eight hundred Half castes and Wangwana one hundred twenty five Independent chiefs and their followers three hundred These made a total of twenty two fifty five according to numbers given me by Thani bin Abdullah and corroborated by a Baluch in the pay of Sheikh bin Nasib Of these men fifteen hundred were armed with guns flint lock muskets German and French double barrels some English Enfields and American Springfields besides these muskets they were mostly armed with spears and long knives for the purpose of decapitating and inflicting vengeful gashes in the dead bodies Powder and ball were plentiful some men were served a hundred rounds each my people received each man sixty rounds As we filed out of the stronghold of Mfuto with waving banners denoting the various commanders with booming horns and the roar of fifty bass drums called gomas with blessings showered on us by the mollahs and happiest predications from the soothsayers astrologers and the diviners of the Koran who could have foretold that this grand force before a week passed over its head would be hurrying into that same stronghold of Mfuto with each man s heart in his mouth from fear The date of our leaving Mfuto for battle with Mirambo was the third of August All my goods were stored in Mfuto ready for the march to Ujiji should we be victorious over the African chief but at least for safety whatever befel us Long before we reached Umanda I was in my hammock in the paroxysms of a fierce attack of intermittent fever which did not leave me until late that night At Umanda six hours from Mfuto our warriors bedaubed themselves with the medicine which the wise men had manufactured for them a compound of matama flour mixed with the juices of a herb whose virtues were only known to the Waganga of the Wanyamwezi At six A M on the fourth of August we were once more prepared for the road but before we were marched out of the village the manneno or speech was delivered by the orator of the Wanyamwezi Words words words Listen sons of Mkasiwa children of Unyamwezi the journey is before you the thieves of the forest are waiting yes they are thieves they cut up your caravans they steal your ivory they murder your women Behold the Arabs are with you El Wali of the Arab sultan and the white man are with you Go the son of Mkasiwa is with you fight kill take slaves take cloth take cattle kill eat and fill yourselves Go A loud wild shout followed this bold harangue the gates of the village were thrown open and blue red and white robed soldiers were bounding upward like so many gymnasts firing their guns incessantly in order to encourage themselves with noise or to strike terror into the hearts of those who awaited us within the strong enclosure of Zimbizo Sultan Kolongo s place As Zimbizo was distant only five hours from Umanda at eleven A M we came in view of it We halted on the verge of the cultivated area around it and its neighbours within the shadow of the forest Strict orders had been given by the several chiefs to their respective commands not to fire until they were within shooting distance of the boma Khamis bin Abdullah crept through the forest to the west of the village The Wanyamwezi took their position before the main gateway aided by the forces of Soud the son of Sayd on the right and the son of Habib on the left Abdullah Mussoud myself and others made ready to attack the eastern gates which arrangement effectually shut them in with the exception of the northern side Suddenly a volley opened on us as we emerged from the forest along the Unyanyembe road in the direction they had been anticipating the sight of an enemy and immediately the attacking forces began their firing in most splendid style There were some ludicrous scenes of men pretending to fire then jumping off to one side then forward then backward with the agility of hopping frogs but the battle was none the less in earnest The breech loaders of my men swallowed my metallic cartridges much faster than I liked to see but happily there was a lull in the firing and we were rushing into the village from the west the south the north through the gates and over the tall palings that surrounded the village like so many Merry Andrews and the poor villagers were flying from the enclosure towards the mountains through the northern gate pursued by the fleetest runners of our force and pelted in the back by bullets from breech loaders and shot guns The village was strongly defended and not more than twenty dead bodies were found in it the strong thick wooden paling having afforded excellent protection against our bullets From Zimbizo after having left a sufficient force within we sallied out and in an hour had cleared the neighbourhood of the enemy having captured two other villages which we committed to the flames after gutting them of all valuables A few tusks of ivory and about fifty slaves besides an abundance of grain composed the loot which fell to the lot of the Arabs On the fifth a detachment of Arabs and slaves seven hundred strong scoured the surrounding country and carried fire and devastation up to the boma of Wilyankuru On the sixth Soud bin Sayd and about twenty other young Arabs led a force of five hundred men against Wilyankuru itself where it was supposed Mirambo was living Another party went out towards the low wooded hills a short distance north of Zimbizo near which place they surprised a youthful forest thief asleep whose head they stretched backwards and cut it off as though he were a goat or a sheep Another party sallied out southward and defeated a party of Mirambo s bush whackers news of which came to our ears at noon In the morning I had gone to Sayd bin Salim s tembe to represent to him how necessary it was to burn the long grass in the forest of Zimbizo lest it might hide any of the enemy but soon afterwards I had been struck down with another attack of intermittent fever and was obliged to turn in and cover myself with blankets to produce perspiration but not however till I had ordered Shaw and Bombay not to permit any of my men to leave the camp But I was told soon afterwards by Selim that more than one half had gone to the attack on Wilyankuru with Soud bin Sayd About six P M the entire camp of Zimbizo was electrified with the news that all the Arabs who had accompanied Soud bin Sayd had been killed and that more than one half of his party had been slain Some of my own men returned and from them I learned that Uledi Grant s former valet Mabruki Khatalabu Killer of his father Mabruki the Little Baruti of Useguhha and Ferahan had been killed I learned also that they had succeeded in capturing Wilyankuru in a very short time that Mirambo and his son were there that as they succeeded in effecting an entrance Mirambo had collected his men and after leaving the village had formed an ambush in the grass on each side of the road between Wilyankuru and Zimbizo and that as the attacking party were returning home laden with over a hundred tusks of ivory and sixty bales of cloth and two or three hundred slaves Mirambo s men suddenly rose up on each side of them and stabbed them with their spears The brave Soud had fired his double barrelled gun and shot two men and was in the act of loading again when a spear was launched which penetrated through and through him all the other Arabs shared the same fate This sudden attack from an enemy they believed to be conquered so demoralized the party that dropping their spoil each man took to his heels and after making a wide detour through the woods returned to Zimbizo to repeat the dolorous tale The effect of this defeat is indescribable It was impossible to sleep from the shrieks of the women whose husbands had fallen All night they howled their lamentations and sometimes might be heard the groans of the wounded who had contrived to crawl through the grass unperceived by the enemy Fugitives were continually coming in throughout the night but none of my men who were reported to be dead were ever heard of again The seventh was a day of distrust sorrow and retreat the Arabs accused one another for urging war without expending all peaceful means first There were stormy councils of war held wherein were some who proposed to return at once to Unyanyembe and keep within their own houses and Khamis bin Abdullah raved like an insulted monarch against the abject cowardice of his compatriots These stormy meetings and propositions to retreat were soon known throughout the camp and assisted more than anything else to demoralize completely the combined forces of Wanyamwezi and slaves I sent Bombay to Sayd bin Salim to advise him not to think of retreat as it would only be inviting Mirambo to carry the war to Unyanyembe After despatching Bombay with this message I fell asleep but about one point thirty P M I was awakened by Selim saying Master get up they are all running away and Khamis bin Abdullah is himself going With the aid of Selim I dressed myself and staggered towards the door My first view was of Thani bin Abdullah being dragged away who when he caught sight of me shouted out Bana quick Mirambo is coming He was then turning to run and putting on his jacket with his eyes almost starting out of their sockets with terror Khamis bin Abdullah was also about departing he being the last Arab to leave Two of my men were following him these Selim was ordered to force back with a revolver Shaw was saddling his donkey with my own saddle preparatory to giving me the slip and leaving me in the lurch to the tender mercies of Mirambo There were only Bombay Mabruki Speke Chanda who was coolly eating his dinner Mabruk Unyauyembe Mtamani Juma and Sarmean only seven out of fifty All the others had deserted and were by this time far away except Uledi Manwa Sera and Zaidi whom Selim brought back at the point of a loaded revolver Selim was then told to saddle my donkey and Bombay to assist Shaw to saddle his own In a few moments we were on the road the men ever looking back for the coming enemy they belabored the donkeys to some purpose for they went at a hard trot which caused me intense pain I would gladly have lain down to die but life was sweet and I had not yet given up all hope of being able to preserve it to the full and final accomplishment of my mission My mind was actively at work planning and contriving during the long lonely hours of night which we employed to reach Mfuto whither I found the Arabs had retreated In the night Shaw tumbled off his donkey and would not rise though implored to do so As I did not despair myself so I did not intend that Shaw should despair He was lifted on his animal and a man was placed on each side of him to assist him thus we rode through the darkness At midnight we reached Mfuto safely and were at once admitted into the village from which we had issued so valiantly but to which we were now returned so ignominiously I found all my men had arrived here before dark Ulimengo the bold guide who had exulted in his weapons and in our numbers and was so sanguine of victory had performed the eleven hours march in six hours sturdy Chowpereh whom I regarded as the faithfullest of my people had arrived only half an hour later than Ulimengo and frisky Khamisi the dandy the orator the rampant demagogue yes he had come third and Speke s Faithfuls had proved as cowardly as any poor nigger of them all Only Selim was faithful I asked Selim Why did you not also run away and leave your master to die Oh sir said the Arab boy naively I was afraid you would whip me CHAPTER IX MY LIFE AND TROUBLES IN UNYANYEMBE continued It never occurred to the Arab magnates that I had cause of complaint against them or that I had a right to feel aggrieved at their conduct for the base desertion of an ally who had as a duty to friendship taken up arms for their sake Their salaams the next morning after the retreat were given as if nothing had transpired to mar the good feeling that had existed between us They were hardly seated however before I began to inform them that as the war was only between them and Mirambo and that as I was afraid if they were accustomed to run away after every little check that the war might last a much longer time than I could afford to lose and that as they had deserted their wounded on the field and left their sick friends to take care of themselves they must not consider me in the light of an ally any more I am satisfied said I having seen your mode of fighting that the war will not be ended in so short a time as you think it will It took you five years I hear to conquer and kill Manwa Sera you will certainly not conquer Mirambo in less than a year I am a white man accustomed to wars after a different style I know something about fighting but I never saw people run away from an encampment like ours at Zimbizo for such slight cause as you had By running away you have invited Mirambo to follow you to Unyanyembe you may be sure he will come The same war is still raging April eighteen seventy four The Arabs protested one after another that they had not intended to have left me but the Wanyamwezi of Mkasiwa had shouted out that the Musungu was gone and the cry had caused a panic among their people which it was impossible to allay Later that day the Arabs continued their retreat to Tabora which is twenty two miles distant from Mfuto I determined to proceed more leisurely and on the second day after the flight from Zimbizo the Expedition with all the stores and baggage marched back to Masangi and on the third day to Kwihara The following extracts from my Diary will serve to show better than anything else my feelings and thoughts about this time after our disgraceful retreat Kwihara Friday eleventh August eighteen seventy one Arrived to day from Zimbili village of Bomboma s I am quite disappointed and almost disheartened But I have one consolation I have done my duty by the Arabs a duty I thought I owed to the kindness they received me with now however the duty is discharged and I am free to pursue my own course I feel happy for some reasons that the duty has been paid at such a slight sacrifice Of course if I had lost my life in this enterprise I should have been justly punished But apart from my duty to the consideration with which the Arabs had received me was the necessity of trying every method of reaching Livingstone This road which the war with Mirambo has closed is only a month s march from this place and if the road could be opened with my aid sooner than without it why should I refuse my aid The attempt has been made for the second time to Ujiji both have failed I am going to try another route to attempt to go by the north would be folly Mirambo s mother and people and the Wasui are between me and Ujiji without including the Watuta who are his allies and robbers The southern route seems to be the most practicable one Very few people know anything of the country south those whom I have questioned concerning it speak of want of water and robber Wazavira as serious obstacles they also say that the settlements are few and far between But before I can venture to try this new route I have to employ a new set of men as those whom I took to Mfuto consider their engagements at an end and the fact of five of their number being killed rather damps their ardor for travelling It is useless to hope that Wanyamwezi can be engaged because it is against their custom to go with caravans as carriers during war time My position is most serious I have a good excuse for returning to the coast but my conscience will not permit me to do so after so much money has been expended and so much confidence has been placed in me In fact I feel I must die sooner than return Saturday August twelfth My men as I supposed they would have gone they said that I engaged them to go to Ujiji by Mirambo s road I have only thirteen left With this small body of men whither can I go I have over one hundred loads in the storeroom Livingstone s caravan is also here his goods consist of seventeen bales of cloth twelve boxes and six bags of beads His men are luxuriating upon the best the country affords If Livingstone is at Ujiji he is now locked up with small means of escape I may consider myself also locked up at Unyamyembe and I suppose cannot go to Ujiji until this war with Mirambo is settled Livingstone cannot get his goods for they are here with mine He cannot return to Zanzibar and the road to the Nile is blocked up He might if he has men and stores possibly reach Baker by travelling northwards through Urundi thence through Ruanda Karagwah Uganda Unyoro and Ubari to Gondokoro Pagazis he cannot obtain for the sources whence a supply might be obtained are closed It is an erroneous supposition to think that Livingstone any more than any other energetic man of his calibre can travel through Africa without some sort of an escort and a durable supply of marketable cloth and beads I was told to day by a man that when Livingstone was coming from Nyassa Lake towards the Tanganika the very time that people thought him murdered he was met by Sayd bin Omar s caravan which was bound for Ulamba He was travelling with Mohammed bin Gharib This Arab who was coming from Urunga met Livingstone at Chi cumbi s or Kwa chi kumbi s country and travelled with him afterwards I hear to Manyuema or Manyema Manyuema is forty marches from the north of Nyassa Livingstone was walking he was dressed in American sheeting He had lost all his cloth in Lake Liemba while crossing it in a boat He had three canoes with him in one he put his cloth another he loaded with his boxes and some of his men into the third he went himself with two servants and two fishermen The boat with his cloth was upset On leaving Nyassa Livingstone went to Ubisa thence to Uemba thence to Urungu Livingstone wore a cap He had a breech loading double barreled rifle with him which fired fulminating balls He was also armed with two revolvers The Wahiyow with Livingstone told this man that their master had many men with him at first but that several had deserted him August thirteenth A caravan came in to day from the seacoast They reported that William L Farquhar whom I left sick at Mpwapwa Usagara and his cook were dead Farquhar I was told died a few days after I had entered Ugogo his cook died a few weeks later My first impulse was for revenge I believed that Leukole had played me false and had poisoned him or that he had been murdered in some other manner but a personal interview with the Msawahili who brought the news informing me that Farquhar had succumbed to his dreadful illness has done away with that suspicion So far as I could understand him Farquhar had in the morning declared himself well enough to proceed but in attempting to rise had fallen backward and died I was also told that the Wasagara possessing some superstitious notions respecting the dead had ordered Jako to take the body out for burial that Jako not being able to carry it had dragged the body to the jungle and there left it naked without the slightest covering of earth or anything else There is one of us gone Shaw my boy Who will be the next I remarked that night to my companion August fourteenth Wrote some letters to Zanzibar Shaw was taken very ill last night August nineteenth Saturday My soldiers are employed stringing beads Shaw is still a bed We hear that Mirambo is coming to Unyanyembe A detachment of Arabs and their slaves have started this morning to possess themselves of the powder left there by the redoubtable Sheikh Sayd bin Salim the commander in chief of the Arab settlements August twenty first Monday Shaw still sick One hundred fundo of beads have been strung The Arabs are preparing for another sally against Mirambo The advance of Mirambo upon Unyanyembe was denied by Sayd bin Salim this morning August twenty second We were stringing beads this morning when about ten A M we heard a continued firing from the direction of Tabora Rushing out from our work to the front door facing Tabora we heard considerable volleying and scattered firing plainly and ascending to the top of my tembe I saw with my glasses the smoke of the guns Some of my men who were sent on to ascertain the cause came running back with the information that Mirambo had attacked Tabora with over two thousand men and that a force of over one thousand Watuta who had allied themselves with him for the sake of plunder had come suddenly upon Tabora attacking from opposite directions Later in the day or about noon watching the low saddle over which we could see Tabora we saw it crowded with fugitives from that settlement who were rushing to our settlement at Kwihara for protection From these people we heard the sad information that the noble Khamis bin Abdullah his little protege Khamis Mohammed bin Abdullah Ibrahim bin Rashid and Sayf the son of Ali the son of Sheikh the son of Nasib had been slain When I inquired into the details of the attack and the manner of the death of these Arabs I was told that after the first firing which warned the inhabitants of Tabora that the enemy was upon them Khamis bin Abdullah and some of the principal Arabs who happened to be with him had ascended to the roof of his tembe and with his spyglass he had looked towards the direction of the firing To his great astonishment he saw the plain around Tabora filled with approaching savages and about two miles off near Kazima a tent pitched which he knew to belong to Mirambo from its having been presented to that chief by the Arabs of Tabora when they were on good terms with him Khamis bin Abdullah descended to his house saying Let us go to meet him Arm yourselves my friends and come with me His friends advised him strongly sat to go out of his tembe for so long as each Arab kept to his tembe they were more than a match for the Ruga Ruga and the Watuta together But Khamis broke out impatiently with Would you advise us to stop in our tembes for fear of this Mshensi pagan Who goes with me His little protege Khamis son of a dead friend asked to be allowed to be his gun bearer Mohammed bin Abdulluh Ibrahim bin Rashid and Sayf the son of Ali young Arabs of good families who were proud to live with the noble Khamis also offered to go with him After hastily arming eighty of his slaves contrary to the advice of his prudent friends he sallied out and was soon face to face with his cunning and determined enemy Mirambo This chief upon seeing the Arabs advance towards him gave orders to retreat slowly Khamis deceived by this rushed on with his friends after them Suddenly Mirambo ordered his men to advance upon them in a body and at the sight of the precipitate rush upon their party Khamis s slaves incontinently took to their heels never even deigning to cast a glance behind them leaving their master to the fate which was now overtaking him The savages surrounded the five Arabs and though several of them fell before the Arabs fire continued to shoot at the little party until Khamis bin Abdullah received a bullet in the leg which brought him to his knees and for the first time to the knowledge that his slaves had deserted him Though wounded the brave man continued shooting but he soon afterwards received a bullet through the heart Little Khamis upon seeing his adopted father s fall exclaimed My father Khamis is dead I will die with him and continued fighting until he received shortly after his death wound In a few minutes there was not one Arab left alive Late at night some more particulars arrived of this tragic scene I was told by people who saw the bodies that the body of Khamis bin Abdullah who was a fine noble brave portly man was found with the skin of his forehead the beard and skin of the lower part of his face the fore part of the nose the fat over the stomach and abdomen and lastly a bit from each heel cut off by the savage allies of Mirambo And in the same condition were found the bodies of his adopted son and fallen friends The flesh and skin thus taken from the bodies was taken of course by the waganga or medicine men to make what they deem to be the most powerful potion of all to enable men to be strong against their enemies This potion is mixed up with their ugali and rice and is taken in this manner with the most perfect confidence in its efficacy as an invulnerable protection against bullets and missiles of all descriptions It was a most sorry scene to witness from our excited settlement at Kwihara almost the whole of Tabora in flames and to see the hundreds of people crowding into Kwihara Perceiving that my people were willing to stand by me I made preparations for defence by boring loopholes for muskets into the stout clay walls of my tembe They were made so quickly and seemed so admirably adapted for the efficient defence of the tembe that my men got quite brave and Wangwana refugees with guns in their hands driven out of Tabora asked to be admitted into our tembe to assist in its defence Livingstone s men were also collected and invited to help defend their master s goods against Mirambo s supposed attack By night I had one hundred and fifty armed men in my courtyard stationed at every possible point where an attack might be expected To morrow Mirambo has threatened that he will come to Kwihara I hope he will come and if he comes within range of an American rifle I shall see what virtue lies in American lead August twenty third We have passed a very anxious day in the valley of Kwihara Our eyes were constantly directed towards unfortunate Tabora It has been said that three tembes only have stood the brunt of the attack Abid bin Suliman s house has been destroyed and over two hundred tusks of ivory that belonged to him have become the property of the African Bonaparte My tembe is in as efficient a state of defence as its style and means of defence will allow Rifle pits surround the house outside and all native huts that obstructed the view have been torn down and all trees and shrubs which might serve as a shelter for any one of the enemy have been cut Provisions and water enough for six days have been brought I have ammunition enough to last two weeks The walls are three feet thick and there are apartments within apartments so that a desperate body of men could fight until the last room had been taken The Arabs my neighbours endeavour to seem brave but it is evident they are about despairing I have heard it rumoured that the Arabs of Kwihara if Tabora is taken will start en masse for the coast and give the country up to Mirambo If such are their intentions and they are really carried into effect I shall be in a pretty mess However if they do leave me Mirambo will not reap any benefit from my stores nor from Livingstone s either for I shall burn the whole house and everything in it August twenty fourth The American flag is still waving above my house and the Arabs are still in Unyanyembe About ten A M a messenger came from Tabora asking us if we were not going to assist them against Mirambo I felt very much like going out to help them but after debating long upon the pros and cons of it asking myself Was it prudent Ought I to go What will become of the people if I were killed Will they not desert me again What was the fate of Khamis bin Abdullah I sent word that I would not go that they ought to feel perfectly at home in their tembes against such a force as Mirambo had that I should be glad if they could induce him to come to Kwihara in which case I would try and pick him off They say that Mirambo and his principal officer carry umbrellas over their heads that he himself has long hair like a Mnyamwezi pagazi and a beard If he comes all the men carrying umbrellas will have bullets rained on them in the hope that one lucky bullet may hit him According to popular ideas I should make a silver bullet but I have no silver with me I might make a gold one About noon I went over to see Sheikh bin Nasib leaving about one hundred men inside the house to guard it while I was absent This old fellow is quite a philosopher in his way I should call him a professor of minor philosophy He is generally so sententious fond of aphorisms and a very deliberate character I was astonished to find him so despairing His aphorisms have deserted him his philosophy has not been able to stand against disaster He listened to me more like a moribund than one possessing all the means of defence and offence I loaded his two pounder with ball and grape and small slugs of iron and advised him not to fire it until Mirambo s people were at his gates About four p m I heard that Mirambo had deported himself to Kazima a place north west of Tabora a couple of miles August twenty sixth The Arabs sallied out this morning to attack Kazima but refrained because Mirambo asked for a day s grace to eat the beef he had stolen from them He has asked them impudently to come to morrow morning at which time he says he will give them plenty of fighting Kwihara is once more restored to a peaceful aspect and fugitives no longer throng its narrow limits in fear and despair August twenty seventh Mirambo retreated during the night and when the Arabs went in force to attack his village of Kazima they found it vacant The Arabs hold councils of war now a days battle meetings of which they seem to be very fond but extremely slow to act upon They were about to make friends with the northern Watuta but Mirambo was ahead of them They had talked of invading Mirambo s territory the second time but Mirambo invaded Unyanyembe with fire and sword bringing death to many a household and he has slain the noblest of them all The Arabs spend their hours in talking and arguing while the Ujiji and Karagwah roads are more firmly closed than ever Indeed many of the influential Arabs are talking of returning to Zanzibar saying Unyanyembe is ruined Meanwhile with poor success however perceiving the impossibility of procuring Wanyamwezi pagazis I am hiring the Wangwana renegades living in Unyanyembe to proceed with me to Ujiji at treble prices Each man is offered thirty doti ordinary hire of a carrier being only from five to ten doti to Ujiji I want fifty men I intend to leave about sixty or seventy loads here under charge of a guard I shall leave all personal baggage behind except one small portmanteau August twenty eighth No news to day of Mirambo Shaw is getting strong again Sheikh bin Nasib called on me to day but except on minor philosophy he had nothing to say I have determined after a study of the country to lead a flying caravan to Ujiji by a southern road through northern Ukonongo and Ukawendi Sheikh bin Nasib has been informed to night of this determination August twenty ninth Shaw got up to day for a little work Alas all my fine spun plans of proceeding by boat over the Victoria N Yanza thence down the Nile have been totally demolished I fear through this war with Mirambo this black Bonaparte Two months have been wasted here already The Arabs take such a long time to come to a conclusion Advice is plentiful and words are as numerous as the blades of grass in our valley all that is wanting indecision The Arabs hope and stay is dead Khamis bin Abdullah is no more Where are the other warriors of whom the Wangwana and Wanyamwezi bards sing Where is mighty Kisesa great Abdullah bin Nasib Where is Sayd the son of Majid Kisesa is in Zanzibar and Sayd the son of Majid is in Ujiji as yet ignorant that his son has fallen in the forest of Wilyankuru Shaw is improving fast I am unsuccessful as yet in procuring soldiers I almost despair of ever being able to move from here It is such a drowsy sleepy slow dreaming country Arabs Wangwana Wanyamwezi are all alike all careless how time flies Their to morrow means sometimes within a month To me it is simply maddening August thirtieth Shaw will not work I cannot get him to stir himself I have petted him and coaxed him I have even cooked little luxuries for him myself And while I am straining every nerve to get ready for Ujiji Shaw is satisfied with looking on listlessly What a change from the ready handed bold man he was at Zanzibar I sat down by his side to day with my palm and needle in order to encourage him and to day for the first time I told him of the real nature of my mission I told him that I did not care about the geography of the country half as much as I cared about FINDING LIVINGSTONE I told him for the first time Now my dear Shaw you think probably that I have been sent here to find the depth of the Tanganika Not a bit of it man I was told to find Livingstone It is to find Livingstone I am here It is to find Livingstone I am going Don t you see old fellow the importance of the mission don t you see what reward you will get from mister Bennett if you will help me I am sure if ever you come to New York you will never be in want of a fifty dollar bill So shake yourself jump about look lively Say you will not die that is half the battle Snap your fingers at the fever I will guarantee the fever won t kill you I have medicine enough for a regiment here His eyes lit up a little but the light that shone in them shortly faded and died I was quite disheartened I made some strong punch to put fire in his veins that I might see life in him I put sugar and eggs and seasoned it with lemon and spice Drink Shaw said I and forget your infirmities You are not sick dear fellow it is only ennui you are feeling Look at Selim there Now I will bet any amount that he will not die that I will carry him home safe to his friends I will carry you home also if you will let me September first According to Thani bin Abdullah whom I visited to day at his tembe in Maroro Mirambo lost two hundred men in the attack upon Tabora while the Arabs losses were five Arabs thirteen freemen and eight slaves besides three tembes and over one hundred small huts burned two hundred and eighty ivory tusks and sixty cows and bullocks captured September third Received a packet of letters and newspapers from captain Webb at Zanzibar What a good thing it is that one s friends even in far America think of the absent one in Africa They tell me that no one dreams of my being in Africa yet I applied to Sheikh bin Nasib to day to permit Livingstone s caravan to go under my charge to Ujiji but he would not listen to it He says he feels certain I am going to my death September fourth Shaw is quite well to day he says Selim is down with the fever My force is gradually increasing though some of my old soldiers are falling off Umgareza is blind Baruti has the small pox very badly Sadala has the intermittent September fifth Baruti died this morning He was one of my best soldiers and was one of those men who accompanied Speke to Egypt Baruti is number seven of those who have died since leaving Zanzibar To day my ears have been poisoned with the reports of the Arabs about the state of the country I am about to travel through The roads are bad they are all stopped the Ruga Ruga are out in the forests the Wakonongo are coming from the south to help Mirambo the Washensi are at war one tribe against another My men are getting dispirited they have imbibed the fears of the Arabs and the Wanyamwezi Bombay begins to feel that I had better go back to the coast and try again some other time We buried Baruti under the shade of the banyan tree a few yards west of my tembe The grave was made four and a half feet deep and three feet wide At the bottom on one side a narrow trench was excavated into which the body was rolled on his side with his face turned towards Mecca The body was dressed in a doti and a half of new American sheeting After it was placed properly in its narrow bed a sloping roof of sticks covered over with matting and old canvas was made to prevent the earth from falling over the body The grave was then filled the soldiers laughing merrily On the top of the grave was planted a small shrub and into a small hole made with the hand was poured water lest he might feel thirsty they said on his way to Paradise water was then sprinkled all ever the grave and the gourd broken This ceremony being ended the men recited the Arabic Fat hah after which they left the grave of their dead comrade to think no more of him September seventh An Arab named Mohammed presented me to day with a little boy slave called Ndugu M hali my brother s wealth As I did not like the name I called the chiefs of my caravan together and asked them to give him a better name One suggested Simba a lion another said he thought Ngombe a cow would suit the boy child another thought he ought to be called Mirambo which raised a loud laugh Bombay thought Bombay Mdogo would suit my black skinned infant very well Ulimengo however after looking at his quick eyes and noting his celerity of movement pronounced the name Ka lu la as the best for him because said he just look at his eyes so bright look at his form so slim watch his movements how quick Yes Kalulu is his name Yes bana said the others let it be Kalulu Kalulu is a Kisawahili term for the young of the blue buck perpusilla antelope Well then said I water being brought in a huge tin pan Selim who was willing to stand godfather holding him over the water let his name henceforth be Kalulu and let no man take it from him and thus it was that the little black boy of Mohammed s came to be called Kalulu The Expedition is increasing in numbers We had quite an alarm before dark Much firing was heard at Tabora which led us to anticipate an attack on Kwihara It turned out however to be a salute fired in honour of the arrival of Sultan Kitambi to pay a visit to Mkasiwa Sultan of Unyanyembe September eighth Towards night Sheikh bin Nasib received a letter from an Arab at Mfuto reporting that an attack was made on that place by Mirambo and his Watuta allies It also warned him to bid the people of Kwihara hold themselves in readiness because if Mirambo succeeded in storming Mfuto he would march direct on Kwihara September ninth Mirambo was defeated with severe loss yesterday in his attack upon Mfuto He was successful in an assault he made upon a small Wanyamwezi village but when he attempted to storm Mfuto he was repulsed with severe loss losing three of his principal men Upon withdrawing his forces from the attack the inhabitants sallied out and followed him to the forest of Umanda where he was again utterly routed himself ingloriously flying from the field The heads of his chief men slain in the attack were brought to Kwikuru the boma of Mkasiwa September fourteenth The Arab boy Selim is delirious from constant fever Shaw is sick again These two occupy most of my time I am turned into a regular nurse for I have no one to assist me in attending upon them If I try to instruct Abdul Kader in the art of being useful his head is so befogged with the villainous fumes of Unyamwezi tobacco that he wanders bewildered about breaking dishes and upsetting cooked dainties until I get so exasperated that my peace of mind is broken completely for a full hour If I ask Ferajji my now formally constituted cook to assist his thick wooden head fails to receive an idea and I am thus obliged to play the part of chef de cuisine September fifteenth The third month of my residence in Unyanyembe is almost finished and I am still here but I hope to be gone before the twenty third inst All last night until nine A M this morning my soldiers danced and sang to the names of their dead comrades whose bones now bleach in the forests of Wilyankuru Two or three huge pots of pombe failed to satisfy the raging thirst which the vigorous exercise they were engaged in created So early this morning I was called upon to contribute a shukka for another potful of the potent liquor To day I was busy selecting the loads for each soldier and pagazi In order to lighten their labor as much as possible I reduced each load from seventy lbs to fifty lbs by which I hope to be enabled to make some long marches I have been able to engage ten pagazis during the last two or three days I have two or three men still very sick and it is almost useless to expect that they will be able to carry anything but I am in hopes that other men may be engaged to take their places before the actual day of departure which now seems to be drawing near rapidly September sixteenth We have almost finished our work on the fifth day from this God willing we shall march I engaged two more pagazis besides two guides named Asmani and Mabruki If vastness of the human form could terrify any one certainly Asmani s appearance is well calculated to produce that effect He stands considerably over six feet without shoes and has shoulders broad enough for two ordinary men To morrow I mean to give the people a farewell feast to celebrate our departure from this forbidding and unhappy country September seventeenth The banquet is ended I slaughtered two bullocks and had a barbacue three sheep two goats and fifteen chickens one hundred twenty lbs of rice twenty large loaves of bread made of Indian corn flour one hundred eggs ten lbs of butter and five gallons of sweet milk were the contents of which the banquet was formed The men invited their friends and neighbours and about one hundred women and children partook of it After the banquet was ended the pombe or native beer was brought in in five gallon pots and the people commenced their dance which continues even now as I write September nineteenth I had a slight attack of fever to day which has postponed our departure Selim and Shaw are both recovered About eight P M Sheik bin Nasib came to me imploring me not to go away to morrow because I was so sick Thani Sakhburi suggested to me that I might stay another month In answer I told them that white men are not accustomed to break their words I had said I would go and I intended to go Sheikh bin Nasib gave up all hope of inducing me to remain another day and he has gone away with a promise to write to Seyd Burghash to tell him how obstinate I am and that I am determined to be killed This was a parting shot About ten P M the fever had gone All were asleep in the tembe but myself and an unutterable loneliness came on me as I reflected on my position and my intentions and felt the utter lack of sympathy with me in all around It requires more nerve than I possess to dispel all the dark presentiments that come upon the mind But probably what I call presentiments are simply the impress on the mind of the warnings which these false hearted Arabs have repeated so often This melancholy and loneliness I feel may probably have their origin from the same cause The single candle which barely lights up the dark shade that fills the corners of my room is but a poor incentive to cheerfulness I feel as though I were imprisoned between stone walls But why should I feel as if baited by these stupid slow witted Arabs and their warnings and croakings I fancy a suspicion haunts my mind as I write that there lies some motive behind all this I wonder if these Arabs tell me all these things to keep me here in the hope that I might be induced another time to assist them in their war with Mirambo If they think so they are much mistaken for I have taken a solemn enduring oath an oath to be kept while the least hope of life remains in me not to be tempted to break the resolution I have formed never to give up the search until I find Livingstone alive or find his dead body and never to return home without the strongest possible proofs that he is alive or that he is dead No living man or living men shall stop me only death can prevent me But death not even this I shall not die I will not die I cannot die And something tells me I do not know what it is perhaps it is the ever living hopefulness of my own nature perhaps it is the natural presumption born out of an abundant and glowing vitality or the outcome of an overweening confidence in oneself anyhow and everyhow something tells me to night I shall find him and write it larger FIND HIM FIND HIM Even the words are inspiring I feel more happy Have I uttered a prayer I shall sleep calmly to night I have felt myself compelled to copy out of my Diary the above notes as they explain written as they are on the spot the vicissitudes of my Life at Unyanyembe To me they appear to explain far better than any amount of descriptive writing even of the most graphic the nature of the life I led There they are unexaggerated in their literality precisely as I conceived them at the time they happened They speak of fevers without number to myself and men they relate our dangers and little joys our annoyances and our pleasures as they occurred CHAPTER X TO MRERA UKONONGO Departure from Unyanyembe The expedition reorganized Bombay mister Shaw returns sick to Unyanyembe A noble forest The fever described Happiness of the camp A park land Herds of game and noble sport A mutiny Punishment of the ringleaders Elephants Arrival at Mrera The twentieth of September had arrived This was the day I had decided to cut loose from those who tormented me with their doubts their fears and beliefs and commence the march to Ujiji by a southern route I was very weak from the fever that had attacked me the day before and it was a most injudicious act to commence a march under such circumstances But I had boasted to Sheikh bin Nasib that a white man never breaks his word and my reputation as a white man would have been ruined had I stayed behind or postponed the march in consequence of feebleness I mustered the entire caravan outside the tembe our flags and streamers were unfurled the men had their loads resting on the walls there was considerable shouting and laughing and negroidal fanfaronnade The Arabs had collected from curiosity s sake to see us off all except Sheikh bin Nasib whom I had offended by my asinine opposition to his wishes The old Sheikh took to his bed but sent his son to bear me a last morsel of Philosophic sentimentality which I was to treasure up as the last words of the patriarchal Sheikh the son of Nasib the son of Ali the son of Sayf Poor Sheikh if thou hadst only known what was at the bottom of this stubbornness this ass like determination to proceed the wrong way what wouldst thou then have said zero Sheikh But the Sheikh comforted himself with the thought that I might know what I was about better than he did which is most likely only neither he nor any other Arab will ever know exactly the motive that induced me to march at all westward when the road to the east was ever so much easier My braves whom I had enlisted for a rapid march somewhere out of Unyanyembe were named as follows one John William Shaw London England two Selim Heshmy Arab three Seedy Mbarak Mombay Zanzibar four Mabruki Spoke ditto five Ulimengo ditto six Ambari ditto seven Uledi ditto eight Asmani ditto nine Sarmean ditto ten Kamna ditto eleven Zaidi ditto twelve Khamisi ditto thirteen Chowpereh Bagamoyo fourteen Kingaru ditto fifteen Belali ditto sixteen Ferous Unyanyembe

Belali boy Uemba fifty three Kalulu boy Lunda fifty four Abdul Kader tailor Malabar These are the men and boys whom I had chosen to be my companions on the apparently useless mission of seeking for the lost traveller David Livingstone The goods with which I had burdened them consisted of one thousand doti or four thousand yds of cloth six bags of beads four loads of ammunition one tent one bed and clothes one box of medicine sextant and books two loads of tea coffee and sugar one load of flour and candles one load of canned meats sardines and miscellaneous necessaries and one load of cooking utensils The men were all in their places except Bombay Bombay had gone he could not be found I despatched a man to hunt him up He was found weeping in the arms of his Delilah Why did you go away Bombay when you knew I intended to go and was waiting Oh master I was saying good bye to my missis Oh indeed Yes master you no do it when you go away Silence sir Oh all right What is the matter with you Bombay Oh nuffin As I saw he was in a humour to pick a quarrel with me before those Arabs who had congregated outside of my tembe to witness my departure and as I was not in a humour to be balked by anything that might turn up the consequence was that I was obliged to thrash Bombay an operation which soon cooled his hot choler but brought down on my head a loud chorus of remonstrances from my pretended Arab friends Now master don t don t stop it master the poor man knows better than you what he and you may expect on the road you are now taking If anything was better calculated to put me in a rage than Bombay s insolence before a crowd it was this gratuitous interference with what I considered my own especial business but I restrained myself though I told them in a loud voice that I did not choose to be interfered with unless they wished to quarrel with me No no bana they all exclaimed we do not wish to quarrel with you In the name of God go on your way in peace Fare you well then said I shaking hands with them Farewell master farewell We wish you we are sure all success and God be with you and guide you March A parting salute was fired the flags were raised up by the guides each pagazi rushed for his load and in a short time with songs and shouts the head of the Expedition had filed round the western end of my tembe along the road to Ugunda Now mister Shaw I am waiting sir Mount your donkey if you cannot walk Please mister Stanley I am afraid I cannot go Why I don t know I am sure I feel very weak So am I weak It was but late last night as you know that the fever left me Don t back out before these Arabs remember you are a white man Here Selim Mabruki Bombay help mister Shaw on his donkey and walk by him Oh bana bans said the Arabs don t take him Do you not see he is sick You keep away nothing will prevent me from taking him He shall go Go on Bombay The last of my party had gone The tembe so lately a busy scene had already assumed a naked desolate appearance I turned towards the Arabs lifted my hat and said again Farewell then faced about for the south followed by my four young gun bearers Selim Kalulu Majwara and Belali After half an hour s march the scenery became more animated Shaw began to be amused Bombay had forgotten our quarrel and assured me if I could pass Mirambo s country I should catch the Tanganika Mabruki Burton also believed we should Selim was glad to leave Unyanyembe where he had suffered so much from fever and there was a something in the bold aspect of the hills which cropped upward above fair valleys that enlivened and encouraged me to proceed In an hour and a half we arrived at our camp in the Kinyamwezi village of Mkwenkwe the birthplace of our famous chanter Maganga My tent was pitched the goods were stored in one of the tembes but one half the men had returned to Kwihara to take one more embrace of their wives and concubines Towards night I was attacked once again with the intermittent fever Before morning it had departed leaving me terribly prostrated with weakness I had heard the men conversing with each other over their camp fires upon the probable prospects of the next day It was a question with them whether I should continue the march Mostly all were of opinion that since the master was sick there would be no march A superlative obstinacy however impelled me on merely to spite their supine souls but when I sallied out of my tent to call them to get ready I found that at least twenty were missing and Livingstone s letter carrier Kaif Halek or How do ye do had not arrived with doctor Livingstone s letter bag Selecting twenty of the strongest and faithfulest men I despatched them back to Unyanyembe in search of the missing men and Selim was sent to Sheikh bin Nasib to borrow or buy a long slave chain Towards night my twenty detectives returned with nine of the missing men The Wajiji had deserted in a body and they could not be found Selim also returned with a strong chain capable of imprisoning within the collars attached to it at least ten men Kaif Halek also appeared with the letter bag which he was to convey to Livingstone under my escort The men were then addressed and the slave chain exhibited to them I told them that I was the first white man who had taken a slave chain with him on his travels but as they were all so frightened of accompanying me I was obliged to make use of it as it was the only means of keeping them together The good need never fear being chained by me only the deserters the thieves who received their hire and presents guns and ammunition and then ran away I would not put any one this time in chains but whoever deserted after this day I should halt and not continue the march till I found him after which he should march to Ujiji with the slave chain round his neck Do you hear Yes was the answer Do you understand Yes We broke up camp at six P M and took the road for Inesuka at which place we arrived at eight P M When we were about commencing the march the next morning it was discovered that two more had deserted Baraka and Bombay were at once despatched to Unyanyembe to bring back the two missing men Asmani and Kingaru with orders not to return without them This was the third time that the latter had deserted as the reader may remember While the pursuit was being effected we halted at the village of Inesuka more for the sake of Shaw than any one else In the evening the incorrigible deserters were brought back and as I had threatened were well flogged and chained to secure them against further temptation Bombay and Baraka had a picturesque story to relate of the capture and as I was in an exceedingly good humour their services were rewarded with a fine cloth each On the following morning another carrier had absconded taking with him his hire of fifteen new cloths and a gun but to halt anywhere near Unyanyembe any longer was a danger that could be avoided only by travelling without stoppages towards the southern jungle lands It will be remembered I had in my train the redoubtable Abdul Kader the tailor he who had started from Bagamoyo with such bright anticipations of the wealth of ivory to be obtained in the great interior of Africa On this morning daunted by the reports of the dangers ahead Abdul Kader craved to be discharged He vowed he was sick and unable to proceed any further As I was pretty well tired of him I paid him off in cloth and permitted him to go About half way to Kasegera Mabruk Saleem was suddenly taken sick I treated him with a grain of calomel and a couple of ounces of brandy As he was unable to walk I furnished him with a donkey Another man named Zaidi was ill with a rheumatic fever and Shaw tumbled twice off the animal he was riding and required an infinite amount of coaxing to mount again Verily my expedition was pursued by adverse fortunes and it seemed as if the Fates had determined upon our return It really appeared as if everything was going to wreck and ruin If I were only fifteen days from Unyanyembe thought I I should be saved Kasegera was a scene of rejoicing the afternoon and evening of our arrival Absentees had just returned from the coast and the youths were brave in their gaudy bedizenment their new barsatis their soharis and long cloths of bright new kaniki with which they had adorned themselves behind some bush before they had suddenly appeared dressed in all this finery The women Hi hi ed like maenads and the Lu lu lu ing was loud frequent and fervent the whole of that afternoon Sylphlike damsels looked up to the youthful heroes with intensest admiration on their features old women coddled and fondled them staff using stooping backed patriarchs blessed them This is fame in Unyamwezi All the fortunate youths had to use their tongues until the wee hours of next morning had arrived relating all the wonders they had seen near the Great Sea and in the Unguja the island of Zanzibar of how they saw great white men s ships and numbers of white men of their perils and trials during their journey through the land of the fierce Wagogo and divers other facts with which the reader and I are by this time well acquainted On the twenty fourth we struck camp and marched through a forest of imbiti wood in a S S W direction and in about three hours came to Kigandu On arriving before this village which is governed by a daughter of Mkasiwa we were informed we could not enter unless we paid toll As we would not pay toll we were compelled to camp in a ruined rat infested boma situated a mile to the left of Kigandu being well scolded by the cowardly natives for deserting Mkasiwa in his hour of extremity We were accused of running away from the war Almost on the threshold of our camp Shaw in endeavouring to dismount lost his stirrups and fell prone on his face The foolish fellow actually laid on the ground in the hot sun a full hour and when I coldly asked him if he did not feel rather uncomfortable he sat up and wept like a child Do you wish to go back mister Shaw If you please I do not believe I can go any farther and if you would only be kind enough I should like to return very much Well mister Shaw I have come to the conclusion that it is best you should return My patience is worn out I have endeavoured faithfully to lift you above these petty miseries which you nourish so devotedly You are simply suffering from hypochondria You imagine yourself sick and nothing evidently will persuade you that you are not Mark my words to return to Unyanyembe is to DIE Should you happen to fall sick in Kwihara who knows how to administer medicine to you Supposing you are delirious how can any of the soldiers know what you want or what is beneficial and necessary for you Once again I repeat if you return you DIE Ah dear me I wish I had never ventured to come I thought life in Africa was so different from this I would rather go back if you will permit me The next day was a halt and arrangements were made for the transportation of Shaw back to Kwihara A strong litter was made and four stout pagazis were hired at Kigandu to carry him Bread was baked a canteen was filled with cold tea and a leg of a kid was roasted for his sustenance while on the road The night before we parted we spent together Shaw played some tunes on an accordion which I had purchased for him at Zanzibar but though it was only a miserable ten dollar affair I thought the homely tunes evoked from the instrument that night were divine melodies The last tune played before retiring was Home sweet Home The morning of the twenty seventh we were all up early There was considerable vis in our movements A long long march lay before us that day but then I was to leave behind all the sick and ailing Only those who were healthy and could march fast and long were to accompany me Mabruk Saleem I left in charge of a native doctor who was to medicate him for a gift of cloth which I gave him in advance The horn sounded to get ready Shaw was lifted in his litter on the shoulders of his carriers My men formed two ranks the flags were lifted and between these two living rows and under those bright streamers which were to float over the waters of the Tanganika before he should see them again Shaw was borne away towards the north while we filed off to the south with quicker and more elastic steps as if we felt an incubus had been taken from us We ascended a ridge bristling with syenite boulders of massive size appearing above a forest of dwarf trees The view which we saw was similar to that we had often seen elsewhere An illimitable forest stretching in grand waves far beyond the ken of vision ridges forest clad rising gently one above another until they receded in the dim purple blue distance with a warm haze floating above them which though clear enough in our neighbourhood became impenetrably blue in the far distance Woods woods woods leafy branches foliage globes or parachutes green brown or sere in colour forests one above another rising falling and receding a very leafy ocean The horizon at all points presents the same view there may be an indistinct outline of a hill far away or here and there a tall tree higher than the rest conspicuous in its outlines against the translucent sky with this exception it is the same the same clear sky dropping into the depths of the forest the same outlines the same forest the same horizon day after day week after week we hurry to the summit of a ridge expectant of a change but the wearied eyes after wandering over the vast expanse return to the immediate surroundings satiated with the eversameness of such scenes Carlyle somewhere in his writings says that though the Vatican is great it is but the chip of an eggshell compared to the star fretted dome where Arcturus and Orion glance for ever and I say that though the grove of Central Park New York is grand compared to the thin groves seen in other great cities that though the Windsor and the New Forests may be very fine and noble in England yet they are but fagots of sticks compared to these eternal forests of Unyamwezi We marched three hours and then halted for refreshments I perceived that the people were very tired not yet inured to a series of long marches or rather not in proper trim for earnest hard work after our long rest in Kwihara When we resumed our march again there were several manifestations of bad temper and weariness But a few good natured remarks about their laziness put them on their mettle and we reached Ugunda at two P M after another four hours spurt Ugunda is a very large village in the district of Ugunda which adjoins the southern frontier of Unyanyembe The village probably numbers four hundred families or two thousand souls It is well protected by a tall and strong palisade of three inch timber Stages have been erected at intervals above the palisades with miniature embrasures in the timber for the muskets of the sharpshooters who take refuge within these box like stages to pick out the chiefs of an attacking force An inner ditch with the sand or soil thrown up three or four feet high against the palings serves as protection for the main body of the defenders who kneel in the ditch and are thus enabled to withstand a very large force For a mile or two outside the village all obstructions are cleared and the besieged are thus warned by sharp eyed watchers to be prepared for the defence before the enemy approaches within musket range Mirambo withdrew his force of robbers from before this strongly defended village after two or three ineffectual attempts to storm it and the Wagunda have been congratulating themselves ever since upon having driven away the boldest marauder that Unyamwezi has seen for generations The Wagunda have about three thousand acres under cultivation around their principal village and this area suffices to produce sufficient grain not only for their own consumption but also for the many caravans which pass by this way for Ufipa and Marungu However brave the Wagunda may be within the strong enclosure with which they have surrounded their principal village they are not exempt from the feeling of insecurity which fills the soul of a Mnyamwezi during war time At this place the caravans are accustomed to recruit their numbers from the swarms of pagazis who volunteer to accompany them to the distant ivory regions south but I could not induce a soul to follow me so great was their fear of Mirambo and his Ruga Raga They were also full of rumors of wars ahead It was asserted that Mbogo was advancing towards Ugunda with a thousand Wakonongo that the Wazavira had attacked a caravan four months previously that Simba was scouring the country with a band of ferocious mercenaries and much more of the same nature and to the same intent On the twenty eighth we arrived at a small snug village embosomed within the forest called Benta three hours and a quarter from Ugunda The road led through the cornfields of the Wagunda and then entered the clearings around the villages of Kisari within one of which we found the proprietor of a caravan who was drumming up carriers for Ufipa He had been halted here two months and he made strenuous exertions to induce my men to join his caravan a proceeding that did not tend to promote harmony between us A few days afterwards I found on my return that he had given up the idea of proceeding south Leaving Kisari we marched through a thin jungle of black jack over sun cracked ground with here and there a dried up pool the bottom of which was well tramped by elephant and rhinoceros Buffalo and zebra tracks were now frequent and we were buoyed up with the hope that before long we should meet game Benta was well supplied with Indian corn and a grain which the natives called choroko which I take to be vetches I purchased a large supply of choroko for my own personal use as I found it to be a most healthy food The corn was stored on the flat roofs of the tembes in huge boxes made out of the bark of the mtundu tree The largest box I have ever seen in Africa was seen here It might be taken for a Titan s hat box it was seven feet in diameter and ten feet in height On the twenty ninth after travelling in a S W by S direction we reached Kikuru The march lasted for five hours over sun cracked plains growing the black jack and ebony and dwarf shrubs above which numerous ant hills of light chalky coloured earth appeared like sand dunes The mukunguru a Kisawahili term for fever is frequent in this region of extensive forests and flat plains owing to the imperfect drainage provided by nature for them In the dry season there is nothing very offensive in the view of the country The burnt grass gives rather a sombre aspect to the country covered with the hard baked tracks of animals which haunt these plains during the latter part of the rainy season In the forest numbers of trees lie about in the last stages of decay and working away with might and main on the prostrate trunks may be seen numberless insects of various species Impalpably however the poison of the dead and decaying vegetation is inhaled into the system with a result sometimes as fatal as that which is said to arise from the vicinity of the Upas tree The first evil results experienced from the presence of malaria are confined bowels and an oppressive languor excessive drowsiness and a constant disposition to yawn The tongue assumes a yellowish sickly hue coloured almost to blackness even the teeth become yellow and are coated with an offensive matter The eyes of the patient sparkle lustrously and become suffused with water These are sure symptoms of the incipient fever which shortly will rage through the system Sometimes this fever is preceded by a violent shaking fit during which period blankets may be heaped on the patient s form with but little amelioration of the deadly chill he feels It is then succeeded by an unusually severe headache with excessive pains about the loins and spinal column which presently will spread over the shoulder blades and running up the neck find a final lodgment in the back and front of the head Usually however the fever is not preceded by a chill but after languor and torpitude have seized him with excessive heat and throbbing temples the loin and spinal column ache and raging thirst soon possesses him The brain becomes crowded with strange fancies which sometimes assume most hideous shapes Before the darkened vision of the suffering man float in a seething atmosphere figures of created and uncreated reptiles which are metamorphosed every instant into stranger shapes and designs growing every moment more confused more complicated more hideous and terrible Unable to bear longer the distracting scene he makes an effort and opens his eyes and dissolves the delirious dream only however to glide again unconsciously into another dream land where another unreal inferno is dioramically revealed and new agonies suffered Oh the many many hours that I have groaned under the terrible incubi which the fits of real delirium evoke Oh the racking anguish of body that a traveller in Africa must undergo Oh the spite the fretfulness the vexation which the horrible phantasmagoria of diabolisms induce The utmost patience fails to appease the most industrious attendance fails to gratify the deepest humility displeases During these terrible transitions which induce fierce distraction Job himself would become irritable insanely furious and choleric A man in such a state regards himself as the focus of all miseries When recovered he feels chastened becomes urbane and ludicrously amiable he conjures up fictitious delights from all things which but yesterday possessed for him such awful portentous aspects His men he regards with love and friendship whatever is trite he views with ecstasy Nature appears charming in the dead woods and monotonous forest his mind becomes overwhelmed with delight I speak for myself as a careful analysation of the attack in all its severe plaintive and silly phases appeared to me I used to amuse myself with taking notes of the humorous and the terrible the fantastic and exaggerated pictures that were presented to me even while suffering the paroxysms induced by fever We arrived at a large pool known as the Ziwani after a four hours march in a S S W direction the first of October We discovered an old half burnt khambi sheltered by a magnificent mkuyu sycamore the giant of the forests of Unyamwezi which after an hour we transformed into a splendid camp If I recollect rightly the stem of the tree measured thirty eight feet in circumference It is the finest tree of its kind I have seen in Africa A regiment might with perfect ease have reposed under this enormous dome of foliage during a noon halt The diameter of the shadow it cast on the ground was one hundred and twenty feet The healthful vigor that I was enjoying about this time enabled me to regard my surroundings admiringly A feeling of comfort and perfect contentment took possession of me such as I knew not while fretting at Unyanyembe wearing my life away in inactivity I talked with my people as to my friends and equals We argued with each other about our prospects in quite a companionable sociable vein When daylight was dying and the sun was sinking down rapidly over the western horizon vividly painting the sky with the colours of gold and silver saffron and opal when its rays and gorgeous tints were reflected upon the tops of the everlasting forest with the quiet and holy calm of heaven resting upon all around and infusing even into the untutored minds of those about me the exquisite enjoyments of such a life as we were now leading in the depths of a great expanse of forest the only and sole human occupants of it this was the time after our day s work was ended and the camp was in a state of perfect security when we all would produce our pipes and could best enjoy the labors which we had performed and the contentment which follows a work well done Outside nothing is heard beyond the cry of a stray florican or guinea fowl which has lost her mate or the hoarse croaking of the frogs in the pool hard by or the song of the crickets which seems to lull the day to rest inside our camp are heard the gurgles of the gourd pipes as the men inhale the blue ether which I also love I am contented and happy stretched on my carpet under the dome of living foliage smoking my short meerschaum indulging in thoughts despite the beauty of the still grey light of the sky and of the air of serenity which prevails around of home and friends in distant America and these thoughts soon change to my work yet incomplete to the man who to me is yet a myth who for all I know may be dead or may be near or far from me tramping through just such a forest whose tops I see bound the view outside my camp We are both on the same soil perhaps in the same forest who knows yet is he to me so far removed that he might as well be in his own little cottage of Ulva Though I am even now ignorant of his very existence yet I feel a certain complacency a certain satisfaction which would be difficult to describe Why is man so feeble and weak that he must tramp tramp hundreds of miles to satisfy the doubts his impatient and uncurbed mind feels Why cannot my form accompany the bold flights of my mind and satisfy the craving I feel to resolve the vexed question that ever rises to my lips Is he alive O soul of mine be patient thou hast a felicitous tranquillity which other men might envy thee Sufficient for the hour is the consciousness thou hast that thy mission is a holy one Onward and be hopeful Monday the second of October found us traversing the forest and plain that extends from the Ziwani to Manyara which occupied us six and a half hours The sun was intensely hot but the mtundu and miombo trees grew at intervals just enough to admit free growth to each tree while the blended foliage formed a grateful shade The path was clear and easy the tamped and firm red soil offered no obstructions The only provocation we suffered was from the attacks of the tsetse or panga sword fly which swarmed here We knew we were approaching an extensive habitat of game and we were constantly on the alert for any specimens that might be inhabiting these forests While we were striding onward at the rate of nearly three miles an hour the caravan I perceived sheered off from the road resuming it about fifty yards ahead of something on the road to which the attention of the men was directed On coming up I found the object to be the dead body of a man who had fallen a victim to that fearful scourge of Africa the small pox He was one of Oseto s gang of marauders or guerillas in the service of Mkasiwa of Unyanyembe who were hunting these forests for the guerillas of Mirambo They had been returning from Ukonongo from a raid they had instituted against the Sultan of Mbogo and they had left their comrade to perish in the road He had apparently been only one day dead Apropos of this it was a frequent thing with us to discover a skeleton or a skull on the roadside Almost every day we saw one sometimes two of these relics of dead and forgotten humanity Shortly after this we emerged from the forest and entered a mbuga or plain in which we saw a couple of giraffes whose long necks were seen towering above a bush they had been nibbling at This sight was greeted with a shout for we now knew we had entered the game country and that near the Gombe creek or river where we intended to halt we should see plenty of these animals A walk of three hours over this hot plain brought us to the cultivated fields of Manyara Arriving before the village gate we were forbidden to enter as the country was throughout in a state of war and it behoved them to be very careful of admitting any party lest the villagers might be compromised We were however directed to a khambi to the right of the village near some pools of clear water where we discovered some half dozen ruined huts which looked very uncomfortable to tired people After we had built our camp the kirangozi was furnished with some cloths to purchase food from the village for the transit of a wilderness in front of us which was said to extend nine marches or one hundred thirty five miles He was informed that the Mtemi had strictly prohibited his people from selling any grain whatever This evidently was a case wherein the exercise of a little diplomacy could only be effective because it would detain us several days here if we were compelled to send men back to Kikuru for provisions Opening a bale of choice goods I selected two royal cloths and told Bombay to carry them to him with the compliments and friendship of the white man The Sultan sulkily refused them and bade him return to the white man and tell him not to bother him Entreaties were of no avail he would not relent and the men in exceedingly bad temper and hungry were obliged to go to bed supperless The words of Njara a slave trader and parasite of the great Sheikh bin Nasib recurred to me Ah master master you will find the people will be too much for you and that you will have to return The Wa manyara are bad the Wakonongo are very bad the Wazavira are the worst of all You have come to this country at a bad time It is war everywhere And indeed judging from the tenor of the conversations around our camp fires it seemed but too evident There was every prospect of a general decamp of all my people However I told them not to be discouraged that I would get food for them in the morning The bale of choice cloths was opened again next morning and four royal cloths were this time selected and two dotis of Merikani and Bombay was again despatched burdened with compliments and polite words It was necessary to be very politic with a man who was so surly and too powerful to make an enemy of What if he made up his mind to imitate the redoubtable Mirambo King of Uyoweh The effect of my munificent liberality was soon seen in the abundance of provender which came to my camp Before an hour went by there came boxes full of choroko beans rice matama or dourra and Indian corn carried on the heads of a dozen villagers and shortly after the Mtemi himself came followed by about thirty musketeers and twenty spearmen to visit the first white man ever seen on this road Behind these warriors came a liberal gift fully equal in value to that sent to him of several large gourds of honey fowls goats and enough vetches and beans to supply my men with four days food I met the chief at the gate of my camp and bowing profoundly invited him to my tent which I had arranged as well as my circumstances would permit for this reception My Persian carpet and bear skin were spread out and a broad piece of bran new crimson cloth covered my kitanda or bedstead The chief a tall robust man and his chieftains were invited to seat themselves They cast a look of such gratified surprise at myself at my face my clothes and guns as is almost impossible to describe They looked at me intently for a few seconds and then at each other which ended in an uncontrollable burst of laughter and repeated snappings of the fingers They spoke the Kinyamwezi language and my interpreter Maganga was requested to inform the chief of the great delight I felt in seeing them After a short period expended in interchanging compliments and a competitive excellence at laughing at one another their chief desired me to show him my guns The sixteen shooter the Winchester rifle elicited a thousand flattering observations from the excited man and the tiny deadly revolvers whose beauty and workmanship they thought were superhuman evoked such gratified eloquence that I was fain to try something else The double barrelled guns fired with heavy charges of power caused them to jump up in affected alarm and then to subside into their seats convulsed with laughter As the enthusiasm of my guests increased they seized each other s index fingers screwed them and pulled at them until I feared they would end in their dislocation After having explained to them the difference between white men and Arabs I pulled out my medicine chest which evoked another burst of rapturous sighs at the cunning neatness of the array of vials He asked what they meant Dowa I replied sententiously a word which may be interpreted medicine Oh h oh h they murmured admiringly I succeeded before long in winning unqualified admiration and my superiority compared to the best of the Arabs they had seen was but too evident Dowa dowa they added Here said I uncorking a vial of medicinal brandy is the Kisungu pombe white man s beer take a spoonful and try it at the same time handing it Hacht hacht oh hacht what eh what strong beer the white men have Oh how my throat burns Ah but it is good said I a little of it makes men feel strong and good but too much of it makes men bad and they die Let me have some said one of the chiefs and me and me and me as soon as each had tasted I next produced a bottle of concentrated ammonia which as I explained was for snake bites and head aches the Sultan immediately complained he had a head ache and must have a little Telling him to close his eyes I suddenly uncorked the bottle and presented it to His Majesty s nose The effect was magical for he fell back as if shot and such contortions as his features underwent are indescribable His chiefs roared with laughter and clapped their hands pinched each other snapped their fingers and committed many other ludicrous things I verily believe if such a scene were presented on any stage in the world the effect of it would be visible instantaneously on the audience that had they seen it as I saw it they would have laughed themselves to hysteria and madness Finally the Sultan recovered himself great tears rolling down his cheeks and his features quivering with laughter then he slowly uttered the word kali hot strong quick or ardent medicine He required no more but the other chiefs pushed forward to get one wee sniff which they no sooner had than all went into paroxysms of uncontrollable laughter The entire morning was passed in this state visit to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned Oh said the Sultan at parting these white men know everything the Arabs are dirt compared to them That night Hamdallah one of the guides deserted carrying with him his hire twenty seven doti and a gun It was useless to follow him in the morning as it would have detained me many more days than I could afford but I mentally vowed that mister Hamdallah should work out those twenty seven doti of cloths before I reached the coast Wednesday October fourth saw us travelling to the Gombe River which is four h fifteen m march from Manyara We had barely left the waving cornfields of my friend Ma manyara before we came in sight of a herd of noble zebra two hours afterwards we had entered a grand and noble expanse of park land whose glorious magnificence and vastness of prospect with a far stretching carpet of verdure darkly flecked here and there by miniature clumps of jungle with spreading trees growing here and there was certainly one of the finest scenes to be seen in Africa Added to which as I surmounted one of the numerous small knolls I saw herds after herds of buffalo and zebra giraffe and antelope which sent the blood coursing through my veins in the excitement of the moment as when I first landed on African soil We crept along the plain noiselessly to our camp on the banks of the sluggish waters of the Gombe Here at last was the hunter s Paradise How petty and insignificant appeared my hunts after small antelope and wild boar what a foolish waste of energies those long walks through damp grasses and through thorny jungles Did I not well remember my first bitter experience in African jungles when in the maritime region But this where is the nobleman s park that can match this scene Here is a soft velvety expanse of young grass grateful shade under those spreading clumps herds of large and varied game browsing within easy rifle range Surely I must feel amply compensated now for the long southern detour I have made when such a prospect as this opens to the view No thorny jungles and rank smelling swamps are here to daunt the hunter and to sicken his aspirations after true sport No hunter could aspire after a nobler field to display his prowess Having settled the position of the camp which overlooked one of the pools found in the depression of the Gombe creek I took my double barrelled smooth bore and sauntered off to the park land Emerging from behind a clump three fine plump spring bok were seen browsing on the young grass just within one hundred yards I knelt down and fired one unfortunate antelope bounded upward instinctively and fell dead Its companions sprang high into the air taking leaps about twelve feet in length as if they were quadrupeds practising gymnastics and away they vanished rising up like India rubber balls until a knoll hid them from view My success was hailed with loud shouts by the soldiers who came running out from the camp as soon as they heard the reverberation of the gun and my gun bearer had his knife at the beast s throat uttering a fervent Bismillah as he almost severed the head from the body Hunters were now directed to proceed east and north to procure meat because in each caravan it generally happens that there are fundi whose special trade it is to hunt for meat for the camp Some of these are experts in stalking but often find themselves in dangerous positions owing to the near approach necessary before they can fire their most inaccurate weapons with any certainty After luncheon consisting of spring bok steak hot corn cake and a cup of delicious Mocha coffee I strolled towards the south west accompanied by Kalulu and Majwara two boy gun bearers The tiny perpusilla started up like rabbits from me as I stole along through the underbrush the honey bird hopped from tree to tree chirping its call as if it thought I was seeking the little sweet treasure the hiding place of which it only knew but no I neither desired perpusilla nor the honey I was on the search for something great this day Keen eyed fish eagles and bustards poised on trees above the sinuous Gombe thought and probably with good reason that I was after them judging by the ready flight with which both species disappeared as they sighted my approach Ah no nothing but hartebeest zebra giraffe eland and buffalo this day After following the Gombe s course for about a mile delighting my eyes with long looks at the broad and lengthy reaches of water to which I was so long a stranger I came upon a scene which delighted the innermost recesses of my soul five six seven eight ten zebras switching their beautiful striped bodies and biting one another within about one hundred and fifty yards The scene was so pretty so romantic never did I so thoroughly realize that I was in Central Africa I felt momentarily proud that I owned such a vast domain inhabited with such noble beasts Here I possessed within reach of a leaden ball any one I chose of the beautiful animals the pride of the African forests It was at my option to shoot any of them Mine they were without money or without price yet knowing this twice I dropped my rifle loth to wound the royal beasts but crack and a royal one was on his back battling the air with his legs Ah it was such a pity but hasten draw the keen sharp edged knife across the beautiful stripes which fold around the throat and what an ugly gash it is done and one have a superb animal at my feet Hurrah I shall taste of Ukonongo zebra to night I thought a spring bok and zebra enough for one day s sport especially after a long march The Gombe a long stretch of deep water winding in and out of green groves calm placid with lotus leaves lightly resting on its surface all pretty picturesque peaceful as a summer s dream looked very inviting for a bath I sought out the most shady spot under a wide spreading mimosa from which the ground sloped smooth as a lawn to the still clear water I ventured to undress and had already stepped in to my ancles in the water and had brought my hands together for a glorious dive when my attention was attracted by an enormously long body which shot into view occupying the spot beneath the surface that I was about to explore by a header Great heavens it was a crocodile I sprang backward instinctively and this proved my salvation for the monster turned away with the most disappointed look and I was left to congratulate myself upon my narrow escape from his jaws and to register a vow never to be tempted again by the treacherous calm of an African river As soon as I had dressed I turned away from the now repulsive aspect of the stream In strolling through the jungle towards my camp I detected the forms of two natives looking sharply about them and after bidding my young attendants to preserve perfect quiet I crept on towards them and by the aid of a thick clump of underbush managed to arrive within a few feet of the natives undetected Their mere presence in the immense forest unexplained was a cause of uneasiness in the then disturbed state of the country and my intention was to show myself suddenly to them and note its effect which if it betokened anything hostile to the Expedition could without difficulty be settled at once with the aid of my double barrelled smooth bore As I arrived on one side of this bush the two suspicious looking natives arrived on the other side and we were separated by only a few feet I made a bound and we were face to face The natives cast a glance at the sudden figure of a white man and seemed petrified for a moment but then recovering themselves they shrieked out Bana bana you don t know us We are Wakonongo who came to your camp to accompany you to Mrera and we are looking for honey Oh to be sure you are the Wakonongo Yes Yes Ah it is all right now I thought you might be Ruga Ruga So the two parties instead of being on hostile terms with each other burst out laughing The Wakonongo enjoyed it very much and laughed heartily as they proceeded on their way to search for the wild honey On a piece of bark they carried a little fire with which they smoked the bees out from their nest in the great mtundu trees The adventures of the day were over the azure of the sky had changed to a dead grey the moon was appearing just over the trees the water of the Gombe was like a silver belt hoarse frogs bellowed their notes loudly by the margin of the creek the fish eagles uttered their dirge like cries as they were perched high on the tallest tree elands snorted their warning to the herds in the forest stealthy forms of the carnivora stole through the dark woods outside of our camp Within the high inclosure of bush and thorn which we had raised around our camp all was jollity laughter and radiant genial comfort Around every camp fire dark forms of men were seen squatted one man gnawed at a luscious bone another sucked the rich marrow in a zebra s leg bone another turned the stick garnished with huge kabobs to the bright blaze another held a large rib over a flame there were others busy stirring industriously great black potfuls of ugali and watching anxiously the meat simmering and the soup bubbling while the fire light flickered and danced bravely and cast a bright glow over the naked forms of the men and gave a crimson tinge to the tall tent that rose in the centre of the camp like a temple sacred to some mysterious god the fires cast their reflections upon the massive arms of the trees as they branched over our camp and in the dark gloom of their foliage the most fantastic shadows were visible Altogether it was a wild romantic and impressive scene But little recked my men for shadows and moonlight for crimson tints and temple like tents they were all busy relating their various experiences and gorging themselves with the rich meats our guns had obtained for us One was telling how he had stalked a wild boar and the furious onset the wounded animal made on him causing him to drop his gun and climb a tree and the terrible grunt of the beast he well remembered and the whole welkin rang with the peals of laughter which his mimic powers evoked Another had shot a buffalo calf and another had bagged a hartebeest the Wakonongo related their laughable rencontre with me in the woods and were lavish in their description of the stores of honey to be found in the woods and all this time Selim and his youthful subs were trying their sharp teeth on the meat of a young pig which one of the hunters had shot but which nobody else would eat because of the Mohammedan aversion to pig which they had acquired during their transformation from negro savagery to the useful docility of the Zanzibar freed man We halted the two following days and made frequent raids on the herds of this fine country The first day I was fairly successful again in the sport I bagged a couple of antelopes a kudu A strepsiceros with fine twisting horns and a pallah buck A melampus a reddish brown animal standing about three and a half feet with broad posteriors I might have succeeded in getting dozens of animals had I any of those accurate heavy rifles manufactured by Lancaster Reilly or Blissett whose every shot tells But my weapons save my light smoothbore were unfit for African game My weapons were more for men With the Winchester rifle and the Starr s carbine I was able to hit anything within two hundred yards but the animals though wounded invariably managed to escape the knife until I was disgusted with the pea bullets What is wanted for this country is a heavy bore No ten or twelve is the real bone crusher that will drop every animal shot in its tracks by which all fatigue and disappointment are avoided Several times during these two days was I disappointed after most laborious stalking and creeping along the ground Once I came suddenly upon an eland while I had a Winchester rifle in my hand the eland and myself mutually astonished at not more than twenty five yards apart I fired at its chest and bullet true to its aim sped far into the internal parts and the blood spouted from the wound in a few minutes he was far away and I was too much disappointed to follow him All love of the chase seemed to be dying away before these several mishaps What were two antelopes for one day s sport to the thousands that browsed over the plain The animals taken to camp during our three days sport were two buffaloes two wild boar three hartebeest one zebra and one pallah besides which were shot eight guinea fowls three florican two fish eagles one pelican and one of the men caught a couple of large silurus fish In the meantime the people had cut sliced and dried this bounteous store of meat for our transit through the long wilderness before us Saturday the seventh day of October we broke up camp to the great regret of the meat loving gormandizing Wangwana They delegated Bombay early in the morning to speak to me and entreat of me to stop one day longer It was ever the case they had always an unconquerable aversion to work when in presence of meat Bombay was well scolded for bearing any such request to me after two days rest during which time they had been filled to repletion with meat And Bombay was by no means in the best of humour flesh pots full of meat were more to his taste than a constant tramping and its consequent fatigues I saw his face settle into sulky ugliness and his great nether lip hanging down limp which meant as if expressed in so many words Well get them to move yourself you wicked hard man I shall not help you An ominous silence followed my order to the kirangozi to sound the horn and the usual singing and chanting were not heard The men turned sullenly to their bales and Asmani the gigantic guide our fundi was heard grumblingly to say he was sorry he had engaged to guide me to the Tanganika However they started though reluctantly I stayed behind with my gunbearers to drive the stragglers on In about half an hour I sighted the caravan at a dead stop with the bales thrown on the ground and the men standing in groups conversing angrily and excitedly Taking my double barrelled gun from Selim s shoulder I selected a dozen charges of buck shot and slipping two of them into the barrels and adjusting my revolvers in order for handy work I walked on towards them I noticed that the men seized their guns as I advanced When within thirty yards of the groups I discovered the heads of two men appear above an anthill on my left with the barrels of their guns carelessly pointed toward the road I halted threw the barrel of my gun into the hollow of the left hand and then taking a deliberate aim at them threatened to blow their heads off if they did not come forward to talk to me These two men were gigantic Asmani and his sworn companion Mabruki the guides of Sheikh bin Nasib As it was dangerous not to comply with such an order they presently came but keeping my eye on Asmani I saw him move his fingers to the trigger of his gun and bring his gun to a ready Again I lifted my gun and threatened him with instant death if he did not drop his gun Asmani came on in a sidelong way with a smirking smile on his face but in his eyes shone the lurid light of murder as plainly as ever it shone in a villain s eyes Mabruki sneaked to my rear deliberately putting powder in the pan of his musket but sweeping the gun sharply round I planted the muzzle of it at about two feet from his wicked looking face and ordered him to drop his gun instantly He let it fall from his hand quickly and giving him a vigorous poke in the breast with my gun which sent him reeling away a few feet from me I faced round to Asmani and ordered him to put his gun down accompanying it with a nervous movement of my gun pressing gently on the trigger at the same time Never was a man nearer his death than was Asmani during those few moments I was reluctant to shed his blood and I was willing to try all possible means to avoid doing so but if I did not succeed in cowing this ruffian authority was at an end The truth was they feared to proceed further on the road and the only possible way of inducing them to move was by an overpowering force and exercise of my power and will in this instance even though he might pay the penalty of his disobedience with death As I was beginning to feel that Asmani had passed his last moment on earth as he was lifting his gun to his shoulder a form came up from behind him and swept his gun aside with an impatient nervous movement and I heard Mabruki Burton say in horror struck accents Man how dare you point your gun at the master Mabruki then threw himself at my feet and endeavoured to kiss them and entreated me not to punish him It was all over now he said there would be no more quarreling they would all go as far as the Tanganika without any more noise and Inshallah said he we shall find the old Musungu at Ujiji Livingstone Speak men freedmen shall we not shall we not go to the Tanganika without any more trouble tell the master with one voice Ay Wallah Ay Wallah Bana yango Hamuna manneno mgini which literally translated means Yes by God Yes by God my master There are no other words said each man loudly Ask the master s pardon man or go thy way said Mabruki peremptorily to Asmani which Asmani did to the gratification of us all It remained for me only to extend a general pardon to all except to Bombay and Ambari the instigators of the mutiny which was now happily quelled For Bombay could have by a word as my captain nipped all manifestation of bad temper at the outset had he been so disposed But no Bombay was more averse to marching than the cowardliest of his fellows not because he was cowardly but because he loved indolence Again the word was given to march and each man with astonishing alacrity seized his load and filed off quickly out of sight While on this subject I may as well give here a sketch of each of the principal men whose names must often appear in the following chapters According to rank they consist of Bombay Mabruki Burton Asmani the guide Chowpereh Ulimengo Khamisi Ambari Jumah Ferajji the cook Maganga the Mnyamwezi Selim the Arab boy and youthful Kalulu a gunbearer Bombay has received an excellent character from Burton and Speke Incarnation of honesty Burton grandly terms him The truth is Bombay was neither very honest nor very dishonest i e he did not venture to steal much He sometimes contrived cunningly as he distributed the meat to hide a very large share for his own use This peccadillo of his did not disturb me much he deserved as captain a larger share than the others He required to be closely watched and when aware that this was the case he seldom ventured to appropriate more cloth than I would have freely given him had he asked for it As a personal servant or valet he would have been unexceptionable but as a captain or jemadar over his fellows he was out of his proper sphere It was too much brain work and was too productive of anxiety to keep him in order At times he was helplessly imbecile in his movements forgot every order the moment it was given him consistently broke or lost some valuable article was fond of argument and addicted to bluster He thinks Hajji Abdullah one of the wickedest white men born because he saw him pick up men s skulls and put them in sacks as if he was about to prepare a horrible medicine with them He wanted to know whether his former master had written down all he himself did and when told that Burton had not said anything in his books upon the Lake Regions upon collecting skulls at Kilwa thought I would be doing a good work if I published this important fact Bombay intends to make a pilgrimage to visit Speke s grave some day I find upon returning to England that captain Burton has informed the world of this wicked and abominable deed in his book upon Zanzibar and that the interesting collection may be seen at the Royal College of Surgeons London Mabruki Ras bukra Mabruki Bull headed Mabruki as Burton calls him is a sadly abused man in my opinion Mabruki though stupid is faithful He is entirely out of his element as valet he might as well be clerk As a watchman he is invaluable as a second captain or fundi whose duty it is to bring up stragglers he is superexcellent He is ugly and vain but he is no coward Asmani the guide is a large fellow standing over six feet with the neck and shoulders of a Hercules Besides being guide he is a fundi sometimes called Fundi Asmani or hunter A very superstitious man who takes great care of his gun and talismanic plaited cord which he has dipped in the blood of all the animals he has ever shot He is afraid of lions and will never venture out where lions are known to be All other animals he regards as game and is indefatigable in their pursuit He is seldom seen without an apologetic or a treacherous smile on his face He could draw a knife across a man s throat and still smile Chowpereh is a sturdy short man of thirty or thereabouts very good natured and humorous When Chowpereh speaks in his dry Mark Twain style the whole camp laughs I never quarrel with Chowpereh never did quarrel with him A kind word given to Chowpereh is sure to be reciprocated with a good deed He is the strongest the healthiest the amiablest the faithfulest of all He is the embodiment of a good follower Khamisi is a neat cleanly boy of twenty or thereabouts active loud voiced a boaster and the cowardliest of the cowardly He will steal at every opportunity He clings to his gun most affectionately is always excessively anxious if a screw gets loose or if a flint will not strike fire yet I doubt that he would be able to fire his gun at an enemy from excessive trembling Khamisi would rather trust his safety to his feet which are small and well shaped Ambari is a man of about forty He is one of the Faithfuls of Speke and one of my Faithfuls He would not run away from me except when in the presence of an enemy and imminent personal danger He is clever in his way but is not sufficiently clever to enact the part of captain could take charge of a small party and give a very good account of them Is lazy and an admirer of good living abhors marching unless he has nothing to carry but his gun Jumah is the best abused man of the party because he has old womanish ways with him yet in his old womanish ways he is disposed to do the best he can for me though he will not carry a pound in weight without groaning terribly at his hard fate To me he is sentimental and pathetic to the unimportant members of the caravan he is stern and uncompromising But the truth is that I could well dispense with Jumah s presence he was one of the incorrigible inutiles eating far more than he was worth besides being an excessively grumbling and querulous fool Ulimengo a strong stalwart fellow of thirty was the maddest and most hare brained of my party Though an arrant coward he was a consummate boaster But though a devotee of pleasure and fun he was not averse from work With one hundred men such as he I could travel through Africa provided there was no fighting to do It will be remembered that he was the martial coryphaeus who led my little army to war against Mirambo chanting the battle song of the Wangwana and that I stated that when the retreat was determined upon he was the first of my party to reach the stronghold of Mfuto He is a swift runner and a fair hunter I have been indebted to him on several occasions for a welcome addition to my larder Ferajji a former dish washer to Speke was my cook He was promoted to this office upon the defection of Bunder Salaam and the extreme non fitness of Abdul Kader For cleaning dishes the first corn cob green twig a bunch of leaves or grass answered Ferajji s purposes in the absence of a cloth If I ordered a plate and I pointed out a black greasy sooty thumbmark to him a rub of a finger Ferajji thought sufficient to remove all objections If I hinted that a spoon was rather dirty Ferajji fancied that with a little saliva and a rub of his loin cloth the most fastidious ought to be satisfied Every pound of meat and every three spoonfuls of musk or porridge I ate in Africa contained at least ten grains of sand Ferajji was considerably exercised at a threat I made to him that on arrival at Zanzibar I would get the great English doctor there to open my stomach and count every grain of sand found in it for each grain of which Ferajji should be charged one dollar The consciousness that my stomach must contain a large number for which the forfeits would be heavy made him feel very sad at times Otherwise Ferajji was a good cook most industrious if not accomplished He could produce a cup of tea and three or four hot pancakes within ten minutes after a halt was ordered for which I was most grateful as I was almost always hungry after a long march Ferajji sided with Baraka against Bombay in Unyoro and when Speke took Bombay s side of the question Ferajji out of love for Baraka left Speke s service and so forfeited his pay Maganga was a Mnyamwezi a native of Mkwenkwe a strong faithful servant an excellent pagazi with an irreproachable temper He it was who at all times on the march started the wildly exuberant song of the Wanyamwezi porters which no matter how hot the sun or how long the march was sure to produce gaiety and animation among the people At such times all hands sang sang with voices that could be heard miles away which made the great forests ring with the sounds which startled every animal big or little for miles around On approaching a village the temper of whose people might be hostile to us Maganga would commence his song with the entire party joining in the chorus by which mode we knew whether the natives were disposed to be friendly or hostile If hostile or timid the gates would at once be closed and dark faces would scowl at us from the interior if friendly they rushed outside of their gates to welcome us or to exchange friendly remarks An important member of the Expedition was Selim the young Arab Without some one who spoke good Arabic I could not have obtained the friendship of the chief Arabs in Unyanyembe neither could I have well communicated with them for though I understood Arabic I could not speak it I have already related how Kalulu came to be in my service and how he came to bear his present name I soon found how apt and quick he was to learn in consequence of which he was promoted to the rank of personal attendant Even Selim could not vie with Kalulu in promptness and celerity or in guessing my wants at the table His little black eyes were constantly roving over the dishes studying out the problem of what was further necessary or had become unnecessary We arrived at the Ziwani in about four h thirty m from the time of our quitting the scene which had well nigh witnessed a sanguinary conflict The Ziwani or pool contained no water not a drop until the parched tongues of my people warned them that they must proceed and excavate for water This excavation was performed by means of strong hard sticks sharply pointed in the dry hard caked bottom After digging to a depth of six feet their labours were rewarded with the sight of a few drops of muddy liquid percolating through the sides which were eagerly swallowed to relieve their raging thirst Some voluntarily started with buckets gourds and canteens south to a deserted clearing called the Tongoni in Ukamba and in about three hours returned with a plentiful supply for immediate use of good and clear water In one h thirty m we arrived at this Tongoni or deserted clearing of the Wakamba Here were three or four villages burnt and an extensive clearing desolate the work of the Wa Ruga Raga of Mirambo Those of the inhabitants who were left after the spoliation and complete destruction of the flourishing settlement emigrated westerly to Ugara A large herd of buffalo now slake their thirst at the pool which supplied the villages of Ukamba with water Great masses of iron haematite cropped up above the surfaces in these forests Wild fruit began to be abundant the wood apple and tamarind and a small plum like fruit furnished us with many an agreeable repast The honey bird is very frequent in these forests of Ukonongo Its cry is a loud quick chirrup The Wakonongo understand how to avail themselves of its guidance to the sweet treasure of honey which the wild bees have stored in the cleft of some great tree Daily the Wakonongo who had joined our caravan brought me immense cakes of honey comb containing delicious white and red honey The red honey comb generally contains large numbers of dead bees but our exceedingly gluttonous people thought little of these They not only ate the honey bees but they also ate a good deal of the wax As soon as the honey bird descries the traveller he immediately utters a series of wild excited cries hops about from twig to twig and from branch to branch then hops to another tree incessantly repeating his chirruping call The native understanding the nature of the little bird unhesitatingly follows him but perhaps his steps are too slow for the impatient caller upon which he flies back urging him louder more impatient cries to hasten and then darts swiftly forward as if he would show how quickly he could go to the honey store until at last the treasure is reached the native has applied fire to the bees nest and secured the honey while the little bird preens himself and chirrups in triumphant notes as if he were informing the biped that without his aid he never could have found the honey Buffalo gnats and tsetse were very troublesome on this march owing to the numerous herds of game in the vicinity On the ninth of October we made a long march in a southerly direction and formed our camp in the centre of a splendid grove of trees The water was very scarce on the road The Wamrima and Wanyamwezi are not long able to withstand thirst When water is plentiful they slake their thirst at every stream and pool when it is scarce as it is here and in the deserts of Marenga and Magunda Mkali long afternoon marches are made the men previously however filling their gourds so as to enable them to reach the water early next morning Selim was never able to endure thirst It mattered not how much of the precious liquid he carried he generally drank it all before reaching camp and he consequently suffered during the night Besides this he endangered his life by quaffing from every muddy pool and on this day he began to complain that he discharged blood which I took to be an incipient stage of dysentery During these marches ever since quitting Ugunda a favourite topic at the camp fires were the Wa Ruga Ruga and their atrocities and a possible encounter that we might have with these bold rovers of the forest I verily believe that a sudden onset of half a dozen of Mirambo s people would have set the whole caravan arunning We reached Marefu the next day after a short three hours march We there found an embassy sent by the Arabs of Unyanyembe to the Southern Watuta bearing presents of several bales in charge of Hassan the Mseguhha This valiant leader and diplomatist had halted here some ten days because of wars and rumours of wars in his front It was said that Mbogo Sultan of Mboga in Ukonongo was at war with the brother of Manwa Sera and as Mbogo was a large district of Ukonongo only two days march from Marefu fear of being involved in it was deterring old Hassan from proceeding He advised me also not to proceed as it was impossible to be able to do so without being embroiled in the conflict I informed him that I intended to proceed on my way and take my chances and graciously offered him my escort as far as the frontier of Ufipa from which he could easily and safely continue on his way to the Watuta but he declined it We had now been travelling fourteen days in a south westerly direction having made a little more than one degree of latitude I had intended to have gone a little further south because it was such a good road also since by going further south we should have labored under no fear of meeting Mirambo but the report of this war in our front only two days off compelled me in the interest of the Expedition to strike across towards the Tanganika an a west by north course through the forest travelling when it was advantageous along elephant tracks and local paths This new plan was adopted after consulting with Asmani the guide We were now in Ukonongo having entered this district when we crossed the Gombe creek The next day after arriving at Marefu we plunged westward in view of the villagers and the Arab ambassador who kept repeating until the last moment that we should certainly catch it We marched eight hours through a forest where the forest peach or the mbembu is abundant The tree that bears this fruit is very like a pear tree and is very productive I saw one tree upon which I estimated there were at least six or seven bushels I ate numbers of the peaches on this day So long as this fruit can be produced a traveller in these regions need not fear starvation At the base of a graceful hilly cone we found a village called Utende the inhabitants of which were in a state of great alarm as we suddenly appeared on the ridge above them Diplomacy urged me to send forward a present of one doti to the Sultan who however would not accept it because he happened to be drunk with pombe and was therefore disposed to be insolent Upon being informed that he would refuse any present unless he received four more cloths I immediately ordered a strong boma to be constructed on the summits of a little hill near enough to a plentiful supply of water and quietly again packed up the present in the bale I occupied a strategically chosen position as I could have swept the face of the hill and the entire space between its base and the village of Watende Watchmen were kept on the look out all night but we were fortunately not troubled until the morning when a delegation of the principal men came to ask if I intended to depart without having made a present to the chief I replied to them that I did not intend passing through any country without making friends with the chief and if their chief would accept a good cloth from me I would freely give it to him Though they demurred at the amount of the present at first the difference between us was finally ended by my adding a fundo of red beads sami sami for the chief s wife From the hill and ridge of Utende sloped a forest for miles and miles westerly which was terminated by a grand and smooth topped ridge rising five hundred or six hundred feet above the plain A four hours march on the twelfth of October brought us to a nullah similar to the Gombe which during the wet season flows to the Gombe River and thence into the Malagarazi River A little before camping we saw a herd of nimba or pallah I had the good fortune to shoot one which was a welcome addition to our fast diminishing store of dried meats prepared in our camp on the Gombe By the quantity of bois de vaches we judged buffaloes were plentiful here as well as elephant and rhinoceros The feathered species were well represented by ibis fish eagles pelicans storks cranes several snowy spoon bills and flamingoes From the nullah or mtoni we proceeded to Mwaru the principal village of the district of Mwaru the chief of which is Ka mirambo Our march lay over desolated clearings once occupied by Ka mirambo s people but who were driven away by Mkasiwa some ten years ago during his warfare against Manwa Sera Niongo the brother of the latter now waging war against Mbogo had passed through Mwaru the day before we arrived after being defeated by his enemy The hilly ridge that bounded the westward horizon visible from Utende was surmounted on this day The western slope trends south west and is drained by the River Mrera which empties into the Malagarazi River We perceived the influence of the Tanganika even here though we were yet twelve or fifteen marches from the lake The jungles increased in density and the grasses became enormously tall these points reminded us of the maritime districts of Ukwere and Ukami We heard from a caravan at this place just come from Ufipa that a white man was reported to be in Urua whom I supposed to mean Livingstone Upon leaving Mwaru we entered the district of Mrera a chief who once possessed great power and influence over this region Wars however have limited his possessions to three or four villages snugly embosomed within a jungle whose outer rim is so dense that it serves like a stone wall to repel invaders There were nine bleached skulls stuck on the top of as many poles before the principal gate of entrance which told us of existing feuds between the Wakonongo and the Wazavira This latter tribe dwelt in a country a few marches west of us whose territory we should have to avoid unless we sought another opportunity to distinguish ourselves in battle with the natives The Wazavira we were told by the Wakonongo of Mrera were enemies to all Wangwana In a narrow strip of marsh between Mwaru and Mrera we saw a small herd of wild elephants It was the first time I had ever seen these animals in their native wildness and my first impressions of them I shall not readily forget I am induced to think that the elephant deserves the title of king of beasts His huge form the lordly way in which he stares at an intruder on his domain and his whole appearance indicative of conscious might afford good grounds for his claim to that title This herd as we passed it at the distance of a mile stopped to survey the caravan as it passed and after having satisfied their curiosity the elephants trooped into the forest which bounded the marshy plain southward as if caravans were every day things to them whilst they the free and unconquerable lords of the forest and the marsh had nothing in common with the cowardly bipeds who never found courage to face them in fair combat The destruction which a herd makes in a forest is simply tremendous When the trees are young whole swathes may be found uprooted and prostrate which mark the track of the elephants as they trampled their path through wood and brake The boy Selim was so ill at this place that I was compelled to halt the caravan for him for two days He seemed to be affected with a disease in the limbs which caused him to sprawl and tremble most painfully besides suffering from an attack of acute dysentery But constant attendance and care soon brought him round again and on the third day he was able to endure the fatigue of riding I was able to shoot several animals during our stay at Mrera The forest outside of the cultivation teems with noble animals Zebra giraffe elephant and rhinoceros are most common ptarmigan and guinea fowl were also plentiful The warriors of Mrera are almost all armed with muskets of which they take great care They were very importunate in their demands for flints bullets and powder which I always made it a point to refuse lest at any moment a fracas occurring they might use the ammunition thus supplied to my own disadvantage The men of this village were an idle set doing little but hunting gaping gossiping and playing like great boys During the interval of my stay at Mrera I employed a large portion of my time in mending my shoes and patching up the great rents in my clothes which the thorn species during the late marches had almost destroyed Westward beyond Mrera was a wilderness the transit of which we were warned would occupy nine days hence arose the necessity to purchase a large supply of grain which ere attempting the great uninhabited void in our front was to be ground and sifted CHAPTER XI THROUGH UKAWENDI UVINZA AND UHHA TO UJIJI Happy auspices Ant hills The water shed of the Tanganika Lion The king of Kasera The home of the lion and the leopard A donkey frightens a leopard Sublime scenes in Kawendi Starvation imminent Amenities of travel in Africa Black mailers The stormy children of Uhha News of a white man Energetic marches Mionvu chief of tribute takers An escape at midnight Toiling through the jungles The Lake Mountains First view of the Tanganika Arrival at Ujiji The happy meeting with Livingstone We bade farewell to Mrera on the seventeenth of October to continue our route north westward All the men and I were firm friends now all squabbling had long ceased Bombay and I had forgotten our quarrel the kirangozi and myself were ready to embrace so loving and affectionate were the terms upon which we stood towards one another Confidence returned to all hearts for now as Mabruk Unyanyembe said we could smell the fish of the Tanganika Unyanyembe with all its disquietude was far behind We could snap our fingers at that terrible Mirambo and his unscrupulous followers and by and by perhaps we may be able to laugh at the timid seer who always prophesied portentous events Sheikh the son of Nasib We laughed joyously as we glided in Indian file through the young forest jungle beyond the clearing of Mrera and boasted of our prowess Oh we were truly brave that morning Emerging from the jungle we entered a thin forest where numerous ant hills were seen like so many sand dunes I imagine that these ant hills were formed during a remarkably wet season when possibly the forest clad plain was inundated I have seen the ants at work by thousands engaged in the work of erecting their hills in other districts suffering from inundation What a wonderful system of cells these tiny insects construct A perfect labyrinth cell within cell room within room hall within hall an exhibition of engineering talents and high architectural capacity a model city cunningly contrived for safety and comfort Emerging after a short hour s march out of the forest we welcome the sight of a murmuring translucent stream swiftly flowing towards the north west which we regard with the pleasure which only men who have for a long time sickened themselves with that potable liquid of the foulest kind found in salinas mbugas pools and puddle holes can realize Beyond this stream rises a rugged and steep ridge from the summit of which our eyes are gladdened with scenes that are romantic animated and picturesque They form an unusual feast to eyes sated with looking into the depths of forests at towering stems of trees and at tufted crowns of foliage We have now before us scores of cones dotting the surface of a plain which extends across Southern Ukonongo to the territory of the Wafipa and which reaches as far as the Rikwa Plain The immense prospect before which we are suddenly ushered is most varied exclusive of conical hills and ambitious flat topped and isolated mountains we are in view of the watersheds of the Rungwa River which empties into the Tanganika south of where we stand and of the Malagarazi River which the Tanganika receives a degree or so north of this position A single but lengthy latitudinal ridge serves as a dividing line to the watershed of the Rungwa and Malagarazi and a score of miles or so further west of this ridge rises another which runs north and south We camped on this day in the jungle close to a narrow ravine with a marshy bottom through the oozy miry contents of which the waters from the watershed of the Rungwa slowly trickled southward towards the Rikwa Plain This was only one of many ravines however some of which were several hundred yards broad others were but a few yards in width the bottoms of which were most dangerous quagmires overgrown with dense tall reeds and papyrus Over the surface of these great depths of mud were seen hundreds of thin threads of slimy ochre coloured water which swarmed with animalculae By and by a few miles south of the base of this ridge which I call Kasera from the country which it cuts in halves these several ravines converge and debouch into the broad marshy oozy spongy river of Usense which trends in a south easterly direction after which gathering the contents of the watercourses from the north and northeast into its own broader channel it soon becomes a stream of some breadth and consequence and meets a river flowing from the east from the direction of Urori with which it conflows in the Rikwa Plain and empties about sixty rectilineal miles further west into the Tanganika Lake The Rungwa River I am informed is considered as a boundary line between the country of Usowa on the north and Ufipa on the south We had barely completed the construction of our camp defences when some of the men were heard challenging a small party of natives which advanced towards our camp headed by a man who from his garb and head dress we knew was from Zanzibar After interchanging the customary salutations I was informed that this party was an embassy from Simba Lion who ruled over Kasera in Southern Unyamwezi Simba I was told was the son of Mkasiwa King of Unyanyembe and was carrying on war with the Wazavira of whom I was warned to beware He had heard such reports of my greatness that he was sorry I did not take his road to Ukawendi that he might have had the opportunity of seeing me and making friends with me but in the absence of a personal visit Simba had sent this embassy to overtake me in the hope that I would present him with a token of my friendship in the shape of cloth Though I was rather taken aback by the demand still it was politic in me to make this powerful chief my friend lest on my return from the search after Livingstone he and I might fall out And since it was incumbent on me to make a present for the sake of peace it was necessary to exhibit my desire for peace by giving if I gave at all a royal present The ambassador conveyed from me to Simba or the Lion of Kasera two gorgeous cloths and two other doti consisting of Merikani and Kaniki and if I might believe the ambassador I had made Simba a friend for ever On the eighteenth of October breaking camp at the usual hour we continued our march north westward by a road which zig zagged along the base of the Kasera mountains and which took us into all kinds of difficulties We traversed at least a dozen marshy ravines the depth of mire and water in which caused the utmost anxiety I sunk up to my neck in deep holes in the Stygian ooze caused by elephants and had to tramp through the oozy beds of the Rungwa sources with any clothes wet and black with mud and slime Decency forbade that I should strip and the hot sun would also blister my body Moreover these morasses were too frequent to lose time in undressing and dressing and as each man was weighted with his own proper load it would have been cruel to compel the men to bear me across Nothing remained therefore but to march on all encumbered as I was with my clothing and accoutrements into these several marshy watercourses with all the philosophical stoicism that my nature could muster for such emergencies But it was very uncomfortable to say the least of it We soon entered the territory of the dreaded Wazavira but no enemy was in sight Simba in his wars had made clean work of the northern part of Uzavira and we encountered nothing worse than a view of the desolated country which must have been once judging from the number of burnt huts and debris of ruined villages extremely populous A young jungle was sprouting up vigorously in their fields and was rapidly becoming the home of wild denizens of the forest In one of the deserted and ruined villages I found quarters for the Expedition which were by no means uncomfortable I shot three brace of guinea fowl in the neighbourhood of Misonghi the deserted village we occupied and Ulimengo one of my hunters bagged an antelope called the mbawala for whose meat some of the Wanyamwezi have a superstitious aversion I take this species of antelope which stands about three and a half feet high of a reddish hide head long horns short to be the Nzoe antelope discovered by Speke in Uganda and whose Latin designation is according to doctor Sclater Tragelaphus Spekii It has a short bushy tail and long hair along the spine A long march in a west by north direction lasting six hours through a forest where the sable antelope was seen and which was otherwise prolific with game brought us to a stream which ran by the base of a lofty conical hill on whose slopes flourished quite a forest of feathery bamboo On the twentieth leaving our camp which lay between the stream and the conical hill above mentioned and surmounting a low ridge which sloped from the base of the hill cone we were greeted with another picturesque view of cones and scarped mountains which heaved upward in all directions A march of nearly five hours through this picturesque country brought us to the Mpokwa River one of the tributaries of the Rungwa and to a village lately deserted by the Wazavira The huts were almost all intact precisely as they were left by their former inhabitants In the gardens were yet found vegetables which after living so long on meat were most grateful to us On the branches of trees still rested the Lares and Penates of the Wazavira in the shape of large and exceedingly well made earthen pots In the neighbouring river one of my men succeeded in few minutes in catching sixty fish of the silurus species the hand alone A number of birds hovered about stream such as the white headed fish eagle and the kingfisher enormous snowy spoonbills ibis martins c This river issued from a mountain clump eight miles or so north of the village of Mpokwa and comes flowing down a narrow thread of water sinuously winding amongst tall reeds and dense brakes on either side the home of hundreds of antelopes and buffaloes South of Mpokwa the valley broadens and the mountains deflect eastward and westward and beyond this point commences the plain known as the Rikwa which during the Masika is inundated but which in the dry season presents the same bleached aspect that plains in Africa generally do when the grass has ripened Travelling up along the right bank of the Mpokwa on the twenty first we came to the head of the stream and the sources of the Mpokwa issuing out of deep defiles enclosed by lofty ranges The mbawala and the buffalo were plentiful On the twenty second after a march of four hours and a half we came to the beautiful stream of Mtambu the water of which was sweet and clear as crystal and flowed northward We saw for the first time the home of the lion and the leopard Hear what Freiligrath says of the place Where the thorny brake and thicket Densely fill the interspace Of the trees through whose thick branches Never sunshine lights the place There the lion dwells a monarch Mightiest among the brutes There his right to reign supremest Never one his claim disputes There he layeth down to slumber Having slain and ta en his fill There he roameth there be croucheth As it suits his lordly will We camped but a few yards from just such a place as the poet describes The herd keeper who attended the goats and donkeys soon after our arrival in camp drove the animals to water and in order to obtain it they travelled through a tunnel in the brake caused by elephants and rhinoceros They had barely entered the dark cavernous passage when a black spotted leopard sprang and fastened its fangs in the neck of one of the donkeys causing it from the pain to bray hideously Its companions set up such a frightful chorus and so lashed their heels in the air at the feline marauder that the leopard bounded away through the brake as if in sheer dismay at the noisy cries which the attack had provoked The donkey s neck exhibited some frightful wounds but the animal was not dangerously hurt Thinking that possibly I might meet with an adventure with a lion or a leopard in that dark belt of tall trees under whose impenetrable shade grew the dense thicket that formed such admirable coverts for the carnivorous species I took a stroll along the awesome place with the gunbearer Kalulu carrying an extra gun and a further supply of ammunition We crept cautiously along looking keenly into the deep dark dens the entrances of which were revealed to us as we journeyed expectant every moment to behold the reputed monarch of the brake and thicket bound forward to meet us and I took a special delight in picturing in my imagination the splendor and majesty of the wrathful brute as he might stand before me I peered closely into every dark opening hoping to see the deadly glitter of the great angry eyes and the glowering menacing front of the lion as he would regard me But alas after an hour s search for adventure I had encountered nothing and I accordingly waxed courageous and crept into one of these leafy thorny caverns and found myself shortly standing under a canopy of foliage that was held above my head fully a hundred feet by the shapely and towering stems of the royal mvule Who can imagine the position A smooth lawn like glade a dense and awful growth of impenetrable jungle around us those stately natural pillars a glorious phalanx of royal trees bearing at such sublime heights vivid green masses of foliage through which no single sun ray penetrated while at our feet babbled the primeval brook over smooth pebbles in soft tones befitting the sacred quiet of the scene Who could have desecrated this solemn holy harmony of nature But just as I was thinking it impossible that any man could be tempted to disturb the serene solitude of the place I saw a monkey perched high on a branch over my head contemplating with something of an awe struck look the strange intruders beneath Well I could not help it I laughed laughed loud and long until I was hushed by the chaos of cries and strange noises which seemed to respond to my laughing A troop of monkeys hidden in the leafy depths above had been rudely awakened and startled by the noise I made were hurrying away from the scene with a dreadful clamor of cries and shrieks Emerging again into the broad sunlight I strolled further in search of something to shoot Presently I saw feeding quietly in the forest which bounded the valley of the Mtambu on the left a huge reddish coloured wild boar armed with most horrid tusks Leaving Kalulu crouched down behind a tree and my solar helmet behind another close by that I might more safely stalk the animal I advanced towards him some forty yards and after taking a deliberate aim fired at his fore shoulder As if nothing had hurt him whatever the animal made a furious bound and then stood with his bristles erected and tufted tail curved over the back a most formidable brute in appearance While he was thus listening and searching the neighbourhood with his keen small eyes I planted another shot in his chest which ploughed its way through his body Instead of falling however as I expected he would he charged furiously in the direction the bullet had come and as he rushed past me another ball was fired which went right through him but still he kept on until within six or seven yards from the trees behind which Kalulu was crouching down on one side and the helmet was resting behind another he suddenly halted and then dropped But as I was about to advance on him with my knife to cut his throat he suddenly started up his eyes had caught sight of the little boy Kalulu and were then almost immediately afterwards attracted by the sight of the snowy helmet These strange objects on either side of him proved too much for the boar for with a terrific grunt he darted on one side into a thick brake from which it was impossible to oust him and as it was now getting late and the camp was about three miles away I was reluctantly obliged to return without the meat On our way to camp we were accompanied by a large animal which persistently followed us on our left It was too dark to see plainly but a large form was visible if not very clearly defined It must have been a lion unless it was the ghost of the dead boar That night about eleven P M we were startled by the roar of a lion in close proximity to the camp Soon it was joined by another and another still and the novelty of the thing kept me awake I peered through the gate of the camp and endeavoured to sight a rifle my little Winchester in the accuracy of which I had perfect confidence but alas for the cartridges they might have been as well filled with sawdust for all the benefit I derived from them Disgusted with the miserable ammunition I left the lions alone and turned in with their roaring as a lullaby That terrestrial paradise for the hunter the valley of the pellucid Mtambu was deserted by us the next morning for the settlement commonly known to the Wakawendi as Imrera s with as much unconcern as though it were a howling desert The village near which we encamped was called Itaga in the district of Rusawa As soon as we had crossed the River Mtambu we had entered Ukawendi commonly called Kawendi by the natives of the country The district of Rusawa is thickly populated The people are quiet and well disposed to strangers though few ever come to this region from afar One or two Wasawahili traders visit it every year or so from Pumburu and Usowa but very little ivory being obtained from the people the long distance between the settlements serves to deter the regular trader from venturing hither If caravans arrive here the objective point to them is the district of Pumburu situated south westerly one day s good marching or say thirty statute miles from Imrera or they make for Usowa on the Tanganika via Pumburu Katuma Uyombeh and Ugarawah Usowa is quite an important district on the Tanganika populous and flourishing This was the road we had intended to adopt after leaving Imrera but the reports received at the latter place forbade such a venture For Mapunda the Sultan of Usowa though a great friend to Arab traders was at war with the colony of the Wazavira who we must remember were driven from Mpokwa and vicinity in Utanda and who were said to have settled between Pumburu and Usowa It remained for us like wise prudent men having charge of a large and valuable Expedition on our hands to decide what to do and what route to adopt now that we had approached much nearer to Ujiji than we were to Unyanyembe I suggested that we should make direct for the Tanganika by compass trusting to no road or guide but to march direct west until we came to the Tanganika and then follow the lake shore on foot until we came to Ujiji For it ever haunted my mind that if doctor Livingstone should hear of my coming which he might possibly do if I travelled along any known road he would leave and that my search for him would consequently be a stern chase But my principal men thought it better that we should now boldly turn our faces north and march for the Malagarazi which was said to be a large river flowing from the east to the Tanganika But none of my men knew the road to the Malagarazi neither could guides be hired from Sultan Imrera We were however informed that the Malagarazi was but two days march from Imrera I thought it safe in such a case to provision my men with three days rations The village of Itaga is situated in a deep mountain hollow finely overlooking a large extent of cultivation The people grow sweet potatoes manioc out of which tapioca is made beans and the holcus Not one chicken could be purchased for love or money and besides grain only a lean scraggy specimen of a goat a long time ago imported form Uvinza was procurable October the twenty fifth will be remembered by me as a day of great troubles in fact a series of troubles began from this date We struck an easterly road in order to obtain a passage to the lofty plateau which bounded the valley of Imrera on the west and on the north We camped after a two and a half hours march at its foot The defile promised a feasible means of ascent to the summit of the plateau which rose upward in a series of scarps a thousand feet above the valley of Imrera While ascending that lofty arc of mountains which bounded westerly and northerly the basin of Imrera extensive prospects southward and eastward were revealed The character of the scenery at Ukawendi is always animated and picturesque but never sublime The folds of this ridge contained several ruins of bomas which seemed to have been erected during war time The mbemba fruit was plentiful along this march and every few minutes I could see from the rear one or two men hastening to secure a treasure of it which they discovered on the ground A little before reaching the camp I had a shot at a leopard but failed to bring him down as he bounded away At night the lions roared as at the Mtambu River A lengthy march under the deep twilight shadows of a great forest which protected us from the hot sunbeams brought us on the next day to a camp newly constructed by a party of Arabs from Ujiji who had advanced thus far on their road to Unyanyembe but alarmed at the reports of the war between Mirambo and the Arabs had returned Our route was along the right bank of the Rugufu a broad sluggish stream well choked with the matete reeds and the papyrus The tracks and the bois de vaches of buffaloes were numerous and there were several indications of rhinoceros being near In a deep clump of timber near this river we discovered a colony of bearded and leonine looking monkeys As we were about leaving our camp on the morning of the twenty eighth a herd of buffalo walked deliberately into view Silence was quickly restored but not before the animals to their great surprise had discovered the danger which confronted them We commenced stalking them but we soon heard the thundering sound of their gallop after which it becomes a useless task to follow them with a long march in a wilderness before one The road led on this day over immense sheets of sandstone and iron ore The water was abominable and scarce and famine began to stare us in the face We travelled for six hours and had yet seen no sign of cultivation anywhere According to my map we were yet two long marches from the Malagarazi if Captain Burton had correctly laid down the position of the river according to the natives account we should have arrived at the Malagarazi on this day On the twenty ninth we left our camp and after a few minutes we were in view of the sublimest but ruggedest scenes we had yet beheld in Africa The country was cut up in all directions by deep wild and narrow ravines trending in all directions but generally toward the north west while on either side rose enormous square masses of naked rock sandstone sometimes towering and rounded sometimes pyramidal sometimes in truncated cones sometimes in circular ridges with sharp rugged naked backs with but little vegetation anywhere visible except it obtained a precarious tenure in the fissured crown of some gigantic hill top whither some soil had fallen or at the base of the reddish ochre scarps which everywhere lifted their fronts to our view A long series of descents down rocky gullies wherein we were environed by threatening masses of disintegrated rock brought us to a dry stony ravine with mountain heights looming above us a thousand feet high This ravine we followed winding around in all directions but which gradually widened however into a broad plain with a western trend The road leaving this struck across a low ridge to the north and we were in view of deserted settlements where the villages were built on frowning castellated masses of rock Near an upright mass of rock over seventy feet high and about fifty yards in diameter which dwarfed the gigantic sycamore close to it we made our camp after five hours and thirty minutes continuous and rapid marching The people were very hungry they had eaten every scrap of meat and every grain they possessed twenty hours before and there was no immediate prospect of food I had but a pound and a half of flour left and this would not have sufficed to begin to feed a force of over forty five people but I had something like thirty pounds of tea and twenty pounds of sugar left and I at once as soon as we arrived at camp ordered every kettle to be filled and placed on the fire and then made tea for all giving each man a quart of a hot grateful beverage well sweetened Parties stole out also into the depths of the jungle to search for wild fruit and soon returned laden with baskets of the wood peach and tamarind fruit which though it did not satisfy relieved them That night before going to sleep the Wangwana set up a loud prayer to Allah to give them food We rose betimes in the morning determined to travel on until food could be procured or we dropped down from sheer fatigue and weakness Rhinoceros tracks abounded and buffalo seemed to be plentiful but we never beheld a living thing We crossed scores of short steeps and descended as often into the depths of dry stony gullies and then finally entered a valley bounded on one side by a triangular mountain with perpendicular sides and on the other by a bold group a triplet of hills While marching down this valley which soon changed its dry bleached aspect to a vivid green we saw a forest in the distance and shortly found ourselves in corn fields Looking keenly around for a village we descried it on the summit of the lofty triangular hill on our right A loud exultant shout was raised at the discovery The men threw down their packs and began to clamour for food Volunteers were asked to come forward to take cloth and scale the heights to obtain it from the village at any price While three or four sallied off we rested on the ground quite worn out In about an hour the foraging party returned with the glorious tidings that food was plentiful that the village we saw was called Welled Nzogera s the son of Nzogera by which of course we knew that we were in Uvinza Nzogera being the principal chief in Uvinza We were further informed that Nzogera the father was at war with Lokanda Mire about some salt pans in the valley of the Malagarazi and that it would be difficult to go to Ujiji by the usual road owing to this war but for a consideration the son of Nzogera was willing to supply us with guides who would take us safely by a northern road to Ujiji Everything auguring well for our prospects we encamped to enjoy the good cheer for which our troubles and privations during the transit of the Ukawendi forests and jungles had well prepared us I am now going to extract from my Diary of the march as without its aid I deem it impossible to relate fully our various experiences so as to show them properly as they occurred to us and as these extracts were written and recorded at the close of each day they possess more interest in my opinion than a cold relation of facts now toned down in memory October thirty first Tuesday Our road led E N E for a considerable time after leaving the base of the triangular mountain whereon the son of Nzogera has established his stronghold in order to avoid a deep and impassable portion of marsh that stood between us and the direct route to the Malagarazi River The valley sloped rapidly to this marsh which received in its broad bosom the drainage of three extensive ranges Soon we turned our faces northwest and prepared to cross the marsh and the guides informed us as we halted on its eastern bank of a terrible catastrophe which occurred a few yards above where we were preparing to cross They told of an Arab and his caravan consisting of thirty five slaves who had suddenly sunk out of sight and who were never more heard of This marsh as it appeared to us presented a breadth of some hundreds of yards on which grew a close network of grass with much decayed matter mixed up with it In the centre of this and underneath it ran a broad deep and rapid stream As the guides proceeded across the men stole after them with cautious footsteps As they arrived near the centre we began to see this unstable grassy bridge so curiously provided by nature for us move up and down in heavy languid undulations like the swell of the sea after a storm Where the two asses of the Expedition moved the grassy waves rose a foot high but suddenly one unfortunate animal plunged his feet through and as he was unable to rise he soon made a deep hollow which was rapidly filling with water With the aid of ten men however we were enabled to lift him bodily up and land him on a firmer part and guiding them both across rapidly the entire caravan crossed without accident On arriving at the other side we struck off to the north and found ourselves in a delightful country in every way suitable for agriculturists Great rocks rose here and there but in their fissures rose stately trees under whose umbrage nestled the villages of the people We found the various village elders greedy for cloth but the presence of the younger son of Nzogera s men restrained their propensity for extortion Goats and sheep were remarkably cheap and in good condition and consequently to celebrate our arrival near the Malagarazi a flock of eight goats was slaughtered and distributed to the men November first Striking north west after leaving our camp and descending the slope of a mountain we soon beheld the anxiously looked for Malagarazi a narrow but deep stream flowing through a valley pent in by lofty mountains Fish eating birds lined the trees on its banks villages were thickly scattered about Food was abundant and cheap After travelling along the left bank of the river a few miles we arrived at the settlements recognizing Kiala as their ruler I had anticipated we should be able at once to cross the river but difficulties arose We were told to camp before any negotiations could be entered into When we demurred we were informed we might cross the river if we wished but we should not be assisted by any Mvinza Being compelled to halt for this day the tent was pitched in the middle of one of the villages and the bales were stored in one of the huts with four soldiers to guard them After despatching an embassy to Kiala eldest son of the great chief Nzogera to request permission to cross the river as a peaceable caravan Kiala sent word that the white man should cross his river after the payment of fifty six cloths Fifty six cloths signified a bale nearly Here was another opportunity for diplomacy Bombay and Asmani were empowered to treat with Kiala about the honga but it was not to exceed twenty five doti At six A M having spoken for seven hours the two men returned with the demand for thirteen doti for Nzogera and ten doti for Kiala Poor Bombay was hoarse but Asmani still smiled and I relented congratulating myself that the preposterous demand which was simply robbery was no worse Three hours later another demand was made Kiala had been visited by a couple of chiefs from his father and the chiefs being told that a white man was at the ferry put in a claim for a couple of guns and a keg of gunpowder But here my patience was exhausted and I declared that they should have to take them by force for I would never consent to be robbed and despoiled after any such fashion Until eleven P M Bombay and Asmani were negotiating about this extra demand arguing quarreling threatening until Bombay declared they would talk him mad if it lasted much longer I told Bombay to take two cloths one for each chief and if they did not consider it enough then I should fight The present was taken and the negotiations were terminated at midnight November second Ihata Island one and a half hour west of Kiala s We arrived before the Island of Ihata on the left bank of the Malagarazi at five p m the morning having been wasted in puerile talk with the owner of the canoes at the ferry The final demand for ferriage across was eight yards of cloth and four fundo of sami sami or red beads which was at once paid Four men with their loads were permitted to cross in the small unshapely and cranky canoes When the boatmen had discharged their canoes of their passengers and cargoes they were ordered to halt on the other side and to my astonishment another demand was made The ferrymen had found that two fundo of these were of short measure and two fundo more must be paid otherwise the contract for ferrying us across would be considered null and void So two fundo more were added but not without demur and much talk which in these lands is necessary four fundo forty necklaces one fundo being ten necklaces Three times the canoes went backwards and forwards when lo another demand was made with the usual clamour and fierce wordy dispute this time for five khete for the man who guided us to the ferry a shukka of cloth for a babbler who had attached himself to the old womanish Jumah who did nothing but babble and increase the clamor These demands were also settled Necklaces About sunset we endeavoured to cross the donkeys Simba a fine wild Kinyamwezi donkey went in first with a rope attached to his neck He had arrived at the middle of the stream when we saw him begin to struggle a crocodile had seized him by the throat The poor animal s struggles were terrific Chowpereh was dragging on the rope with all his might but to no use for the donkey sank and we saw no more of him The depth of the river at this place was about fifteen feet We had seen the light brown heads the glittering eyes and the ridgy backs hovering about the vicinity but we had never thought that the reptiles would advance so near such an exciting scene as the vicinity of the ferry presented during the crossing Saddened a little by this loss we resumed our work and by seven P M we were all across excepting Bombay and the only donkey now left which was to be brought across in the morning when the crocodiles should have deserted the river November third What contention have we not been a witness to these last three days What anxiety have we not suffered ever since our arrival in Uvinza The Wavinza are worse than the Wagogo and their greed is more insatiable We got the donkey across with the aid of a mganga or medicine man who spat some chewed leaves of a tree which grows close to the stream over him He informed me he could cross the river at any time day or night after rubbing his body with these chewed leaves which he believed to be a most potent medicine About ten A M appeared from the direction of Ujiji a caravan of eighty Waguhha a tribe which occupies a tract of country on the south western side of the Lake Tanganika We asked the news and were told a white man had just arrived at Ujiji from Manyuema This news startled us all A white man we asked Yes a white man they replied How is he dressed Like the master they answered referring to me Is he young or old He is old He has white hair on his face and is sick Where has he come from From a very far country away beyond Uguhha called Manyuema Indeed and is he stopping at Ujiji now Yes we saw him about eight days ago Do you think he will stop there until we see him Sigue don t know Was he ever at Ujiji before Yes he went away a long time ago Hurrah This is Livingstone He must be Livingstone He can be no other but still he may be some one else some one from the West Coast or perhaps he is Baker No Baker has no white hair on his face But we must now march quick lest he hears we are coming and runs away I addressed my men and asked them if they were willing to march to Ujiji without a single halt and then promised them if they acceded to my wishes two doti each man All answered in the affirmative almost as much rejoiced as I was myself But I was madly rejoiced intensely eager to resolve the burning question Is it doctor David Livingstone God grant me patience but I do wish there was a railroad or at least horses in this country We set out at once from the banks of the Malagarazi accompanied by two guides furnished us by Usenge the old man of the ferry who now that we had crossed showed himself more amiably disposed to us We arrived at the village of Isinga Sultan Katalambula after a little over an hour s march across a saline plain but which as we advanced into the interior became fertile and productive November fourth Started early with great caution maintaining deep silence The guides were sent forward one two hundred yards ahead of the other that we might be warned in time The first part of the march was through a thin jungle of dwarf trees which got thinner and thinner until finally it vanished altogether and we had entered Uhha a plain country Villages were visible by the score among the tall bleached stalks of dourra and maize Sometimes three sometimes five ten or twenty beehive shaped huts formed a village The Wahha were evidently living in perfect security for not one village amongst them all was surrounded with the customary defence of an African village A narrow dry ditch formed the only boundary between Uhha and Uvinza On entering Uhha all danger from Makumbi vanished We halted at Kawanga the chief of which lost no time in making us understand that he was the great Mutware of Kimenyi under the king and that he was the tribute gatherer for his Kiha majesty He declared that he was the only one in Kimenyi an eastern division of Uhha who could demand tribute and that it would be very satisfactory to him and a saving of trouble to ourselves if we settled his claim of twelve doti of good cloths at once We did not think it the best way of proceeding knowing as we did the character of the native African so we at once proceeded to diminish this demand but after six hours hot argument the Mutware only reduced it by two This claim was then settled upon the understanding that we should be allowed to travel through Uhha as far as the Rusugi River without being further mulcted November fifth Leaving Kawanga early in the morning and continuing our march over the boundless plains which were bleached white by the hot equatorial sun we were marching westward full of pleasant anticipations that we were nearing the end of our troubles joyfully congratulating ourselves that within five days we should see that which I had come so far from civilisation and through so many difficulties to see and were about passing a cluster of villages with all the confidence which men possess against whom no one had further claim or a word to say when I noticed two men darting from a group of natives who were watching us and running towards the head of the Expedition with the object evidently of preventing further progress The caravan stopped and I walked forward to ascertain the cause from the two natives I was greeted politely by the two Wahha with the usual Yambos and was then asked Why does the white man pass by the village of the King of Uhha without salutation and a gift Does not the white man know there lives a king in Uhha to whom the Wangwana and Arabs pay something for right of passage Why we paid last night to the chief of Kawanga who informed us that he was the man deputed by the King of Uhha to collect the toll How much did you pay Ten doti of good cloth Are you sure Quite sure If you ask him he will tell you so Well said one of the Wahha a fine handsome intelligent looking youth it is our duty to the king to halt you here until we find out the truth of this Will you walk to our village and rest yourselves under the shade of our trees until we can send messengers to Kawanga No the sun is but an hour high and we have far to travel but in order to show you we do not seek to pass through your country without doing that which is right we will rest where we now stand and we will send with your messengers two of our soldiers who will show you the man to whom we paid the cloth The messengers departed but in the meantime the handsome youth who turned out to be the nephew of the King whispered some order to a lad who immediately hastened away with the speed of an antelope to the cluster of villages which we had just passed The result of this errand as we saw in a short time was the approach of a body of warriors about fifty in number headed by a tall fine looking man who was dressed in a crimson robe called Joho two ends of which were tied in a knot over the left shoulder a new piece of American sheeting was folded like a turban around his head and a large curved piece of polished ivory was suspended to his neck He and his people were all armed with spears and bows and arrows and their advance was marked with a deliberation that showed they felt confidence in any issue that might transpire We were halted on the eastern side of the Pombwe stream near the village of Lukomo in Kimenyi Uhha The gorgeously dressed chief was a remarkable man in appearance His face was oval in form high cheek bones eyes deeply sunk a prominent and bold forehead a fine nose and a well cut mouth he was tall in figure and perfectly symmetrical When near to us he hailed me with the words Yambo bana How do you do master in quite a cordial tone I replied cordially also Yambo mutware How do you do chief We myself and men interchanged Yambos with his warriors and there was nothing in our first introduction to indicate that the meeting was of a hostile character The chief seated himself his haunches resting on his heels laying down his bow and arrows by his side his men did likewise I seated myself on a bale and each of my men sat down on their loads forming quite a semicircle The Wahha slightly outnumbered my party but while they were only armed with bows and arrows spears and knob sticks we were armed with rifles muskets revolvers pistols and hatchets All were seated and deep silence was maintained by the assembly The great plains around us were as still in this bright noon as if they were deserted of all living creatures Then the chief spoke I am Mionvu the great Mutware of Kimenyi and am next to the King who lives yonder pointing to a large village near some naked hills about ten miles to the north I have come to talk with the white man It has always been the custom of the Arabs and the Wangwana to make a present to the King when they pass through his country Does not the white man mean to pay the King s dues Why does the white man halt in the road Why will he not enter the village of Lukomo where there is food and shade where we can discuss this thing quietly Does the white man mean to fight I know well he is stronger than we are His men have guns and the Wahha have but bows and arrows and spears but Uhha is large and our villages are many Let him look about him everywhere all is Uhha and our country extends much further than he can see or walk in a day The King of Uhha is strong yet he wishes friendship only with the white man Will the white man have war or peace A deep murmur of assent followed this speech of Mionvu from his people and disapprobation blended with a certain uneasiness from my men When about replying the words of General Sherman which I heard him utter to the chiefs of the Arapahoes and Cheyennes at North Platte in eighteen sixty seven came to my mind and something of their spirit I embodied in my reply to Mionvu Mutware of Kimenyi Mionvu the great Mutware asks me if I have come for war When did Mionvu ever hear of white men warring against black men Mionvu must understand that the white men are different from the black White men do not leave their country to fight the black people neither do they come here to buy ivory or slaves They come to make friends with black people they come to search for rivers and lakes and mountains they come to discover what countries what peoples what rivers what lakes what forests what plains what mountains and hills are in your country to know the different animals that are in the land of the black people that when they go back they may tell the white kings and men and children what they have seen and heard in the land so far from them The white people are different from the Arabs and Wangwana the white people know everything and are very strong When they fight the Arabs and the Wangwana run away We have great guns which thunder and when they shoot the earth trembles we have guns which carry bullets further than you can see even with these little things pointing to my revolvers I could kill ten men quicker than you could count We are stronger than the Wahha Mionvu has spoken the truth yet we do not wish to fight I could kill Mionvu now yet I talk to him as to a friend I wish to be a friend to Mionvu and to all black people Will Mionvu say what I can do for him As these words were translated to him imperfectly I suppose but still intelligibly the face of the Wahha showed how well they appreciated them Once or twice I thought I detected something like fear but my assertions that I desired peace and friendship with them soon obliterated all such feelings Mionvu replied The white man tells me he is friendly Why does he not come to our village Why does he stop on the road The sun is hot Mionvu will not speak here any more If the white man is a friend he will come to the village We must stop now It is noon You have broken our march We will go and camp in your village I said at the same time rising and pointing to the men to take up their loads We were compelled to camp there was no help for it the messengers had not returned from Kawanga Having arrived in his village Mionvu had cast himself at full length under the scanty shade afforded by a few trees within the boma About two P M the messengers returned saying it was true the chief of Kawanga had taken ten cloths not however for the King of Uhha but for himself Mionvu who evidently was keen witted and knew perfectly what he was about now roused himself and began to make miniature faggots of thin canes ten in each faggot and shortly he presented ten of these small bundles which together contained one hundred to me saying each stick represented a cloth and the amount of the honga required by the King of Uhha was ONE HUNDRED CLOTHS nearly two bales Recovering from our astonishment which was almost indescribable we offered TEN Ten to the King of Uhha Impossible You do not stir from Lukomo until you pay us one hundred exclaimed Mionvu in a significant manner I returned no answer but went to my hut which Mionvu had cleared for my use and Bombay Asmani Mabruki and Chowpereh were invited to come to me for consultation Upon my asking them if we could not fight our way through Uhha they became terror stricken and Bombay in imploring accents asked me to think well what I was about to do because it was useless to enter on a war with the Wahha Uhha is all a plain country we cannot hide anywhere Every village will rise all about us and how can forty five men fight thousands of people They would kill us all in a few minutes and how would you ever reach Ujiji if you died Think of it my dear master and do not throw your life away for a few rags of cloth Well but Bombay this is robbery Shall we submit to be robbed Shall we give this fellow everything he asks He might as well ask me for all the cloth and all my guns without letting him see that we can fight I can kill Mionvu and his principal men myself and you can slay all those howlers out there without much trouble If Mionvu and his principal were dead we should not be troubled much and we could strike south to the Mala garazi and go west to Ujiji No no dear master don t think of it for a moment If we went neat the Malagarazi we should come across Lokanda Mira Well then we will go north Up that way Uhha extends far and beyond Uhha are the Watuta Well then say what we shall do We must do something but we must not be robbed Pay Mionvu what he asks and let us go away from here This is the last place we shall have to pay And in four days we shall be in Ujiji Did Mionvu tell you that this is the last time we would have to pay He did indeed What do you say Asmani Shall we fight or pay Asmani s face wore the usual smile but he replied I am afraid we must pay This is positively the last time And you Chowpereh Pay bana it is better to get along quietly in this country If we were strong enough they would pay us Ah if we had only two hundred guns how these Wahha would run What do you say Mabruki Ah master dear master it is very hard and these people are great robbers I would like to chop their heads off all so I would But you had better pay This is the last time and what are one hundred cloths to you Well then Bombay and Asmani go to Mionvu and offer him twenty If he will not take twenty give him thirty If he refuses thirty give him forty then go up to eighty slowly Make plenty of talk not one doti more I swear to you I will shoot Mionvu if he demands more than eighty Go and remember to be wise I will cut the matter short At nine P M sixty four doti were handed over to Mionvu for the King of Uhha six doti for himself and five doti for his sub altogether seventy five doti a bale and a quarter No sooner had we paid than they began to fight amongst themselves over the booty and I was in hopes that the factions would proceed to battle that I might have good excuse for leaving them and plunging south to the jungle that I believed existed there by which means under its friendly cover we might strike west But no it was only a verbose war which portended nothing more than a noisy clamor November sixth At dawn we were on the road very silent and sad Our stock of cloth was much diminished we had nine bales left sufficient to have taken us to the Atlantic Ocean aided by the beads which were yet untouched if we practised economy If I met many more like Mionvu I had not enough to take me to Ujiji and though we were said to be so near Livingstone seemed to me to be just as far as ever We crossed the Pombwe and then struck across a slowly undulating plain rising gradually to mountains on our right and on our left sinking towards the valley of the Malagarazi which river was about twenty miles away Villages rose to our view everywhere Food was cheap milk was plentiful and the butter good After a four hours march we crossed the Kanengi River and entered the boma of Kahirigi inhabited by several Watusi and Wahha Here we were told lived the King of Uhha s brother This announcement was anything but welcome and I began to suspect I had fallen into another hornets nest We had not rested two hours before two Wangwana entered my tent who were slaves of Thani bin Abdullah our dandified friend of Unyanyembe These men came on the part of the king s brother to claim the HONGA The king s brother demanded thirty doti Half a bale Merciful Providence What shall I do We had been told by Mionvu that the honga of Uhha was settled and now here is another demand from the King s brother It is the second time the lie has been told and we have twice been deceived We shall be deceived no more These two men informed us there were five more chiefs living but two hours from each other who would exact tribute or black mail like those we had seen Knowing this much I felt a certain calm It was far better to know the worst at once Five more chiefs with their demands would assuredly ruin us In view of which what is to be done How am I to reach Livingstone without being beggared Dismissing the men I called Bombay and told him to assist Asmani in settling the honga as cheaply as possible I then lit my pipe put on the cap of consideration and began to think Within half an hour I had made a plan which was to be attempted to be put in execution that very night I summoned the two slaves of Thani bin Abdullah after the honga had been settled to everybody s satisfaction though the profoundest casuistries and diplomatic arguments failed to reduce it lower than twenty six doti and began asking them about the possibility of evading the tribute taking Wahha ahead This rather astonished them at first and they declared it to be impossible but finally after being pressed they replied that one of their number should guide us at midnight or a little after into the jungle which grew on the frontiers of Uhha and Uvinza By keeping a direct west course through this jungle until we came to Ukaranga we might be enabled we were told to travel through Uhha without further trouble If I were willing to pay the guide twelve doti and if I were able to impose silence on my people while passing through the sleeping village the guide was positive I could reach Ujiji without paying another doti It is needless to add that I accepted the proffered assistance at such a price with joy But there was much to be done Provisions were to be purchased sufficient to last four days for the tramp through the jungle and men were at once sent with cloth to purchase grain at any price Fortune favoured us for before eight P M we had enough for six days November seventh I did not go to sleep at all last night but a little after midnight as the moon was beginning to show itself by gangs of four the men stole quietly out of the village and by three A M the entire Expedition was outside the boma and not the slightest alarm had been made After a signal to the new guide the Expedition began to move in a southern direction along the right bank of the Kanengi River After an hour s march in this direction we struck west across the grassy plain and maintained it despite the obstacles we encountered which were sore enough to naked men The bright moon lighted our path dark clouds now and then cast immense long shadows over the deserted and silent plains and the moonbeans were almost obscured and at such times our position seemed awful Till the moon Rising in clouded majesty at length Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light And o er the dark her silver mantle threw Bravely toiled the men without murmur though their legs were bleeding from the cruel grass Ambrosial morn at last appeared with all its beautiful and lovely features Heaven was born anew to us with comforting omens and cheery promise The men though fatigued at the unusual travel sped forward with quicker pace as daylight broke until at eight A M we sighted the swift Rusugi River when a halt was ordered in a clump of jungle near it for breakfast and rest Both banks of the river were alive with buffalo eland and antelope but though the sight was very tempting we did not fire because we dared not The report of a gun would have alarmed the whole country I preferred my coffee and the contentment which my mind experienced at our success An hour after we had rested some natives carrying salt from the Malagarazi were seen coming up the right bank of the river When abreast of our hiding place they detected us and dropping their salt bags they took to their heels at once shouting out as they ran to alarm some villages that appeared about four miles north of us The men were immediately ordered to take up their loads and in a few minutes we had crossed the Rusugi and were making direct for a bamboo jungle that appeared in our front On on we kept steadily until at one P M we sighted the little lake of Musunya as wearied as possible with our nine hours march Lake Musunya is one of the many circular basins found in this part of Uhha There was quite a group of them The more correct term of these lakes would be immense pools In the Masika season Lake Musunya must extend to three or four miles in length by two in breadth It swarms with hippopotami and its shores abound with noble game We were very quiet as may be imagined in our bivouac neither tent nor hut was raised nor was fire kindled so that in case of pursuit we could move off without delay I kept my Winchester rifle the gift of my friend mister Morris and a rare gift it was for such a crisis with its magazine full and two hundred cartridges in a bag slung over my shoulders Each soldier s gun was also ready and loaded and we retired to sleep our fatigues off with a feeling of perfect security November eighth Long before dawn appeared we were on the march and as daylight broke we emerged from the bamboo jungle and struck across the naked plain of Uhha once more passing several large pools by the way far embracing prospects of undulating country with here and there a characteristic clump of trees relieving the general nudity of the whole Hour after hour we toiled on across the rolling land waves the sun shining with all its wonted African fervor but with its heat slightly tempered by the welcome breezes which came laden with the fragrance of young grass and perfume of strange flowers of various hues that flecked the otherwise pale green sheet which extended so far around us We arrived at the Rugufu River not the Ukawendi Rugufu but the northern stream of that name a tributary of the Malagarazi It was a broad shallow stream and sluggish with an almost imperceptible flow south west While we halted in the deep shade afforded by a dense clump of jungle close to the right bank resting awhile before continuing our journey I distinctly heard a sound as of distant thunder in the west Upon asking if it were thunder I was told it was Kabogo Kabogo what is that It is a great mountain on the other side of the Tanganika full of deep holes into which the water rolls and when there is wind on the Tanganika there is a sound like mvuha thunder Many boats have been lost there and it is a custom with Arabs and natives to throw cloth Merikani and Kaniki and especially white Merikani beads to appease the mulungu god of the lake Those who throw beads generally get past without trouble but those who do not throw beads into the lake get lost and are drowned Oh it is a dreadful place This story was told me by the ever smiling guide Asmani and was corroborated by other former mariners of the lake whom I had with me At the least this place where we halted for dinner on the banks of the Rugufu River is eighteen and a half hours or forty six miles from Ujiji and as Kabogo is said to be near Uguhha it must be over sixty miles from Ujiji therefore the sound of the thundering surf which is said to roll into the caves of Kabogo was heard by us at a distance of over one hundred miles away from them Continuing our journey for three hours longer through thin forests over extensive beds of primitive rock among fields of large boulders thickly strewn about passing by numerous herds of buffalo giraffe and zebra over a quaking quagmire which resembled peat we arrived at the small stream of Sunuzzi to a camping place only a mile removed from a large settlement of Wahha But we were buried in the depths of a great forest no road was in the vicinity no noise was made deep silence was preserved nor were fires lit We might therefore rest tranquilly secure certain that we should not be disturbed To morrow morning the kirangozi has promised we shall be out of Uhha and if we travel on to Niamtaga in Ukaranga the same day the next day would see us in Ujiji Patience my soul A few hours more then the end of all this will be known I shall be face to face with that white man with the white hairs on his face whoever he is November ninth Two hours before dawn we left our camp on the Sunuzzi River and struck through the forest in a north by west direction having muzzled our goats previously lest by their bleating they might betray us This was a mistake which might have ended tragically for just as the eastern sky began to assume a pale greyish tint we emerged from the jungle on the high road The guide thought we had passed Uhha and set up a shout which was echoed by every member of the caravan and marched onward with new vigor and increased energy when plump we came to the outskirts of a village the inhabitants of which were beginning to stir Silence was called for at once and the Expedition halted immediately I walked forward to the front to advise with the guide He did not know what to do There was no time to consider so I ordered the goats to be slaughtered and left on the road and the guide to push on boldly through the village The chickens also had their throats cut after which the Expedition resumed the march quickly and silently led by the guide who had orders to plunge into the jungle south of the road I stayed until the last man had disappeared then after preparing my Winchester brought up the rear followed by my gunbearers with their stock of ammunition As we were about disappearing beyond the last hut a man darted out of his hut and uttered an exclamation of alarm and loud voices were heard as if in dispute But in a short time we were in the depths of the jungle hurrying away from the road in a southern direction and edging slightly westward Once I thought we were pursued and I halted behind a tree to check our foes if they persisted in following us but a few minutes proved to me that we were not pursued After half an hour s march we again turned our faces westward It was broad daylight now and our eyes were delighted with most picturesque and sequestered little valleys where wild fruit trees grew and rare flowers blossomed and tiny brooks tumbled over polished pebbles where all was bright and beautiful until finally wading through one pretty pure streamlet whose soft murmurs we took for a gentle welcome we passed the boundary of wicked Uhha and had entered Ukaranga an event that was hailed with extravagant shouts of joy Presently we found the smooth road and we trod gaily with elastic steps with limbs quickened for the march which we all knew to be drawing near its end What cared we now for the difficulties we had encountered for the rough and cruel forests for the thorny thickets and hurtful grass for the jangle of all savagedom of which we had been the joyless audience To morrow Ay the great day draws nigh and we may well laugh and sing while in this triumphant mood We have been sorely tried we have been angry with each other when vexed by troubles but we forget all these now and there is no face but is radiant with the happiness we have all deserved We made a short halt at noon for rest and refreshment I was shown the hills from which the Tanganika could be seen which bounded the valley of the Liuche on the east I could not contain myself at the sight of them Even with this short halt I was restless and unsatisfied We resumed the march again I spurred my men forward with the promise that to morrow should see their reward We were in sight of the villages of the Wakaranga the people caught sight of us and manifested considerable excitement I sent men ahead to reassure them and they came forward to greet us This was so new and welcome to us so different from the turbulent Wavinza and the black mailers of Uhha that we were melted But we had no time to loiter by the way to indulge our joy I was impelled onward by my almost uncontrollable feelings I wished to resolve my doubts and fears Was HE still there Had HE heard of my coming Would HE fly How beautiful Ukaranga appears The green hills are crowned by clusters of straw thatched cones The hills rise and fall here denuded and cultivated there in pasturage here timbered yonder swarming with huts The country has somewhat the aspect of Maryland We cross the Mkuti a glorious little river We ascend the opposite bank and stride through the forest like men who have done a deed of which they may be proud We have already travelled nine hours and the sun is sinking rapidly towards the west yet apparently we are not fatigued We reach the outskirts of Niamtaga and we hear drums beat The people are flying into the woods they desert their villages for they take us to be Ruga Ruga the forest thieves of Mirambo who after conquering the Arabs of Unyanyembe are coming to fight the Arabs of Ujiji Even the King flies from his village and every man woman and child terror stricken follows him We enter into it and quietly take possession Finally the word is bruited about that we are Wangwana from Unyanyembe Well then is Mirambo dead they ask No we answer Well how did you come to Ukaranga By way of Ukonongo Ukawendi and Uhha Oh hi le Then they laugh heartily at their fright and begin to make excuses The King is introduced to me and he says he had only gone to the woods in order to attack us again he meant to have come back and killed us all if we had been Ruga Ruga But then we know the poor King was terribly frightened and would never have dared to return had we been RugaRuga not he We are not however in a mood to quarrel with him about an idiomatic phrase peculiar to him but rather take him by the hand and shake it well and say we are so very glad to see him And he shares in our pleasure and immediately three of the fattest sheep pots of beer flour and honey are brought to us as a gift and I make him happier still with two of the finest cloths I have in my bales and thus a friendly pact is entered into between us While I write my Diary of this day s proceedings I tell my servant to lay out my new flannel suit to oil my boots to chalk my helmet and fold a new puggaree around it that I may make as presentable an appearance as possible before the white man with the grey beard and before the Arabs of Ujiji for the clothes I have worn through jungle and forest are in tatters Good night only let one day come again and we shall see what we shall see November tenth Friday The two hundred and thirty sixth day from Bagamoyo on the Sea and the fifty first day from Unyanyembe General direction to Ujiji west by south Time of march six hours It is a happy glorious morning The air is fresh and cool The sky lovingly smiles on the earth and her children The deep woods are crowned in bright vernal leafage the water of the Mkuti rushing under the emerald shade afforded by the bearded banks seems to challenge us for the race to Ujiji with its continuous brawl We are all outside the village cane fence every man of us looking as spruce as neat and happy as when we embarked on the dhows at Zanzibar which seems to us to have been ages ago we have witnessed and experienced so much Forward Ay Wallah ay Wallah bana yango and the lighthearted braves stride away at a rate which must soon bring us within view of Ujiji We ascend a hill overgrown with bamboo descend into a ravine through which dashes an impetuous little torrent ascend another short hill then along a smooth footpath running across the slope of a long ridge we push on as only eager lighthearted men can do In two hours I am warned to prepare for a view of the Tanganika for from the top of a steep mountain the kirangozi says I can see it I almost vent the feeling of my heart in cries But wait we must behold it first And we press forward and up the hill breathlessly lest the grand scene hasten away We are at last on the summit Ah not yet can it be seen A little further on just yonder oh there it is a silvery gleam I merely catch sight of it between the trees and but here it is at last True THE TANGANIKA and there are the blue black mountains of Ugoma and Ukaramba An immense broad sheet a burnished bed of silver lucid canopy of blue above lofty mountains are its valances palm forests form its fringes The Tanganika Hurrah and the men respond to the exultant cry of the Anglo Saxon with the lungs of Stentors and the great forests and the hills seem to share in our triumph Was this the place where Burton and Speke stood Bombay when they saw the lake first I don t remember master it was somewhere about here I think Poor fellows The one was half paralyzed the other half blind said Sir Roderick Murchison when he described Burton and Spoke s arrival in view of the Tanganika And I Well I am so happy that were I quite paralyzed and blinded I think that at this supreme moment I could take up my bed and walk and all blindness would cease at once Fortunately however I am quite well I have not suffered a day s sickness since the day I left Unyanyembe How much would Shaw be willing to give to be in my place now Who is happiest he revelling in the luxuries of Unyanyembe or I standing on the summit of this mountain looking down with glad eyes and proud heart on the Tanganika We are descending the western slope of the mountain with the valley of the Liuche before us Something like an hour before noon we have gained the thick matete brake which grows on both banks of the river we wade through the clear stream arrive on the other side emerge out of the brake and the gardens of the Wajiji are around us a perfect marvel of vegetable wealth Details escape my hasty and partial observation I am almost overpowered with my own emotions I notice the graceful palms neat plots green with vegetable plants and small villages surrounded with frail fences of the matete cane We push on rapidly lest the news of our coming might reach the people of Ujiji before we come in sight and are ready for them We halt at a little brook then ascend the long slope of a naked ridge the very last of the myriads we have crossed This alone prevents us from seeing the lake in all its vastness We arrive at the summit travel across and arrive at its western rim and pause reader the port of Ujiji is below us embowered in the palms only five hundred yards from us At this grand moment we do not think of the hundreds of miles we have marched or of the hundreds of hills that we have ascended and descended or of the many forests we have traversed or of the jungles and thickets that annoyed us or of the fervid salt plains that blistered our feet or of the hot suns that scorched us nor of the dangers and difficulties now happily surmounted At last the sublime hour has arrived our dreams our hopes and anticipations are now about to be realised Our hearts and our feelings are with our eyes as we peer into the palms and try to make out in which hut or house lives the white man with the grey beard we heard about when we were at the Malagarazi Unfurl the flags and load your guns We will master we will master respond the men eagerly One two three fire A volley from nearly fifty guns roars like a salute from a battery of artillery we shall note its effect presently on the peaceful looking village below Now kirangozi hold the white man s flag up high and let the Zanzibar flag bring up the rear And you men keep close together and keep firing until we halt in the market place or before the white man s house You have said to me often that you could smell the fish of the Tanganika I can smell the fish of the Tanganika now There are fish and beer and a long rest waiting for you MARCH Before we had gone a hundred yards our repeated volleys had the effect desired We had awakened Ujiji to the knowledge that a caravan was coming and the people were witnessed rushing up in hundreds to meet us The mere sight of the flags informed every one immediately that we were a caravan but the American flag borne aloft by gigantic Asmani whose face was one vast smile on this day rather staggered them at first However many of the people who now approached us remembered the flag They had seen it float above the American Consulate and from the mast head of many a ship in the harbor of Zanzibar and they were soon heard welcoming the beautiful flag with cries of Bindera Kisungu a white man s flag Bindera Merikani the American flag Then we were surrounded by them by Wajiji Wanyamwezi Wangwana Warundi Waguhha Wamanyuema and Arabs and were almost deafened with the shouts of Yambo yambo bana Yambo bana Yambo bana To all and each of my men the welcome was given We were now about three hundred yards from the village of Ujiji and the crowds are dense about me Suddenly I hear a voice on my right say Good morning sir Startled at hearing this greeting in the midst of such a crowd of black people I turn sharply around in search of the man and see him at my side with the blackest of faces but animated and joyous a man dressed in a long white shirt with a turban of American sheeting around his woolly head and I ask Who the mischief are you I am Susi the servant of doctor Livingstone said be smiling and showing a gleaming row of teeth What Is doctor Livingstone here Yes sir In this village Yes sir Are you sure Sure sure sir Why I leave him just now Good morning sir said another voice Hallo said I is this another one Yes sir Well what is your name My name is Chumah sir What are you Chumah the friend of Wekotani Yes sir And is the Doctor well Not very well sir Where has he been so long In Manyuema Now you Susi run and tell the Doctor I am coming Yes sir and off he darted like a madman But by this time we were within two hundred yards of the village and the multitude was getting denser and almost preventing our march Flags and streamers were out Arabs and Wangwana were pushing their way through the natives in order to greet us for according to their account we belonged to them But the great wonder of all was How did you come from Unyanyembe Soon Susi came running back and asked me my name he had told the Doctor I was coming but the Doctor was too surprised to believe him and when the Doctor asked him my name Susi was rather staggered But during Susi s absence the news had been conveyed to the Doctor that it was surely a white man that was coming whose guns were firing and whose flag could be seen and the great Arab magnates of Ujiji Mohammed bin Sali Sayd bin Majid Abid bin Suliman Mohammed bin Gharib and others had gathered together before the Doctor s house and the Doctor had come out from his veranda to discuss the matter and await my arrival In the meantime the head of the Expedition had halted and the kirangozi was out of the ranks holding his flag aloft and Selim said to me I see the Doctor sir Oh what an old man He has got a white beard And I what would I not have given for a bit of friendly wilderness where unseen I might vent my joy in some mad freak such as idiotically biting my hand turning a somersault or slashing at trees in order to allay those exciting feelings that were well nigh uncontrollable My heart beats fast but I must not let my face betray my emotions lest it shall detract from the dignity of a white man appearing under such extraordinary circumstances So I did that which I thought was most dignified I pushed back the crowds and passing from the rear walked down a living avenue of people until I came in front of the semicircle of Arabs before which stood the white man with the grey beard As I advanced slowly towards him I noticed he was pale that he looked wearied and wan that he had grey whiskers and moustache that he wore a bluish cloth cap with a faded gold band on a red ground round it and that he had on a red sleeved waistcoat and a pair of grey tweed trousers I would have run to him only I was a coward in the presence of such a mob would have embraced him but that I did not know how he would receive me so I did what moral cowardice and false pride suggested was the best thing walked deliberately to him took off my hat and said doctor LIVINGSTONE I PRESUME Yes said he with a kind cordial smile lifting his cap slightly I replaced my hat on my head and he replaced his cap and we both grasped hands I then said aloud I thank God Doctor I have been permitted to see you He answered I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you I turned to the Arabs took off my hat to them in response to the saluting chorus of Yambos I received and the Doctor introduced them to me by name Then oblivious of the crowds oblivious of the men who shared with me my dangers we Livingstone and I turned our faces towards his house He pointed to the veranda or rather mud platform under the broad overhanging eaves he pointed to his own particular seat which I saw his age and experience in Africa had suggested namely a straw mat with a goatskin over it and another skin nailed against the wall to protect his back from contact with the cold mud I protested against taking this seat which so much more befitted him than I but the Doctor would not yield I must take it We were seated the Doctor and I with our backs to the wall The Arabs took seats on our left More than a thousand natives were in our front filling the whole square densely indulging their curiosity and discussing the fact of two white men meeting at Ujiji one just come from Manyuema in the west the other from Unyanyembe in the east Conversation began What about I declare I have forgotten Oh we mutually asked questions of one another such as How did you come here and Where have you been all this long time the world has believed you to be dead Yes that was the way it began but whatever the Doctor informed me and that which I communicated to him I cannot correctly report for I found myself gazing at him conning the wonderful figure and face of the man at whose side I now sat in Central Africa Every hair of his head and beard every wrinkle of his face the wanness of his features and the slightly wearied look he wore were all imparting intelligence to me the knowledge I craved for so much ever since I heard the words Take what you want but find Livingstone What I saw was deeply interesting intelligence to me and unvarnished truth I was listening and reading at the same time What did these dumb witnesses relate to me Oh reader had you been at my side on this day in Ujiji how eloquently could be told the nature of this man s work Had you been there but to see and hear His lips gave me the details lips that never lie I cannot repeat what he said I was too much engrossed to take my note book out and begin to stenograph his story He had so much to say that he began at the end seemingly oblivious of the fact that five or six years had to be accounted for But his account was oozing out it was growing fast into grand proportions into a most marvellous history of deeds The Arabs rose up with a delicacy I approved as if they intuitively knew that we ought to be left to ourselves I sent Bombay with them to give them the news they also wanted so much to know about the affairs at Unyanyembe Sayd bin Majid was the father of the gallant young man whom I saw at Masangi and who fought with me at Zimbizo and who soon afterwards was killed by Mirambo s Ruga Ruga in the forest of Wilyankuru and knowing that I had been there he earnestly desired to hear the tale of the fight but they had all friends at Unyanyembe and it was but natural that they should be anxious to hear of what concerned them After giving orders to Bombay and Asmani for the provisioning of the men of the Expedition I called Kaif Halek or How do ye do and introduced him to doctor Livingstone as one of the soldiers in charge of certain goods left at Unyanyembe whom I had compelled to accompany me to Ujiji that he might deliver in person to his master the letter bag with which he had been entrusted This was that famous letter bag marked Nov first eighteen seventy which was now delivered into the Doctor s hands three hundred sixty five days after it left Zanzibar How long I wonder had it remained at Unyanyembe had I not been despatched into Central Africa in search of the great traveller The Doctor kept the letter bag on his knee then presently opened it looked at the letters contained there and read one or two of his children s letters his face in the meanwhile lighting up He asked me to tell him the news No Doctor said I read your letters first which I am sure you must be impatient to read Ah said he I have waited years for letters and I have been taught patience I can surely afford to wait a few hours longer No tell me the general news how is the world getting along You probably know much already Do you know that the Suez Canal is a fact is opened and a regular trade carried on between Europe and India through it I did not hear about the opening of it Well that is grand news What else Shortly I found myself enacting the part of an annual periodical to him There was no need of exaggeration of any penny a line news or of any sensationalism The world had witnessed and experienced much the last few years The Pacific Railroad had been completed eighteen sixty nine Grant had been elected President of the United States Egypt had been flooded with savans the Cretan rebellion had terminated eighteen sixty six eighteen sixty eight a Spanish revolution had driven Isabella from the throne of Spain and a Regent had been appointed General Prim was assassinated a Castelar had electrified Europe with his advanced ideas upon the liberty of worship Prussia had humbled Denmark and annexed Schleswig Holstein eighteen sixty four and her armies were now around Paris the Man of Destiny was a prisoner at Wilhelmshohe the Queen of Fashion and the Empress of the French was a fugitive and the child born in the purple had lost for ever the Imperial crown intended for his head the Napoleon dynasty was extinguished by the Prussians Bismarck and Von Moltke and France the proud empire was humbled to the dust What could a man have exaggerated of these facts What a budget of news it was to one who had emerged from the depths of the primeval forests of Manyuema The reflection of the dazzling light of civilisation was cast on him while Livingstone was thus listening in wonder to one of the most exciting pages of history ever repeated How the puny deeds of barbarism paled before these Who could tell under what new phases of uneasy life Europe was labouring even then while we two of her lonely children rehearsed the tale of her late woes and glories More worthily perhaps had the tongue of a lyric Demodocus recounted them but in the absence of the poet the newspaper correspondent performed his part as well and truthfully as he could Not long after the Arabs had departed a dishful of hot hashed meat cakes was sent to us by Sayd bin Majid and a curried chicken was received from Mohammed bin Sali and Moeni Kheri sent a dishful of stewed goat meat and rice and thus presents of food came in succession and as fast as they were brought we set to I had a healthy stubborn digestion the exercise I had taken had put it in prime order but Livingstone he had been complaining that he had no appetite that his stomach refused everything but a cup of tea now and then he ate also ate like a vigorous hungry man and as he vied with me in demolishing the pancakes he kept repeating You have brought me new life You have brought me new life Oh by George I said I have forgotten something Hasten Selim and bring that bottle you know which and bring me the silver goblets I brought this bottle on purpose for this event which I hoped would come to pass though often it seemed useless to expect it Selim knew where the bottle was and he soon returned with it a bottle of Sillery champagne and handing the Doctor a silver goblet brimful of the exhilarating wine and pouring a small quantity into my own I said doctor Livingstone to your very good health sir And to yours he responded smilingly And the champagne I had treasured for this happy meeting was drunk with hearty good wishes to each other But we kept on talking and talking and prepared food was being brought to us all that afternoon and we kept on eating each time it was brought until I had eaten even to repletion and the Doctor was obliged to confess that he had eaten enough Still Halimah the female cook of the Doctor s establishment was in a state of the greatest excitement She had been protruding her head out of the cookhouse to make sure that there were really two white men sitting down in the veranda when there used to be only one who would not because he could not eat anything and she had been considerably exercised in her mind about this fact She was afraid the Doctor did not properly appreciate her culinary abilities but now she was amazed at the extraordinary quantity of food eaten and she was in a state of delightful excitement We could hear her tongue rolling off a tremendous volume of clatter to the wondering crowds who halted before the kitchen to hear the current of news with which she edified them Poor faithful soul While we listened to the noise of her furious gossip the Doctor related her faithful services and the terrible anxiety she evinced when the guns first announced the arrival of another white man in Ujiji how she had been flying about in a state cf the utmost excitement from the kitchen into his presence and out again into the square asking all sorts of questions how she was in despair at the scantiness of the general larder and treasury of the strange household how she was anxious to make up for their poverty by a grand appearance to make up a sort of Barmecide feast to welcome the white man Why said she is he not one of us Does he not bring plenty of cloth and beads Talk about the Arabs Who are they that they should be compared to white men Arabs indeed The Doctor and I conversed upon many things especially upon his own immediate troubles and his disappointments upon his arrival in Ujiji when told that all his goods had been sold and he was reduced to poverty He had but twenty cloths or so left of the stock he had deposited with the man called Sherif the half caste drunken tailor who was sent by the Consul in charge of the goods Besides which he had been suffering from an attack of dysentery and his condition was most deplorable He was but little improved on this day though he had eaten well and already began to feel stronger and better This day like all others though big with happiness to me at last was fading away While sitting with our faces looking to the east as Livingstone had been sitting for days preceding my arrival we noted the dark shadows which crept up above the grove of palms beyond the village and above the rampart of mountains which we had crossed that day now looming through the fast approaching darkness and we listened with our hearts full of gratitude to the Great Giver of Good and Dispenser of all Happiness to the sonorous thunder of the surf of the Tanganika and to the chorus which the night insects sang Hours passed and we were still sitting there with our minds busy upon the day s remarkable events when I remembered that the traveller had not yet read his letters Doctor I said you had better read your letters I will not keep you up any longer Yes he answered it is getting late and I will go and read my friends letters Good night and God bless you Good night my dear Doctor and let me hope that your news will be such as you desire I have now related by means of my Diary How I found Livingstone as recorded on the evening of that great day I have been averse to reduce it by process of excision and suppression into a mere cold narrative because by so doing I would be unable to record what feelings swayed each member of the Expedition as well as myself during the days preceding the discovery of the lost traveller and more especially the day it was the good fortune of both Livingstone and myself to clasp each other s hands in the strong friendship which was born in that hour we thus strangely met The aged traveller though cruelly belied contrary to all previous expectation received me as a friend and the cordial warmth with which he accepted my greeting the courtesy with which he tendered to me a shelter in his own house the simple candour of his conversation graced by unusual modesty of manner and meekness of spirit wrought in me such a violent reaction in his favor that when the parting good night was uttered I felt a momentary vague fear lest the fulness of joy which I experienced that evening would be diminished by some envious fate before the morrow s sun should rise above Ujiji CHAPTER XII INTERCOURSE WITH LIVINGSTONE AT UJIJI 
1828-141203-0000	train-other-500	LIVINGSTONE S OWN STORY OF HIS JOURNEYS HIS TROUBLES AND DISAPPOINTMENTS If there is love between us inconceivably delicious and profitable will our intercourse be
1828-141203-0001	train-other-500	if not your time is lost and you will only annoy me I shall seem to you stupid and the reputation I have false All my good is magnetic and I educate not by lessons
1828-141203-0002	train-other-500	but by going about my business
1828-141203-0003	train-other-500	Emerson s Representative Men I woke up early next morning with a sudden start The room was strange It was a house and not my tent Ah yes I recollected
1828-141203-0004	train-other-500	I had discovered Livingstone and I was in his house I listened that the knowledge dawning on me might be confirmed by the sound of his voice I heard nothing but the sullen roar of the surf
1828-141203-0005	train-other-500	I lay quietly in bed Bed Yes it was a primitive four poster with the leaves of the palm tree spread upon it instead of down
none	none	 and horsehair and my bearskin spread over this 
1828-141203-0006	train-other-500	serving me in place of linen I began to put myself under rigid mental cross examination and to an analyzation of my position What was I sent for To find Livingstone
1828-141203-0007	train-other-500	Have you found him Yes of course am I not in his house Whose compass is that hanging on a peg there Whose clothes whose boots are those Who reads those newspapers those Saturday Reviews
1828-141203-0008	train-other-500	and numbers of Punch lying on the floor Well
none	none	 what are you going to do now 
1828-141203-0009	train-other-500	I shall tell him this morning who sent me and what brought me here I will then ask him to write a letter to mister Bennett and to give what news he can spare I did not come here to rob him of his news
1828-141203-0010	train-other-500	Sufficient for me is it that I have found him It is a complete success so far But it will be a greater one if he gives me letters for mister Bennett and an acknowledgment that he has seen me Do you think he will do so
1828-141203-0011	train-other-500	Why not I have come here to do him a service He has no goods I have He has no men with him I have If I do a friendly part by him
1828-141203-0012	train-other-500	will he not do a friendly part by me What says the poet Nor hope to find A friend but who has found a friend in thee All like the purchase few the price will pay
1828-141203-0013	train-other-500	And this makes friends such wonders here below I have paid the purchase by coming so far to do him a service But I think from what I have seen of him last night that he is not such a niggard and misanthrope
1828-141203-0014	train-other-500	as I was led to believe He exhibited considerable emotion despite the monosyllabic greeting when he shook my hand If he were a man to feel annoyance at any person coming after him he would not have received me as he did
1828-141203-0015	train-other-500	nor would he ask me to live with him but he would have surlily refused to see me and told me to mind my own business Neither does he mind my nationality for here said he
1828-141203-0016	train-other-500	Americans and Englishmen are the same people We speak the same language and have the same ideas Just so Doctor I agree with you Here at least Americans and Englishmen shall be brothers and whatever I can do for you
1828-141203-0017	train-other-500	you may command me freely I dressed myself quietly intending to take a stroll along the Tanganika before the Doctor should rise opened the door which creaked horribly on its hinges
1828-141203-0018	train-other-500	and walked out to the veranda Halloa Doctor you up already I hope you have slept well Good morning mister Stanley
none	none	 I am glad to see you 
1828-141203-0019	train-other-500	I hope you rested well I sat up late reading my letters You have brought me good and bad news But sit down He made a place for me by his side Yes many of my friends are dead
1828-141203-0020	train-other-500	My eldest son has met with a sad accident that is my boy Tom my second son Oswell is at college studying medicine and is doing well I am told Agnes my eldest daughter
1828-141203-0021	train-other-500	has been enjoying herself in a yacht with Sir Paraffine Young and his family Sir Roderick also is well and expresses a hope that he will soon see me You have brought me quite a budget
1828-141203-0022	train-other-500	The man was not an apparition then and yesterday s scenes were not the result of a dream and I gazed on him intently for thus I was assured he had not run away
1828-141203-0023	train-other-500	which was the great fear that constantly haunted me as I was journeying to Ujiji Now Doctor said I you are probably wondering why I came here
none	none	 It is true said he I have been wondering 
1828-141203-0024	train-other-500	I thought you at first an emissary of the French Government
none	none	 in the place of Lieutenant Le Saint 
1828-141203-0025	train-other-500	who died a few miles above Gondokoro I heard you had boats plenty of men and stores and I really believed you were some French officer until I saw the American flag and to tell you the truth
1828-141203-0026	train-other-500	I was rather glad it was so because I could not have talked to him in French and if he did not know English we had been a pretty pair of white men in Ujiji
none	none	 I did not like to ask you yesterday 
1828-141203-0027	train-other-500	because I thought it was none of my business Well said I laughing for your sake I am glad that I am an American and not a Frenchman and that we can understand each other perfectly without an interpreter
1828-141203-0028	train-other-500	I see that the Arabs are wondering that you an Englishman and I an American understand each other We must take care not to tell them that the English and Americans have fought
1828-141203-0029	train-other-500	and that there are Alabama claims left unsettled and that we have such people as Fenians in America who hate you But seriously Doctor now don t be frightened when I tell you that I have come after YOU
1828-141203-0030	train-other-500	After me Yes How Well You have heard of the New York Herald Oh who has not heard of that newspaper
1828-141203-0031	train-other-500	Without his father s knowledge or consent mister James Gordon Bennett son of mister James Gordon Bennett the proprietor of the Herald has commissioned me to find you to get whatever news of your discoveries you like to give and to assist you
1828-141203-0032	train-other-500	if I can with means Young mister Bennett told you to come after me to find me out and help me It is no wonder then you praised mister Bennett so much last night I know him I am proud to say
1828-141203-0033	train-other-500	to be just what I say he is He is an ardent generous and true man Well indeed I am very much obliged to him and it makes me feel proud to think that you Americans think so much of me
1828-141203-0034	train-other-500	You have just come in the proper time for I was beginning to think that I should have to beg from the Arabs Even they are in want of cloth and there are but few beads in Ujiji
none	none	 That fellow Sherif has robbed me of all 
1828-141203-0035	train-other-500	I wish I could embody my thanks to mister Bennett in suitable words but if I fail to do so do not I beg of you believe me the less grateful And now Doctor having disposed of this little affair Ferajji
1828-141203-0036	train-other-500	shall bring breakfast if you have no objection You have given me an appetite he said Halimah is my cook
none	none	 but she never can tell the difference between 
1828-141203-0037	train-other-500	tea and coffee Ferajji the cook was ready as usual with excellent tea and a dish of smoking cakes dampers as the Doctor called them
none	none	 I never did care much for this kind of a cake fried in a pan 
1828-141203-0038	train-other-500	but they were necessary to the Doctor who had nearly lost all his teeth from the hard fare of Lunda He had been compelled to subsist on green ears of Indian corn there was no meat in that district
1828-141203-0039	train-other-500	and the effort to gnaw at the corn ears had loosened all his teeth I preferred the corn scones of Virginia which to my mind were the nearest approach to palatable bread obtainable in Central Africa
1828-141203-0040	train-other-500	The Doctor said he had thought me a most luxurious and rich man when he saw my great bath tub carried on the shoulders of one of my men but he thought me still more luxurious this morning when my knives and forks
1828-141203-0041	train-other-500	and plates and cups saucers silver spoons and silver teapot were brought forth shining and bright spread on a rich Persian carpet and observed that I was well attended to by my yellow and ebon Mercuries
1828-141203-0042	train-other-500	This was the beginning of our life at Ujiji I knew him not as a friend before my arrival He was only an object to me a great item for a daily newspaper
1828-141203-0043	train-other-500	as much as other subjects in which the voracious news loving public delight in
none	none	 I had gone over battlefields witnessed revolutions civil wars rebellions emeutes and massacres 
1828-141203-0044	train-other-500	stood close to the condemned murderer to record his last struggles and last sighs but never had I been called to record anything that moved me so much as this man s woes and sufferings
1828-141203-0045	train-other-500	his privations and disappointments which now were poured into my ear Verily did I begin to perceive that the Gods above do with just eyes survey the affairs of men
1828-141203-0046	train-other-500	I began to recognize the hand of an overruling and kindly Providence The following are singular facts worthy for reflection
1828-141203-0047	train-other-500	I was commissioned for the duty of discovering Livingstone sometime in October eighteen sixty nine mister Bennett was ready with the money and I was ready for the journey But observe reader
1828-141203-0048	train-other-500	that I did not proceed directly upon the search mission I had many tasks to fulfil before proceeding with it and many thousand miles to travel over Supposing that I had gone direct to Zanzibar from Paris
1828-141203-0049	train-other-500	seven or eight months afterwards perhaps I should have found myself at Ujiji but Livingstone would not have been found there then he was on the Lualaba
none	none	 and I should have had to follow him on his devious tracks through the primeval forests of Manyuema and up along the crooked course of the Lualaba for hundreds of miles 
1828-141203-0050	train-other-500	The time taken by me in travelling up the Nile back to Jerusalem then to Constantinople Southern Russia the Caucasus and Persia was employed by Livingstone in fruitful discoveries west of the Tanganika Again
none	none	 consider that I arrived at Unyanyembe 
1828-141203-0051	train-other-500	in the latter part of June
none	none	 and that owing to a war I was delayed three months at Unyanyembe 
1828-141203-0052	train-other-500	leading a fretful peevish and impatient life But while I was thus fretting myself and being delayed by a series of accidents Livingstone was being forced back to Ujiji in the same month
1828-141203-0053	train-other-500	It took him from June to October to march to Ujiji Now in September I broke loose from the thraldom which accident had imposed on me and hurried southward to Ukonongo
1828-141203-0054	train-other-500	then westward to Kawendi then northward to Uvinza then westward to Ujiji only about three weeks after the Doctor s arrival to find him resting under the veranda of his house
1828-141203-0055	train-other-500	with his face turned eastward the direction from which I was coming Had I gone direct from Paris on the search I might have lost him
none	none	 had I been enabled to have gone direct to Ujiji from Unyanyembe I might have lost him The days came and went peacefully and happily under the palms of Ujiji 
1828-141203-0056	train-other-500	My companion was improving in health and spirits Life had been brought back to him his fading vitality was restored his enthusiasm for his work was growing up again into a height that was compelling him to desire to be up and doing
1828-141203-0057	train-other-500	But what could he do with five men and fifteen or twenty cloths
none	none	 Have you seen the northern head of the Tangannka Doctor I asked one day 
1828-141203-0058	train-other-500	No I did try to go there
none	none	 but the Wajiji were doing their best to fleece me 
1828-141203-0059	train-other-500	as they did both Burton and Speke and I had not a great deal of cloth If I had gone to the head of the Tanganika I could not have gone to Manyuema The central line of drainage was the most important
1828-141203-0060	train-other-500	and that is the Lualaba Before this line the question whether there is a connection between the Tanganika and the Albert N Yanza sinks into insignificance The great line of drainage
1828-141203-0061	train-other-500	is the river flowing from latitude eleven degrees south which I followed for over seven degrees northward
none	none	 The Chambezi 
1828-141203-0062	train-other-500	the name given to its most southern extremity drains a large tract of country south of the southernmost source of the Tanganika it must therefore be the most important I have not the least doubt myself
1828-141203-0063	train-other-500	but that this lake is the Upper Tanganika and the Albert N Yanza of Baker is the Lower Tanganika
none	none	 which are connected by a river flowing from the upper to the lower 
1828-141203-0064	train-other-500	This is my belief based upon reports of the Arabs and a test I made of the flow with water plants But
none	none	 I really never gave it 
1828-141203-0065	train-other-500	much thought Well if I were you Doctor before leaving Ujiji I should explore it and resolve the doubts upon the subject lest after you leave here you should not return by this way
1828-141203-0066	train-other-500	The Royal Geographical Society attach much importance to this supposed connection and declare you are the only man who can settle it If I can be of any service to you you may command me Though I did not come to Africa as an explorer
1828-141203-0067	train-other-500	I have a good deal of curiosity upon the subject and should be willing to accompany you I have with me about twenty men who understand rowing we have plenty of guns cloth and beads and if we can get a canoe from the Arabs we can manage the thing easily
1828-141203-0068	train-other-500	Oh we can get a canoe from Sayd bin Majid This man has been very kind to me and if ever there was an Arab gentleman he is one Then it is settled is it that we go I am ready
1828-141203-0069	train-other-500	whenever you are I am at your command Don t you hear my men call you the Great Master and me the Little Master It would never do for the Little Master to command By this time
1828-141203-0070	train-other-500	Livingstone was becoming known to me I defy any one to be in his society long without thoroughly fathoming him for in him there is no guile and what is apparent on the surface is the thing that is in him
1828-141203-0071	train-other-500	I simply write down my own opinion of the man as I have seen him not as he represents himself as I know him to be not as I have heard of him I lived with him from the tenth November eighteen seventy one
none	none	 to the fourteenth March eighteen seventy two 
1828-141203-0072	train-other-500	witnessed his conduct in the camp and on the march and my feelings for him are those of unqualified admiration
none	none	 The camp is the best place to discover a man s weaknesses where 
1828-141203-0073	train-other-500	if he is flighty or wrong headed he is sure to develop his hobbies and weak side I think it possible however that Livingstone with an unsuitable companion might feel annoyance I know I should do so very readily
1828-141203-0074	train-other-500	if a man s character was of that oblique nature that it was an impossibility to travel in his company I have seen men in whose company I felt nothing but a thraldom
1828-141203-0075	train-other-500	which it was a duty to my own self respect to cast off as soon as possible a feeling of utter incompatibility with whose nature mine could never assimilate But Livingstone was a character that I venerated
1828-141203-0076	train-other-500	that called forth all my enthusiasm that evoked nothing but sincerest admiration doctor Livingstone is about sixty years old though after he was restored to health
1828-141203-0077	train-other-500	he appeared more like a man who had not passed his fiftieth year His hair has a brownish colour yet but is here and there streaked with grey lines over the temples
none	none	 his whiskers and moustache are very grey 
1828-141203-0078	train-other-500	He shaves his chin daily His eyes which are hazel are remarkably bright he has a sight keen as a hawk s His teeth alone indicate the weakness of age the hard fare of Lunda has made havoc in their lines
1828-141203-0079	train-other-500	His form which soon assumed a stoutish appearance is a little over the ordinary height with the slightest possible bow in the shoulders When walking he has a firm but heavy tread like that of an overworked or fatigued man
1828-141203-0080	train-other-500	He is accustomed to wear a naval cap with a semicircular peak by which he has been identified throughout Africa His dress when first I saw him exhibited traces of patching and repairing but was scrupulously clean
1828-141203-0081	train-other-500	I was led to believe that Livingstone possessed a splenetic misanthropic temper some have said that he is garrulous that he is demented that he has utterly changed from the David Livingstone whom people knew as the reverend missionary
1828-141203-0082	train-other-500	that he takes no notes or observations but such as those which no other person could read but himself and it was reported before I proceeded to Central Africa that he was married to an African princess I respectfully
1828-141203-0083	train-other-500	beg to differ with all and each of the above statements I grant he is not an angel but he approaches to that being as near as the nature of a living man will allow I never saw any spleen or misanthropy in him
1828-141203-0084	train-other-500	as for being garrulous doctor Livingstone is quite the reverse he is reserved if anything and to the man who says doctor Livingstone is changed all I can say is that he never could have known him
1828-141203-0085	train-other-500	for it is notorious that the Doctor has a fund of quiet humour which he exhibits at all times whenever he is among friends I must also beg leave to correct the gentleman who informed me that Livingstone takes no notes or observations
1828-141203-0086	train-other-500	The huge Letts s Diary which I carried home to his daughter is full of notes and there are no less than a score of sheets within it filled with observations which he took during the last trip he made to Manyuema alone
none	none	 and in the middle of the book there is sheet after sheet column after column carefully written of figures alone A large letter which I received from him has been sent to Sir Thomas MacLear and this contains nothing but observations 
1828-141203-0088	train-other-500	During the four months I was with him I noticed him every evening making most careful notes and a large tin box that he has with him contains numbers of field note books the contents of which I dare say will see the light some time
1828-141203-0089	train-other-500	His maps also evince great care and industry As to the report of his African marriage it is unnecessary to say more than that it is untrue and it is utterly beneath a gentleman
1828-141203-0090	train-other-500	to hint at such a thing in connection with the name of David Livingstone There is a good natured abandon about Livingstone which was not lost on me Whenever he began to laugh there was a contagion about it that compelled me to imitate him
1828-141203-0091	train-other-500	It was such a laugh as Herr Teufelsdrockh s a laugh of the whole man from head to heel If he told a story he related it in such a way as to convince one of its truthfulness his face was so
1828-141203-0092	train-other-500	lit up by the sly fun it contained that I was sure the story was worth relating and worth listening to
none	none	 The wan features which had shocked me at first meeting 
1828-141203-0093	train-other-500	the heavy step which told of age and hard travel the grey beard and bowed shoulders belied the man Underneath that well worn exterior lay an endless fund of high spirits and inexhaustible humour
1828-141203-0094	train-other-500	that rugged frame of his enclosed a young and most exuberant soul Every day I heard innumerable jokes and pleasant anecdotes interesting hunting stories in which his friends Oswell Webb Vardon and Gorden Cumming
1828-141203-0095	train-other-500	were almost always the chief actors I was not sure at first but this joviality humour and abundant animal spirits were the result of a joyous hysteria but as I found they continued while I was with him
1828-141203-0096	train-other-500	I am obliged to think them natural Another thing which specially attracted my attention was his wonderfully retentive memory If we remember the many years he has spent in Africa deprived of books
1828-141203-0097	train-other-500	we may well think it an uncommon memory that can recite whole poems from Byron Burns Tennyson Longfellow Whittier and Lowell The reason of this may be found perhaps
none	none	 in the fact that he has lived all his life almost we may say 
1828-141203-0098	train-other-500	within himself Zimmerman a great student of human nature says on this subject The unencumbered mind recalls all that it has read all that pleased the eye and delighted the ear
1828-141203-0099	train-other-500	and reflecting on every idea which either observation or experience or discourse has produced gains new information by every reflection The intellect contemplates all the former scenes of life
1828-141203-0100	train-other-500	views by anticipation those that are yet to come and blends all ideas of past and future in the actual enjoyment of the present moment He has lived in a world which revolved inwardly
1828-141203-0101	train-other-500	out of which he seldom awoke except to attend to the immediate practical necessities of himself and people then relapsed again into the same happy inner world which he must have peopled with his own friends relations acquaintances
1828-141203-0102	train-other-500	familiar readings ideas and associations so that wherever he might be or by whatsoever he was surrounded his own world always possessed more attractions to his cultured mind
1828-141203-0103	train-other-500	than were yielded by external circumstances The study of doctor Livingstone would not be complete if we did not take the religious side of his character into consideration His religion is not of the theoretical kind
1828-141203-0104	train-other-500	but it is a constant earnest sincere practice It is neither demonstrative nor loud but manifests itself in a quiet practical way and is always at work It is not aggressive
1828-141203-0105	train-other-500	which sometimes is troublesome if not impertinent In him religion exhibits its loveliest features it governs his conduct not only towards his servants but towards the natives
1828-141203-0106	train-other-500	the bigoted Mohammedans and all who come in contact with him Without it Livingstone with his ardent temperament his enthusiasm his high spirit and courage must have become uncompanionable and a hard master
1828-141203-0107	train-other-500	Religion has tamed him and made him a Christian gentleman the crude and wilful have been refined and subdued religion has made him the most companionable of men
1828-141203-0108	train-other-500	and indulgent of masters a man whose society is pleasurable In Livingstone I have seen many amiable traits His gentleness never forsakes him his hopefulness never deserts him
1828-141203-0109	train-other-500	No harassing anxieties distraction of mind long separation from home and kindred can make him complain He thinks all will come out right at last he has such faith in the goodness of Providence
1828-141203-0110	train-other-500	The sport of adverse circumstances the plaything of the miserable beings sent to him from Zanzibar he has been baffled and worried even almost to the grave yet he will not desert the charge imposed upon him by his friend
1828-141203-0111	train-other-500	Sir Roderick Murchison To the stern dictates of duty alone has he sacrificed his home and ease the pleasures refinements and luxuries of civilized life His is the Spartan heroism
1828-141203-0112	train-other-500	the inflexibility of the Roman the enduring resolution of the Anglo Saxon never to relinquish his work though his heart yearns for home never to surrender his obligations until he can write
none	none	 Finis 
1828-141203-0113	train-other-500	to his work But you may take any point in doctor Livingstone s character
none	none	 and analyse it carefully 
1828-141203-0114	train-other-500	and I would challenge any man to find a fault in it He is sensitive I know but so is any man of a high mind and generous nature He is sensitive on the point of being doubted or being criticised An extreme love of truth is one of his strongest characteristics
1828-141203-0115	train-other-500	which proves him to be a man of strictest principles and conscientious scruples being such he is naturally sensitive and shrinks from any attacks on the integrity of his observations and the accuracy of his reports
none	none	 He is conscious of having laboured in the course of geography and science with zeal and industry 
1828-141203-0116	train-other-500	to have been painstaking and as exact as circumstances would allow Ordinary critics seldom take into consideration circumstances but
1828-141203-0117	train-other-500	utterly regardless of the labor expended in obtaining the least amount of geographical information in a new land environed by inconceivable dangers and difficulties such as Central Africa presents they seem to take delight in rending to tatters
1828-141203-0118	train-other-500	and reducing to nil the fruits of long years of labor by sharply pointed shafts of ridicule and sneers
1828-141203-0119	train-other-500	Livingstone no doubt may be mistaken in some of his conclusions about certain points in the geography of Central Africa but he is not so dogmatic and positive a man as to refuse conviction
1828-141203-0120	train-other-500	He certainly demands when arguments in contra are used in opposition to him higher authority than abstract theory His whole life is a testimony against its unreliability
1828-141203-0121	train-other-500	and his entire labor of years were in vain if theory can be taken in evidence against personal observation and patient investigation The reluctance he manifests to entertain suppositions
1828-141203-0122	train-other-500	possibilities regarding the nature form configuration of concrete immutable matter like the earth arises from the fact that a man who commits himself to theories about such an untheoretical subject as Central Africa
1828-141203-0123	train-other-500	is deterred from bestirring himself to prove them by the test of exploration His opinion of such a man is that he unfits himself for his duty
1828-141203-0124	train-other-500	that he is very likely to become a slave to theory a voluptuous fancy which would master him It is his firm belief that a man who rests his sole knowledge of the geography of Africa on theory
1828-141203-0125	train-other-500	deserves to be discredited It has been the fear of being discredited and criticised and so made to appear before the world as a man who spent so many valuable years in Africa for the sake of burdening the geographical mind with theory
1828-141203-0126	train-other-500	that has detained him so long in Africa doing his utmost to test the value of the main theory which clung to him and would cling to him until he proved or disproved it This main theory
1828-141203-0127	train-other-500	is his belief that in the broad and mighty Lualaba he has discovered the head waters of the Nile
1828-141203-0128	train-other-500	His grounds for believing this are of such nature and weight as to compel him to despise the warning that years are advancing on him and his former iron constitution is failing
1828-141203-0129	train-other-500	He believes his speculations on this point will be verified he believes he is strong enough to pursue his explorations until he can return to his country with the announcement that the Lualaba is none other
none	none	 than the Nile On discovering that the insignificant stream called the Chambezi which rises between ten degrees S and twelve degrees S flowed westerly 
2046-141204-0000	train-other-500	and then northerly through several lakes now under the names of the Chambezi then as the Luapula and then as the Lualaba and that it still continued its flow towards the north for over seven degrees Livingstone became firmly of the opinion that the river whose current he followed was the Egyptian Nile
none	none	 Failing at lat four degrees S to pursue his explorations further without additional supplies he determined to return to Ujiji to obtain them And now having obtained them he intends to return to the point where he left off work He means to follow that great river until it is firmly established what name shall eventually be given the noble water way whose course he has followed through so many 
2046-141204-0001	train-other-500	sick toilings and difficulties To all entreaties to come home to all the glowing temptations which home and innumerable friends offer he returns the determined answer No
none	none	 not until my work is ended I have often heard our servants discuss our respective merits Your master say my servants to Livingstone s is a good man a very good man he does not beat you for he has a kind heart but ours oh he is sharp hot as fire mkali sana kana moto From being hated and thwarted in every possible way by the Arabs and half castes upon first arrival in Ujiji he has through his uniform kindness and mild pleasant temper won all hearts I observed that universal respect was paid to him Even the Mohammedans never passed his house without calling to pay their compliments and to say The blessing of God rest on you Each Sunday morning he gathers his little flock around him and reads prayers and a chapter from the Bible in a natural unaffected and sincere tone and afterwards delivers a short address in the Kisawahili language about the subject read to them which is listened to with interest and attention There is another point in Livingstone s character about which readers of his books and students of his travels would like to know 
2046-141204-0002	train-other-500	and that is his ability to withstand the dreadful climate of Central Africa and the consistent energy with which he follows up his explorations His consistent energy is native to him and to his race
2046-141204-0003	train-other-500	He is a very fine example of the perseverance doggedness and tenacity which characterise the Anglo Saxon spirit
none	none	 but his ability to withstand the climate is due not only to the happy constitution with which he was born but to the strictly temperate life he has ever led A drunkard and a man of vicious habits could never have withstood the climate of Central Africa 
2046-141204-0004	train-other-500	The second day after my arrival in Ujiji I asked the Doctor if he did not feel a desire sometimes to visit his country
none	none	 and take a little rest after his six years explorations and the answer he gave me fully reveals the man Said he I should like very much to go home and see my children once again but I cannot bring my heart to abandon the task I have undertaken when it is so nearly completed 
2046-141204-0005	train-other-500	It only requires six or seven months more to trace the true source that I have discovered with Petherick s branch of the White Nile or with the Albert N Yanza of Sir Samuel Baker which is the lake called by the natives
none	none	 Chowambe Why should I go home before my task is ended to have to come back again to do what I can very well do now 
2046-141204-0006	train-other-500	And why I asked did you come so far back without finishing the task which you say you have got to do Simply because I was forced My men would not budge a step forward They mutinied and formed a secret resolution
2046-141204-0007	train-other-500	if I still insisted upon going on to raise a disturbance in the country and after they had effected it to abandon me in which case I should have been killed It was dangerous to go any further I had explored six hundred miles of the watershed had traced all the principal streams
2046-141204-0008	train-other-500	which discharge their waters into the central line of drainage but when about starting to explore the last hundred miles the hearts of my people failed them and they set about frustrating me in every possible way Now having returned seven hundred miles to get a new supply of stores
2046-141204-0009	train-other-500	and another escort I find myself destitute of even the means to live but for a few weeks and sick in mind and body Here I may pause to ask any brave man how he would have comported himself in such a crisis
2046-141204-0010	train-other-500	Many would have been in exceeding hurry to get home to tell the news of the continued explorations and discoveries
none	none	 and to relieve the anxiety of the sorrowing family and friends awaiting their return 
2046-141204-0011	train-other-500	Enough surely had been accomplished towards the solution of the problem that had exercised the minds of his scientific associates of the Royal Geograpical Society It was no negative exploration it was hard earnest labor of years
2046-141204-0012	train-other-500	self abnegation enduring patience and exalted fortitude such as ordinary men fail to exhibit
none	none	 Suppose Livingstone had hurried to the coast after he had discovered Lake Bangweolo 
2046-141204-0013	train-other-500	to tell the news to the geographical world then had returned to discover Moero and run away again then went back once more only to discover Kamolondo and to race back again This would not be in accordance with Livingstone s character
2046-141204-0014	train-other-500	He must not only discover the Chambezi Lake Bangweolo Luapula River Lake Moero Lualaba River and Lake Kamolondo
none	none	 but he must still tirelessly urge his steps forward to put the final completion to the grand lacustrine river system 
2046-141204-0015	train-other-500	Had he followed the example of ordinary explorers he would have been running backwards and forwards to tell the news instead of exploring
none	none	 and he might have been able to write a volume upon the discovery of each lake and earn much money thereby 
2046-141204-0016	train-other-500	They are no few months explorations that form the contents of his books His Missionary Travels embraces a period of sixteen years
none	none	 his book on the Zambezi 
2046-141204-0017	train-other-500	five years and if the great traveller lives to come home his third book the grandest of all must contain the records of eight or nine years It is a principle with Livingstone to do well what he undertakes to do and in the consciousness that he is doing it despite the yearning for his home
2046-141204-0018	train-other-500	which is sometimes overpowering he finds to a certain extent contentment if not happiness To men differently constituted
none	none	 a long residence amongst the savages of Africa would be contemplated with horror 
2046-141204-0019	train-other-500	yet Livingstone s mind can find pleasure and food for philosophic studies The wonders of primeval nature the great forests and sublime mountains the perennial streams and sources of the great lakes the marvels of the earth
2046-141204-0020	train-other-500	the splendors of the tropic sky by day and by night all terrestrial and celestial phenomena are manna to a man of such self abnegation and devoted philanthropic spirit He can be charmed with the primitive simplicity of
2046-141204-0021	train-other-500	Ethiop s dusky children with whom he has spent so many years of his life he has a sturdy faith in their capabilities sees virtue in them where others see nothing but savagery
2046-141204-0022	train-other-500	and wherever he has gone among them he has sought to elevate a people that were apparently forgotten of God and Christian man One night I took out my note book and prepared to take down from his own lips what he had to say about his travels and unhesitatingly
2046-141204-0023	train-other-500	he related his experiences of which the following is a summary doctor David Livingstone left the Island of Zanzibar in March eighteen sixty six On the seventh of the following month he departed from
none	none	 Mikindany Bay 
2046-141204-0024	train-other-500	for the interior with an expedition consisting of twelve Sepoys from Bombay nine men from Johanna
none	none	 of the Comoro Islands seven liberated slaves and two Zambezi men 
2046-141204-0025	train-other-500	taking them as an experiment six camels three buffaloes two mules and three donkeys He had thus thirty men with him twelve of whom viz the Sepoys were to act as guards for the Expedition
2046-141204-0026	train-other-500	They were mostly armed with the Enfield rifles presented to the Doctor by the Bombay Government The baggage of the expedition consisted of ten bales of cloth and two bags of beads
2046-141204-0027	train-other-500	which were to serve as the currency by which they would be enabled to purchase the necessaries of life in the countries the Doctor intended to visit Besides the cumbrous moneys they carried several boxes of instruments such as chronometers air thermometers sextant and artificial horizon
2046-141204-0028	train-other-500	boxes containing clothes medicines and personal necessaries The expedition travelled up the left bank of the Rovuma River a route
none	none	 as full of difficulties as any that could be chosen 
2046-141204-0029	train-other-500	For miles Livingstone and his party had to cut their way with their axes through the dense and almost impenetrable jungles which lined the river s banks The road was a mere footpath leading in the most erratic fashion into and through the dense vegetation
2046-141204-0030	train-other-500	seeking the easiest outlet from it without any regard to the course it ran
none	none	 The pagazis 
2046-141204-0031	train-other-500	were able to proceed easily enough but the camels on account of their enormous height could not advance a step without the axes of the party clearing the way These tools of foresters were almost always required
2046-141204-0032	train-other-500	but the advance of the expedition was often retarded by the unwillingness of the Sepoys and Johanna men to work Soon after the departure of the expedition from the coast
2046-141204-0033	train-other-500	the murmurings and complaints of these men began and upon every occasion and at every opportunity they evinced a decided hostility to an advance In order to prevent the progress of the Doctor and in hopes that it would compel him to return to the coast these
2046-141204-0034	train-other-500	men so cruelly treated the animals that before long there was not one left alive But as this scheme failed they set about instigating the natives against the white men whom they accused most wantonly of strange practices
2046-141204-0035	train-other-500	As this plan was most likely to succeed and as it was dangerous to have such men with him the Doctor arrived at the conclusion
none	none	 that it was best to discharge them and accordingly sent the Sepoys back to the coast 
2046-141204-0036	train-other-500	but not without having first furnished them with the means of subsistence on their journey to the coast These men were such a disreputable set that the natives spoke of them as the Doctor s slaves One of their worst sins was the custom of giving their guns and ammunition
2046-141204-0037	train-other-500	to carry to the first woman or boy they met whom they impressed for that purpose by such threats or promises as they were totally unable to perform and unwarranted in making An hour s marching was sufficient to fatigue them
2046-141204-0038	train-other-500	after which they lay down on the road to bewail their hard fate and concoct new schemes to frustrate their leader s purposes Towards night they generally made their appearance at the camping ground with the looks of half dead men
2046-141204-0039	train-other-500	Such men naturally made but a poor escort for had the party been attacked by a wandering tribe of natives of any strength the Doctor could have made no defence and no other alternative would have been left to him but to surrender and be ruined
2046-141204-0040	train-other-500	The Doctor and his little party arrived on the eighteenth July eighteen sixty six at a village belonging to a chief of the Wahiyou
none	none	 situate eight days march south of the Rovuma and overlooking the watershed of the Lake Nyassa 
2046-141204-0041	train-other-500	The territory lying between the Rovuma River and this Wahiyou village was an uninhabited wilderness during the transit of which Livingstone and his expedition suffered considerably from hunger and desertion of men Early in August eighteen sixty six the Doctor came to the country of Mponda
none	none	 a chief who dwelt near the Lake Nyassa 
2046-141204-0042	train-other-500	On the road thither two of the liberated slaves deserted him Here also Wekotani a protege of the Doctor insisted upon his discharge
none	none	 alleging as an excuse an excuse which the Doctor subsequently found to be untrue 
2046-141204-0043	train-other-500	that he had found his brother He also stated that his family lived on the east side of the Nyassa Lake
none	none	 He further stated that Mponda s favourite wife was his sister 
2046-141204-0044	train-other-500	Perceiving that Wekotani was unwilling to go with him further the Doctor took him to Mponda who now saw and heard of him for the first time and having furnished the ungrateful boy with enough cloth and beads to keep him until his big brother should call for him left him with the chief
2046-141204-0045	train-other-500	after first assuring himself that he would receive honourable treatment from him The Doctor also gave Wekotanti writing paper as
none	none	 he could read and write being accomplishments acquired at Bombay 
2046-141204-0046	train-other-500	where he had been put to school so that should he at any time feel disposed
none	none	 he might write to his English friends or to himself 
2046-141204-0047	train-other-500	The Doctor further enjoined him not to join in any of the slave raids usually made by his countrymen the men of Nyassa on their neighbours Upon finding that his application for a discharge was successful
2046-141204-0048	train-other-500	Wekotani endeavoured to induce Chumah another protege of the Doctor s and a companion or chum of Wekotani to leave the Doctor s service and proceed with him promising as a bribe a wife and plenty of pombe from his big brother
2046-141204-0049	train-other-500	Chumah upon referring the matter to the Doctor was advised not to go as he the Doctor strongly suspected that Wekotani wanted only to make him his slave Chumah wisely withdrew from his tempter From Mponda s the Doctor proceeded to the heel of the Nyassa
none	none	 to the village of a Babisa chief who required medicine for a skin disease 
2046-141204-0050	train-other-500	With his usual kindness he stayed at this chief s village to treat his malady
none	none	 While here a half caste Arab arrived from the western shore of the lake and reported that he had been plundered by a band of Mazitu at a place which the Doctor and Musa chief of the Johanna men were very well aware was at least one hundred fifty miles north north west of where they were then stopping 
2046-141204-0051	train-other-500	Musa however for his own reasons which will appear presently eagerly listened to the Arab s tale and gave full credence to it Having well digested its horrible details he came to the Doctor to give him the full benefit of what he had heard with such willing ears
2046-141204-0052	train-other-500	The traveller patiently listened to the narrative which lost nothing of its portentous significance through Musa s relation
none	none	 and then asked Musa if he believed it 
2046-141204-0053	train-other-500	Yes answered Musa readily he tell me true true I ask him good and he tell me true true
none	none	 The Doctor however said he did not believe it for the Mazitu would not have been satisfied with merely plundering a man 
2046-141204-0054	train-other-500	they would have murdered him but suggested in order to allay the fears of his Moslem subordinate that they should both proceed to the chief with whom they were staying who being a sensible man would be able to advise them as to the probability or improbability of the tale being correct Together they proceeded to the Babisa chief
2046-141204-0055	train-other-500	who when he had heard the Arab s story unhesitatingly denounced the Arab as a liar and his story without the least foundation in fact giving as a reason that if the Mazitu had been lately in that vicinity
none	none	 he should have heard of it soon enough 
2046-141204-0056	train-other-500	But Musa broke out with No no Doctor no no no I no want to go to Mazitu I no want Mazitu to kill me I want to see my father my mother my child in Johanna I want no Mazitu These are Musa s words
2046-141204-0057	train-other-500	ipsissima verba To which the Doctor replied I don t want the Mazitu to kill me either but as you are afraid of them I promise to go straight west until we get far past the beat of the Mazitu Musa was not satisfied but kept moaning and sorrowing saying
2046-141204-0058	train-other-500	If we had two hundred guns with us I would go but our small party of men they will attack by night and kill all The Doctor repeated his promise But I will not go near them I will go west As soon as he turned his face westward Musa and the Johanna men ran away in a body
2046-141204-0059	train-other-500	The Doctor says in commenting upon Musa s conduct that he felt strongly tempted to shoot Musa and another ringleader but was nevertheless glad that he did not soil his hands with their vile blood A day or two afterwards another of his men Simon Price by name
none	none	 came to the Doctor with the same tale about the Mazitu 
2046-141204-0060	train-other-500	but compelled by the scant number of his people to repress all such tendencies to desertion and faint heartedness the Doctor silenced him at once and sternly forbade him to utter the name of the Mazitu any more Had the natives not assisted him
none	none	 he must have despaired of ever being able to penetrate the wild and unexplored interior which he was now about to tread 
2046-141204-0061	train-other-500	Fortunately as the Doctor says with unction I was in a country now after leaving the shores of Nyassa which the foot of the slave trader has not trod it was a new and virgin land and of course as I have always found in such cases the natives were really good and hospitable
none	none	 and for very small portions of cloth my baggage was conveyed from village to village by them 
2046-141204-0062	train-other-500	In many other ways the traveller in his extremity was kindly treated by the yet unsophisticated and innocent natives On leaving this hospitable region in the early part of December eighteen sixty six
2046-141204-0063	train-other-500	the Doctor entered a country where the Mazitu had exercised their customary marauding propensities The land was swept clean of provisions and cattle
none	none	 and the people had emigrated to other countries beyond the bounds of those ferocious plunderers Again the Expedition was besieged by pinching hunger from which they suffered 
2046-141204-0064	train-other-500	they had recourse to the wild fruits which some parts of the country furnished At intervals the condition of the hard pressed band was made worse by the heartless desertion of some of its members
none	none	 who more than once departed with the Doctor s personal kit changes of clothes linen c With more or less misfortunes constantly dogging his footsteps he traversed in safety the countries of the Babisa Bobemba Barungu Ba ulungu and Lunda In the country of Lunda lives the famous Cazembe who was first made known to Europeans by doctor Lacerda 
2046-141204-0065	train-other-500	the Portuguese traveller Cazembe is a most intelligent prince he is a tall stalwart man who wears a peculiar kind of dress made of crimson print in the form of a prodigious kilt
none	none	 In this state dress King Cazembe received doctor Livingstone 
2046-141204-0066	train-other-500	surrounded by his chiefs and body guards A chief who had been deputed by the King and elders to discover all about the white man
none	none	 then stood up before the assembly and in a loud voice gave the result of the inquiry he had instituted 
2046-141204-0067	train-other-500	He had heard that the white man had come to look for waters for rivers and seas though he could not understand what the white man could want with such things he had no doubt that the object was good
none	none	 Then Cazembe asked what the Doctor proposed doing 
2046-141204-0068	train-other-500	and where he thought of going The Doctor replied that he had thought of proceeding south as he had heard of lakes and rivers being in that direction
none	none	 Cazembe asked What can you want to go there for The water is close here 
2046-141204-0069	train-other-500	There is plenty of large water in this neighbourhood
none	none	 Before breaking up the assembly Cazembe gave orders to let the white man go where he would 
2046-141204-0070	train-other-500	through his country undisturbed and unmolested He was the first Englishman he had seen he said and he liked him Shortly after his introduction to the King the Queen entered the large house surrounded by a body guard of Amazons with spears
2046-141204-0071	train-other-500	She was a fine tall handsome young woman and evidently thought she was about to make an impression upon the rustic white man
none	none	 for she had clothed herself after a most royal fashion 
2046-141204-0072	train-other-500	and was armed with a ponderous spear But her appearance so different from what the Doctor had imagined caused him to laugh which entirely spoiled the effect intended for the laugh of the Doctor was so contagious that she herself was the first to imitate it
2046-141204-0073	train-other-500	and the Amazons courtier like followed suit
none	none	 Much disconcerted by this the Queen ran back followed by her obedient damsels a retreat most undignified and unqueenlike compared with her majestic advent into the Doctor s presence 
2046-141204-0074	train-other-500	But Livingstone will have much to say about his reception at this court
none	none	 and about this interesting King and Queen and who can so well relate the scenes he witnessed and which belong exclusively to him as he himself 
2046-141204-0075	train-other-500	Soon after his arrival in the country of Lunda or Londa
none	none	 and before he had entered the district ruled over by Cazembe he had crossed a river called the Chambezi 
2046-141204-0076	train-other-500	which was quite an important stream The similarity of the name with that large and noble river south which will be for ever connected with his name misled Livingstone at that time and he accordingly did not pay to it the attention it deserved
none	none	 believing that the Chambezi was but the head waters of the Zambezi 
2046-141204-0077	train-other-500	and consequently had no bearing or connection with the sources of the river of Egypt of which he was in search
none	none	 His fault was in relying too implicitly upon the correctness of Portuguese information This error it cost him many months of tedious labour and travel to rectify From the beginning of eighteen sixty seven the time of his arrival at Cazembe s till the middle of March eighteen sixty nine the time of his arrival at Ujiji he was mostly engaged in correcting the errors and misrepresentations of the Portuguese travellers The Portuguese in speaking of the River Chambezi invariably spoke of it as our own Zambezi that is the Zambezi which flows through the Portuguese possessions of the Mozambique In going to Cazembe from Nyassa said they you will cross our own Zambezi Such positive and reiterated information given not only orally but in their books and maps was naturally confusing When the Doctor perceived that what he saw and what they described were at variance out of a sincere wish to be correct and lest he might have been mistaken himself he started to retravel the ground he had travelled before Over and over again he traversed the several countries watered by the several rivers of the complicated water system like an uneasy spirit Over and over again he asked the same questions from the different peoples he met until he was obliged to desist lest they might say The man is mad he has got water on the brain But his travels and tedious labours in Lunda and the adjacent countries have established beyond doubt first that the Chambezi is a totally distinct river from the Zambezi of the Portuguese and secondly that the Chambezi starting from about latitude eleven degrees south is no other than the most southerly feeder of the great Nile thus giving that famous river a length of over two thousand miles of direct latitude making it second to the Mississippi the longest river in the world The real and true name of the Zambezi is Dombazi When Lacerda and his Portuguese successors coming to Cazembe crossed the Chambezi and heard its name they very naturally set it down as our own Zambezi and without further inquiry sketched it as running in that direction During his researches in that region so pregnant in discoveries Livingstone came to a lake lying north east of Cazembe which the natives call Liemba from the country of that name which bordered it on the east and south In tracing the lake north he found it to be none other than the Tanganika or the south eastern extremity of it which looks on the Doctor s map very much like an outline of Italy The latitude of the southern end of this great body of water is about eight degrees forty two minutes south which thus gives it a length from north to south of three hundred sixty geographical miles From the southern extremity of the Tanganika he crossed Marungu and came in sight of Lake Moero Tracing this lake which is about sixty miles in length to its southern head he found a river called the Luapula entering it from that direction Following the Luapula south he found it issue from the large lake of Bangweolo which is nearly as large in superficial area as the Tanganika In exploring for the waters which discharged themselves into the lake he found that by far the most important of these feeders was the Chambezi so that he had thus traced the Chambezi from its source to Lake Bangweolo and the issue from its northern head under the name of Luapula and found it enter Lake Moero Again he returned to Cazembe s well satisfied that the river running north through three degrees of latitude could not be the river running south under the name of Zambezi though there might be a remarkable resemblance in their names At Cazembe s he found an old white bearded half caste named Mohammed bin Sali who was kept as a kind of prisoner at large by the King because of certain suspicious circumstances attending his advent and stay in the country Through Livingstone s influence Mohammed bin Sali obtained his release On the road to Ujiji he had bitter cause to regret having exerted himself in the half caste s behalf He turned out to be a most ungrateful wretch who poisoned the minds of the Doctor s few followers and ingratiated himself with them by selling the favours of his concubines to them by which he reduced them to a kind of bondage under him The Doctor was deserted by all but two even faithful Susi and Chumah deserted him for the service of Mohammed bin Sali But they soon repented and returned to their allegiance From the day he had the vile old man in his company manifold and bitter misfortunes followed the Doctor up to his arrival at Ujiji in March eighteen sixty nine From the date of his arrival until the end of June eighteen sixty nine he remained at Ujiji whence he dated those letters which though the outside world still doubted his being alive satisfied the minds of the Royal Geographical people and his intimate friends that he still existed and that Musa a tale was the false though ingenious fabrication of a cowardly deserter It was during this time that the thought occurred to him of sailing around the Lake Tanganika but the Arabs and natives were so bent upon fleecing him that had he undertaken it the remainder or his goods would not have enabled him to explore the central line of drainage the initial point of which he found far south of Cazembe s in about latitude eleven degrees in the river called Chambezi In the days when tired Captain Burton was resting in Ujiji after his march from the coast near Zanzibar the land to which Livingstone on his departure from Ujiji bent his steps was unknown to the Arabs save by vague report Messrs Burton and Speke never heard of it it seems Speke who was the geographer of Burton s Expedition heard of a place called Urua which he placed on his map according to the general direction indicated by the Arabs but the most enterprising of the Arabs in their search after ivory only touched the frontiers of Rua as the natives and Livingstone call it for Rua is an immense country with a length of six degrees of latitude and as yet an undefined breadth from east to west At the end of June eighteen sixty nine Livingstone quitted Ujiji and crossed over to Uguhha on the western shore for his last and greatest series of explorations the result of which was the further discovery of a lake of considerable magnitude connected with Moero by the large river called the Lualaba and which was a continuation of the chain of lakes he had previously discovered From the port of Uguhha he set off in company with a body of traders in an almost direct westerly course for the country of Urua Fifteen days march brought them to Bambarre the first important ivory depot in Manyema or as the natives pronounce it Manyuema For nearly six months he was detained at Bambarre from ulcers in the feet which discharged bloody ichor as soon as he set them on the ground When recovered he set off in a northerly direction and after several days came to a broad lacustrine river called the Lualaba flowing northward and westward and in some places southward in a most confusing way The river was from one to three miles broad By exceeding pertinacity he contrived to follow its erratic course until he saw the Lualaba enter the narrow long lake of Kamolondo in about latitude six degrees thirty minutes Retracing this to the south he came to the point where he had seen the Luapula enter Lake Moero One feels quite enthusiastic when listening to Livingstone s description of the beauties of Moero scenery Pent in on all sides by high mountains clothed to the edges with the rich vegetation of the tropics the Moero discharges its superfluous waters through a deep rent in the bosom of the mountains The impetuous and grand river roars through the chasm with the thunder of a cataract but soon after leaving its confined and deep bed it expands into the calm and broad Lualaba stretching over miles of ground After making great bends west and south west and then curving northward it enters Kamolondo By the natives it is called the Lualaba but the Doctor in order to distinguish it from other rivers of the same name has given it the name of Webb s River after mister Webb the wealthy proprietor of Newstead Abbey whom the Doctor distinguishes as one of his oldest and most consistent friends Away to the south west from Kamolondo is another large lake which discharges its waters by the important River Loeki or Lomami into the great Lualaba To this lake known as Chebungo by the natives doctor Livingstone has given the name of Lincoln to be hereafter distinguished on maps and in books as Lake Lincoln in memory of Abraham Lincoln our murdered President This was done from the vivid impression produced on his mind by hearing a portion of his inauguration speech read from an English pulpit which related to the causes that induced him to issue his Emancipation Proclamation by which memorable deed four million of slaves were for ever freed To the memory of the man whose labours on behalf of the negro race deserves the commendation of all good men Livingstone has contributed a monument more durable than brass or stone Entering Webb s River from the south south west a little north of Kamolondo is a large river called Lufira but the streams that discharge themselves from the watershed into the Lualaba are so numerous that the Doctor s map would not contain them so he has left all out except the most important Continuing his way north tracing the Lualaba through its manifold and crooked curves as far as latitude four degrees south he came to where he heard of another lake to the north into which it ran But here you may come to a dead halt and read what lies beyond this spot thus This was the furthermost point whence he was compelled to return on the weary road to Ujiji a distance of seven hundred miles In this brief sketch of doctor Livingstone s wonderful travels it is to be hoped the most superficial reader as well as the student of geography comprehends this grand system of lakes connected together by Webb s River To assist him let him glance at the map accompanying this book He will then have a fair idea of what doctor Livingstone has been doing during these long years and what additions he has made to the study of African geography That this river distinguished under several titles flowing from one lake into another in a northerly direction with all its great crooked bends and sinuosities is the Nile the true Nile the Doctor has not the least doubt For a long time he entertained great scepticism because of its deep bends and curves west and south west even but having traced it from its head waters the Chambezi through seven degrees of latitude that is from eleven degrees S to lat four degrees N he has been compelled to come to the conclusion that it can be no other river than the Nile He had thought it was the Congo but has discovered the sources of the Congo to be the Kassai and the Kwango two rivers which rise on the western side of the Nile watershed in about the latitude of Bangweolo and he was told of another river called the Lubilash which rose from the north and ran west But the Lualaba the Doctor thinks cannot be the Congo from its great size and body and from its steady and continued flow northward through a broad and extensive valley bounded by enormous mountains westerly and easterly The altitude of the most northerly point to which the Doctor traced the wonderful river was a little in excess of two thousand feet so that though Baker makes out his lake to be twenty seven hundred feet above the sea yet the Bahr Ghazal through which Petherick s branch of the White Nile issues into the Nile is but two thousand feet in which case there is a possibility that the Lualaba may be none other than Petherick s branch It is well known that trading stations for ivory have been established for about five hundred miles up Petherick s branch We must remember this fact when told that Gondokoro in lat four degrees N is two thousand feet above the sea and lat four degrees S where the halt was made is only a little over two thousand feet above the sea That the two rivers said to be two thousand feet above the sea separated from each other by eight degrees of latitude are one and the same river may among some men be regarded as a startling statement But we must restrain mere expressions of surprise and take into consideration that this mighty and broad Lualaba is a lacustrine river broader than the Mississippi that at intervals the body of water forms extensive lakes then contracting into a broad river it again forms a lake and so on to lat four degrees and even beyond this point the Doctor hears of a large lake again north We must wait also until the altitudes of the two rivers the Lualaba where the Doctor halted and the southern point on the Bahr Ghazal where Petherick has been are known with perfect accuracy Now for the sake of argument suppose we give this nameless lake a length of six degrees of latitude as it may be the one discovered by Piaggia the Italian traveller from which Petherick s branch of the White Nile issues out through reedy marshes into the Bahr Ghazal thence into the White Nile south of Gondokoro By this method we can suppose the rivers one for if the lake extends over so many degrees of latitude the necessity of explaining the differences of altitude that must naturally exist between two points of a river eight degrees of latitude apart would be obviated Also Livingstone s instruments for observation and taking altitudes may have been in error and this is very likely to have been the case subjected as they have been to rough handling during nearly six years of travel Despite the apparent difficulty of the altitude there is another strong reason for believing Webb s River or the Lualaba to be the Nile The watershed of this river six hundred miles of which Livingstone has travelled is drained from a valley which lies north and south between lofty eastern and western ranges This valley or line of drainage while it does not receive the Kassai and the Kwango receives rivers flowing from a great distance west for instance the important tributaries Lufira and Lomami and large rivers from the east such as the Lindi and Luamo and while the most intelligent Portuguese travellers and traders state that the Kassai the Kwango and Lubilash are the head waters of the Congo River no one has yet started the supposition that the grand river flowing north and known by the natives as the Lualaba is the Congo This river may be the Congo or perhaps the Niger If the Lualaba is only two thousand feet above the sea and the Albert N Yanza twenty seven hundred feet the Lualaba cannot enter that lake If the Bahr Ghazal does not extend by an arm for eight degrees above Gondokoro then the Lualaba cannot be the Nile But it would be premature to dogmatise on the subject Livingstone will clear up the point himself and if he finds it to be the Congo will be the first to admit his error Livingstone admits the Nile sources have not been found though he has traced the Lualaba through seven degrees of latitude flowing north and though he has not a particle of doubt of its being the Nile not yet can the Nile question be said to be resolved and ended For two reasons one He has heard of the existence of four fountains two of which gave birth to a river flowing north Webb s River or the Lualaba and to a river flowing south which is the Zambezi He has repeatedly heard of these fountains from the natives Several times he has been within one hundred and two hundred miles from them but something always interposed to prevent his going to see them According to those who have seen them they rise on either side of a mound or level which contains no stones Some have called it an ant hill One of these fountains is said to be so large that a man standing on one side cannot be seen from the other These fountains must be discovered and their position taken The Doctor does not suppose them to be south of the feeders of Lake Bangweolo In his letter to the Herald he says These four full grown gushing fountains rising so near each other and giving origin to four large rivers answer in a certain degree to the description given of the unfathomable fountains of the Nile by the secretary of Minerva in the city of Sais in Egypt to the father of all travellers Herodotus For the information of such readers as may not have the original at hand I append the following from Cary s translation of Herodotus II twenty eight Jul two thousand one The History of Herodotus Vone by Herodotus Macaulay With respect to the sources of the Nile no man of all the Egyptians Libyans or Grecians with whom I have conversed ever pretended to know anything except the registrar of Minerva s the secretary of the treasury of the goddess Neith or Athena as Herodotus calls her ho grammatiste s to n hiro n xre mato n te s Athe naie s treasury at Sais in Egypt He indeed seemed to be trifling with me when he said he knew perfectly well yet his account was as follows That there are two mountains rising into a sharp peak situated between the city of Syene in Thebais and Elephantine The names of these mountains are the one Crophi the other Mophi that the sources of the Nile which are bottomless flow from between these mountains and that half of the water flows over Egypt and to the north the other half over Ethiopia and the south That the fountains of the Nile are bottomless he said Psammitichus king of Egypt proved by experiment for having caused a line to be twisted many thousand fathoms in length he let it down but could not find a bottom Such then was the opinion the registrar gave if indeed he spoke the real truth proving in my opinion that there are strong whirlpools and an eddy here so that the water beating against the rocks a sounding line when let down cannot reach the bottom I was unable to learn anything more from any one else But thus much I learnt by carrying my researches as far as possible having gone and made my own observations as far as Elephantine and beyond that obtaining information from hearsay As one ascends the river above the city of Elephantine the country is steep here therefore it is necessary to attach a rope on both sides of a boat as one does with an ox in a plough and so proceed but if the rope should happen to break the boat is carried away by the force of the stream This kind of country lasts for a four days passage and the Nile here winds as much as the Maeander There are twelve schoeni which it is necessary to sail through in this manner and after that you will come to a level plain where the Nile flows round an island its name is Tachompso Ethiopians inhabit the country immediately above Elephantine and one half of the island the other half is inhabited by Egyptians Near to this island lies a vast lake on the borders of which Ethiopian nomades dwell After sailing through this lake you will come to the channel of the Nile which flows into it then you will have to land and travel forty days by the side of the river for sharp rocks rise in the Nile and there are many sunken ones through which it is not possible to navigate a boat Having passed this country in the forty days you must go on board another boat and sail for twelve days and then you will arrive at a large city called Meroe this city is said to be the capital of all Ethiopia The inhabitants worship no other gods than Jupiter and Bacchus but these they honour with great magnificence They have also an oracle of Jupiter and they make war whenever that god bids them by an oracular warning and against whatever country he bids them Sailing from this city you will arrive at the country of the Automoli in a space of time equal to that which you took in coming from Elephantine to the capital of the Ethiopians These Automoli are called by the name of Asmak which in the language of Greece signifies those that stand at the left hand of the king These to the number of two hundred and forty thousand of the Egyptian war tribe revolted to the Ethiopians on the following occasion In the reign of King Psammitichus garrisons were stationed at Elephantine against the Ethiopians and another at the Pelusian Daphnae against the Arabians and Syrians and another at Marea against Libya and even in my time garrisons of the Persians are stationed in the same places as they were in the time of Psammitichus for they maintain guards at Elephantine and Daphnae Now these Egyptians after they had been on duty three years were not relieved therefore having consulted together and come to an unanimous resolution they all revolted from Psammitichus and went to Ethiopia Psammitichus hearing of this pursued them and when he overtook them he entreated them by many arguments and adjured them not to forsake the gods of their fathers and their children and wives But one of them is reported to have uncovered and to have said that wheresoever these were there they which it is said that one of them pointed to his privy member and said that wherever this was there would they have both children and wives Macaulay tr published edition censors should find both children and wives These men when they arrived in Ethiopia offered their services to the king of the Ethiopians who made them the following recompense There were certain Ethiopians disaffected towards him these he bade them expel and take possession of their land By the settlement of these men among the Ethiopians the Ethiopians became more civilized and learned the manners of the Egyptians Now for a voyage and land journey of four months the Nile is known in addition to the part f the stream that is in Egypt for upon computation so many months are known to be spent by a person who travels from Elephantine to the Automoli This river flows from the west and the setting of the sun but beyond this no one is able to speak with certainty for the rest of the country is desert by reason of the excessive heat But I have heard the following account from certain Cyrenaeans who say that they went to the oracle of Ammon and had a conversation with Etearchus King of the Ammonians and that among other subjects they happened to discourse about the Nile that nobody knew its sources whereupon Etearchus said that certain Nasamonians once came to him this nation is Lybian and inhabits the Syrtis and the country for no great distance eastward of the Syrtis and that when these Nasamonians arrived and were asked if they could give any further formation touching the deserts of Libya they answered that there were some daring youths amongst them sons of powerful men and that they having reached man s estate formed many other extravagant plans and moreover chose five of their number by lot to explore the deserts of Libya to see if they could make any further discovery than those who had penetrated the farthest For as respects the parts of Libya along the Northern Sea beginning from Egypt to the promontory of Solois where is the extremity of Libya Libyans and various nations of Libyans reach all along it except those parts which are occupied by Grecians and Phoenicians but as respects the parts above the sea and those nations which reach down to the sea in the upper parts Libya is infested by wild beasts and all beyond that is sand dreadfully short of water and utterly desolate They further related that when the young men deputed by their companions set out well furnished with water and provisions they passed first through the inhabited country and having traversed this they came to the region infested by wild beasts and after this they crossed the desert making their way towards the west and when they had traversed much sandy ground during a journey of many days they at length saw some trees growing in a plain and that they approached and began to gather the fruit that grew on the trees and while they were gathering some diminutive men less than men of middle stature came up and having seized them carried them away and that the Nasamonians did not at all understand their language nor those who carried them off the language of the Nasamonians However they conducted them through vast morasses and when they had passed these they came to a city in which all the inhabitants were of the same size as their conductors and black in colour and by the city flowed a great river running from the west to the east and that crocodiles were seen in it Thus far I have set forth the account of Etearchus the Ammonian to which may be added as the Cyrenaeans assured me that he said the Nasamonians all returned safe to their own country and that the men whom they came to were all necromancers Etearchus also conjectured that this river which flows by their city is the Nile and reason so evinces for the Nile flows from Libya and intersects it in the middle and as I conjecture inferring things unknown from things known it sets out from a point corresponding with the Ister For the Ister beginning from the Celts and the city of Pyrene divides Europe in its course but the Celts are beyond the pillars of Hercules and border on the territories of the Cynesians who lie in the extremity of Europe to the westward and the Ister terminates by flowing through all Europe into the Euxine Sea where a Milesian colony is settled in Istria Now the Ister as it flows through a well peopled country is generally known but no one is able to speak about the sources of the Nile because Libya through which it flows is uninhabited and desolate Respecting this stream therefore as far as I was able to reach by inquiry I have already spoken It however discharges itself into Egypt and Egypt lies as near as may be opposite to the mountains of Cilicia from whence to Sinope on the Euxine Sea is a five days journey in a straight line to an active man and Sinope is opposite to the Ister where it discharges itself into the sea So I think that the Nile traversing the whole of Libya may be properly compared with the Ister Such then is the account that I am able to give respecting the Nile end of Herodotus s account two Webb s River must be traced to its connection with some portion of the old Nile When these two things have been accomplished then and not till then can the mystery of the Nile be explained The two countries through which the marvellous lacustrine river the Lualaba flows with its manifold lakes and broad expanse of water are Rua the Uruwwa of Speke and Manyuema For the first time Europe is made aware that between the Tanganika and the known sources of the Congo there exist teeming millions of the negro race who never saw or heard of the white people who make such a noisy and busy stir outside of Africa Upon the minds of those who had the good fortune to see the first specimen of these remarkable white races in doctor Livingstone he seems to have made a favourable impression though through misunderstanding his object and coupling him with the Arabs who make horrible work there his life was sought after more than once These two extensive countries Rua and Manyuema are populated by true heathens governed not as the sovereignties of Karagwah Urundi and Uganda by despotic kings but each village by its own sultan or lord Thirty miles outside of their own immediate settlements the most intelligent of these small chiefs seem to know nothing Thirty miles from the Lualaba there were but few people who had ever heard of the great river Such ignorance among the natives of their own country naturally increased the labours of Livingstone Compared with these all tribes and nations in Africa with whom Livingstone came in contact may be deemed civilized yet in the arts of home manufacture these wild people of Manyuema were far superior to any he had seen Where other tribes and nations contented themselves with hides and skins of animals thrown negligently over their shoulders the people of Manyuema manufactured a cloth from fine grass which may favorably compare with the finest grass cloth of India They also know the art of dyeing them in various colours black yellow and purple The Wangwana or freed men of Zanzibar struck with the beauty of the fabric eagerly exchange their cotton cloths for fine grass cloth and on almost every black man from Manyuema I have seen this native cloth converted into elegantly made damirs Arabic short jackets These countries are also very rich in ivory The fever for going to Manyuema to exchange tawdry beads for its precious tusks is of the same kind as that which impelled men to go to the gulches and placers of California Colorado Montana and Idaho after nuggets to Australia and diamonds to Cape Colony Manyuema is at present the El Dorado of the Arab and the Wamrima tribes It is only about four years since that the first Arab returned from Manyuema with such wealth of ivory and reports about the fabulous quantities found there that ever since the old beaten tracks of Karagwah Uganda Ufipa and Marungu have been comparatively deserted The people of Manyuema ignorant of the value of the precious article reared their huts upon ivory stanchions Ivory pillars were common sights in Manyuema and hearing of these one can no longer wonder at the ivory palace of Solomon For generations they have used ivory tusks as door posts and supports to the eaves until they had become perfectly rotten and worthless But the advent of the Arabs soon taught them the value of the article It has now risen considerably in price though still fabulously cheap At Zanzibar the value of ivory per frasilah of thirty five lbs weight is from fifty dollars to sixty dollars according to its quality In Unyanyembe it is about one dollar ten per pound but in Manyuema it may be purchased for from half a cent to fourteen cent s worth of copper per pound of ivory The Arabs however have the knack of spoiling markets by their rapacity and cruelty With muskets a small party of Arabs is invincible against such people as those of Manyuema who until lately never heard the sound of a gun The discharge of a musket inspires mortal terror in them and it is almost impossible to induce them to face the muzzle of a gun They believe that the Arabs have stolen the lightning and that against such people the bow and arrow can have little effect They are by no means devoid of courage and they have often declared that were it not for the guns not one Arab would leave the country alive this tends to prove that they would willingly engage in fight with the strangers who had made themselves so detestable were it not that the startling explosion of gunpowder inspires them with terror Into what country soever the Arabs enter they contrive to render their name and race abominated But the mainspring of it all is not the Arab s nature colour or name but simply the slave trade So long as the slave trade is permitted to be kept up at Zanzibar so long will these otherwise enterprising people the Arabs kindle gainst them the hatred of the natives throughout Africa On the main line of travel from Zanzibar into the interior of Africa these acts of cruelty are unknown for the very good reason that the natives having been armed with guns and taught how to use those weapons are by no means loth to do so whenever an opportunity presents itself When too late they have perceived their folly in selling guns to the natives the Arabs now begin to vow vengeance on the person who will in future sell a gun to a native But they are all guilty of the same mistake and it is strange they did not perceive that it was folly when they were doing so In former days the Arab when protected by his slave escort armed with guns could travel through Useguhha Urori Ukonongo Ufipa Karagwah Unyoro and Uganda with only a stick in his hand now however it is impossible for him or any one else to do so Every step he takes armed or unarmed is fraught with danger The Waseguhha near the coast detain him and demand the tribute or give him the option of war entering Ugogo he is subjected every day to the same oppressive demand or to the fearful alternative The Wanyamwezi also show their readiness to take the same advantage the road to Karagwah is besieged with difficulties the terrible Mirambo stands in the way defeats their combined forces with ease and makes raids even to the doors of their houses in Unyanyembe and should they succeed in passing Mirambo a chief Swaruru stands before them who demands tribute by the bale and against whom it is useless to contend These remarks have reference to the slave trade inaugurated in Manyuema by the Arabs Harassed on the road between Zanzibar and Unyanyembe by minatory natives who with bloody hands are ready to avenge the slightest affront the Arabs have refrained from kidnapping between the Tanganika and the sea but in Manyuema where the natives are timid irresolute and divided into small weak tribes they recover their audacity and exercise their kidnapping propensities unchecked The accounts which the Doctor brings from that new region are most deplorable He was an unwilling spectator of a horrible deed a massacre committed on the inhabitants of a populous district who had assembled in the market place on the banks of the Lualaba as they had been accustomed to do for ages It seems that the Wamanyuema are very fond of marketing believing it to be the summum bonum of human enjoyment They find endless pleasure in chaffering with might and main for the least mite of their currency the last bead and when they gain the point to which their peculiar talents are devoted they feel intensely happy The women are excessively fond of this marketing and as they are very beautiful the market place must possess considerable attractions for the male sex It was on such a day amidst such a scene that Tagamoyo a half caste Arab with his armed slave escort commenced an indiscriminate massacre by firing volley after volley into the dense mass of human beings It is supposed that there were about two thousand present and at the first sound of the firing these poor people all made a rush for their canoes In the fearful hurry to avoid being shot the canoes were paddled away by the first fortunate few who got possession of them those that were not so fortunate sprang into the deep waters of the Lualaba and though many of them became an easy prey to the voracious crocodiles which swarmed to the scene the majority received their deaths from the bullets of the merciless Tagamoyo and his villanous band The Doctor believes as do the Arabs themselves that about four hundred people mostly women and children lost their lives while many more were made slaves This outrage is only one of many such he has unwillingly witnessed and he is utterly unable to describe the feelings of loathing he feels for the inhuman perpetrators Slaves from Manyuema command a higher price than those of any other country because of their fine forms and general docility The women the Doctor said repeatedly are remarkably pretty creatures and have nothing except the hair in common with the negroes of the West Coast They are of very light colour have fine noses well cut and not over full lips while the prognathous jaw is uncommon These women are eagerly sought after as wives by the half castes of the East Coast and even the pure Omani Arabs do not disdain to take them in marriage To the north of Manyuema Livingstone came to the light complexioned race of the colour of Portuguese or our own Louisiana quadroons who are very fine people and singularly remarkable for commercial cuteness and sagacity The women are expert divers for oysters which are found in great abundance in the Lualaba Rua at a place called Katanga is rich in copper The copper mines of this place have been worked for ages In the bed of a stream gold has been found washed down in pencil shaped pieces or in particles as large as split peas Two Arabs have gone thither to prospect for this metal but as they are ignorant of the art of gulch mining it is scarcely possible that they will succeed From these highly important and interesting discoveries doctor Livingstone was turned back when almost on the threshold of success by the positive refusal of his men to accompany him further They were afraid to go on unless accompanied by a large force of men and as these were not procurable in Manyuema the Doctor reluctantly turned his face towards Ujiji It was a long and weary road back The journey had now no interest for him He had travelled the road before when going westward full of high hopes and aspirations impatient to reach the goal which promised him rest from his labors now returning unsuccessful baffled and thwarted when almost in sight of the end and having to travel the same path back on foot with disappointed expectations and defeated hopes preying on his mind no wonder that the old brave spirit almost succumbed and the strong constitution almost went to wreck Livingstone arrived at Ujiji October sixteenth almost at death s door On the way he had been trying to cheer himself up since he had found it impossible to contend against the obstinacy of his men with It won t take long five or six months more it matters not since it cannot be helped I have got my goods in Ujiji and can hire other people and make a new start again These are the words and hopes by which he tried to delude himself into the idea that all would be right yet but imagine the shock he must have suffered when he found that the man to whom was entrusted his goods for safe keeping had sold every bale for ivory The evening of the day Livingstone had returned to Ujiji Susi and Chuma two of his most faithful men were seen crying bitterly The Doctor asked of them what ailed them and was then informed for the first time of the evil tidings that awaited him Said they All our things are sold sir Sherif has sold everything for ivory Later in the evening Sherif came to see him and shamelessly offered his hand but Livingstone repulsed him saying he could not shake hands with a thief As an excuse Sherif said he had divined on the Koran and that this had told him the Hakim Arabic for Doctor was dead Livingstone was now destitute he had just enough to keep him and his men alive for about a month when he would be forced to beg from the Arabs The Doctor further stated that when Speke gives the altitude of the Tanganika at only eighteen hundred feet above the sea Speke must have fallen into that error by a frequent writing of the Anne Domini a mere slip of the pen for the altitude as he makes it out is twenty eight hundred feet by boiling point and a little over three thousand feet by barometer The Doctor s complaints were many because slaves were sent to him in charge of goods after he had so often implored the people at Zanzibar to send him freemen A very little effort on the part of those entrusted with the despatch of supplies to him might have enabled them to procure good and faithful freemen but if they contented themselves upon the receipt of a letter from doctor Livingstone with sending to Ludha Damji for men it is no longer a matter of wonder that dishonest and incapable slaves were sent forward It is no new fact that the Doctor has discovered when he states that a negro freeman is a hundred times more capable and trustworthy than a slave Centuries ago Eumaeus the herdsman said to Ulysses Jove fixed it certain that whatever day Makes man a slave takes half his worth away We passed several happy days at Ujiji and it was time we were now preparing for our cruise on the Tanganika Livingstone was improving every day under the different diet which my cook furnished him I could give him no such suppers as that which Jupiter and Mercury received at the cottage of Baucis and Philemon We had no berries of chaste Minerva pickled cherries endive radishes dried figs dates fragrant apples and grapes but we had cheese and butter which I made myself new laid eggs chickens roast mutton fish from the lake rich curds and cream wine from the Guinea palm egg plants cucumbers sweet potatoes pea nuts and beans white honey from Ukaranga luscious singwe a plum like fruit from the forests of Ujiji and corn scones and dampers in place of wheaten bread During the noontide heats we sat under our veranda discussing our various projects and in the early morning and evening we sought the shores of the lake promenading up and down the beach to breathe the cool breezes which ruffled the surface of the water and rolled the unquiet surf far up on the smooth and whitened shore It was the dry season and we had most lovely weather the temperature never was over eighty degrees in the shade The market place overlooking the broad silver water afforded us amusement and instruction Representatives of most of the tribes dwelling near the lake were daily found there There were the agricultural and pastoral Wajiji with their flocks and herds there were the fishermen from Ukaranga and Kaole from beyond Bangwe and even from Urundi with their whitebait which they called dogara the silurus the perch and other fish there were the palm oil merchants principally from Ujiji and Urundi with great five gallon pots full of reddish oil of the consistency of butter there were the salt merchants from the salt plains of Uvinza and Uhha there were the ivory merchants from Uvira and Usowa there were the canoe makers from Ugoma and Urundi there were the cheap Jack pedlers from Zanzibar selling flimsy prints and brokers exchanging blue mutunda beads for sami sami and sungomazzi and sofi The sofi beads are like pieces of thick clay pipe stem about half an inch long and are in great demand here Here were found Waguhha Wamanyuema Wagoma Wavira Wasige Warundi Wajiji Waha Wavinza Wasowa Wangwana Wakawendi Arabs and Wasawahili engaged in noisy chaffer and barter Bareheaded and almost barebodied the youths made love to the dark skinned and woolly headed Phyllises who knew not how to blush at the ardent gaze of love as their white sisters old matrons gossiped as the old women do everywhere the children played and laughed and struggled as children of our own lands and the old men leaning on their spears or bows were just as garrulous in the Place de Ujiji as aged elders in other climes CHAPTER XIII OUR CRUISE ON THE LAKE TANGANIKA EXPLORATION OF THE NORTH END OF THE LAKE THE RUSIZI IS DISCOVERED TO ENTER INTO THE LAKE RETURN TO UJIJI I distinctly deny that any misleading by my instructions from the Royal Geographical Society as to the position of the White Nile made me unconscious of the vast importance of ascertaining the direction of the Rusizi River The fact is we did our best to reach it and we failed Burton s Zanzibar The universal testimony of the natives to the Rusizi River being an influent is the most conclusive argument that it does run out of the lake Speke I therefore claim for Lake Tanganika the honour of being the SOUTHERNMOST RESERVOIR OF THE NILE until some more positive evidence by actual observation shall otherwise determine it Findlay R G S Had Livingstone and myself after making up our minds to visit the northern head of the Lake Tanganika been compelled by the absurd demands or fears of a crew of Wajiji to return to Unyanyembe without having resolved the problem of the Rusizi River we had surely deserved to be greeted by everybody at home with a universal giggling and cackling But captain Burton s failure to settle it by engaging Wajiji and that ridiculous savage chief Kannena had warned us of the negative assistance we could expect from such people for the solution of a geographical problem We had enough good sailors with us who were entirely under our commands Could we but procure the loan of a canoe we thought all might be well Upon application to Sayd bin Majid he at once generously permitted us to use his canoe for any service for which we might require it After engaging two Wajiji guides at two doti each we prepared to sail from the port of Ujiji in about a week or so after my entrance into Ujiji I have already stated how it was that the Doctor and I undertook the exploration of the northern half of the Tanganika and the River Rusizi about which so much had been said and written Before embarking on this enterprise doctor Livingstone had not definitely made up his mind which course he should take as his position was truly deplorable His servants consisted of Susi Chumah Hamoydah Gardner and Halimah the female cook and wife of Hamoydah to these was added Kaif Halek the man whom I compelled to follow me from Unyanyembe to deliver the Livingstone letters to his master Whither could doctor Livingstone march with these few men and the few table cloths and beads that remained to him from the store squandered by the imbecile Sherif This was a puzzling question Had doctor Livingstone been in good health his usual hardihood and indomitable spirit had answered it in a summary way He might have borrowed some cloth from Sayd bin Majid at an exorbitant price sufficient to bring him to Unyanyembe and the sea coast But how long would he have been compelled to sit down at Ujiji waiting and waiting for the goods that were said to be at Unyanyembe a prey to high expectations hoping day after day that the war would end hoping week after week to hear that his goods were coming Who knows how long his weak health had borne up against the several disappointments to which he would be subjected Though it was with all due deference to doctor Livingstone s vast experience as a traveller I made bold to suggest the following courses to him either of which he could adopt Ist To go home and take the rest he so well deserved and as he appeared then to be so much in need of second To proceed to Unyanyembe receive his goods and enlist pagazis sufficient to enable him to travel anywhere either to Manyuema or Rua and settle the Nile problem which he said he was in a fair way of doing third To proceed to Unyanyembe receive his caravan enlist men and try to join Sir Samuel Baker either by going to Muanza and sailing through Ukerewe or Victoria N Yanza in my boats which I should put up to Mtesa s palace at Uganda thus passing by Mirambo and Swaruru of Usui who would rob him if he took the usual caravan road to Uganda thence from Mtesa to Kamrasi King of Unyoro where he would of course hear of the great white man who was said to be with a large force of men at Gondokoro fourth To proceed to Unyanyembe receive his caravan enlist men and return to Ujiji and back to Manyuema by way of Uguhha fifth To proceed by way of the Rusizi through Ruanda and so on to Itara Unyoro and Baker For either course whichever he thought most expedient I and my men would assist him as escort and carriers to the best of our ability If he should elect to go home I informed him I should be proud to escort him and consider myself subject to his commands travelling only when he desired and camping only when he gave the word sixth The last course which I suggested to him was to permit me to escort him to Unyanyembe where he could receive his own goods and where I could deliver up to him a large supply of first class cloth and beads guns and ammunition cooking utensils clothing boats tents c and where he could rest in a comfortable house while I would hurry down to the coast organise a new expedition composed of fifty or sixty faithful men well armed by whom I could send an additional supply of needful luxuries in the shape of creature comforts After long consideration he resolved to adopt the last course as it appeared to him to be the most feasible one and the best though he did not hesitate to comment upon the unaccountable apathy of his agent at Zanzibar which had caused him so much trouble and vexation and weary marching of hundreds of miles Our ship though nothing more than a cranky canoe hollowed out of a noble mvule tree of Ugoma was an African Argo bound on a nobler enterprise than its famous Grecian prototype We were bound upon no mercenary errand after no Golden Fleece but perhaps to discover a highway for commerce which should bring the ships of the Nile up to Ujiji Usowa and far Marungu We did not know what we might discover on our voyage to the northern head of the Tanganika we supposed that we should find the Rusizi to be an effluent of the Tanganika flowing down to the Albert or the Victoria N Yanza We were told by natives and Arabs that the Rusizi ran out of the lake Sayd bin Majid had stated that his canoe would carry twenty five men and three thousand five hundred lbs of ivory Acting upon this information we embarked twenty five men several of whom had stored away bags of salt for the purposes of trade with the natives but upon pushing off from the shore near Ujiji we discovered the boat was too heavily laden and was down to the gunwale Returning in shore we disembarked six men and unloaded the bags of salt which left us with sixteen rowers Selim Ferajji the cook and the two Wajiji guides Having thus properly trimmed our boat we again pushed off and steered her head for Bangwe Island which was distant four or five miles from the Bunder of Ujiji While passing this island the guides informed us that the Arabs and Wajiji took shelter on it during an incursion of the Watuta which took place some years ago when they came and invaded Ujiji and massacred several of the inhabitants Those who took refuge on the island were the only persons who escaped the fire and sword with which the Watuta had visited Ujiji After passing the island and following the various bends and indentations of the shore we came in sight of the magnificent bay of Kigoma which strikes one at once as being an excellent harbor from the variable winds which blow over the Tanganika About ten A M we drew in towards the village of Kigoma as the east wind was then rising and threatened to drive us to sea With those travelling parties who are not in much hurry Kigoma is always the first port for canoes bound north from Ujiji The next morning at dawn we struck tent stowed baggage cooked and drank coffee and set off northward again The lake was quite calm its waters of a dark green colour reflected the serene blue sky above The hippopotami came up to breathe in alarmingly close proximity to our canoe and then plunged their heads again as if they were playing hide and seek with us Arriving opposite the high wooded hills of Bemba and being a mile from shore we thought it a good opportunity to sound the depth of the water whose colour seemed to indicate great depth We found thirty five fathoms at this place Our canoeing of this day was made close in shore with a range of hills beautifully wooded and clothed with green grass sloping abruptly almost precipitously into the depths of the fresh water sea towering immediately above us and as we rounded the several capes or points roused high expectations of some new wonder or some exquisite picture being revealed as the deep folds disclosed themselves to us Nor were we disappointed The wooded hills with a wealth of boscage of beautiful trees many of which were in bloom and crowned with floral glory exhaling an indescribably sweet fragrance lifting their heads in varied contour one pyramidal another a truncated cone one table topped another ridgy like the steep roof of a church one a glorious heave with an even outline another jagged and savage interested us considerably and the pretty pictures exquisitely pretty at the head of the several bays evoked many an exclamation of admiration It was the most natural thing in the world that I should feel deepest admiration for these successive pictures of quiet scenic beauty but the Doctor had quite as much to say about them as I had myself though as one might imagine satiated with pictures of this kind far more beautiful far more wonderful he should long ago have expended all his powers of admiring scenes in nature From Bagamoyo to Ujiji I had seen nothing to compare to them none of these fishing settlements under the shade of a grove of palms and plantains banians and mimosa with cassava gardens to the right and left of palmy forests and patches of luxuriant grain looking down upon a quiet bay whose calm waters at the early morn reflected the beauties of the hills which sheltered them from the rough and boisterous tempests that so often blew without The fishermen evidently think themselves comfortably situated The lake affords them all the fish they require more than enough to eat and the industrious a great deal to sell The steep slopes of the hills cultivated by the housewives contribute plenty of grain such as dourra and Indian corn besides cassava ground nuts or peanuts and sweet potatoes The palm trees afford oil and the plantains an abundance of delicious fruit The ravines and deep gullies supply them with the tall shapely trees from which they cut out their canoes Nature has supplied them bountifully with all that a man s heart or stomach can desire It is while looking at what seems both externally and internally complete and perfect happiness that the thought occurs how must these people sigh when driven across the dreary wilderness that intervenes between the lake country and the sea coast for such homes as these those unfortunates who bought by the Arabs for a couple of doti are taken away to Zanzibar to pick cloves or do hamal work As we drew near Niasanga our second camp the comparison between the noble array of picturesque hills and receding coves with their pastoral and agricultural scenes and the shores of old Pontus was very great A few minutes before we hauled our canoe ashore two little incidents occurred I shot an enormous dog faced monkey which measured from nose to end of tail four feet nine inches the face was eight one two inches long its body weighed about one hundred lbs It had no mane or tuft at end of tail but the body was covered with long wiry hair Numbers of these specimens were seen as well as of the active cat headed and long tailed smaller ones The other was the sight of a large lizard about two fort six in long which waddled into cover before we had well noticed it The Doctor thought it to be the Monitor terrestris We encamped under a banian tree our surroundings were the now light grey waters of the Tanganika an amphitheatral range of hills and the village of Niasanga situated at the mouth of the rivulet Niasanga with its grove of palms thicket of plantains and plots of grain and cassava fields Near our tent were about half a dozen canoes large and small belonging to the villagers Our tent door fronted the glorious expanse of fresh water inviting the breeze and the views of distant Ugoma and Ukaramba and the Island of Muzimu whose ridges appeared of a deep blue colour At our feet were the clean and well washed pebbles borne upward into tiny lines and heaps by the restless surf A search amongst these would reveal to us the material of the mountain heaps which rose behind and on our right and left there was schist conglomerate sandstone a hard white clay an ochreish clay containing much iron polished quartz c Looking out of our tent we could see a line on each side of us of thick tall reeds which form something like a hedge between the beach and the cultivated area around Niasanga Among birds seen here the most noted were the merry wagtails which are regarded as good omens and messengers of peace by the natives and any harm done unto them is quickly resented and is fineable Except to the mischievously inclined they offer no inducement to commit violence On landing they flew to meet us balancing themselves in the air in front within easy reach of our hands The other birds were crows turtle doves fish hawks kingfishers ibis nigra and ibis religiosa flocks of whydah birds geese darters paddy birds kites and eagles At this place the Doctor suffered from dysentery it is his only weak point he says and as I afterwards found it is a frequent complaint with him Whatever disturbed his mind or any irregularity in eating was sure to end in an attack of dysentery which had lately become of a chronic character The third day of our journey on the Tanganika brought us to Zassi River and village after a four hours pull Along the line of road the mountains rose two thousand and twenty five hundred feet above the waters of the lake I imagined the scenery getting more picturesque and animated at every step and thought it by far lovelier than anything seen near Lake George or on the Hudson The cosy nooks at the head of the many small bays constitute most admirable pictures filled in as they are with the ever beautiful feathery palms and broad green plantain fronds These nooks have all been taken possession of by fishermen and their conically beehive shaped huts always peep from under the frondage The shores are thus extremely populous every terrace small plateau and bit of level ground is occupied Zassi is easily known by a group of conical hills which rise near by and are called Kirassa Opposite to these at the distance of about a mile from shore we sounded and obtained thirty five fathoms as on the previous day Getting out a mile further I let go the whole length of my line one hundred fifteen fathoms and obtained no bottom In drawing it up again the line parted and I lost the lead with three fourths of the line The Doctor stated apropos of this that he had sounded opposite the lofty Kabogo south of Ujiji and obtained the great depth of three hundred fathoms He also lost his lead and one hundred fathoms of his line but he had nearly nine hundred fathoms left and this was in the canoes We hope to use this long sounding line in going across from the eastern to the western shore On the fourth day we arrived at Nyabigma a sandy island in Urundi We had passed the boundary line between Ujiji and Urundi half an hour before arriving at Nyabigma The Mshala River is considered by both nations to be the proper divisional line though there are parties of Warundi who have emigrated beyond the frontier into Ujiji for instance the Mutware and villagers of populous Kagunga distant an hour north from Zassi There are also several small parties of Wajiji who have taken advantage of the fine lands in the deltas of the Kasokwe Namusinga and Luaba Rivers the two first of which enter the Tanganika in this bay near the head of which Nyabigma is situated From Nyabigma a pretty good view of the deep curve in the great mountain range which stretches from Cape Kazinga and terminates at Cape Kasofu may be obtained a distance of twenty or twenty five miles It is a most imposing scene this great humpy ridgy and irregular line of mountains Deep ravines and chasms afford outlets to the numerous streams and rivers which take their rise in the background the pale fleecy ether almost always shrouds its summit From its base extends a broad alluvial plain rich beyond description teeming with palms and plantains and umbrageous trees Villages are seen in clusters everywhere Into this alluvial plain run the Luaba or Ruaba River on the north side of Cape Kitunda and the Kasokwe Namusinga and Mshala Rivers on the south side of the cape All the deltas of rivers emptying into the Tanganika are hedged in on all sides with a thick growth of matete a gigantic species of grass and papyrus In some deltas as that of Luaba and Kasokwe morasses have been formed in which the matete and papyrus jungle is impenetrable In the depths of them are quiet and deep pools frequented by various aquatic birds such as geese ducks snipes widgeons kingfishers and ibis cranes and storks and pelicans To reach their haunts is however a work of great difficulty to the sportsman in quest of game a work often attended with great danger from the treacherous nature of these morasses as well as from the dreadful attacks of fever which in these regions invariably follow wet feet and wet clothes At Nyabigma we prepared by distributing ten rounds of ammunition to each of our men for a tussle with the Warundi of two stages ahead should they invite it by a too forward exhibition of their prejudice to strangers At dawn of the fifth day we quitted the haven of Nyabigma Island and in less than an hour had arrived off Cape Kitunda This cape is a low platform of conglomerate sandstone extending for about eight miles from the base of the great mountain curve which gives birth to the Luaba and its sister streams Crossing the deep bay at the head of which is the delta of the Luaba we came to Cape Kasofu Villages are numerous in this vicinity From hence we obtained a view of a series of points or capes Kigongo Katunga and Buguluka all of which we passed before coming to a halt at the pretty position of Mukungu At Mukungu where we stopped on the fifth day we were asked for honga or tribute The cloth and beads upon which we subsisted during our lake voyage were mine but the Doctor being the elder of the two more experienced and the big man of the party had the charge of satisfying all such demands Many and many a time had I gone through the tedious and soul wearying task of settling the honga and I was quite curious to see how the great traveller would perform the work The Mateko a man inferior to a Mutware of Mukungu asked for two and a half doti This was the extent of the demand which he made known to us a little after dark The Doctor asked if nothing had been brought to us He was answered No it was too late to get anything now but if we paid the honga the Mateko would be ready to give us something when we came back Livingstone upon hearing this smiled and the Mateko being then and there in front of him he said to him Well if you can t get us anything now and intend to give something when we return we had better keep the honga until then The Mateko was rather taken aback at this and demurred to any such proposition Seeing that he was dissatisfied we urged him to bring one sheep one little sheep for our stomachs were nearly empty having been waiting more than half a day for it The appeal was successful for the old man hastened and brought us a lamb and a three gallon pot of sweet but strong zogga or palm toddy and in return the Doctor gave him two and a half doti of cloth The lamb was killed and our digestions being good its flesh agreed with us but alas for the effects of zogga or palm toddy Susi the invaluable adjunct of doctor Livingstone and Bombay the headman of my caravan were the two charged with watching the canoe but having imbibed too freely of this intoxicating toddy they slept heavily and in the morning the Doctor and I had to regret the loss of several valuable and indispensable things among which may be mentioned the Doctor s nine hundred fathom sounding line five hundred rounds of pin rim and central fire cartridges for my arms and ninety musket bullets also belonging to me Besides these which were indispensable in hostile Warundi a large bag of flour and the Doctor s entire stock of white sugar were stolen This was the third time that my reliance in Bombay s trustworthiness resulted in a great loss to me and for the ninety ninth time I had to regret bitterly having placed such entire confidence in Speke s loud commendation of him It was only the natural cowardice of ignorant thieves that prevented the savages from taking the boat and its entire contents together with Bombay and Susi as slaves I can well imagine the joyful surprise which must have been called forth at the sight and exquisite taste of the Doctor s sugar and the wonder with which they must have regarded the strange ammunition of the Wasungu It is to be sincerely hoped that they did not hurt themselves with the explosive bullets and rim cartridges through any ignorance of the nature of the deadly contents in which ease the box and its contents would prove a very Pandora s casket Much grieved at our loss we set off on the sixth day at the usual hour on our watery journey We coasted close to the several low headlands formed by the rivers Kigwena Kikuma and Kisunwe and when any bay promised to be interesting steered the canoe according to its indentations While travelling on the water each day brought forth similar scenes on our right rose the mountains of Urundi now and then disclosing the ravines through which the several rivers and streams issued into the great lake at their base were the alluvial plains where flourished the oil palm and grateful plantain while scores of villages were grouped under their shade Now and then we passed long narrow strips of pebbly or sandy beach whereon markets were improvised for selling fish and the staple products of the respective communities Then we passed broad swampy morasses formed by the numerous streams which the mountains discharged where the matete and papyrus flourished Now the mountains approached to the water their sides descending abruptly to the water s edge then they receded into deep folds at the base of which was sure to be seen an alluvial plain from one to eight miles broad Almost constantly we observed canoes being punted vigorously close to the surf in fearless defiance of a catastrophe such as a capsize and gobbling up by voracious crocodiles Sometimes we sighted a canoe a short distance ahead of us whereupon our men with song and chorus would exert themselves to the utmost to overtake it Upon observing our efforts the natives would bend themselves to their tasks and paddling standing and stark naked give us ample opportunities for studying at our leisure comparative anatomy Or we saw a group of fishermen lazily reclining in puris naturalibus on the beach regarding with curious eye the canoes as they passed their neighbourhood then we passed a flotilla of canoes their owners sitting quietly in their huts busily plying the rod and hook or casting their nets or a couple of men arranging their long drag nets close in shore for a haul or children sporting fearlessly in the water with their mothers looking on approvingly from under the shade of a tree from which I infer that there are not many crocodiles in the lake except in the neighbourhood of the large rivers After passing the low headland of Kisunwe formed by the Kisunwe River we came in view of Murembwe Cape distant about four or five miles the intervening ground being low land a sandy and pebbly beach Close to the beach are scores of villages while the crowded shore indicates the populousness of the place beyond About half way between Cape Kisunwe and Murembwe is a cluster of villages called Bikari which has a mutware who is in the habit of taking honga As we were rendered unable to cope for any length of time with any mischievously inclined community all villages having a bad reputation with the Wajiji were avoided by us But even the Wajiji guides were sometimes mistaken and led us more than once into dangerous places The guides evidently had no objections to halt at Bikari as it was the second camp from Mukungu because with them a halt in the cool shade of plaintains was infinitely preferable to sitting like carved pieces of wood in a cranky canoe But before they stated their objections and preferences the Bikari people called to us in a loud voice to come ashore threatening us with the vengeance of the great Wami if we did not halt As the voices were anything but siren like we obstinately refused to accede to the request Finding threats of no avail they had recourse to stones and accordingly flung them at us in a most hearty manner As one came within a foot of my arm I suggested that a bullet be sent in return in close proximity to their feet but Livingstone though he said nothing yet showed plainly enough that he did not quite approve of this As these demonstrations of hostility were anything but welcome and as we saw signs of it almost every time we came opposite a village we kept on our way until we came to Murembwe Point which being a delta of a river of the same name was well protected by a breadth of thorny jungle spiky cane and a thick growth of reed and papyrus from which the boldest Mrundi might well shrink especially if he called to mind that beyond this inhospitable swamp were the guns of the strangers his like had so rudely challenged We drew our canoe ashore here and on a limited area of clean sand Ferajji our rough and ready cook lit his fire and manufactured for us a supply of most delicious Mocha coffee Despite the dangers which still beset us we were quite happy and seasoned our meal with a little moral philosophy which lifted us unconsciously into infinitely superior beings to the pagans by whom we were surrounded upon whom we now looked down under the influence of Mocha coffee and moral philosophy with calm contempt not unmixed with a certain amount of compassion The Doctor related some experiences he had had among people of similar disposition but did not fail to ascribe them with the wisdom of a man of ripe experiences to the unwise conduct of the Arabs and half castes in this opinion I unreservedly concur From Murembwe Point having finished our coffee and ended our discourse on ethics we proceeded on our voyage steering for Cape Sentakeyi which though it was eight or ten miles away we hoped to make before dark The Wangwana pulled with right good will but ten hours went by and night was drawing near and we were still far from Sentakeyi As it was a fine moonlight night and we were fully alive to the dangerous position in which we might find ourselves they consented to pull an hour or two more About one P M we pulled in shore for a deserted spot a clean shelf of sand about thirty feet long by ten deep from which a clay bank rose about ten or twelve feet above while on each side there were masses of disintegrated rock Here we thought that by preserving some degree of silence we might escape observation and consequent annoyance for a few hours when being rested we might continue our journey Our kettle was boiling for tea and the men had built a little fire for themselves and had filled their black earthen pot with water for porridge when our look outs perceived dark forms creeping towards our bivouac Being hailed they at once came forward and saluted us with the native Wake Our guides explained that we were Wangwana and intended to camp until morning when if they had anything to sell we should be glad to trade with them They said they were rejoiced to hear this and after they had exchanged a few words more during which time we observed that they were taking mental notes of the camp they went away Upon leaving they promised to return in the morning with food and make friends with us While drinking our tea the look outs warned us of the approach of a second party which went through the same process of saluting and observing as the first had done These also went away over exuberant as I thought and were shortly succeeded by a third party who came and went as the others had From all this we inferred that the news was spreading rapidly through the villages about and we had noticed two canoes passing backwards and forwards with rather more haste than we deemed usual or necessary We had good cause to be suspicious it is not customary for people at least between Ujiji and Zanzibar to be about visiting and saluting after dark under any pretence it is not permitted to persons to prowl about camp after dark without being shot at and this going backward and forward this ostentatious exuberance of joy at the arrival of a small party of Wangwana which in many parts of Urundi would be regarded as a very common event was altogether very suspicious While the Doctor and I were arriving at the conclusion that these movements were preliminary to or significant of hostility a fourth body very boisterous and loud came and visited us Our supper had been by this time despatched and we thought it high time to act The fourth party having gone with extravagant manifestations of delight the men were hurried into the canoe and when all were seated and the look outs embarked we quietly pushed off but not a moment too soon As the canoe was gliding from the darkened light that surrounded us I called the Doctor s attention to several dark forms some of whom were crouching behind the rocks on our right and others scrambling over them to obtain good or better positions at the same time people were approaching from the left of our position in the same suspicious way and directly a voice hailed us from the top of the clay bank overhanging the sandy shelf where we had lately been resting Neatly done cried the Doctor as we were shooting through the water leaving the discomfited would be robbers behind us Here again my hand was stayed from planting a couple of good shots as a warning to them in future from molesting strangers by the more presence of the Doctor who as I thought if it were actually necessary would not hesitate to give the word After pulling six hours more during which we had rounded Cape Sentakeyi we stopped at the small fishing village of Mugeyo where we were permitted to sleep unmolested At dawn we continued our journey and about eight A M arrived at the village of the friendly Mutware of Magala We had pulled for eighteen hours at a stretch which at the rate of two miles and a half per hour would make forty five miles Taking bearings from our camp at Cape Magala one of the most prominent points in travelling north from Ujiji we found that the large island of Muzimu which had been in sight ever since rounding Cape Bangwe near Ujiji Bunder bore about south south west and that the western shore had considerably approached to the eastern the breadth of the lake being at this point about eight or ten miles We had a good view of the western highlands which seemed to be of an average height about three thousand feet above the lake Luhanga Peak rising a little to the north of west from Magala might be about five hundred feet higher and Sumburizi a little north of Luhanga where lived Mruta Sultan of Uvira the country opposite to this part of Urundi about three hundred feet higher than the neighbouring heights Northward from Magala Cape the lake streamed away between two chains of mountains both meeting in a point about thirty miles north of us The Warundi of Magala were very civil and profound starers They flocked around the tent door and most pertinaciously gazed on us as if we were subjects of most intense interest but liable to sudden and eternal departure The Mutware came to see us late in the afternoon dressed with great pomp He turned out to be a boy whom I had noticed in the crowd of gazers for his good looks and fine teeth which he showed being addicted to laughing continually There was no mistaking him though he was now decorated with many ivory ornaments with necklaces and with heavy brass bracelets and iron wire anklets Our admiration of him was reciprocated and in return for our two doti of cloth and a fundo of samsam he gave a fine fat and broad tailed sheep and a pot of milk In our condition both were extremely acceptable At Magala we heard of a war raging between Mukamba for whose country we were bound and Warumashanya a Sultan of an adjoining district and we were advised that unless we intended to assist one of these chiefs against the other it would be better for us to return But as we had started to solve the problem of the Rusizi River such considerations had no weight with us On the eighth morning from leaving Ujiji we bade farewell to the hospitable people of Magala and set off for Mukamba s country which was in view Soon after passing the boundary between Urundi proper and what is known as Usige a storm from the south west arose and the fearful yawing of our canoe into the wave trough warned us from proceeding further so we turned her head for Kisuka village about four miles north where Mugere in Usige begins At Kisuka a Mgwana living with Mukamba came to see us and gave us details of the war between Mukamba and Warumashanya from which it seemed that these two chiefs were continually at loggerheads It is a tame way of fighting after all One chief makes a raid into the other s country and succeeds in making off with a herd of cattle killing one or two men who have been surprised Weeks or perhaps months elapse before the other retaliates and effects a capture in a similar way and then a balance is struck in which neither is the gainer Seldom do they attack each other with courage and hearty goodwill the constitution of the African being decidedly against any such energetic warfare This Mgwana further upon being questioned gave us information far more interesting viz about the Rusizi He told us positively with the air of a man who knew all about it and as if anybody who doubted him might well be set down as an egregious ass that the Rusizi River flowed out of the lake away to Suna s Mtesa s country Where else could it flow to he asked The Doctor was inclined to believe it or perhaps he was more inclined to let it rest as stated until our own eyes should confirm it I was more inclined to doubt as I told the Doctor first it was too good to be true second the fellow was too enthusiastic upon a subject that could not possibly interest him His Barikallahs and Inshallahs were far too fervid his answers too much in accordance with our wishes The Doctor laid great stress on the report of a Mgwana he met far south who stated that the grandfather or father of Rumanika present King of Karagwah had thought of excavating the bed of the Kitangule River in order that his canoes might go to Ujiji to open a trade From this I imagine coinciding as it did with his often expressed and present firm belief that the waters of the Tanganika had an outlet somewhere the Doctor was partial to the report of the Mgwana but as we proceed we shall see how all this will end On the ninth morning from Ujiji about two hours after sunrise we passed the broad delta of the Mugere a river which gives its name also to the district on the eastern shore ruled over by Mukamba We had come directly opposite the most southern of its three mouths when we found quite a difference in the colour of the water An almost straight line drawn east and west from the mouth would serve well to mark off the difference that existed between the waters On the south side was pure water of a light green on the north side it was muddy and the current could be distinctly seen flowing north Soon after passing the first mouth we came to a second and then a third mouth each only a few yards broad but each discharging sufficient water to permit our following the line of the currents several rods north beyond the respective mouths Beyond the third mouth of the Mugere a bend disclosed itself with groups of villages beyond on its bank These were Mukamba s and in one of them lived Mukamba the chief The natives had yet never seen a white man and of course as soon as we landed we were surrounded by a large concourse all armed with long spears the only weapon visible amongst them save a club stick and here and there a hatchet We were shown into a hut which the Doctor and I shared between us What followed on that day I have but a dim recollection having been struck down by fever the first since leaving Unyanyembe I dimly recollect trying to make out what age Mukamba might be and noting that he was good looking withal and kindly disposed towards us And during the intervals of agony and unconsciousness I saw or fancied I saw Livingstone s form moving towards me and felt or fancied I felt Livingstone s hand tenderly feeling my hot head and limbs I had suffered several fevers between Bagamoyo and Unyanyembe without anything or anybody to relieve me of the tedious racking headache and pain or to illumine the dark and gloomy prospect which must necessarily surround the bedside of the sick and solitary traveller But though this fever having enjoyed immunity from it for three months was more severe than usual I did not much regret its occurrence since I became the recipient of the very tender and fatherly kindness of the good man whose companion I now found myself The next morning having recovered slightly from the fever when Mukamba came with a present of an ox a sheep and a goat I was able to attend to the answers which he gave to the questions about the Rusizi River and the head of the lake The ever cheerful and enthusiastic Mgwana was there also and he was not a whit abashed when through him the chief told us that the Rusizi joined by the Ruanda or Luanda at a distance of two days journey by water or one day by land from the head of the lake flowed INTO the lake Thus our hopes excited somewhat by the positive and repeated assurances that the river flowed out away towards Karagwah collapsed as speedily as they were raised We paid Mukamba the honga consisting of nine doti and nine fundo of samsam lunghio muzurio n zige The printed handkerchiefs which I had in abundance at Unyanyembe would have gone well here After receiving his present the chief introduced his son a tall youth of eighteen or thereabouts to the Doctor as a would be son of the Doctor but with a good natured laugh the Doctor scouted all such relationship with him as it was instituted only for the purpose of drawing more cloth out of him Mukamba took it in good part and did not insist on getting more Our second evening at Mukamba s Susi the Doctor s servant got gloriously drunk through the chief s liberal and profuse gifts of pombe Just at dawn neat morning I was awakened by hearing several sharp crack like sounds I listened and I found the noise was in our hut It was caused by the Doctor who towards midnight had felt some one come and lie down by his side on the same bed and thinking it was me he had kindly made room and laid down on the edge of the bed But in the morning feeling rather cold he had been thoroughly awakened and on rising on his elbow to see who his bed fellow was he discovered to his great astonishment that it was no other than his black servant Susi who taking possession of his blankets and folding them about himself most selfishly was occupying almost the whole bed The Doctor with that gentleness characteristic of him instead of taking a rod had contented himself with slapping Susi on the back saying Get up Susi will you You are in my bed How dare you sir get drunk in this way after I have told you so often not to Get up You won t Take that and that and that Still Susi slept and grunted so the slapping continued until even Susi s thick hide began to feel it and he was thoroughly awakened to the sense of his want of devotion and sympathy for his master in the usurping of even his master s bed Susi looked very much crestfallen after this expose of his infirmity before the little master as I was called The next day at dusk Mukamba having come to bid us good bye and requested that as soon as we reached his brother Ruhinga whose country was at the head of the lake we would send our canoe back for him and that in the meanwhile we should leave two of our men with him with their guns to help defend him in case Warumashanya should attack him as soon as we were gone we embarked and pulled across In nine hours we had arrived at the head of the lake in Mugihewa the country of Ruhinga Mukamba s elder brother In looking back to where we had come from we perceived that we had made a diagonal cut across from south east to north west instead of having made a direct east and west course or in other words from Mugere which was at least ten miles from the northernmost point of the eastern shore we had come to Mugihewa situated at the northernmost point of the western shore Had we continued along the eastern shore and so round the northern side of the lake we should have passed by Mukanigi the country of Warumashanya and Usumbura of Simveh his ally and friend But by making a diagonal course as just described we had arrived at the extreme head of the lake without any difficulty The country in which we now found ourselves Mugihewa is situated in the delta of the Rusizi River It is an extremely flat country the highest part of which is not ten feet above the lake with numerous depressions in it overgrown with the rankest of matete grass and the tallest of papyrus and pond like hollows filled with stagnant water which emit malaria wholesale Large herds of cattle are reared on it for where the ground is not covered with marshy plants it produces rich sweet grass The sheep and goats especially the former are always in good condition and though they are not to be compared with English or American sheep they are the finest I have seen in Africa Numerous villages are seen on this land because the intervening spaces are not occupied with the rank and luxuriant jungle common in other parts of Africa Were it not for the Euphorbia kolquall of Abyssinia which some chief has caused to be planted as a defence round the villages one might see from one end of Mugihewa to the other The waters along the head of the lake from the western to the eastern shores swarm with crocodiles From the banks I counted ten heads of crocodiles and the Rusizi we were told was full of them Ruhinga who came to see us soon after we had taken up our quarters in his village was a most amiable man who always contrived to see something that excited his risibility though older by five or six years perhaps he said he was a hundred years old than Mukamba he was not half so dignified nor regarded with so much admiration by his people as his younger brother Ruhinga had a better knowledge however of the country than Mukamba and an admirable memory and was able to impart his knowledge of the country intelligently After he had done the honours as chief to us presented us with an ox and a sheep milk and honey we were not backward in endeavouring to elicit as much information as possible out of him The summary of the information derived from Ruhinga may be stated as follows The country bordering the head of the lake from Urundi proper on the eastern shore to Uvira on the western is divided into the following districts first Mugere governed by Mukamba through which issued into the lake the small rivers of Mugere and Mpanda second Mukanigi governed by Warumashanya which occupied the whole of the north eastern head of the lake through which issued into the lake the small rivers of Karindwa and Mugera wa Kanigi third On the eastern half of the district at the head of the lake was Usumbura governed by Simveh ally and friend of Warumashanya extending to the eastern bank of the Rusizi fourth Commencing from the western bank of the Rusizi to the extreme north western head of the lake was Mugihewa Ruhinga s country fifth From Uvira on the west running north past Mugihewa and overlapping it on the north side as far as the hills of Chamati was Ruwenga also a country governed by Mukamba Beyond Ruwenga from the hills of Chamati to the Ruanda River was the country of Chamati West of Ruwenga comprising all the mountains for two days journey in that direction was Uashi These are the smaller sub divisions of what is commonly known as Ruwenga and Usige Ruwenga comprises the countries of Ruwenga and Mugihewa Usige the countries of Usumbura Mukanigi and Mugere But all these countries are only part and parcel of Urundi which comprises all that country bordering the lake from Mshala River on the eastern shore to Uvira on the western extending over ten days journey direct north from the head of the lake and one month in a northeastern direction to Murukuko the capital of Mwezi Sultan of all Urundi Direct north of Urundi is Ruanda also a very large country The Rusizi River according to Ruhinga rose near a lake called Kivo which he said is as long as from Mugihawa to Mugere and as broad as from Mugihewa to Warumashanya s country or say eighteen miles in length by about eight in breadth The lake is surrounded by mountains on the western and northern sides on the south western side of one of these mountains issues the Rusizi at first a small rapid stream but as it proceeds towards the lake it receives the rivers Kagunissi Kaburan Mohira Nyamagana Nyakagunda Ruviro Rofubu Kavimvira Myove Ruhuha Mukindu Sange Rubirizi Kiriba and lastly the Ruanda River which seems to be the largest of them all Kivo Lake is so called from the country in which it is situated On one side is Mutumbi probably the Utumbi of Speke and Baker on the west is Ruanda on the east is Urundi The name of the chief of Kivo is Kwansibura After so many minute details about the River Rusizi it only remained for us to see it On the second morning of our arrival at Mugihewa we mustered ten strong paddlers and set out to explore the head of the lake and the mouth of the Rusizi We found that the northern head of the lake was indented with seven broad bays each from one and a half to three miles broad that long broad spits of sand overgrown with matete separated each bay from the other The first starting from west to east at the broadest part to the extreme southern point of Mugihewa was about three miles broad and served as a line of demarcation between Mukamba s district of Ruwenga and Mugihewa of Ruhinga it was also two miles deep The second bay was a mile from the southern extremity of Mugihewa to Ruhinga s village at the head of the bay and it was a mile across to another spit of sand which was terminated by a small island The third bay stretched for nearly a mile to a long spit at the end of which was another island one and a quarter mile in length and was the western side of the fourth bay at the head of which was the delta of the Rusizi This fourth bay at its base was about three miles in depth and penetrated half a mile further inland than any other Soundings indicated six feet deep and the same depth was kept to within a few hundred yards of the principal mouth of the Rusizi The current was very sluggish not more than a mile an hour Though we constantly kept our binocular searching for the river we could not see the main channel until within two hundred yards of it and then only by watching by what outlet the fishing canoes came out The bay at this point had narrowed from two miles to about two hundred yards in breadth Inviting a canoe to show us the way a small flotilla of canoes preceded us from the sheer curiosity of their owners We followed and in a few minutes were ascending the stream which was very rapid though but about ten yards wide and very shallow not more than two feet deep We ascended about half a mile the current being very strong from six to eight miles an hour and quite far enough to observe the nature of the stream at its embouchure We could see that it widened and spread out in a myriad of channels rushing by isolated clumps of sedge and matete grass and that it had the appearance of a swamp We had ascended the central or main channel The western channel was about eight yards broad We observed after we had returned to the bay that the easternmost channel was about six yards broad and about ten feet deep but very sluggish We had thus examined each of its three mouths and settled all doubts as to the Rusizi being an effluent or influent It was not necessary to ascend higher there being nothing about the river itself to repay exploration of it The question Was the Rusizi an effluent or an influent was answered for ever There was now no doubt any more on that point In size it was not to be compared with the Malagarazi River neither is it or can it be navigable for anything but the smallest canoes The only thing remarkable about it is that it abounds in crocodiles but not one hippopotamus was seen which may be taken as another evidence of its shallowness The bays to the east of the Rusizi are of the same conformation as those on the west Carefully judging from the width of the several bays from point to point and of the several spits which separate them the breadth of the lake may be said to be about twelve or fourteen miles Had we contented ourselves with simply looking at the conformation and the meeting of the eastern and western ranges we should have said that the lake ended in a point as Captain Speke has sketched it on his map But its exploration dissolved that idea Chamati Hill is the extreme northern termination of the western range and seems upon a superficial examination to abut against the Ramata mountains of the eastern range which are opposite Chamati but a valley about a mile in breadth separates the two ranges and through this valley the Rusizi flows towards the lake Though Chamati terminates the western range the eastern range continues for miles beyond north westerly After its issue from this broad gorge the Rusizi runs seemingly in a broad and mighty stream through a wide alluvial plain its own formation in a hundred channels until approaching the lake it flows into it by three channels only as above described After the patient investigation of the North end of the Lake and satisfying ourselves by personal observation that the Rusizi ran into the Lake the native rumor which Sir Samuel Baker brought home that the Tanganika and the Albert N Yanza have a water connection still finds many believers I should not omit to state here that though the Doctor and I have had to contend against the strong current of the Rusizi River as it flowed swift and strong INTO the Tanganika the Doctor still adheres to the conviction that whatever part the Rusizi plays there must be an outlet to the Tanganika somewhere from the fact that all fresh water lakes have outlets The Doctor is able to state his opinions and reasons far better than I can find for him and lest I misconstrue the subject I shall leave it until he has an opportunity to explain them himself which his great knowledge of Africa will enable him to do with advantage One thing is evident to me and I believe to the Doctor that Sir Samuel Baker will have to curtail the Albert N Yanza by one if not two degrees of latitude That well known traveller has drawn his lake far into the territory of the Warundi while Ruanda has been placed on the eastern side whereas a large portion of it if not all should be placed north of what he has designated on his map as Usige The information of such an intelligent man as Ruhinga is not to be despised for if Lake Albert came within a hundred miles of the Tanganika he would surely have heard of its existence even if he had not seen it himself Originally he came from Mutumbi and he has travelled from that country into Mugihewa the district he now governs He has seen Mwezi the great King of Urundi and describes him as a man about forty years old and as a very good man Our work was now done there was nothing more to detain us at Mugihewa Ruhinga had been exceedingly kind and given us one ox after another to butcher and eat Mukamba had done the same Their women had supplied us with an abundance of milk and butter and we had now bounteous supplies of both The Doctor had taken a series of observations for latitude and longitude and Mugihewa was made out to be in three degrees nineteen minutes S latitude On the seventh December early in the morning we left Mugihewa and rowing past the southern extremity of the Katangara Islands we approached the highlands of Uashi near the boundary line between Mukamba s country and Uvira The boundary line is supposed to be a wide ravine in the depths of which is a grove of tall beautiful and straight stemmed trees out of which the natives make their canoes Passing Kanyamabengu River which issues into the lake close to the market ground of Kirabula the extreme point of Burton and Speke s explorations of the Tanganika we steered south along the western shore of the lake for half an hour longer to Kavimba where we halted to cook breakfast The village where lived Mruta the King of Uvira was in sight of our encampment and as we observed parties of men ascending and descending the mountains much more often than we thought augured good to ourselves we determined to continue on our course south Besides there was a party of disconsolate looking Wajiji here who had been plundered only a few days before our arrival for attempting as the Wavira believed to evade the honga payment Such facts as these and our knowledge of the general state of insecurity in the country resulting from the many wars in which the districts of the Tanganika were engaged determined us not to halt at Kavimba We embarked quickly in our boat before the Wavira had collected themselves and headed south against a strong gale which came driving down on us from the south west After a hard pull of about two hours in the teeth of the storm which was rapidly rising we pointed the head of the boat into a little quiet cove almost hidden in tall reeds and disembarked for the night Cognizant of the dangers which surrounded us knowing that savage and implacable man was the worst enemy we had to fear we employed our utmost energies in the construction of a stout fence of thorn bushes and then sat down to supper after our work was done and turned in to sleep but not before we had posted watchmen to guard our canoe lest the daring thieves of Uvira might abstract it in which case we should have been in a pretty plight and in most unenviable distress At daybreak leaving Kukumba Point after our humble breakfast of coffee cheese and dourra cakes was despatched we steered south once more Our fires had attracted the notice of the sharp eyed and suspicious fishermen of Kukumba but our precautions and the vigilant watch we had set before retiring had proved an effectual safeguard against the Kivira thieves The western shores of the lake as we proceeded were loftier and more bold than the wooded heights of Urundi and bearded knolls of Ujiji A back ridge the vanguard of the mountains which rise beyond disclosed itself between the serrated tops of the front line of mountains which rose to a height of from twenty five hundred to three thousand feet above the lake Within the folds of the front line of mountains rise isolated hills of considerable magnitude precipitous and abrupt but scenically very picturesque The greater part of these hills have the rounded and smooth top or are tabularly summited The ridge enfolding these hills shoots out at intervals promontorial projections of gradual sloping outlines which on the map I have designated capes or points When rounding these points up went our compasses for the taking of bearings and observing the directions of all prominent objects of interest Often these capes are formed by the alluvial plains through which we may be sure a river will be found flowing These pretty alluvial plains enfolded on the south the west and the north by a grand mountain arc present most luxurious and enchanting scenery The vegetation seems to be of spontaneous growth Groups of the Elaeis Guineansis palm embowering some dun brown village an array of majestic superb growth of mvule trees a broad extent covered with vivid green sorghum stalks parachute like tops of mimosa a line of white sand on which native canoes are drawn far above the reach of the plangent uneasy surf fishermen idly reclining in the shade of a tree these are the scenes which reveal themselves to us as we voyage in our canoe on the Tanganika When wearied with the romance of wild tropic scenes such as these we have but to lift our eyes to the great mountain tops looming darkly and grandly on our right to watch the light pencilling of the cirrus brushing their summits as it is drifted toward the north by the rising wind to watch the changing forms which the clouds assume from the fleecy horizontal bars of the cirrus to the denser gloomier cumulus prognosticator of storm and rain which soon settles into a portentous group Alps above Alps one above another and we know the storm which was brewing is at hand and that it is time to seek shelter Passing Muikamba we saw several groves of the tall mvule tree As far as Bemba the Wabembe occupy the mountain summits while the Wavira cultivate the alluvial plains along the base and lower slopes of the mountain At Bemba we halted to take in pieces of pipe clay in accordance with the superstition of the Wajiji who thought us certain of safe passage and good fortune if we complied with the ancient custom Passing Ngovi we came to a deep bend which curved off to Cape Kabogi at the distance of ten miles About two thirds of the way we arrived at a group of islets three in number all very steep and rocky the largest about three hundred feet in length at the base and about two hundred feet in breadth Here we made preparations to halt for the night The inhabitants of the island were a gorgeously feathered old cock which was kept as a propitiatory offering to the spirit of the island a sickly yellow looking thrush a hammer headed stork and two fish hawks who finding we had taken possession of what had been religiously reserved for them took flight to the most western island where from their perches they continued to eye us most solemnly As these islands were with difficulty pronounced by us as Kavunvweh the Doctor seeing that they were the only objects we were likely to discover named them the New York Herald Islets and in confirmation of the new designation given them shook hands with me upon it Careful dead reckoning settled them to be in lat three degrees forty one minutes S The summit of the largest island was well adapted to take bearings and we improved the opportunity as most extensive views of the broad and lengthy lake and surrounding lines of imposing mountains were attainable The Ramata Hills were clearly visible and bore N N E from it Katanga Cape S E by S Sentakeyi E S E Magala E by N south western point of Muzimu bore S northern point of Muzimu island S S E At dawn on the ninth December we prepared to resume our voyage Once or twice in the night we had been visited by fishermen but our anxious watchfulness prevented any marauding It seemed to me however that the people of the opposite shore who were our visitors were eagerly watching an opportunity to pounce upon our canoe or take us bodily for a prey and our men were considerably affected by these thoughts if we may judge from the hearty good will with which they rowed away from our late encampment Arriving at Cape Kabogi we came to the territory of the Wasansi We knew we were abreast of a different tribe by the greeting Moholo which a group of fishermen gave us as that of the Wavira was Wake like that of Urundi Usige and Uhha We soon sighted Cape Luvumba a sloping projection of a mountain ridge which shot far into the lake As a storm was brewing we steered for a snug little cove that appeared before a village and drawing our canoe from the water began to set the tent and make other preparations for passing the night As the natives appeared quiet and civil enough we saw no reason to suspect that they entertained any hostility to Arabs and Wangwana Accordingly we had our breakfast cooked and as usual laid down for an afternoon nap I soon fell asleep and was dreaming away in my tent in happy oblivion of the strife and contention that had risen since I had gone to sleep when I heard a voice hailing me with Master master get up quick Here is a fight going to begin I sprang up and snatching my revolver belt from the gun stand walked outside Surely there appeared to be considerable animus between the several factions between a noisy vindictive looking set of natives of the one part and our people of the other part Seven or eight of our people had taken refuge behind the canoe and had their loaded guns half pointing at the passionate mob which was momentarily increasing in numbers but I could not see the Doctor anywhere
2039_141209_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is the Doctor I asked 
none	none	He has gone over that hill sir with his compass said Selim Anybody with him Susi and Chumah You Bombay send two men off to warn the Doctor and tell him to hurry up here But just at this period the Doctor and his two men appeared on the brow of the hill looking down in a most complacent manner upon the serio comic scene that the little basin wherein we were encamped presented For indeed despite the serious aspect of it there was much that was comical blended with it in a naked young man who perfectly drunk barely able to stand on his feet was beating the ground with his only loin cloth screaming and storming away like a madman declaring by this and by that in his own choice language that no Mgwana or Arab should halt one moment on the sacred soil of Usansi His father the Sultan was as inebriated as himself though not quite so violent in his behaviour In the meantime the Doctor arrived upon the scene and Selim had slipped my Winchester rifle with the magazine full of cartridges into my hand The Doctor calmly asked what was the matter and was answered by the Wajiji guides that the people wished us to leave as they were on hostile terms with the Arabs because the eldest son of the Sultan of Muzimu the large island nearly opposite had been beaten to death by a Baluch named Khamis at Ujiji because the young fellow had dared look into his harem and ever since peace had been broken between the Wasansi and Arabs After consulting with the guides the Doctor and I came to the conclusion that it were better that we should endeavour to pacify the Sultan by a present rather than take offence at a drunken boy s extravagant freak In his insane fury he had attempted to slash at one of my men with a billhook he carried This had been taken as a declaration of hostilities and the soldiers were ready enough to engage in war but there was no necessity to commence fighting with a drunken mob who could have been cleared off the ground with our revolvers alone had we desired it The Doctor baring his arm said to them that he was not a Mgwana or an Arab but a white man that Arabs and Wangwana had no such colour as we had We were white men different people altogether from those whom they were accustomed to see that no black men had ever suffered injury from white men This seemed to produce great effect for after a little gentle persuasion the drunken youth and his no less inebriate sire were induced to sit down to talk quietly In their conversation with us they frequently referred to Mombo the son of Kisesa Sultan of Muzimu who was brutally murdered Yes brutally murdered they exclaimed several times in their own tongue illustrating by a faithful pantomime how the unfortunate youth had died Livingstone continued talking with them in a mild paternal way and their loud protestations against Arab cruelty were about to subside when the old Sultan suddenly rose up and began to pace about in an excited manner and in one of his perambulations deliberately slashed his leg with the sharp blade of his spear and then exclaimed that the Wangwana had wounded him At this cry one half of the mob hastily took to flight but one old woman who carried a strong staff with a carved lizard s body on its top commenced to abuse the chief with all the power of her voluble tongue charging him with a desire to have them all killed and other women joined in with her in advising him to be quiet and accept the present we were willing to give But it is evident that there was little needed to cause all men present in that little hollow to begin a most sanguinary strife The gentle patient bearing of the Doctor had more effect than anything else in making all forbear bloodshed while there was left the least chance of an amicable settlement and in the end it prevailed The Sultan and his son were both sent on their way rejoicing While the Doctor conversed with them and endeavoured to calm their fierce passions I had the tent struck and the canoes launched and the baggage stowed and when the negotiations had concluded amicably I begged the Doctor to jump into the boat as this apparent peace was simply a lull before a storm besides said I there are two or three cowardly creatures in the boat who in case of another disturbance would not scruple to leave both of us here From Cape Luvumba about four point thirty P M we commenced pulling across at eight P M we were abreast of Cape Panza the northern extremity of the island of Muzimu at six A M we were southward of Bikari and pulling for Mukungu in Urundi at which place we arrived at ten A M having been seventeen hours and a half in crossing the lake which computing at two miles an hour may be said to be thirty five miles direct breadth and a little more than forty three miles from Cape Luvumba On the eleventh of December after seven hours pulling we arrived at picturesque Zassi again on the twelfth at the pretty cove of Niasanga and at eleven A M we had rounded past Bangwe and Ujiji was before us We entered the port very quietly without the usual firing of guns as we were short of powder and ball As we landed our soldiers and the Arab magnates came to the water s edge to greet us Mabruki had a rich budget to relate to us of what had occurred during our absence This faithful man left behind in charge of Livingstone s house had done most excellently Kalulu had scalded himself and had a frightful raw sore on his chest in consequence Mabruki had locked up Marora in chains for wounding one of the asses Bilali the stuttering coward a bully of women had caused a tumult in the market place and had been sharply belaboured with the stick by Mabruki And above all most welcome was a letter I received from the American Consul at Zanzibar dated June eleventh containing telegrams from Paris as late as April twenty second of the same year Poor Livingstone exclaimed And I have none What a pleasant thing it is to have a real and good friend Our voyage on the Tanganika had lasted twenty eight days during which time we had traversed over three hundred miles of water CHAPTER XIV OUR JOURNEY FROM UJIJI TO UNYANYEMBE We felt quite at home when we sat down on our black bear skin gay Persian carpet and clean new mats to rest with our backs to the wall sipping our tea with the air of comfortable men and chat over the incidents of the picnic as Livingstone persisted in calling our journey to the Rusizi It seemed as if old times which we loved to recall had come back again though our house was humble enough in its aspect and our servants were only naked barbarians but it was near this house that I had met him Livingstone after that eventful march from Unyanyembe it was on this same veranda that I listened to that wonderful story of his about those far enchanting regions west of the Lake Tanganika it was in this same spot that I first became acquainted with him and ever since my admiration has been growing for him and I feel elated when he informs me that he must go to Unyanyembe under my escort and at my expense The old mud walls and the bare rafters and the ancient thatched roof and this queer looking old veranda will have an historical interest for me while I live and so while I can I have taken pains and immortalized the humble old building by a sketch I have just said that my admiration for Livingstone has been growing This is true The man that I was about to interview so calmly and complacently as I would interview any prominent man with the view of specially delineating his nature or detailing his opinions has conquered me I had intended to interview him report in detail what he said picture his life and his figure then bow him my au revoir and march back That he was specially disagreeable and brusque in his manner which would make me quarrel with him immediately was firmly fixed in my mind But Livingstone true noble Christian generous hearted frank man acted like a hero invited me to his house said he was glad to see me and got well on purpose to prove the truth of his statement You have brought new life unto me and when I fell sick with the remittent fever hovering between life and death he attended me like a father and we have now been together for more than a month Can you wonder then that I like this man whose face is the reflex of his nature whose heart is essentially all goodness whose aims are so high that I break out impetuously sometimes But your family Doctor they would like to see you oh so much Let me tempt you to come home with me I promise to carry you every foot of the way to the coast You shall have the finest donkey to ride that is in Unyanyembe Your wants you have but to hint them and they shall be satisfied Let the sources of the Nile go do you come home and rest then after a year s rest and restored health you can return and finish what you have to do But ever the answer was No I should like to see my family very much indeed My children s letters affect me intensely but I must not go home I must finish my task It is only the want of supplies that has detained me I should have finished the discovery of the Nile by this by tracing it to its connection with either Baker s Lake or Petherick s branch of the Nile If I had only gone one month further I could have said the work is done Some of these men who had turned the Doctor back from his interesting discoveries were yet in Ujiji and had the Government Enfield rifles in their hands which they intended to retain until their wages had been paid to them but as they had received sixty dollars advance each at Zanzibar from the English Consul with the understanding entered into by contract that they should follow their master wherever he required them to go and as they had not only not gone where they were required to proceed with him but had baffled and thwarted him it was preposterous that a few men should triumph over the Doctor by keeping the arms given to him by the Bombay Government I had listened to the Arab sheikhs friends of the Doctor advising them in mild tones to give them up I had witnessed the mutineer s stubbornness and it was then on the burzani of Sayd bin Majid s house that I took advantage to open my mind on the subject not only for the benefit of the stubborn slaves but also for the benefit of the Arabs and to tell them that it was well that I had found Livingstone alive for if they had but injured a hair of his head I should have gone back to the coast to return with a party which would enable me to avenge him I had been waiting to see Livingstone s guns returned to him every day hoping that I should not have to use force but when a month or more had elapsed and still the arms had not been returned I applied for permission to take them which was granted Susi the gallant servant of doctor Livingstone was immediately despatched with about a dozen armed men to recover them and in a few minutes we had possession of them without further trouble The Doctor had resolved to accompany me to Unyanyembe in order to meet his stores which had been forwarded from Zanzibar November first eighteen seventy As I had charge of the escort it was my duty to study well the several routes to Unyanyembe from Ujiji I was sufficiently aware of the difficulties and the responsibilities attached to me while escorting such a man Besides my own personal feelings were involved in the case If Livingstone came to any harm through any indiscretion of mine while he was with me it would immediately be said Ah had he not accompanied Stanley he would have been alive now I took out my chart the one I had made myself in which I had perfect faith and I sketched out a route which would enable us to reach Unyanyembe without paying a single cloth as tribute and without encountering any worse thing than a jungle by which we could avoid all the Wavinza and the plundering Wahha This peaceable secure route led by water south along the coast of Ukaranga and Ukawendi to Cape Tongwe Arriving at Cape Tongwe I should be opposite the village of Itaga Sultan Imrera in the district of Rusawa of Ukawendi after which we should strike my old road which I had traversed from Unyanyembe when bound for Ujiji I explained it to the Doctor and he instantly recognised its feasibility and security and if I struck Imrera as I proposed to do it would demonstrate whether my chart was correct or not We arrived at Ujiji from our tour of discovery north of the Tanganika December thirteenth and from this date the Doctor commenced writing his letters to his numerous friends and to copy into his mammoth Letts s Diary from his field books the valuable information he had acquired during his years of travel south and west of the Tanganika I sketched him while sitting in his shirt sleeves in the veranda with his Letts s Diary on his knee and the likeness on the frontispiece is an admirable portrait of him because the artist who has assisted me has with an intuitive eye seen the defects in my own sketch and by this I am enabled to restore him to the reader s view exactly as I saw him as he pondered on what he had witnessed during his long marches Soon after my arrival at Ujiji he had rushed to his paper and indited a letter to James Gordon Bennett esquire wherein he recorded his thanks and after he had finished it I asked him to add the word Junior to it as it was young mister Bennett to whom he was indebted I thought the letter admirable and requested the Doctor not to add another word to it The feelings of his heart had found expression in the grateful words he had written and if I judged mister Bennett rightly I knew he would be satisfied with it For it was not the geographical news he cared so much about as the grand fact of Livingstone s being alive or dead In this latter part of December he was writing letters to his children to Sir Roderick Murchison and to Lord Granville He had intended to have written to the Earl of Clarendon but it was my sad task to inform him of the death of that distinguished nobleman In the meantime I was preparing the Expedition for its return march to Unyanyembe apportioning the bales and luggage the Doctor s large tin boxes and my own among my own men for I had resolved upon permitting the Doctor s men to march as passengers because they had so nobly performed their duty to their master Sayd bin Majid had left December twelve for Mirambo s country to give the black Bonaparte battle for the murder of his son Soud in the forests of Wilyankuru and he had taken with him three hundred stout fellows armed with guns from Ujiji The stout hearted old chief was burning with rage and resentment and a fine warlike figure he made with his seven foot gun Before we had departed for the Rusizi I had wished him bon voyage and expressed a hope that he would rid the Central African world of the tyrant Mirambo On the twentieth of December the rainy season was ushered in with heavy rain thunder lightning and hail the thermometer falling to sixty six degrees Fahrenheit The evening of this day I was attacked with urticaria or nettle rash for the third time since arriving in Africa and I suffered a woeful sickness and it was the forerunner of an attack of remittent fever which lasted four days This is the malignant type which has proved fatal to so many African travellers on the Zambezi the White Nile the Congo and the Niger The head throbs the pulses bound the heart struggles painfully while the sufferer s thoughts are in a strange world such only as a sick man s fancy can create This was the fourth attack of fever since the day I met Livingstone The excitement of the march and the high hope which my mind constantly nourished had kept my body almost invincible against an attack of fever while advancing towards Ujiji but two weeks after the great event had transpired my energies were relaxed my mind was perfectly tranquil and I became a victim Christmas came and the Doctor and I had resolved upon the blessed and time honoured day being kept as we keep it in Anglo Saxon lands with a feast such as Ujiji could furnish us The fever had quite gone from me the night before and on Christmas morning though exceedingly weak I was up and dressed and lecturing Ferajji the cook upon the importance of this day to white men and endeavouring to instil into the mind of the sleek and pampered animal some cunning secrets of the culinary art Fat broad tailed sheep goats zogga and pombe eggs fresh milk plantains singwe fine cornflour fish onions sweet potatoes c c were procured in the Ujiji market and from good old Moeni Kheri But alas for my weakness Ferajji spoiled the roast and our custard was burned the dinner was a failure That the fat brained rascal escaped a thrashing was due only to my inability to lift my hands for punishment but my looks were dreadful and alarming and capable of annihilating any one except Ferajji The stupid hard headed cook only chuckled and I believe he had the subsequent gratification of eating the pies custards and roast that his carelessness had spoiled for European palates Sayd bin Majid previous to his departure had left orders that we should be permitted to use his canoe for our homeward trip and Moeni Kheri kindly lent his huge vessel for the same purpose The Expedition now augmented by the Doctor and his five servants and their luggage necessitated the employment of another canoe We had our flocks of milch goats and provision of fat sheep for the jungle of Ukawendi the transit of which I was about to attempt Good Halimah Livingstone s cook had made ready a sackful of fine flour such as she only could prepare in her fond devotion for her master Hamoydah her husband also had freely given his assistance and attention to this important article of food I purchased a donkey for the Doctor the only one available in Ujiji lest the Doctor might happen to suffer on the long march from his ancient enemy In short we were luxuriously furnished with food sheep goats cheese cloth donkeys and canoes sufficient to convey us a long distance we needed nothing more The twenty seventh of December has arrived it is the day of our departure from Ujiji I was probably about to give an eternal farewell to the port whose name will for ever be sacred in my memory The canoes great lumbering hollow trees are laden with good things the rowers are in their places the flag of England is hoisted at the stern of the Doctor s canoe the flag of America waves and rustles joyously above mine and I cannot look at them without feeling a certain pride that the two Anglo Saxon nations are represented this day on this great inland sea in the face of wild nature and barbarism We are escorted to our boats by the great Arab merchants by the admiring children of Unyamwezi by the freemen of Zanzibar by wondering Waguhha and Wajiji by fierce Warundi who are on this day quiet even sorrowful that the white men are going Whither they all ask At eight A M we start freely distributing our farewells as the Arabs and quidnuncs wave their hands On the part of one or two of them there was an attempt to say something sentimental and affecting especially by the convicted sinner Mohammed bin Sali but though outwardly I manifested no disapprobation of his words or of the emphatic way in which he shook my hand I was not sorry to see the last of him after his treachery to Livingstone in eighteen sixty nine I was earnestly requested to convey to Unyanyembe Mengi salaams to everybody but had I done so as he evidently desired me to do I would not have been surprised at being regarded by all as hopelessly imbecile We pushed off from the clayey bank at the foot of the market place while the land party unencumbered with luggage under the leadership of gigantic Asmani and Bombay commenced their journey southward along the shores of the lake We had arranged to meet them at the mouth of every river to transport them across from bank to bank The Doctor being in Sayd bin Majid s boat which was a third or so shorter than the one under my command took the lead with the British flag held aloft by a bamboo streaming behind like a crimson meteor My boat manned by Wajiji sailors whom we had engaged to take the canoes back from Tongwe Cape to Ujiji Bunder came astern and had a much taller flagstaff on which was hoisted the ever beautiful Stars and Stripes Its extreme height drew from the Doctor whose patriotism and loyalty had been excited the remark that he would cut down the tallest palmyra for his flagstaff as it was not fitting that the British flag should be so much lower than that of the United States Our soldiers were not a whit behind us in lightheartedness at the thought of going to Unyanyembe They struck up the exhilarating song of the Zanzibar boatmen with the ecstatic chorus Kinan de re re Kitunga rowing away like madmen until they were compelled to rest from sheer exhaustion while the perspiration exuded from the pores of their bodies in streams When refreshed they bent back to their oars raising the song of the Mrima O mama re de mi Ky which soon impelled them to an extravagant effort again It was by this series of ferocious spurts racing shouting singing perspiring laughing groaning and puffing that our people vented their joyous feelings as the thought filled their minds that we were homeward bound and that by the route I had adopted between us and Unyanyembe there was not the least danger We have given the Waha the slip ha ha The Wavinza will trouble us no more ho ho Mionvu can get no more cloth from us by by And Kiala will see us no more never more he he they shouted with wild bursts of laughter seconded by tremendous and rapid strokes with their oars which caused the stiff old canoes to quiver from stem to stern Our party ashore seemed to partake of our excitement and joined in the wild refrain of the mad African song We watched them urging their steps forward to keep pace with us as we rounded the capes and points and rowed across the bays whose margins were sedge and rush and reed the tiny and agile Kalulu little Bilali and Majwara were seen racing the herds of goats sheep and donkeys which belonged to the caravan and the animals even seemed to share the general joy Nature also proud wild nature zero with the lofty azure dome upheaved into infinity with her breadth and depth of vivid greenness and enormous vastness on our left with her immense sheet of bright glancing water with her awful and intense serenity she partook of and added to our joy About ten A M we arrived at Kirindo s an old chief noted for his singular kindness to doctor Livingstone while he bore animosity to the Arabs To the Arabs this was unaccountable to the Doctor it was plain he had but spoken kind and sincere words while all the Arabs spoke to him as if he were not even a man least of all a chief Kirindo s place is at the mouth of the Liuche which is very wide the river oozes out through a forest of eschinomenae pith tree This was a rendezvous agreed upon between shore and lake parties that the canoes might all cross to the other side distant a mile and a half The mouth of the Liuche forms the Bay of Ukaranga so named because on the other side whither we were about to cross our party was situated the village of Ukaranga a few hundred yards from the lake All the baggage was taken out of the largest canoe and stowed snugly in the smaller one and a few select oarsmen having taken seats pushed off with the Doctor on board who was to superintend pitching the encampment at Ukaranga while I remained behind to bind the fractious and ill natured donkeys and stow them away in the bottom of the large canoe that no danger of upsetting might be incurred and a consequent gobbling up by hungry crocodiles which were all about us waiting their opportunity The flock of goats were then embarked and as many of our people as could be got in About thirty still remained behind with myself for whom my canoe was to return We all arrived safe at Ukaranga though we got dangerously near a herd of hippopotami The crossing of the wide mouth the Liuche being then in flood was effected in about four hours The next day in the same order as on our departure from Ujiji we pursued our way south the lake party keeping as closely as possible to the shore yet when feasible wind and weather permitting we struck off boldly across the numerous small bays which indent the shores of the Tanganika The shores were beautifully green the effect of the late rains the waters of the lake were a faithful reflex of the blue firmament above The hippopotami were plentiful Those noticed on this day were coloured with reddish rings round the base of their ears and on the neck One monster coming up rather late was surprised by the canoe making full for him and in great fright took a tremendous dive which showed the whole length of his body Half way between the mouth of the Malagarazi and that of the Liuche we saw a camp on shore that of Mohammed bin Gharib a Msawahili who figured often in Livingstone s verbal narrative to me of his adventures and travels as one of the kindest and best of the Moslems in Central Africa He appeared to me a kindly disposed man with a face seldom seen having the stamp of an unusual characteristic on it that of sincerity The vegetation of the shores as we proceeded was truly tropical each curve revealed new beauties With the soft chalky stone of which most of the cliffs and bluffs are made seen as we neared the mouth of the Malagarazi the surf has played strange freaks We arrived at the mouth of the Malagarazi about P M having rowed eighteen miles from Ukaranga The shore party arrived very much fatigued about five P M The next day was employed in crossing the caravan across the broad mouth of the Malagarazi to our camp a couple of miles north of the river This is a river which a civilised community would find of immense advantage for shortening the distance between the Tanganika and the coast Nearly one hundred miles might be performed by this river which is deep enough at all seasons to allow navigation as far as Kiala in Uvinza whence a straight road might be easily made to Unyanyembe Missionaries also might reap the same benefit from it for conversion tours to Uvinza Uhha and Ugala Pursuing our way on the thirtieth and rounding the picturesque capes of Kagongo Mviga and Kivoe we came after about three hours rowing in sight of villages at the mouth of the swift and turbid Rugufu Here we had again to transport the caravan ever the crocodile infested mouth of the river On the morning of the thirty first we sent a canoe with men to search for food in the two or three villages that were visible on the other side Four doti purchased just sufficient for four days for our caravan of forty eight persons We then got under weigh having informed the kirangozi that Urimba was our destination and bidding him keep as closely as possible to the lake shore where it was practicable but if not to make the best he could of it From the debouchement of the Rugufu the headwaters of which we had crossed on our random route to Ujiji to Urimba a distance of six days by water there are no villages and consequently no food The shore party however before leaving Ujiji had eight days rations and on this morning four days distributed to each person and therefore was in no danger of starvation should the mountain headlands now unfolding abrupt and steep one after another prevent them from communicating with us It must be understood that such a journey as this had never been attempted before by any Arab or Msawahili and every step taken was in sheer ignorance of where the road would lead the men ashore Rounding Kivoe s steep promontory whose bearded ridge and rugged slope wooded down to the water s edge whose exquisite coves and quiet recesses might well have evoked a poetical effusion to one so inclined we dared the chopping waves of Kivoe s bay and stood direct for the next cape Mizohazy behind which owing to wind and wave we were compelled to halt for the night After Mizohazy is the bold cape of Kabogo not the terrible Kabogo around whose name mystery has been woven by the superstitious natives not the Kabogo whose sullen thunder and awful roar were heard when crossing the Rugufu on our flight from the Wahha but a point in Ukaranga on whose hard and uninviting rocks many a canoe has been wrecked We passed close to its forbidding walls thankful for the calm of the Tanganika Near Kabogo are some very fine mvule trees well adapted for canoe building and there are no loud mouthed natives about to haggle for the privilege of cutting them Along the water s edge and about three feet above it was observed very clearly on the smooth face of the rocky slopes of Kabogo the high water mark of the lake This went to show that the Tanganika during the rainy season rises about three feet above its dry season level and that during the latter season evaporation reduces it to its normal level The number of rivers which we passed on this journey enabled me to observe whether as I was told there was any current setting north It was apparent to me that while the south west south or south east winds blew the brown flood of the rivers swept north but it happened that while passing once or twice the mouths of rivers after a puff from the north west and north that the muddied waters were seen southward of the mouths from which I conclude that there is no current in the Tanganika except such as is caused by the fickle wind Finding a snug nook of a bay at a place called Sigunga we put in for lunch An island at the mouth of the bay suggested to our minds that this was a beautiful spot for a mission station the grandly sloping hills in the background with an undulating shelf of land well wooded between them and the bay added to the attractions of such a spot The island capable of containing quite a large village and perfectly defensible might for prudence sake contain the mission and its congregation the landlocked bay would protect their fishery and trade vessels more than sustain a hundred times the number of the population of the island Wood for building their canoes and houses is close at hand the neighbouring country would afford game in abundance and the docile and civil people of Ukaranga but wait religious shepherds From beautiful Sigunga after a brief halt we set off and after three hours arrived at the mouth of the River Uwelasia Hippopotami and crocodiles being numerous we amused ourselves by shooting at them having also a hope of attracting the attention of our shore party the sound of whose guns we had not heard since leaving the Rugufu On the third of January we left Uwelasia and passing by Cape Herembe were in the bay of Tongwe This bay is about twenty five miles broad and stretches from Cape Herembe to Cape Tongwe Finding themselves so near their destination Urimba being but six miles from Herembe Point the men of both boats bent themselves to their oars and with shouts songs and laughter encouraged each other to do their utmost The flags of the two great Anglo Saxon nations rippled and played in the soft breeze sometimes drawing near caressingly together again bending away like two lovers coy to unite The tight little boat of the Doctor would keep ahead and the crimson and crossed flag of England would wave before me and it seemed to say to the beautiful laggard astern Come on come on England leads the way But was it not England s place to be in the front here She won the right to it by discovering the Tanganika America came but second Urimba though a large district of Kawendi has a village of the same name peopled by refugees from Yombeh who found the delta of the Loajeri though the unhealthiest of spots equal to that of the Rusizi far preferable to the neighbourhood of Sultan Pumburu of Southern Kawendi A good chase by the victors seems to have given a shock to their systems for they are very timid and distrustful of strangers and would by no means permit us to enter their village of which to say the truth I was very glad after a glance at the reeking corruption on which they were encamped In the immediate neighbourhood nay for a couple of miles on either side I should suppose that to a white man it were death to sleep a single night Leading the way south of the village I found a fit camping place at the extreme south east corner of Tongwe Bay about a mile and a half due west of the lofty peak of Kivanga or Kakungu By an observation taken by the Doctor we found ourselves to be in latitude five degrees fifty four minutes south None of the natives had heard of our shore party and as the delta of the Loajeri and Mogambazi extended for about fifteen miles and withal was the most impassable of places being perfectly flat overgrown with the tallest of matete eschinomenae and thorny bush and flooded with water it was useless to fatigue our men searching for the shore party in such an inhospitable country No provisions were procurable for the villages were in a state of semi starvation the inhabitants living from hand to mouth on what reluctant Fortune threw into their nets The second day of our arrival at Urimba I struck off into the interior with my gun bearer Kalulu carrying the Doctor s splendid double barreled rifle a Reilly No twelve on the search for venison After walking about a mile I came to a herd of zebras By creeping on all fours I managed to come within one hundred yards of them but I was in a bad spot low prickly shrubs and tsetse flies alighting on the rifle sight biting my nose and dashing into my eyes completely disconcerted me and to add to my discontent my efforts to disengage myself from the thorns alarmed the zebras which all stood facing the suspicious object in the bush I fired at the breast of one but as might be expected missed The zebras galloped away to about three hundred yards off and I dashed into the open and hastily cocking the left hand trigger aimed at a proud fellow trotting royally before his fellows and by good chance sent a bullet through his heart A fortunate shot also brought down a huge goose which had a sharp horny spur on the fore part of each wing This supply of meat materially contributed towards the provisioning of the party for the transit of the unknown land that lay between us and Mrera in Rusawa Kawendi It was not until the third day of our arrival at our camp at Urimba that our shore party arrived They had perceived our immense flag hoisted on a twenty feet long bamboo above the tallest tree near our camp as they surmounted the sharp lofty ridge behind Nerembe fifteen miles off and had at first taken it for a huge bird but there were sharp eyes in the crowd and guided by it they came to camp greeted as only lost and found men are greeted I suffered from another attack of fever at this camp brought on by the neighbourhood of the vile delta the look of which sickened the very heart in me On the seventh of January we struck camp and turned our faces eastward and for me home Yet regretfully There had been enough happiness and pleasure and pleasantest of social companionship found on the shores of the lake for me I had seen enough lovely scenes which siren like invited one to quiet rest gentle scenes where there was neither jar nor tumult neither strife nor defeat neither hope nor disappointment but rest a drowsy indolent yet pleasant rest And only a few drawbacks to these There was fever there were no books no newspapers no wife of my own race and blood no theatres no hotels no restaurants no East River oysters no mince pies neither buckwheat cakes nor anything much that was good for a cultivated palate to love So in turning to say farewell to the then placid lake and the great blue mountains that grew bluer as they receded on either hand I had the courage to utter that awful word tearlessly and without one sigh Our road led up through the valley of the Loajeri after leaving its delta a valley growing ever narrower until it narrowed into a ravine choked by the now roaring bellowing river whose resistless rush seemed to affect the very air we breathed It was getting oppressive this narrowing ravine and opportunely the road breasted a knoll then a terrace then a hill and lastly a mountain where we halted to encamp As we prepared to select a camping place the Doctor silently pointed forward and suddenly a dead silence reigned everywhere The quinine which I had taken in the morning seemed to affect me in every crevice of my brain but a bitter evil remained and though I trembled under the heavy weight of the Reilly rifle I crept forward to where the Doctor was pointing I found myself looking down a steep ravine on the other bank of which a fine buffalo cow was scrambling upward She had just reached the summit and was turning round to survey her enemy when I succeeded in planting a shot just behind the shoulder blade and close to the spine evoking from her a deep bellow of pain She is shot she is shot exclaimed the Doctor that is a sure sign you have hit her And the men even raised a shout at the prospect of meat A second planted in her spine brought her to her knees and a third ended her We thus had another supply of provisions which cut up and dried over a fire as the Wangwana are accustomed to do would carry them far over the unpeopled wilderness before us For the Doctor and myself we had the tongue the hump and a few choice pieces salted down and in a few days had prime corned beef It is not inapt to state that the rifle had more commendations bestowed on it than the hunter by the Wangwana The next day we continued the march eastward under the guidance of our kirangozi but it was evident by the road he led us that he knew nothing of the country though through his volubility he had led us to believe that he knew all about Ngondo Yombeh and Pumburu s districts When recalled from the head of the caravan we were about to descend into the rapid Loajeri and beyond it were three ranges of impassable mountains which we were to cross in a north easterly direction quite out of our road After consulting with the Doctor I put myself at the head of the caravan and following the spine of the ridge struck off due east regardless of how the road ran At intervals a travelled road crossed our path and after following it a while we came to the ford of the Loajeri The Loajeri rises south and south east of Kakungu Peak We made the best we could of the road after crossing the river until we reached the main path that runs from Karah to Ngondo and Pumburu in Southern Kawendi On the ninth soon after leaving camp we left the travelled path and made for a gap in the are of hills before us as Pumburu was at war with the people of Manya Msenge a district of northern Kawendi The country teemed with game the buffaloes and zebras were plentiful Among the conspicuous trees were the hyphene and borassus palm trees and a tree bearing a fruit about the size of a six hundred pounder cannon ball called by some natives mabyah according to the Doctor the seeds of which are roasted and eaten They are not to be recommended as food to Europeans In the Kisawahili tongue mabyah mbyah byah mean bad unpleasant On the tenth putting myself at the head of my men with my compass in hand I led the way east for three hours A beautiful park land was revealed to us but the grass was very tall and the rainy season which had commenced in earnest made my work excessively disagreeable Through this tall grass which was as high as my throat I had to force my way compass in hand to lead the Expedition as there was not the least sign of a road and we were now in an untravelled country We made our camp on a beautiful little stream flowing north one of the feeders of the Rugufu River The eleventh still saw me plunging through the grass which showered drops of rain on me every time I made a step forward In two hours we crossed a small stream with slippery syenitic rocks in its bed showing the action of furious torrents Mushrooms were in abundance and very large In crossing an old pagazi of Unyamwezi weather beaten uttered in a deplorable tone My kibuyu is dead by which he meant that he had slipped and in falling had broken his gourd which in Kisawahili is kibuyu On the eastern bank we halted for lunch and after an hour and a half s march arrived at another stream which I took to be the Mtambu at first from the similarity of the land though my map informed me that it was impossible The scenery around was very similar and to the north we had cited a similar tabular hill to the Magdala Mount I had discovered north of Imrera while going to the Malagarazi Though we had only travelled three and a half hours the Doctor was very tired as the country was exceedingly rough The next day crossing several ranges with glorious scenes of surpassing beauty everywhere around us we came in view of a mighty and swift torrent whose bed was sunk deep between enormous lofty walls of sandstone rock where it roared and brawled with the noise of a little Niagara Having seen our camp prepared on a picturesque knoll I thought I would endeavour to procure some meat which this interesting region seemed to promise I sallied out with my little Winchester along the banks of the river eastward I travelled for an hour or two the prospect getting more picturesque and lovely and then went up a ravine which looked very promising Unsuccessful I strode up the bank and my astonishment may be conceived when I found myself directly in front of an elephant who had his large broad ears held out like studding sails the colossal monster the incarnation of might of the African world Methought when I saw his trunk stretched forward like a warning finger that I heard a voice say Siste Venator But whether it did not proceed from my imagination or No I believe it proceeded from Kalulu who must have shouted Tembo tembo bana yango Lo an elephant an elephant my master For the young rascal had fled as soon as he had witnessed the awful colossus in such close vicinage Recovering from my astonishment I thought it prudent to retire also especially with a pea shooter loaded with treacherous sawdust cartridges in my hand As I looked behind I saw him waving his trunk which I understood to mean Good bye young fellow it is lucky for you you went in time for I was going to pound you to a jelly As I was congratulating myself a wasp darted fiercely at me and planted its sting in my neck and for that afternoon my anticipated pleasures were dispelled Arriving at camp I found the men grumbling their provisions were ended and there was no prospect for three days at least of procuring any With the improvidence usual with the gluttons they had eaten their rations of grain all their store of zebra and dried buffalo meat and were now crying out that they were famished The tracks of animals were numerous but it being the rainy season the game was scattered everywhere whereas had we travelled during the dry season through these forests our larders might have been supplied fresh each day Some time about six P M as the Doctor and I were taking our tea outside the tent a herd of elephants twelve in number passed about eight hundred yards off Our fundi Asmani and Mabruki Kisesa were immediately despatched in pursuit I would have gone myself with the heavy Reilly rifle only I was too much fatigued We soon heard their guns firing and hoped they were successful as a plentiful supply of meat might then have been procured while we ourselves would have secured one of the elephant s feet for a nice delicate roast but within an hour they returned unsuccessful having only drawn blood some of which they exhibited to us on a leaf It requires a very good rifle to kill an African elephant A No eight bore with a Frazer s shell planted in the temple I believe would drop an elephant each shot Faulkner makes some extraordinary statements about walking up in front of an elephant and planting a bullet in his forehead killing him instantly The tale however is so incredible that I would prefer not to believe it especially when he states that the imprint of the muzzle of his rifle was on the elephant s trunk African travellers especially those with a taste for the chase are too fond of relating that which borders on the incredible for ordinary men to believe them Such stories must be taken with a large grain of salt for the sake of the amusement they afford to readers at home In future whenever I hear a man state how he broke the back of an antelope at six hundred yards I shall incline to believe a cipher had been added by a slip of the pen or attribute it to a typographical error for this is almost an impossible feat in an African forest It may be done once but it could never be done twice running An antelope makes a very small target at six hundred yards distance but then all these stories belong by right divine to the chasseur who travels to Africa for the sake only of sport On the thirteenth we continued our march across several ridges and the series of ascents and descents revealed to us valleys and mountains never before explored streams rushing northward swollen by the rains and grand primeval forests in whose twilight shade no white man ever walked before On the fourteenth the same scenes were witnessed an unbroken series of longitudinal ridges parallel one with another and with Lake Tanganika Eastward the faces of these ridges present abrupt scarps and terraces rising from deep valleys while the western declivities have gradual slopes These are the peculiar features of Ukawendi the eastern watershed of the Tanganika In one of these valleys on this day we came across a colony of reddish bearded monkeys whose howls or bellowing rang amongst the cliffs as they discovered the caravan I was not able to approach them for they scrambled up trees and barked their defiance at me then bounded to the ground as I still persisted in advancing and they would have soon drawn me in pursuit if I had not suddenly remembered that my absence was halting the Expedition About noon we sighted our Magdala the grand towering mount whose upright frowning mass had attracted our eyes as it lifted itself from above the plain in all its grandeur when we were hurrying along the great ridge of Rusawa towards the Crocodile River We recognised the old mystic beauty of the tree clad plain around it Then it was bleached and a filmy haze covered it lovingly now it was vivid greenness Every vegetable plant herb and tree had sprung into quick life the effect of the rains Rivers that ran not in those hot summer days now fumed and rushed impetuously between thick belts of mighty timber brawling hoarsely in the glades We crossed many of these streams all of which are feeders of the Rugufu Beautiful bewitching Ukawendi By what shall I gauge the loveliness of the wild free luxuriant spontaneous nature within its boundaries By anything in Europe No By anything in Asia Where India perhaps Yes or say Mingrelia and Imeritia For there we have foaming rivers we have picturesque hillocks we have bold hills ambitious mountains and broad forests with lofty solemn rows of trees with clean straight stems through which you can see far lengthy vistas as you see here Only in Ukawendi you can almost behold the growth of vegetation the earth is so generous nature so kind and loving that without entertaining any aspiration for a residence or a wish to breathe the baleful atmosphere longer than is absolutely necessary one feels insensibly drawn towards it as the thought creeps into his mind that though all is foul beneath the captivating glamorous beauty of the land the foulness might be removed by civilized people and the whole region made as healthy as it is productive Even while staggering under the pressure of the awful sickness with mind getting more and more embittered brain sometimes reeling with the shock of the constantly recurring fevers though I knew how the malaria rising out of that very fairness was slowly undermining my constitution and insidiously sapping the powers of mind and body I regarded the alluring face of the land with a fatuous love and felt a certain sadness steal over me as each day I was withdrawing myself from it and felt disposed to quarrel with the fate that seemed to eject me out of Ukawendi On the ninth day of our march from the shores of the Tanganika we again perceived our Magdala Mount rising like a dark cloud to the north east by which I knew that we were approaching Imrera and that our Icarian attempt to cross the uninhabited jungle of Ukawendi would soon be crowned with success Against the collective counsel of the guides and hypothetical suggestions of the tired and hungry souls of our Expedition I persisted in being guided only by the compass and my chart The guides strenuously strove to induce me to alter my course and strike in a south west direction which had I listened to them would have undoubtedly taken me to South western Ukonongo or North eastern Ufipa The veteran and experienced soldiers asked mournfully if I were determined to kill them with famine as the road I should have taken was north east but I preferred putting my trust in the compass No sun shone upon us as we threaded our way through the primeval forest by clumps of jungle across streams up steep ridges and down into deep valleys A thick haze covered the forests rain often pelted us the firmament was an unfathomable depth of grey vapour The Doctor had perfect confidence in me and I held on my way As soon as we arrived at our camp the men scattered themselves through the forest to search for food A grove of singwe trees was found close by Mushrooms grew in abundance and these sufficed to appease the gnawing hunger from which the people suffered Had it not been such rainy weather I should have been enabled to procure game for the camp but the fatigue which I suffered and the fever which enervated me utterly prevented me from moving out of the camp after we once came to a halt The fear of lions which were numerous in our vicinity whose terrible roaring was heard by day and by night daunted the hunters so much that though I offered five doti of cloth for every animal brought to camp none dared penetrate the gloomy glades or awesome belts of timber outside the friendly defence of the camp The morning of the tenth day I assured the people that we were close to food cheered the most amiable of them with promise of abundant provender and hushed the most truculent knaves with a warning not to tempt my patience too much lest we came to angry blows and then struck away east by north through the forest with the almost exhausted Expedition dragging itself weakly and painfully behind me It was a most desperate position certainly and I pitied the poor people far more than they pitied themselves and though I fumed and stormed in their presence when they were disposed to lie down and give up never was a man further from doing them injury I was too proud of them but under the circumstances it was dangerous nay suicidal to appear doubtful or dubious of the road The mere fact that I still held on my way according to the Doctor s little pearly monitor the compass had a grand moral effect on them and though they demurred in plaintive terms and with pinched faces they followed my footsteps with a trustfulness which quite affected me For long miles we trudged over smooth sloping sward with a vision of forest and park land beauty on our right and left and in front of us such as is rarely seen At a pace that soon left the main body of the Expedition far behind I strode on with a few gallant fellows who despite their heavy loads kept pace with me After a couple of hours we were ascending the easy slope of a ridge which promised to decide in a few minutes the truth or the inaccuracy of my chart Presently we arrived at the eastern edge of the ridge and about five miles away and one thousand feet below the high plateau on which we stood we distinguished the valley of Imrera By noon we were in our old camp The natives gathered round bringing supplies of food and to congratulate us upon having gone to Ujiji and returned But it was long before the last member of the Expedition arrived The Doctor s feet were very sore bleeding from the weary march His shoes were in a very worn out state and he had so cut and slashed them with a knife to ease his blistered feet that any man of our force would have refused them as a gift no matter how ambitious he might be to encase his feet a la Wasungu Asmani the guide was very much taken aback when he discovered that the tiny compass knew the way better than he did and he declared it as his solemn opinion that it could not lie He suffered much in reputation from having contested the palm with the little thing and ever afterwards his boasted knowledge of the country was considerably doubted After halting a day to recruit ourselves we continued our journey on the eighteenth January eighteen seventy two towards Unyanyembe A few miles beyond Imrera Asmani lost the road again and I was obliged to show it to him by which I gained additional honour and credit as a leader and guide My shoes were very bad and it was difficult to decide whose were the worst in condition the Doctor s or mine A great change had come upon the face of the land since I had passed northward en route to Ujiji The wild grapes now hung in clusters along the road the corn ears were advanced enough to pluck and roast for food the various plants shed their flowers and the deep woods and grasses of the country were greener than ever On the nineteenth we arrived at Mpokwa s deserted village The Doctor s feet were very much chafed and sore by the marching He had walked on foot all the way from Urimba though he owned a donkey while I considerably to my shame be it said had ridden occasionally to husband my strength that I might be enabled to hunt after arrival at camp Two huts were cleared for our use but just as we had made ourselves comfortable our sharp eyed fellows had discovered several herds of game in the plain west of Mpokwa Hastily devouring a morsel of corn bread with coffee I hastened away with Bilali for a gunbearer taking with me the famous Reilly rifle of the Doctor and a supply of Fraser s shells After plunging through a deep stream and getting wet again and pushing my way through a dense brake I arrived at a thin belt of forest through which I was obliged to crawl and in half an hour I had arrived within one hundred and forty yards of a group of zebras which were playfully biting each other under the shade of a large tree Suddenly rising up I attracted their attention but the true old rifle was at my shoulder and crack crack went both barrels and two fine zebras a male and female fell dead under the tree where they had stood In a few seconds their throats were cut and after giving the signal of my success I was soon surrounded by a dozen of my men who gave utterance to their delight by fulsome compliments to the merits of the rifle though very few to me When I returned to camp with the meat I received the congratulations of the Doctor which I valued far higher as he knew from long experience what shooting was When the eatable portions of the two zebras were hung to the scale we found according to the Doctor s own figures that we had seven hundred nineteen lbs of good meat which divided among forty four men gave a little over sixteen lbs to each person Bombay especially was very happy as he had dreamed a dream wherein I figured prominently as shooting animals down right and left and when he had seen me depart with that wonderful Reilly rifle he had not entertained a doubt of my success and accordingly had commanded the men to be ready to go after me as soon as they should hear the reports of the gun The following is quoted from my Diary January twentieth eighteen seventy two To day was a halt On going out for a hunt I saw a herd of eleven giraffes After crossing Mpokwa stream I succeeded in getting within one hundred and fifty yards of one of them and fired at it but though it was wounded I did not succeed in dropping it though I desired the skin of one of them very much In the afternoon I went out to the east of the village and came to a herd of six giraffes I wounded one of them but it got off despite my efforts What remarkable creatures they are How beautiful their large limpid eyes I could have declared on oath that both shots had been a success but they sheered off with the stately movements of a clipper about to tack When they ran they had an ungainly dislocated motion somewhat like the contortions of an Indian nautch or a Theban danseuse a dreamy undulating movement which even the tail with its long fringe of black hair seemed to partake of The Doctor who knew how to console an ardent but disappointed young hunter attributed my non success to shooting with leaden balls which were too soft to penetrate the thick hide of the giraffes and advised me to melt my zinc canteens with which to harden the lead It was not the first time that I had cause to think the Doctor an admirable travelling companion none knew so well how to console one for bad luck none knew so well how to elevate one in his own mind If I killed a zebra did not his friend Oswell the South African hunter and himself long ago come to the conclusion that zebra meat was the finest in Africa If I shot a buffalo cow she was sure to be the best of her kind and her horns were worth while carrying home as specimens and was she not fat If I returned without anything the game was very wild or the people had made a noise and the game had been frightened and who could stalk animals already alarmed Indeed he was a most considerate companion and knowing him to be literally truthful I was proud of his praise when successful and when I failed I was easily consoled Ibrahim the old pagazi whose feelings had been so lacerated in Ukawendi when his ancient kibuyu broke before leaving Ujiji invested his cloth in a slave from Manyuema who bore the name of Ulimengo which signifies the World As we approached Mpokwa Ulimengo absconded with all his master s property consisting of a few cloths and a bag of salt which he had thought of taking to Unyanyembe for trade Ibrahim was inconsolable and he kept lamenting his loss daily in such lugubrious tones that the people instead of sympathizing laughed at him I asked him why he purchased such a slave and while he was with him why he did not feed him Replied he tartly Was he not my slave Was not the cloth with which I bought him mine If the cloth was my own could I not purchase what I liked Why do you talk so Ibrahim s heart was made glad this evening by the return of Ulimengo with the salt and the cloth and the one eyed old man danced with his great joy and came in all haste to impart to me the glad news Lo the World has come back Sure My salt and my cloth are with him also Sure To which I replied that he had better feed him in future as slaves required food as well as their masters From ten P M to midnight the Doctor was employed in taking observations from the star Canopus the result of which was that he ascertained Mpokwa district of Utanda Ukonongo to be in S latitude six degrees eighteen minutes forty seconds On comparing it with its position as laid down in my map by dead reckoning I found we differed by three miles I having laid it down at six degrees fifteen minutes south latitude The day following was a halt The Doctor s feet were so inflamed and sore that he could not bear his shoes on My heels were also raw and I viciously cut large circles out of my shoes to enable me to move about Having converted my zinc canteens into bullets and provided myself with a butcher and gun bearer I set out for the lovely park land and plain west of Mpokwa stream with the laudable resolution to obtain something and seeing nothing in the plain I crossed over a ridge and came to a broad basin covered with tall grass with clumps here and there of hyphene palm with a stray mimosa or so scattered about Nibbling off the branches of the latter I saw a group of giraffes and then began stalking them through the grass taking advantage of the tall grass grown ant hills that I might approach the wary beasts before their great eyes could discover me I contrived to come within one hundred seventy five yards by means of one of these curious hummocks but beyond it no man could crawl without being observed the grass was so thin and short I took a long breath wiped my perspiring brow and sat down for a while my black assistants also like myself were almost breathless with the exertion and the high expectations roused by the near presence of the royal beasts I toyed lovingly with the heavy Reilly saw to my cartridges and then stood up and turned with my rifle ready took one good long steady aim then lowered it again to arrange the sights lifted it up once more dropped it A giraffe half turned his body for the last time I lifted it took one quick sight at the region of the heart and fired He staggered reeled then made a short gallop but the blood was spouting from the wound in a thick stream and before he had gone two hundred yards he came to a dead halt with his ears drawn back and allowed me to come within twenty yards of him when receiving a zinc bullet through the head he fell dead Allah ho akhbar cried Khamisi my butcher fervently This is meat master I was rather saddened than otherwise at seeing the noble animal stretched before me If I could have given him his life back I think I should have done so I thought it a great pity that such splendid animals so well adapted for the service of man in Africa could not be converted to some other use than that of food Horses mules and donkeys died in these sickly regions but what a blessing for Africa would it be if we could tame the giraffes and zebras for the use of explorers and traders Mounted on a zebra a man would be enabled to reach Ujiji in one month from Bagamoyo whereas it took me over seven months to travel that distance The dead giraffe measured sixteen feet nine inches from his right fore hoof to the top of his head and was one of the largest size though some have been found to measure over seventeen feet He was spotted all over with large black nearly round patches I left Khamisi in charge of the dead beast while I returned to camp to send off men to cut it up and convey the meat to our village But Khamisi climbed a tree for fear of the lions and the vultures settled on it so that when the men arrived on the spot the eyes the tongue and a great part of the posteriors were eaten up What remained weighed as follows when brought in and hung to the scales one hind leg one hundred thirty four lbs one one hundred thirty six one fore leg one hundred sixty I one hundred sixty Ribs one hundred fifty eight Neck seventy four Rump eighty seven Breast forty six Liver twenty Lungs twelve Heart six Total weight of eatable portions nine hundred ninety three lbs Skin and head one hundred eighty one lbs The three days following I suffered from a severe attack of fever and was unable to stir from bed I applied my usual remedies for it which consisted of colocynth and quinine but experience has shown me that an excessive use of the same cathartic weakens its effect and that it would be well for travellers to take with them different medicines to cause proper action in the liver such as colocynth calomel resin of jalap Epsom salts and that no quinine should be taken until such medicines shall have prepared the system for its reception The Doctor s prescription for fever consists of three grains of resin of jalap and two grains of calomel with tincture of cardamoms put in just enough to prevent irritation of the stomach made into the form of a pill which is to be taken as soon as one begins to feel the excessive languor and weariness which is the sure forerunner of the African type of fever An hour or two later a cup of coffee unsugared and without milk ought to be taken to cause a quicker action The Doctor also thinks that quinine should be taken with the pill but my experience though it weighs nothing against what he has endured has proved to me that quinine is useless until after the medicine has taken effect My stomach could never bear quinine unless subsequent to the cathartic A well known missionary at Constantinople recommends travellers to take three grains of tartar emetic for the ejection of the bilious matter in the stomach but the reverend doctor possibly forgets that much more of the system is disorganized than the stomach and though in one or two cases of a slight attack this remedy may have proved successful it is altogether too violent for an enfeebled man in Africa I have treated myself faithfully after this method three or four times but I could not conscientiously recommend it For cases of urticaria I could recommend taking three grains of tartar emetic but then a stomach pump would answer the purpose as well On the twenty seventh we set out for Misonghi About half way I saw the head of the Expedition on the run and the motive seemed to be communicated quickly man after man to those behind until my donkey commenced to kick and lash behind with his heels In a second I was made aware of the cause of this excitement by a cloud of wild bees buzzing about my head three or four of which settled on my face and stung me frightfully We raced madly for about half a mile behaving in as wild a manner as the poor bestung animals As this was an unusually long march I doubted if the Doctor could march it because his feet were so sore so I determined to send four men back with the kitanda but the stout old hero refused to be carried and walked all the way to camp after a march of eighteen miles He had been stung dreadfully in the head and in the face the bees had settled in handfuls in his hair but after partaking of a cup of warm tea and some food he was as cheerful as if he had never travelled a mile At Mrera Central Ukonongo we halted a day to grind grain and to prepare the provision we should need during the transit of the wilderness between Mrera and Manyara On the thirty first of January at Mwaru Sultan Ka mirambo we met a caravan under the leadership of a slave of Sayd bin Habib who came to visit us in our camp which was hidden in a thick clump of jungle After he was seated and had taken his coffee I asked What is thy news my friend that thou bast brought from Unyanyembe My news is good master How goes the war Ah Mirambo is where He eats the hides even He is famished Sayd bin Habib my master hath possession of Kirira The Arabs are thundering at the gates of Wilyankuru Sayd bin Majid who came from Ujiji to Usagozi in twenty days hath taken and slain Moto Fire the King Simba of Kasera hath taken up arms for the defence of his father Mkasiwa of Unyanyembe The chief of Ugunda hath sent five hundred men to the field Ough Mirambo is where In a month he will be dead of hunger Great and good news truly my friend Yes in the name of God And whither art thou bound with thy caravan Sayd the son of Majid who came from Ujiji hath told us of the road that the white man took that he had arrived at Ujiji safely and that he was on his way back to Unyanyembe So we have thought that if the white man could go there we could also Lo the Arabs come by the hundred by the white man s road to get the ivory from Ujiji I am that white man You Yes Why it was reported that you were dead that you fought with the Wazavira Ah my friend these are the words of Njara the son of Khamis See pointing to Livingstone this is the white man my father whom I saw at Ujiji He is going with me to Unyanyembe to get his cloth after which he will return to the great waters It is a courteous custom in Africa to address elderly people as Baba Father Wonderful thou sayest truly What has thou to tell me of the white man at Unyanyembe Which white man The white man I left in the house of Sayd the son of Salim my house at Kwihara He is dead Dead True You do not mean to say the white man is dead True he is dead How long ago Many months now What did he die of Homa fever Any more of my people dead I know not Enough I looked sympathetically at the Doctor and he replied I told you so When you described him to me as a drunken man I knew he could not live Men who have been habitual drunkards cannot live in this country any more than men who have become slaves to other vices I attribute the deaths that occurred in my expedition on the Zambezi to much the same cause Ah Doctor there are two of us gone I shall be the third if this fever lasts much longer Oh no not at all If you would have died from fever you would have died at Ujiji when you had that severe attack of remittent Don t think of it Your fever now is only the result of exposure to wet I never travel during the wet season This time I have travelled because I was anxious and I did not wish to detain you at Ujiji Well there is nothing like a good friend at one s back in this country to encourage him and keep his spirits up Poor Shaw I am sorry very sorry for him How many times have I not endeavoured to cheer him up But there was no life in him And among the last words I said to him before parting were Remember if you return to Unyanyembe you die We also obtained news from the chief of Sayd bin Habib s caravan that several packets of letters and newspapers and boxes had arrived for me from Zanzibar by my messengers and Arabs that Selim the son of Sheikh Hashid of Zanzibar was amongst the latest arrivals in Unyanyembe The Doctor also reminded me with the utmost good nature that according to his accounts he had a stock of jellies and crackers soups fish and potted ham besides cheese awaiting him in Unyanyembe and that he would be delighted to share his good things whereupon I was greatly cheered and during the repeated attacks of fever I suffered about this time my imagination loved to dwell upon the luxuries at Unyanyembe I pictured myself devouring the hams and crackers and jellies like a madman I lived on my raving fancies My poor vexed brain rioted on such homely things as wheaten bread and butter hams bacon caviare and I would have thought no price too high to pay for them Though so far away and out of the pale of Europe and America it was a pleasure to me during the athumia or despondency into which I was plunged by ever recurring fevers to dwell upon them I wondered that people who had access to such luxuries should ever get sick and become tired of life I thought that if a wheaten loaf with a nice pat of fresh butter were presented to me I would be able though dying to spring up and dance a wild fandango Though we lacked the good things of this life above named we possessed salted giraffe and pickled zebra tongues we had ugali made by Halimah herself we had sweet potatoes tea coffee dampers or slap jacks but I was tired of them My enfeebled stomach harrowed and irritated with medicinal compounds with ipecac colocynth tartar emetic quinine and such things protested against the coarse food Oh for a wheaten loaf my soul cried in agony Five hundred dollars for one loaf of bread The Doctor somehow or another despite the incessant rain the dew fog and drizzle the marching and sore feet ate like a hero and I manfully sternly resolved to imitate the persevering attention he paid to the welfare of his gastric powers but I miserably failed doctor Livingstone possesses all the attainments of a traveller His knowledge is great about everything concerning Africa the rocks the trees the fruits and their virtues are known to him He is also full of philosophic reflections upon ethnological matter With camp craft with its cunning devices he is au fait His bed is luxurious as a spring mattress Each night he has it made under his own supervision First he has two straight poles cut three or four inches in diameter which are laid parallel one with another at the distance of two feet across these poles are laid short sticks saplings three feet long and over them is laid a thick pile of grass then comes a piece of waterproof canvas and blankets and thus a bed has been improvised fit for a king It was at Livingstone s instigation I purchased milch goats by which since leaving Ujiji we have had a supply of fresh milk for our tea and coffee three times a day Apropos of this we are great drinkers of these welcome stimulants we seldom halt drinking until we have each had six or seven cups We have also been able to provide ourselves with music which though harsh is better than none I mean the musical screech of parrots from Manyuema Half way between Mwaru Kamirambo s village and the deserted Tongoni of Ukamba I carved the Doctor s initials and my own on a large tree with the date February second I have been twice guilty of this in Africa once when we were famishing in Southern Uvinza I inscribed the date my initials and the word Starving in large letters on the trunk of a sycamore In passing through the forest of Ukamba we saw the bleached skull of an unfortunate victim to the privations of travel Referring to it the Doctor remarked that he could never pass through an African forest with its solemn stillness and serenity without wishing to be buried quietly under the dead leaves where he would be sure to rest undisturbed In England there was no elbow room the graves were often desecrated and ever since he had buried his wife in the woods of Shupanga he had sighed for just such a spot where his weary bones would receive the eternal rest they coveted The same evening when the tent door was down and the interior was made cheerful by the light of a paraffin candle the Doctor related to me some incidents respecting the career and the death of his eldest son Robert Readers of Livingstone s first book South Africa without which no boy should be will probably recollect the dying Sebituane s regard for the little boy Robert missus Livingstone and family were taken to the Cape of Good Hope and thence sent to England where Robert was put in the charge of a tutor but wearied of inactivity when he was about eighteen he left Scotland and came to Natal whence he endeavoured to reach his father Unsuccessful in his attempt he took ship and sailed for New York and enlisted in the Northern Army in a New Hampshire regiment of Volunteers discarding his own name of Robert Moffatt Livingstone and taking that of Rupert Vincent that his tutor who seems to have been ignorant of his duties to the youth might not find him From one of the battles before Richmond he was conveyed to a North Carolina hospital where he died from his wounds On the seventh of February we arrived at the Gombe and camped near one of its largest lakes This lake is probably several miles in length and swarms with hippopotami and crocodiles From this camp I despatched Ferajji the cook and Chowpereh to Unyanyembe to bring the letters and medicines that were sent to me from Zanzibar and meet us at Ugunda while the next day we moved to our old quarters on the Gombe where we were first introduced to the real hunter s paradise in Central Africa The rain had scattered the greater number of the herds but there was plenty of game in the vicinity Soon after breakfast I took Khamisi and Kalulu with me for a hunt After a long walk we arrived near a thin jungle where I discovered the tracks of several animals boar antelope elephant rhinoceros hippopotamus and an unusual number of imprints of the lion s paw Suddenly I heard Khamisi say Master master here is a simba lion and he came up to me trembling with excitement and fear for the young fellow was an arrant coward to point out the head of a beast which could be seen just above the tall grass looking steadily towards us It immediately afterwards bounded from side to side but the grass was so high that it was impossible to tell exactly what it was Taking advantage of a tree in my front I crept quietly onwards intending to rest the heavy rifle against it as I was so weak from the effects of several fevers that I felt myself utterly incapable of supporting my rifle for a steady aim But my surprise was great when I cautiously laid it against the tree and then directed its muzzle to the spot where I had seen him stand Looking further away to where the grass was thin and scant I saw the animal bound along at a great rate and that it was a lion the noble monarch of the forest was in full flight From that moment I ceased to regard him as the mightiest among the brutes or his roar as anything more fearful in broad daylight than a sucking dove s The next day was also a halt and unable to contain my longing for the chase where there used to be such a concourse of game of all kinds soon after morning coffee and after despatching a couple of men with presents to my friend Ma manyara of ammonia bottle memory I sauntered out once more for the park Not five hundred yards from the camp myself and men were suddenly halted by hearing in our immediate vicinity probably within fifty yards or so a chorus of roars issuing from a triplet of lions Instinctively my fingers raised the two hammers as I expected a general onset on me for though one lion might fly it was hardly credible that three should While looking keenly about I detected within easy rifle shot a fine hartebeest trembling and cowering behind a tree as if it expected the fangs of the lion in its neck Though it had its back turned to me I thought a bullet might plough its way to a vital part and without a moment s hesitation I aimed and fired The animal gave a tremendous jump as if it intended to take a flying leap through the tree but recovering itself it dashed through the underbrush in a different direction from that in which I supposed the lions to be and I never saw it again though I knew I had struck it from the bloody trail it left neither did I see nor hear anything more of the lions I searched far and wide over the park land for prey of some kind but was compelled to return unsuccessful to camp Disgusted with my failure we started a little after noon for Manyara at which place we were hospitably greeted by my friend who had sent men to tell me that his white brother must not halt in the woods but must come to his village We received a present of honey and food from the chief which was most welcome to us in our condition Here was an instance of that friendly disposition among Central African chiefs when they have not been spoiled by the Arabs which doctor Livingstone found among the Babisa and Ba ulungu and in Manyuema I received the same friendly recognition from all the chiefs from Imrera in Ukawendi to Unyanyembe as I did from Mamanyara On the fourteenth we arrived at Ugunda and soon after we had established ourselves comfortably in a hut which the chief lent us for our use in came Ferajji and Chowpereh bringing with them Sarmean and Uledi Manwa Sera who it will be recollected were the two soldiers sent to Zanzibar with letters and who should Sarmean have in charge but the deserter Hamdallah who decamped at Manyara as we were going to Ujiji This fellow it seems had halted at Kigandu and had informed the chief and the doctor of the village that he had been sent by the white man to take back the cloth left there for the cure of Mabruk Saleem and the simple chief had commanded it to be given up to him upon his mere word in consequence of which the sick man had died Upon Sarmean s arrival in Unyanyembe from Zanzibar about fifty days after the Expedition had departed for Ujiji the news he received was that the white man Shaw was dead and that a man called Hamdallah who had engaged himself as one of my guides but who had shortly after returned was at Unyanyembe He had left him unmolested until the appearance of Ferajji and his companion when they at once in a body made a descent on his hut and secured him With the zeal which always distinguished him in my service Sarmean had procured a forked pole between the prongs of which the neck of the absconder was placed and a cross stick firmly lashed effectually prevented him from relieving himself of the incumbrance attached to him so deftly There were no less than seven packets of letters and newspapers from Zanzibar which had been collecting during my absence from Unyanyembe These had been intrusted at various times to the chiefs of caravans who had faithfully delivered them at my tembe according to their promise to the Consul There was one packet for me which contained two or three letters for doctor Livingstone to whom of course they were at once transferred with my congratulations In the same packet there was also a letter to me from the British Consul at Zanzibar requesting me to take charge of Livingstone s goods and do the best I could to forward them on to him dated twenty fifth September eighteen seventy one five days after I left Unyanyembe on my apparently hopeless task Well Doctor said I to Livingstone the English Consul requests me to do all I can to push forward your goods to you I am sorry that I did not get the authority sooner for I should have attempted it but in the absence of these instructions I have done the best I could by pushing you towards the goods The mountain has not been able to advance towards Mohammed but Mohammed has been compelled to advance towards the mountain But doctor Livingstone was too deeply engrossed in his own letters from home which were just a year old I received good and bad news from New York but the good news was subsequent and wiped out all feelings that might have been evoked had I received the bad only But the newspapers nearly a hundred of them New York Boston and London journals were full of most wonderful news The Paris Commune was in arms against the National Assembly the Tuileries the Louvre and the ancient city Lutetia Parisiorum had been set in flames by the blackguards of Saint Antoine French troops massacring and murdering men women and children rampant diabolism and incarnate revenge were at work in the most beautiful city in the world Fair women converted into demons and dragged by ruffianly soldiery through the streets to universal execration and pitiless death children of tender age pinned to the earth and bayoneted men innocent or not shot cut stabbed slashed destroyed a whole city given up to the summa injuria of an infuriate reckless and brutal army Oh France Oh Frenchmen Such things are unknown even in the heart of barbarous Central Africa We spurned the newspapers with our feet and for relief to sickened hearts gazed on the comic side of our world as illustrated in the innocent pages of Punch Poor Punch good hearted kindly natured Punch a traveller s benison on thee Thy jokes were as physic thy innocent satire was provocative of hysteric mirth Our doors were crowded with curious natives who looked with indescribable wonder at the enormous sheets I heard them repeat the words Khabari Kisungu white man s news often and heard them discussing the nature of such a quantity of news and expressing their belief that the Wasungu were mbyah sana and very mkali by which they meant to say that the white men were very wicked and very smart and clever though the term wicked is often employed to express high admiration On the fourth day from Ugunda or the eighteenth of February and the fifty third day from Ujiji we made our appearance with flags flying and guns firing in the valley of Kwihara and when the Doctor and myself passed through the portals of my old quarters I formally welcomed him to Unyanyembe and to my house Since the day I had left the Arabs sick and weary almost with my life but nevertheless imbued with the high hope that my mission would succeed one hundred thirty one days had elapsed with what vicissitudes of fortune the reader well knows during which time I had journeyed over twelve hundred miles The myth after which I travelled through the wilderness proved to be a fact and never was the fact more apparent than when the Living Man walked with me arm in arm to my old room and I said to him Doctor we are at last HOME CHAPTER XV HOMEWARD BOUND LIVINGSTONE S LAST WORDS THE FINAL FAREWELL Unyanyembe was now to me a terrestrial Paradise Livingstone was no less happy he was in comfortable quarters which were a palace compared to his hut in Ujiji Our store rooms were full of the good things of this life besides cloth beads wire and the thousand and one impedimenta and paraphernalia of travel with which I had loaded over one hundred and fifty men at Bagamoyo I had seventy four loads of miscellaneous things the most valuable of which were now to be turned over to Livingstone for his march back to the sources of the Nile It was a great day with us when with hammer and chisel I broke open the Doctor s boxes that we might feast our famished stomachs on the luxuries which were to redeem us from the effect of the cacotrophic dourra and maize food we had been subjected to in the wilderness I conscientiously believed that a diet on potted ham crackers and jellies would make me as invincible as Talus and that I only required a stout flail to be able to drive the mighty Wagogo into the regions of annihilation should they dare even to wink in a manner I disapproved The first box opened contained three tins of biscuits six tins of potted hams tiny things not much larger than thimbles which when opened proved to be nothing more than a table spoonful of minced meat plentifully seasoned with pepper the Doctor s stores fell five hundred degrees below zero in my estimation Next were brought out five pots of jam one of which was opened this was also a delusion The stone jars weighed a pound and in each was found a little over a tea spoonful of jam Verily we began to think our hopes and expectations had been raised to too high a pitch Three bottles of curry were next produced but who cares for curry Another box was opened and out tumbled a fat dumpy Dutch cheese hard as a brick but sound and good though it is bad for the liver in Unyamwezi Then another cheese was seen but this was all eaten up it was hollow and a fraud The third box contained nothing but two sugar loaves the fourth candles the fifth bottles of salt Harvey Worcester and Reading sauces essence of anchovies pepper and mustard Bless me what food were these for the revivifying of a moribund such as I was The sixth box contained four shirts two pairs of stout shoes some stockings and shoe strings which delighted the Doctor so much when he tried them on that he exclaimed Richard is himself again That man said I whoever he is is a friend indeed Yes that is my friend Waller The five other boxes contained potted meat and soups but the twelfth containing one dozen bottles of medicinal brandy was gone and a strict cross examination of Asmani the head man of Livingstone s caravan elicited the fact that not only was one case of brandy missing but also two bales of cloth and four bags of the most valuable beads in Africa sami sami which are as gold with the natives I was grievously disappointed after the stores had been examined everything proved to be deceptions in my jaundiced eyes Out of the tins of biscuits when opened there was only one sound box the whole of which would not make one full meal The soups who cared for meat soups in Africa Are there no bullocks and sheep and goats in the land from which far better soup can be made than any that was ever potted Peas or any other kind of vegetable soup would have been a luxury but chicken and game soups what nonsense I then overhauled my own stores I found some fine old brandy and one bottle of champagne still left though it was evident in looking at the cloth bales that dishonesty had been at work and some person happened to suggest Asmani the head man sent by doctor Kirk in charge of Livingstone s goods as the guilty party Upon his treasures being examined I found eight or ten coloured cloths with the mark of my own agent at Zanzibar on them As he was unable to give a clear account of how they came in his box they were at once confiscated and distributed among the most deserving of the Doctor s people Some of the watchmen also accused him of having entered into my store room and of having abstracted two or three gorah of domestics from my bales and of having some days afterwards snatched the keys from the hands of one of my men and broken them lest other people might enter and find evidences of his guilt As Asmani was proved to be another of the moral idiots Livingstone discharged him on the spot Had we not arrived so soon at Unyanyembe it is probable that the entire stock sent from Zanzibar had in time disappeared Unyanyembe being rich in fruits grain and cattle we determined to have our Christmas dinner over again in style and being fortunately in pretty good health I was enabled to superintend its preparation Never was such prodigality seen in a tembe of Unyamwezi as was seen in ours nor were ever such delicacies provided There were but few Arabs in Unyanyembe when we arrived as they were investing the stronghold of Mirambo About a week after our return the little mannikin Sheikh Sayd bin Salim El Wali who was the commander in chief of their forces came to Kwihara from the front But the little Sheikh was in no great hurry to greet the man he had wronged so much As soon as we heard of his arrival we took the opportunity to send men immediately after the goods which were forwarded to the Wali s care soon after Livingstone s departure for Mikindany Bay The first time we sent men for them the governor declared himself too sick to attend to such matters but the second day they were surrendered with a request that the Doctor would not be very angry at their condition as the white ants had destroyed everything The stores this man had detained at Unyanyembe were in a most sorry state The expenses were prepaid for their carriage to Ujiji but the goods had been purposely detained at this place by Sayd bin Salim since eighteen sixty seven that he might satisfy his appetite for liquor and probably fall heir to two valuable guns that were known to be with them The white ants had not only eaten up bodily the box in which the guns were packed but they had also eaten the gunstocks The barrels were corroded and the locks were quite destroyed The brandy bottles most singular to relate had also fallen a prey to the voracious and irresistible destroyers the white ants and by some unaccountable means they had imbibed the potent Hennessy and replaced the corks with corn cobs The medicines had also vanished and the zinc pots in which they had been snugly packed up were destroyed by corrosion Two bottles of brandy and one small zinc case of medicines only were saved out of the otherwise utter wreck I also begged the Doctor to send to Sheikh Sayd and ask him if he had received the two letters despatched by him upon his first arrival at Ujiji for doctor Kirk and Lord Clarendon and if he had forwarded them to the coast as he was desired to do The reply to the messengers was in the affirmative and subsequently I obtained the same answer in the presence of the Doctor On the two hundred and twenty second of February the pouring rain which had dogged us the entire distance from Ujiji ceased and we had now beautiful weather and while I prepared for the homeward march the Doctor was busy writing his letters and entering his notes into his journal which I was to take to his family When not thus employed we paid visits to the Arabs at Tabora by whom we were both received with that bounteous hospitality for which they are celebrated Among the goods turned over by me to doctor Livingstone while assorting such cloths as I wished to retain for my homeward trip were Doti Yards First class American sheeting two hundred eighty five eleven forty Kaniki blue stuff sixteen sixty four Medium blue stuff sixty two hundred forty Dabwani cloth forty one sixty four Barsati cloths twenty eight one hundred twelve Printed handkerchiefs seventy two hundred eighty Medium Rehani cloth one hundred twenty seven five hundred eight Ismahili twenty eighty Sohari twenty eighty four pieces fine Kungura red check twenty two eighty eight four gorah Rehani eight thirty two Total number of cloths six hundred ninety seven twenty seven eighty eight Besides Cloth twenty seven eighty eight yards Assorted beads sixteen sacks weight nine hundred ninety two lbs Brass wire Nos five and six ten fraslilah three hundred fifty lbs one canvas tent waterproof one air bed one boat canvas one bag of tools carpenter s one rip saw two barrels of tar twelve sheets of ship s copper sixty lbs Clothes one Jocelyn breech loader metallic cartridge one Starr s one Henry sixteen shooter one revolver two hundred rounds revolver ammunition two thousand Jocelyn and Starrs ammunition fifteen hundred Henry rifle ammunition Cooking utensils medicine chest books sextant canvas bags c c c The above made a total of about forty loads Many things in the list would have brought fancy prices in Unyanyembe especially the carbines and ammunition the saw carpenter s tools the beads and wire Out of the thirty three loads which were stored for him in my tembe the stock sent to Livingstone Nov eleven thousand eight hundred seventy but few of them would be available for his return trip to Rua and Manyuema The six hundred ninety six doti of cloth which were left to him formed the only marketable articles of value he possessed and in Manyuema where the natives manufactured their own cloth such an article would be considered a drug while my beads and wire with economy would suffice to keep him and his men over two years in those regions His own cloth and what I gave him made in the aggregate thirteen ninety three doti which at two doti per day for food were sufficient to keep him and sixty men six hundred ninety six days He had thus four years supplies The only articles he lacked to make a new and completely fitted up expedition were the following a list of which he and I drew up A few tins of American wheat flour soda crackers preserved fruits A few tins of salmon ten lbs Hyson tea Some sewing thread and needles one dozen official envelopes Nautical Almanac for eighteen seventy two and eighteen seventy three one blank journal one chronometer stopped one chain for refractory people With the articles just named he would have a total of seventy loads but without carriers they were an incumbrance to him for with only the nine men which he now had he could go nowhere with such a splendid assortment of goods I was therefore commissioned to enlist as soon as I reached Zanzibar fifty freemen arm them with a gun and hatchet each man besides accoutrements and to purchase two thousand bullets one thousand flints and ten kegs of gunpowder The men were to act as carriers to follow wherever Livingstone might desire to go For without men he was simply tantalized with the aspirations roused in him by the knowledge that he had abundance of means which were irrealizable without carriers All the wealth of London and New York piled before him were totally unavailable to him without the means of locomotion No Mnyamwezi engages himself as carrier during war time You who have read the diary of my Life in Unyanyembe know what stubborn Conservatives the Wanyamwezi are A duty lay yet before me which I owed to my illustrious companion and that was to hurry to the coast as if on a matter of life and death act for him in the matter of enlisting men as if he were there himself to work for him with the same zeal as I would for myself not to halt or rest until his desires should be gratified And this I vowed to do but it was a death blow to my project of going down the Nile and getting news of Sir S Baker The Doctor s task of writing his letters was ended He delivered into my hand twenty letters for Great Britain six for Bombay two for New York and one for Zanzibar The two letters for New York were for James Gordon Bennett junior as he alone not his father was responsible for the Expedition sent under my command I beg the reader s pardon for republishing one of these letters here as its spirit and style indicate the man the mere knowledge of whose life or death was worth a costly Expedition Ujiji on Tanganika East Africa November eighteen seventy one James Gordon Bennett junior esquire My Dear Sir It is in general somewhat difficult to write to one we have never seen it feels so much like addressing an abstract idea but the presence of your representative mister H M Stanley in this distant region takes away the strangeness I should otherwise have felt and in writing to thank you for the extreme kindness that prompted you to send him I feel quite at home If I explain the forlorn condition in which he found me you will easily perceive that I have good reason to use very strong expressions of gratitude I came to Ujiji off a tramp of between four hundred and five hundred miles beneath a blazing vertical sun having been baffled worried defeated and forced to return when almost in sight of the end of the geographical part of my mission by a number of half caste Moslem slaves sent to me from Zanzibar instead of men The sore heart made still sorer by the woeful sights I had seen of man s inhumanity to man racked and told on the bodily frame and depressed it beyond measure I thought that I was dying on my feet It is not too much to say that almost every step of the weary sultry way was in pain and I reached Ujiji a mere ruckle of bones There I found that some five hundred pounds sterling worth of goods which I had ordered from Zanzibar had unaccountably been entrusted to a drunken half caste Moslem tailor who after squandering them for sixteen months on the way to Ujiji finished up by selling off all that remained for slaves and ivory for himself He had divined on the Koran and found that I was dead He had also written to the Governor of Unyanyembe that he had sent slaves after me to Manyuema who returned and reported my decease and begged permission to sell off the few goods that his drunken appetite had spared He however knew perfectly well from men who had seen me that I was alive and waiting for the goods and men but as for morality he is evidently an idiot and there being no law here except that of the dagger or musket I had to sit down in great weakness destitute of everything save a few barter cloths and beads which I had taken the precaution to leave here in case of extreme need The near prospect of beggary among Ujijians made me miserable I could not despair because I laughed so much at a friend who on reaching the mouth of the Zambezi said that he was tempted to despair on breaking the photograph of his wife We could have no success after that Afterward the idea of despair had to me such a strong smack of the ludicrous that it was out of the question Well when I had got to about the lowest verge vague rumors of an English visitor reached me I thought of myself as the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho but neither priest Levite nor Samaritan could possibly pass my way Yet the good Samaritan was close at hand and one of my people rushed up at the top of his speed and in great excitement gasped out An Englishman coming I see him and off he darted to meet him An American flag the first ever seen in these parts at the head of a caravan told me the nationality of the stranger I am as cold and non demonstrative as we islanders are usually reputed to be but your kindness made my frame thrill It was indeed overwhelming and I said in my soul Let the richest blessings descend from the Highest on you and yours The news mister Stanley had to tell was thrilling The mighty political changes on the Continent the success of the Atlantic cables the election of General Grant and many other topics riveted my attention for days together and had an immediate and beneficial effect on my health I had been without news from home for years save what I could glean from a few Saturday Reviews and Punch of eighteen sixty eight The appetite revived and in a week I began to feel strong again mister Stanley brought a most kind and encouraging despatch from Lord Clarendon whose loss I sincerely deplore the first I have received from the Foreign Office since eighteen sixty six and information that the British Government had kindly sent a thousand pounds sterling to my aid Up to his arrival I was not aware of any pecuniary aid I came unsalaried but this want is now happily repaired and I am anxious that you and all my friends should know that though uncheered by letter I have stuck to the task which my friend Sir Roderick Murchison set me with John Bullish tenacity believing that all would come right at last The watershed of South Central Africa is over seven hundred wiles in length The fountains thereon are almost innumerable that is it would take a man s lifetime to count them From the watershed they converge into four large rivers and these again into two mighty streams in the great Nile valley which begins in ten degrees to twelve degrees south latitude It was long ere light dawned on the ancient problem and gave me a clear idea of the drainage I had to feel my way and every step of the way and was generally groping in the dark for who cared where the rivers ran We drank our fill and let the rest run by The Portuguese who visited Cazembe asked for slaves and ivory and heard of nothing else I asked about the waters questioned and cross questioned until I was almost afraid of being set down as afflicted with hydrocephalus My last work in which I have been greatly hindered from want of suitable attendants was following the central line of drainage down through the country of the cannibals called Manyuema or shortly Manyema This line of drainage has four large lakes in it The fourth I was near when obliged to turn It is from one to three miles broad and never can be reached at any point or at any time of the year Two western drains the Lufira or Bartle Frere s River flow into it at Lake Kamolondo Then the great River Lomame flows through Lake Lincoln into it too and seems to form the western arm of the Nile on which Petherick traded Now I knew about six hundred miles of the watershed and unfortunately the seventh hundred is the most interesting of the whole for in it if I am not mistaken four fountains arise from an earthen mound and the last of the four becomes at no great distance off a large river Two of these run north to Egypt Lufira and Lomame and two run south into inner Ethiopia as the Leambaye or Upper Zambezi and the Kaful Are not these the sources of the Nile mentioned by the Secretary of Minerva in the city of Sais to Herodotus I have heard of them so often and at great distances off that I cannot doubt their existence and in spite of the sore longing for home that seizes me every time I think of my family I wish to finish up by their rediscovery Five hundred pounds sterling worth of goods have again unaccountably been entrusted to slaves and have been over a year on the way instead of four months I must go where they lie at your expense ere I can put the natural completion to my work And if my disclosures regarding the terrible Ujijian slavery should lead to the suppression of the East Coast slave trade I shall regard that as a greater matter by far than the discovery of all the Nile sources together Now that you have done with domestic slavery for ever lend us your powerful aid toward this great object This fine country is blighted as with a curse from above in order that the slavery privileges of the petty Sultan of Zanzibar may not be infringed and the rights of the Crown of Portugal which are mythical should be kept in abeyance till some future time when Africa will become another India to Portuguese slave traders I conclude by again thanking you most cordially for your great generosity and am Gratefully yours David Livingstone To the above letter I have nothing to add it speaks for itself but I then thought it was the best evidence of my success For my own part I cared not one jot or tittle about his discoveries except so far as it concerned the newspaper which commissioned me for the search It is true I felt curious as to the result of his travels but since he confessed that he had not completed what he had begun I felt considerable delicacy to ask for more than he could afford to give His discoveries were the fruits of of his own labours to him they belonged by their publication he hoped to obtain his reward which he desired to settle on his children Yet Livingstone had a higher and nobler ambition than the mere pecuniary sum he would receive he followed the dictates of duty Never was such a willing slave to that abstract virtue His inclinations impelled him home the fascinations of which it required the sternest resolves to resist With every foot of new ground he travelled over he forged a chain of sympathy which should hereafter bind the Christian nations in bonds of love and charity to the Heathen of the African tropics If he were able to complete this chain of love by actual discovery and description of them to embody such peoples and nations as still live in darkness so as to attract the good and charitable of his own land to bestir themselves for their redemption and salvation this Livingstone would consider an ample reward A delirious and fatuous enterprise a Quixotic scheme some will say Not it my friends for as sure as the sun shines on both Christian and Infidel civilised and Pagan the day of enlightenment will come and though Livingstone the Apostle of Africa may not behold it himself nor we younger men not yet our children the Hereafter will see it and posterity will recognise the daring pioneer of its civilization The following items are extracted in their entirety from my Diary March twelfth The Arabs have sent me as many as forty five letters to carry to the coast I am turned courier in my latter days but the reason is that no regularly organized caravans are permitted to leave Unyanyembe now because of the war with Mirambo What if I had stayed all this time at Unyanyembe waiting for the war to end It is my opinion that the Arabs will not be able to conquer Mirambo under nine months yet To night the natives have gathered themselves together to give me a farewell dance in front of my house I find them to be the pagazis of Singiri chief of Mtesa s caravan My men joined in and captivated by the music despite myself I also struck in and performed the light fantastic to the intense admiration of my braves who were delighted to see their master unbend a little from his usual stiffness It is a wild dance altogether The music is lively and evoked from the sonorous sound of four drums which are arranged before the bodies of four men who stand in the centre of the weird circle Bombay as ever comical never so much at home as when in the dance of the Mrima has my water bucket on his head Chowpereh the sturdy the nimble sure footed Chowpereh has an axe in his hand and wears a goatskin on his head Baraka has my bearskin and handles a spear Mabruki the Bull headed has entered into the spirit of the thing and steps up and down like a solemn elephant Ulimengo has a gun and is a fierce Drawcansir and you would imagine he was about to do battle to a hundred thousand so ferocious is he in appearance Khamisi and Kamna are before the drummers back to back kicking up ambitiously at the stars Asmani the embodiment of giant strength a towering Titan has also a gun with which he is dealing blows in the air as if he were Thor slaying myriads with his hammer The scruples and passions of us all are in abeyance we are contending demons under the heavenly light of the stars enacting only the part of a weird drama quickened into action and movement by the appalling energy and thunder of the drums The warlike music is ended and another is started The choragus has fallen on his knees and dips his head two or three times in an excavation in the ground and a choir also on their knees repeat in dolorous tones the last words of a slow and solemn refrain The words are literally translated Choragus Oh oh oh the white man is going home Choir Oh oh oh going home Going home oh oh oh Choragus To the happy island on the sea Where the beads are plenty oh oh oh Choir Oh oh oh where the beads are plenty Oh oh oh Choragus While Singiri has kept us oh very long From our homes very long oh oh oh Choir From our homes oh oh oh Oh oh oh Choragus And we have had no food for very long We are half starved oh for so long Bana Singiri Choir For so very long oh oh oh Bana Singiri Singiri Singiri oh Singiri Choragus Mirambo has gone to war To fight against the Arabs The Arabs and Wangwana Have gone to fight Mirambo Choir Oh oh oh to fight Mirambo Oh Mirambo Mirambo Oh to fight Mirambo Choragus But the white man will make us glad He is going home For he is going home And he will make us glad Sh sh sh Choir The white man will make us glad Sh sh sh Sh sh h h sh h h h h h Um m mu um m m sh This is the singular farewell which I received from the Wanyamwezi of Singiri and for its remarkable epic beauty rhythmic excellence and impassioned force I have immortalised it in the pages of this book as one of the most wonderful productions of the chorus loving children of Unyamwezi March thirteenth The last day of my stay with Livingstone has come and gone and the last night we shall be together is present and I cannot evade the morrow I feel as though I would rebel against the fate which drives me away from him The minutes beat fast and grow into hours Our door is closed and we are both of us busy with our own thoughts What his thoughts are I know not Mine are sad My days seem to have been spent in an Elysian field otherwise why should I so keenly regret the near approach of the parting hour Have I not been battered by successive fevers prostrate with agony day after day lately Have I not raved and stormed in madness Have I not clenched my fists in fury and fought with the wild strength of despair when in delirium Yet I regret to surrender the pleasure I have felt in this man s society though so dearly purchased I cannot resist the sure advance of time which flies this night as if it mocked me and gloated on the misery it created Be it so How many times have I not suffered the pang of parting with friends I wished to linger longer but the inevitable would come Fate sundered us This is the same regretful feeling only it is more poignant and the farewell may be forever FOREVER And FOR EVER echo the reverberations of a woful whisper I have noted down all he has said to night but the reader shall not share it with me It is mine I am as jealous as he is himself of his Journal and I have written in German text and in round hand on either side of it on the waterproof canvas cover POSITTVELY NOT TO BE OPENED to which he has affixed his signature I have stenographed every word he has said to me respecting the equable distribution of certain curiosities among his friends and children and his last wish about his dear old friend Sir Roderick Murchison because he has been getting anxious about him ever since we received the newspapers at Ugunda when we read that the old man was suffering from a paralytic stroke I must be sure to send him the news as soon as I get to Aden and I have promised that he will receive the message from me quicker than anything was ever received in Central Africa To morrow night Doctor you will be alone Yes the house will look as though a death had taken place You had better stop until the rains which are now near are over I would to God I could my dear Doctor but every day I stop here now that there is no necessity for me to stay longer keeps you from your work and home I know but consider your health you are not fit to travel What is it Only a few weeks longer You will travel to the coast just as quickly when the rains are over as you will by going now The plains will be inundated between here and the coast You think so but I will reach the coast in forty days if not in forty I will in fifty certain The thought that I am doing you an important service will spur me on March fourteenth At dawn we were up the bales and baggage were taken outside of the building and the men prepared themselves for the first march towards home We had a sad breakfast together I could not eat my heart was too full neither did my companion seem to have an appetite We found something to do which kept us longer together At eight o clock I was not gone and I had thought to have been off at five A M Doctor said I I will leave two men with you who will stop to day and to morrow with you for it may be that you have forgotten something in the hurry of my departure I will halt a day at Tura on the frontier of Unyamwezi for your last word and your last wish and now we must part there is no help for it Good bye Oh I am coming with you a little way I must see you off on the road Thank you Now my men Home Kirangozi lift the flag and MARCH The house looked desolate it faded from our view Old times and the memories of my aspirations and kindling hopes came strong on me The old hills round about that I once thought tame and uninteresting had become invested with histories and reminiscences for me On that burzani I have sat hour after hour dreaming and hoping and sighing On that colonel I stood watching the battle and the destruction of Tabora Under that roof I have sickened and been delirious and cried out like a child at the fate that threatened my mission Under that banian tree lay my dead comrade poor Shaw I would have given a fortune to have had him by my side at this time From that house I started on my journey to Ujiji to it I returned as to a friend with a newer and dearer companion and now I leave all Already it all appears like a strange dream We walked side by side the men lifted their voices into a song I took long looks at Livingstone to impress his features thoroughly on my memory The thing is Doctor so far as I can understand it you do not intend to return home until you have satisfied yourself about the Sources of the Nile When you have satisfied yourself you will come home and satisfy others Is it not so That is it exactly When your men come back I shall immediately start for Ufipa then crossing the Rungwa River I shall strike south and round the extremity of the Tanganika Then a south east course will take me to Chicumbi s on the Luapula On crossing the Luapula I shall go direct west to the copper mines of Katanga Eight days south of Katanga the natives declare the fountains to be When I have found them I shall return by Katanga to the underground houses of Rua From the caverns ten days north east will take me to Lake Kamolondo I shall be able to travel from the lake in your boat up the River Lufira to Lake Lincoln Then coming down again I can proceed north by the Lualaba to the fourth lake which I think will explain the whole problem and I will probably find that it is either Chowambe Baker s lake or Piaggia s lake And how long do you think this little journey will take you A year and a half at the furthest from the day I leave Unyanyembe Suppose you say two years contingencies might arise you know It will be well for me to hire these new men for two years the day of their engagement to begin from their arrival at Unyanyembe Yes that will do excellently well Now my dear Doctor the best friends must part You have come far enough let me beg of you to turn back Well I will say this to you you have done what few men could do far better than some great travellers I know And I am grateful to you for what you have done for me God guide you safe home and bless you my friend And may God bring you safe back to us all my dear friend Farewell Farewell We wrung each other s hands and I had to tear myself away before I unmanned myself but Susi and Chumah and Hamoydah the Doctor s faithful fellows they must all shake and kiss my hands before I could quite turn away I betrayed myself Good bye Doctor dear friend Good bye The FAREWELL between Livingstone and myself had been spoken We were parted he to whatever fate Destiny had yet in store for him to battling against difficulties to many many days of marching through wildernesses with little or nothing much to sustain him save his own high spirit and enduring faith in God who would bring all things right at last and I to that which Destiny may have in store for me But though I may live half a century longer I shall never forget that parting scene in Central Africa I shall never cease to think of the sad tones of that sorrowful word Farewell how they permeated through every core of my heart how they clouded my eyes and made me wish unutterable things which could never be An audacious desire to steal one embrace from the dear old man came over me and almost unmanned me I felt tempted to stop with him and assist him on his long return march to the fountain region but these things were not to be any more than many other impulsive wishes and despite the intensified emotions which filled both of us save by silent tears and a tremulous parting word we did not betray our stoicism of manhood and race I assumed a gruff voice and ordered the Expedition to march and I resolutely turned my face toward the eastern sky But ever and anon my eyes would seek that deserted figure of an old man in grey clothes who with bended head and slow steps was returning to his solitude the very picture of melancholy and each time I saw him as the plain was wide and clear of obstructions I felt my eyes stream and my heart swell with a vague indefinable feeling of foreboding and sorrow I thought of his lonely figure sitting day after day on the burzani of his house by which all caravans from the coast would have to pass and of the many many times he would ask the new comers whether they had passed any men coming along the road for him and I thought as each day passed and his stores and letters had not arrived how he would grieve at the lengthening delay I then felt strong again as I felt that so long as I should be doing service for Livingstone I was not quite parted from him and by doing the work effectively and speedily the bond of friendship between us would be strengthened Such thoughts spurred me to the resolution to march so quickly for the coast that Arabs in after time should marvel at the speed with which the white man s caravan travelled from Unyanyembe to Zanzibar I took one more look at him he was standing near the gate of Kwikuru with his servants near him I waved a handkerchief to him as a final token of farewell and he responded to it by lifting his cap It was the last opportunity for we soon surmounted the crest of a land wave and began the descent into the depression on the other side and I NEVER saw him more God grant dear reader that if ever you take to travelling in Central Africa you find as good and true a man for your companion as I found in noble David Livingstone For four months and four days he and I occupied the same house or the same tent and I never had one feeling of resentment against him nor did he show any against me and the longer I lived with him the more did my admiration and reverence for him increase What were Livingstone s thoughts during the time which elapsed between my departure for the coast and the arrival of his supplies may be gathered from a letter which he wrote on the second of July to mister John F Webb American Consul at Zanzibar I have been waiting up here like Simeon Stylites on his pillar and counting every day and conjecturing each step taken by our friend towards the coast wishing and praying that no sickness might lay him up no accident befall him and no unlooked for combinations of circumstances render his kind intentions vain or fruitless mister Stanley had got over the tendency to the continued form of fever which is the most dangerous and was troubled only with the intermittent form which is comparatively safe or I would not have allowed him but would have accompanied him to Zanzibar I did not tell himself so nor did I say what I thought that he really did a very plucky thing in going through the Mirambo war in spite of the remonstrances of all the Arabs and from Ujiji guiding me back to Unyanyembe The war as it is called is still going on The danger lay not so much in the actual fighting as in the universal lawlessness the war engendered I am not going to inflict on the reader a repetition of our march back except to record certain incidents which occurred to us as we journeyed to the coast March seventeenth We came to the Kwalah River The first rain of the Masika season fell on this day I shall be mildewed before I reach the coast Last year s Masika began at Bagamoyo March twenty third and ended thirtieth April The next day I halted the Expedition at Western Tura on the Unyamwezi frontier and on the twentieth arrived at Eastern Tura when soon after we heard a loud report of a gun and Susi and Hamoydah the Doctor s servants with Uredi and another of my men appeared with a letter for Sir Thomas MacLear Observatory Cape of Good Hope and one for myself which read as follows Kwihara March fifteen eighteen seventy two Dear Stanley If you can telegraph on your arrival in London be particular please to say how Sir Roderick is You put the matter exactly yesterday when you said that I was not yet satisfied about the Sources but as soon as I shall be satisfied I shall return and give satisfactory reasons fit for other people This is just as it stands I wish I could give you a better word than the Scotch one to put a stout heart to a stey brae a steep ascent for you will do that and I am thankful that before going away the fever had changed into the intermittent or safe form I would not have let you go but with great concern had you still been troubled with the continued type I feel comfortable in commending you to the guardianship of the good Lord and Father of all I am gratefully yours David Livingstone I have worked as hard as I could copying observations made in one line of march from Kabuire back again to Cazembe and on to Lake Baugweolo and am quite tired out My large figures fill six sheets of foolscap and many a day will elapse ere I take to copying again I did my duty when ill at Ujiji in eighteen sixty nine and am not to blame though they grope a little in the dark at home Some Arab letters have come and I forward them to you D L March sixteen eighteen seventy two P S I have written a note this morning to mister Murray fifty Albemarle Street the publisher to help you if necessary in sending the Journal by book post or otherwise to Agnes If you call on him you will find him a frank gentleman A pleasant journey to you David Livingstone To Henry M Stanley esquire Wherever he may be found Several Wangwana arrived at Tura to join our returning Expedition as they were afraid to pass through Ugogo by themselves others were reported coming but as all were sufficiently warned at Unyanyembe that the departure of the caravan would take place positively on the fourteenth I was not disposed to wait longer As we were leaving Tura on the twenty first Susi and Hamoydah were sent back to the Doctor with last words from me while we continued our march to Nghwhalah River Two days afterwards we arrived before the village of Ngaraisa into which the head of the caravan attempted to enter but the angry Wakimbu forcibly ejected them On the twenty fourth we encamped in the jungle in what is called the tongoni or clearing This region was at one period in a most flourishing state the soil is exceedingly fertile the timber is large and would be valuable near the coast and what is highly appreciated in Africa there is an abundance of water We camped near a smooth broad hump of syenite at one end of which rose upright and grand a massive square rock which towered above several small trees in the vicinity at the other end stood up another singular rock which was loosened at the base The members of the Expedition made use of the great sheet of rock to grind their grain a common proceeding in these lands where villages are not near or when the people are hostile On the twenty seventh of March we entered Kiwyeh At dawn when leaving Mdaburu River the solemn warning had been given that we were about entering Ugogo and as we left Kaniyaga village with trumpet like blasts of the guide s horn we filed into the depths of an expanse of rustling Indian corn The ears were ripe enough for parching and roasting and thus was one anxiety dispelled by its appearance for generally in early March caravans suffer from famine which overtakes both natives and strangers We soon entered the gum tree districts and we knew we were in Ugogo The forests of this country are chiefly composed of the gum and thorn species mimosa and tamarisk with often a variety of wild fruit trees The grapes were plentiful though they were not quite ripe and there was also a round reddish fruit with the sweetness of the Sultana grape with leaves like a gooseberry bush There was another about the size of an apricot which was excessively bitter Emerging from the entangled thorn jungle the extensive settlements of Kiwyeh came into view and to the east of the chief s village we found a camping place under the shade of a group of colossal baobab We had barely encamped when we heard the booming bellowing war horns sounding everywhere and we espied messengers darting swiftly in every direction giving the alarm of war When first informed that the horns were calling the people to arm themselves and prepare for war I half suspected that an attack was about to be made on the Expedition but the words Urugu warugu thief thieves bandied about declared the cause Mukondoku the chief of the populous district two days to the north east where we experienced some excitement when westward bound was marching to attack the young Mtemi Kiwyeh and Kiwyeh s soldiers were called to the fight The men rushed to their villages and in a short time we saw them arrayed in full fighting costume Feathers of the ostrich and the eagle waved over their fronts or the mane of the zebra surrounded their heads their knees and ankles were hung with little bells joho robes floated behind from their necks spears assegais knob sticks and bows were flourished over their heads or held in their right hands as if ready for hurling On each flank of a large body which issued from the principal village and which came at a uniform swinging double quick the ankle and knee bells all chiming in admirable unison were a cloud of skirmishers consisting of the most enthusiastic who exercised themselves in mimic war as they sped along Column after column companies and groups from every village hurried on past our camp until probably there were nearly a thousand soldiers gone to the war This scene gave me a better idea than anything else of the weakness of even the largest caravans which travelled between Zanzibar and Unyanyembe At night the warriors returned from the forest the alarm proved to be without foundation At first it was generally reported that the invaders were Wahehe or the Wadirigo as that tribe are scornfully called from their thieving propensities The Wahehe frequently make a foray upon the fat cattle of Ugogo They travel from their own country in the south east and advance through the jungle and when about to approach the herds stoop down covering their bodies with their shields of bull hide Having arrived between the cattle and the herdsmen they suddenly rise up and begin to switch the cattle heartily and having started them off into the jungle in the care of men already detailed for the work they turn about and plant their shields before them to fight the aroused shepherds On the thirtieth we arrived at Khonze which is remarkable for the mighty globes of foliage which the giant sycamores and baobabs put forth above the plain The chief of Khonze boasts of four tembes out of which he could muster in the aggregate fifty armed men yet this fellow instigated by the Wanyamwezi residents prepared to resist our advance because I only sent him three doti twelve yards of cloth as honga We were halted waiting the return of a few friendly Wagogo travellers who had joined us and who were asked to assist Bombay in the negotiation of the tribute when the Wagogo returned to us at breathless speed and shouted out to me Why do you halt here Do you wish to die These pagans will not take the tribute but they boast that they will eat up all your cloth The renegade Wanyamwezi who had married into Wagogo families were always our bane in this country As the chief of Khonze came up I ordered the men to load their guns and I loaded my own ostentatiously in his presence and then strode up to him and asked if he had come to take the cloth by force or if he were going to accept quietly what I would give him As the Mnyamwezi who caused this show of hostilities was beginning to speak I caught him by the throat and threatened to make his nose flatter if he attempted to speak again in my presence and to shoot him first if we should be forced to fight The rascal was then pushed away into the rear The chief who was highly amused with this proceeding laughed loudly at the discomfiture of the parasite and in a short time he and I had settled the tribute to our mutual satisfaction and we parted great friends The Expedition arrived at Sanza that night On the thirty first we came to Kanyenyi to the great Mtemi Magomba s whose son and heir is Mtundu M gondeh As we passed by the tembe of the great Sultan the msagira or chief counsellor a pleasant grey haired man was at work making a thorn fence around a patch of young corn He greeted the caravan with a sonorous Yambo and putting himself at its head he led the way to our camp When introduced to me he was very cordial in his manner He was offered a kiti stool and began to talk very affably He remembered my predecessors Burton Speke and Grant very well declared me to be much younger than any of them and recollecting that one of the white men used to drink asses milk Burton offered to procure me some The way I drank it seemed to give him very great satisfaction His son Unamapokera was a tall man of thirty or thereabouts and he conceived a great friendship for me and promised that the tribute should be very light and that he would send a man to show me the way to Myumi which was a village on the frontier of Kanyenyi by which I would be enabled to avoid the rapacious Kisewah who was in the habit of enforcing large tribute from caravans With the aid of Unamapokera and his father we contrived to be mulcted very lightly for we only paid ten doti while Burton was compelled to pay sixty doti or two hundred and forty yards of cloth On the first of April rising early we reached Myumi after a four hours march then plunged into the jungle and about two P M arrived at a large ziwa or pond situate in the middle of a jungle and on the next day at ten A M reached the fields of Mapanga We were passing the village of Mapanga to a resting place beyond the village where we might breakfast and settle the honga when a lad rushed forward to meet us and asked us where we were going Having received a reply that we were going to a camping place he hastened on ahead and presently we heard him talking to some men in a field on our right In the meantime we had found a comfortable shady place and had come to a halt the men were reclining on the ground or standing up near their respective loads Bombay was about opening a bale when we heard a great rush of men and loud shouts and immediately after out rushed from the jungle near by a body of forty or fifty armed men who held their spears above their heads or were about to draw their bows with a chief at their head all uttering such howls of rage as only savages can which sounded like a long drawn Hhaat uh Hhaat uhh uhh which meant unmistakably You will will you No you will not at once determined defiant and menacing I had suspected that the voices I heard boded no good to us and I had accordingly prepared my weapons and cartridges Verily what a fine chance for adventure this was One spear flung at us or one shot fired into this minatory mob of savages and the opposing bands had been plunged into a fatal conflict There would have been no order of battle no pomp of war but a murderous strife a quick firing of breech loaders and volleys from flint lock muskets mixed with the flying of spears and twanging of bows the cowardly running away at once pursued by yelping savages and who knows how it all would have terminated Forty spears against forty guns but how many guns would not have decamped Perhaps all and I should have been left with my boy gunbearers to have my jugular deliberately severed or to be decapitated leaving my head to adorn a tall pole in the centre of a Kigogo village like poor Monsieur Maizan s at Dege la Mhora in Uzaramo Happy end of an Expedition And the Doctor s Journal lost for ever the fruits of six years labor But in this land it will not do to fight unless driven to the very last extremity No belligerent Mungo Park can be successful in Ugogo unless he has a sufficient force of men with him With five hundred Europeans one could traverse Africa from north to south by tact and the moral effect that such a force would inspire Very little fighting would be required Without rising from the bale on which I was seated I requested the kirangozi to demand an explanation of their furious hubbub and threatening aspect if they were come to rob us No said the chief we do not want to stop the road or to rob you but we want the tribute But don t you see us halted and the bale opened to send it to you We have come so far from your village that after the tribute is settled we can proceed on our way as the day is yet young The chief burst into a loud laugh and was joined by ourselves He evidently felt ashamed of his conduct for he voluntarily offered the explanation that as he and his men were cutting wood to make a new fence for his village a lad came up to him and said that a caravan of Wangwana were about passing through the country without stopping to explain who they were We were soon very good friends He begged of me to make rain for him as his crops were suffering and no rain had fallen for months I told him that though white people were very great and clever people much superior to the Arabs yet we could not make rain Though very much disappointed he did not doubt my statement and after receiving his honga which was very light he permitted us to go on our way and even accompanied us some distance to show us the road At three P M we entered a thorny jungle and by five P M we had arrived at Muhalata a district lorded over by the chief Nyamzaga A Mgogo of whom I made a friend proved very staunch He belonged to Mulowa a country to the S S E and south of Kulabi and was active in promoting my interests by settling the tribute with the assistance of Bombay for me When on the next day we passed through Kulabi on our way to Mvumi and the Wagogo were about to stop us for the honga he took upon himself the task of relieving us from further toll by stating we were from Ugogo or Kanyenyi The chief simply nodded his head and we passed on It seems that the Wagogo do not exact blackmail of those caravans who intend only to trade in their own country or have no intention of passing beyond their own frontier Leaving Kulabi we traversed a naked red loamy plain over which the wind from the heights of Usagara now rising a bluish black jumble of mountains in our front howled most fearfully With clear keen incisive force the terrible blasts seemed to penetrate through an through our bodies as though we were but filmy gauze Manfully battling against this mighty peppo storm we passed through Mukamwa s and crossing a broad sandy bed of a stream we entered the territory of Mvumi the last tribute levying chief of Ugogo The fourth of April after sending Bombay and my friendly Mgogo with eight doti or thirty two yards of cloth as a farewell tribute to the Sultan we struck off through the jungle and in five hours we were on the borders of the wilderness of Marenga Mkali the hard bitter or brackish water From our camp I despatched three men to Zanzibar with letters to the American Consul and telegraphic despatches for the Herald with a request to the Consul that he would send the men back with a small case or two containing such luxuries as hungry worn out and mildewed men would appreciate The three messengers were charged not to halt for anything rain or no rain river or inundation as if they did not hurry up we should catch them before they reached the coast With a fervent Inshallah bana they departed On the fifth with a loud vigorous cheery Hurrah we plunged into the depths of the wilderness which with its eternal silence and solitude was far preferable to the jarring inharmonious discord of the villages of the Wagogo For nine hours we held on our way starting with noisy shouts the fierce rhinoceros the timid quagga and the herds of antelopes which crowd the jungles of this broad salina On the seventh amid a pelting rain we entered Mpwapwa where my Scotch assistant Farquhar died We had performed the extraordinary march of three hundred thirty eight English statute miles from the fourteenth of March to the seventh of April or within twenty four days inclusive of halts which was a little over fourteen miles a day Leukole the chief of Mpwapwa with whom I left Farquhar gave the following account of the death of the latter The white man seemed to be improving after you left him until the fifth day when while attempting to rise and walk out of his tent he fell back from that minute he got worse and worse and in the afternoon he died like one going to sleep His legs and abdomen had swollen considerably and something I think broke within him when he fell for he cried out like a man who was very much hurt and his servant said The master says he is dying We had him carried out under a large tree and after covering him with leaves there left him His servant took possession of his things his rifle clothes and blanket and moved off to the tembe of a Mnyamwezi near Kisokweh where he lived for three months when he also died Before he died he sold his master s rifle to an Arab going to Unyanyembe for ten doti forty yards of cloth That is all I know about it He subsequently showed me the hollow into which the dead body of Farquhar was thrown but I could not find a vestige of his bones though we looked sharply about that we might make a decent grave for them Before we left Unyanyembe fifty men were employed two days carrying rocks with which I built up a solid enduring pile around Shaw s grave eight feet long and five feet broad which doctor Livingstone said would last hundreds of years as the grave of the first white man who died in Unyamwezi But though we could not discover any remains of the unfortunate Farquhar we collected a large quantity of stones and managed to raise a mound near the banks of the stream to commemorate the spot where his body was laid It was not until we had entered the valley of the Mukondokwa River that we experienced anything like privation or hardship from the Masika Here the torrents thundered and roared the river was a mighty brown flood sweeping downward with an almost resistless flow The banks were brimful and broad nullahs were full of water and the fields were inundated and still the rain came surging down in a shower that warned us of what we might expect during our transit of the sea coast region Still we urged our steps onward like men to whom every moment was precious as if a deluge was overtaking us Three times we crossed this awful flood at the fords by means of ropes tied to trees from bank to bank and arrived at Kadetamare on the eleventh a most miserable most woe begone set of human beings and camped on a hill opposite Mount Kibwe which rose on the right of the river one of the tallest peaks of the range On the twelfth of April after six hours of the weariest march I had ever undergone we arrived at the mouth of the Mukondokwa Pass out of which the river debouches into the Plain of Makata We knew that it was an unusual season for the condition of the country though bad enough the year before was as nothing compared to this year Close to the edge of the foaming angry flood lay our route dipping down frequently into deep ditches wherein we found ourselves sometimes up to the waist in water and sometimes up to the throat Urgent necessity impelled us onward lest we might have to camp at one of these villages until the end of the monsoon rains so we kept on over marshy bottoms up to the knees in mire under jungly tunnels dripping with wet then into sloughs arm pit deep Every channel seemed filled to overflowing yet down the rain poured beating the surface of the river into yellowish foam pelting us until we were almost breathless Half a day s battling against such difficulties brought us after crossing the river once again to the dismal village of Mvumi We passed the night fighting swarms of black and voracious mosquitoes and in heroic endeavours to win repose in sleep in which we were partly successful owing to the utter weariness of our bodies On the thirteenth we struck out of the village of Mvumi It had rained the whole night and the morning brought no cessation Mile after mile we traversed over fields covered by the inundation until we came to a branch river side once again where the river was narrow and too deep to ford in the middle We proceeded to cut a tree down and so contrived that it should fall right across the stream Over this fallen tree the men bestriding it cautiously moved before them their bales and boxes but one young fellow Rojab through over zeal or in sheer madness took up the Doctor s box which contained his letters and Journal of his discoveries on his head and started into the river I had been the first to arrive on the opposite bank in order to superintend the crossing when I caught sight of this man walking in the river with the most precious box of all on his head Suddenly he fell into a deep hole and the man and box went almost out of sight while I was in an agony at the fate which threatened the despatches Fortunately he recovered himself and stood up while I shouted to him with a loaded revolver pointed at his head Look out Drop that bog and I ll shoot you All the men halted in their work while they gazed at their comrade who was thus imperilled by bullet and flood The man himself seemed to regard the pistol with the greatest awe and after a few desperate efforts succeeded in getting the box safely ashore As the articles within were not damaged Rojab escaped punishment with a caution not to touch the bog again on any account and it was transferred to the keeping of the sure footed and perfect pagazi Maganga From this stream in about an hour we came to the main river but one look at its wild waters was enough We worked hard to construct a raft but after cutting down four trees and lashing the green logs together and pushing them into the whirling current we saw them sink like lead We then tied together all the strong rope in our possession and made a line one hundred eighty feet long with one end of which tied round his body Chowpereh was sent across to lash it to a tree He was carried far down the stream but being an excellent swimmer he succeeded in his attempt The bales were lashed around the middle and heaved into the stream were dragged through the river to the opposite bank as well as the tent and such things as could not be injured much by the water Several of the men as well as myself were also dragged through the water each of the boys being attended by the best swimmers but when we came to the letter boxes and valuables we could suggest no means to take them over Two camps were accordingly made one on each side of the stream the one on the bank which I had just left occupying an ant hill of considerable height while my party had to content itself with a flat miry marsh An embankment of soil nearly a foot high was thrown up in a circle thirty feet in diameter in the centre of which my tent was pitched and around it booths were erected It was an extraordinary and novel position that we found ourselves in Within twenty feet of our camp was a rising river with flat low banks above us was a gloomy weeping sky surrounding us on three sides was an immense forest on whose branches we heard the constant pattering rain beneath our feet was a great depth of mud black and loathsome add to these the thought that the river might overflow and sweep us to utter destruction In the morning the river was still rising and an inevitable doom seemed to hang over us There was yet time to act to bring over the people with the most valuable effects of the Expedition as I considered doctor Livingstone s Journal and letters and my own papers of far greater value than anything else While looking at the awful river an idea struck me that I might possibly carry the boxes across one at a time by cutting two slender poles and tying cross sticks to them making a kind of hand barrow on which a box might rest when lashed to it Two men swimming across at the same time holding on to the rope with the ends of the poles resting on the men s shoulders I thought would be enabled to convey over a seventy lb box with ease In a short time one of these was made and six couples of the strongest swimmers were prepared and stimulated with a rousing glass of stiff grog each man with a promise of cloth to each also if they succeeded in getting everything ashore undamaged by the water When I saw with what ease they dragged themselves across the barrow on their shoulders I wondered that I had not thought of the plan before Within an hour of the first couple had gone over the entire Expedition was safe on the eastern bank and at once breaking camp we marched north through the swampy forest which in some places was covered with four feet of water Seven hours constant splashing brought us to Rehenneko after experiencing several queer accidents We were now on the verge only of the inundated plain of the Makata which even with the last year s rain was too horrible to think of undertaking again in cold blood We were encamped ten days on a hill near Rehenneko or until the twenty fifth when the rain having entirely ceased we resolved to attempt the crossing of the Makata The bales of cloth had all been distributed as presents to the men for their work except a small quantity which I retained for the food of my own mess But we should have waited a month longer for the inundation had not abated four inches However after we once struggled up to our necks in water it was use less to turn back For two marches of eight hours each we plunged through slush mire deep sloughs water up to our necks and muddy cataclysms swam across nullahs waded across gullies and near sunset of the second day arrived on the banks of the Makata River My people are not likely to forget that night not one of them was able to sleep until it was long past midnight because of the clouds of mosquitoes which threatened to eat us all up and when the horn sounded for the march of another day there was not one dissentient amongst them It was five A M when we began the crossing of the Makata River but beyond it for six miles stretched one long lake the waters of which flowed gently towards the Wami This was the confluence of the streams four rivers were here gathered into one The natives of Kigongo warned us not to attempt it as the water was over our heads but I had only to give a hint to the men and we set on our way Even the water we were getting quite amphibious was better than the horrible filth and piles of decaying vegetation which were swept against the boma of the village We were soon up to our armpits then the water shallowed to the knee then we stepped up to the neck and waded on tiptoe supporting the children above the water and the same experiences occurred as those which we suffered the day before until we were halted on the edge of the Little Makata which raced along at the rate of eight knots an hour but it was only fifty yards wide and beyond it rose a high bank and dry park lands which extended as far as Simbo We had no other option than to swim it but it was a slow operation the current was so swift and strong Activity and zeal high rewards presents of money backed by the lively feeling that we were nearing home worked wonders and in a couple of hours we were beyond the Makata Cheery and hopeful we sped along the dry smooth path that now lay before us with the ardor and vivacity of heroes and the ease and power of veterans We rolled three ordinary marches into one that day and long before night arrived at Simbo On the twenty ninth we crossed the Ungerengeri and as we came to Simbamwenni the Lion City of Useguhha lo what a change The flooded river had swept the entire front wall of the strongly walled city away and about fifty houses had been destroyed by the torrent Villages of Waruguru on the slopes of the Uruguru Mountains Mkambaku range had also suffered disastrously If one fourth of the reports we heard were true at least a hundred people must have perished The Sultana had fled and the stronghold of Kimbengo was no more A deep canal that he had caused to be excavated when alive to bring a branch of the Ungerengeri near his city which was his glory and boast proved the ruin of Simbamwenni After the destruction of the place the river had formed a new bed about three hundred yards from the city But what astonished us most were the masses of debris which seemed to be piled everywhere and the great numbers of trees that were prostrate and they all seemed to lie in the same direction as if a strong wind had come from the south west The aspect of the Ungerengeri valley was completely changed from a Paradise it was converted into a howling waste We continued our march until we reached Ulagalla and it was evident as we advanced that an unusual storm had passed over the land for the trees in some places seemed to lie in swathes A most fatiguing and long march brought us to Mussoudi on the eastern bank of the Ungerengeri but long before we reached it we realized that a terrific destruction of human life and property had occurred The extent and nature of the calamity may be imagined when I state that nearly ONE HUNDRED VILLAGES according to Mussoudi s report were swept away Mussoudi the Diwan says that the inhabitants had gone to rest as usual as they had done ever since he had settled in the valley twenty five years ago when in the middle of the night they heard a roar like many thunders which woke them up to the fact that death was at work in the shape of an enormous volume of water that like a wall came down tearing the tallest trees with it carrying away scores of villages at one fell sure swoop into utter destruction The scene six days after the event when the river has subsided into its normal breadth and depth during the monsoons is simply awful Wherever we look we find something very suggestive of the devastation that has visited the country fields of corn are covered with many feet of sand and debris the sandy bed the river has deserted is about a mile wide and there are but three villages standing of all that I noticed when en route to Unyanyembe When I asked Mussoudi where the people had gone to he replied God has taken most of them but some have gone to Udoe The surest blow ever struck at the tribe of the Wakami was indeed given by the hand of God and to use the words of the Diwan God s power is wonderful and who can resist Him I again resort to my Diary and extract the following April thirtieth Passing Msuwa we travelled hurriedly through the jungle which saw such hard work with us when going to Unyanyembe What dreadful odors and indescribable loathing this jungle produces It is so dense that a tiger could not crawl through it it is so impenetrable that an elephant could not force his way Were a bottleful of concentrated miasma such as we inhale herein collected what a deadly poison instantaneous in its action undiscoverable in its properties would it be I think it would act quicker than chloroform be as fatal as prussic acid Horrors upon horrors are in it Boas above our heads snakes and scorpions under our feet Land crabs terrapins and iguanas move about in our vicinity Malaria is in the air we breathe the road is infested with hotwater ants which bite our legs until we dance and squirm about like madmen Yet somehow we are fortunate enough to escape annihilation and many another traveller might also Yet here in verity are the ten plagues of Egypt through which a traveller in these regions must run the gauntlet one Plague of boas seven Suffocation from the two Red ants or hot water density of the jungle three Scorpions eight Stench four Thorns and spear cacti nine Thorns in the road five Numerous impediments ten Miasma six Black mud knee deep May first Kingaru Hera We heard news of a great storm having raged at Zanzibar which has destroyed every house and every ship so the story runs and the same destruction has visited Bagamoyo and Whinde they say But I am by this time pretty well acquainted with the exaggerative tendency of the African It is possible that serious loss has been sustained from the evidences of the effects of the storm in the interior I hear also that there are white men at Bagamoyo who are about starting into the country to look after me Who would look after me I cannot imagine I think they must have some confused idea of my Expedition though how they came to know that I was looking for any man I cannot conceive because I never told a soul until I reached Unyanyembe May second Rosako I had barely arrived at the village before the three men I despatched from Mvumi Ugogo entered bringing with them from the generous American Consul a few bottles of champagne a few pots of jam and two boxes of Boston crackers These were most welcome after my terrible experiences in the Makata Valley Inside one of these boxes carefully put up by the Consul were four numbers of the Herald one of which contained my correspondence from Unyanyembe wherein were some curious typographical errors especially in figures and African names I suppose my writing was wretched owing to my weakness In another are several extracts from various newspapers in which I learn that many editors regard the Expedition into Africa as a myth Alas it has been a terrible earnest fact with me nothing but hard conscientious work privation sickness and almost death Eighteen men have paid the forfeit of their lives in the undertaking It certainly is not a myth the death of my two white assistants they poor fellows found their fate in the inhospitable regions of the interior One of my letters received from Zanzibar by my messengers states that there is an expedition at Bagamoyo called the Livingstone Search and Relief Expedition What will the leaders of it do now Livingstone is found and relieved already Livingstone says he requires nothing more It is a misfortune that they did not start earlier then they might with propriety proceed and be welcomed May fourth Arrived at Kingwere s Ferry but we were unable to attract the attention of the canoe paddler Between our camp and Bagamoyo we have an inundated plain that is at least four miles broad The ferrying of our Expedition across this broad watery waste will occupy considerable time May fifth Kingwere the canoe proprietor came about eleven A M from his village at Gongoni beyond the watery plain By his movements I am fain to believe him to be a descendant of some dusky King Log for I have never seen in all this land the attributes and peculiarities of that royal personage so faithfully illustrated as in Kingwere He brought two canoes with him short cranky things in which only twelve of us could embark at a time It was three o clock in the afternoon before we arrived at Gongoni village May sixth After impressing Kingwere with the urgent necessity of quick action on his part with a promise of an extra five dollar gold piece I had the satisfaction to behold the last man reach my camp at three point thirty p m An hour later and we are en route at a pace that I never saw equalled at any time by my caravan Every man s feelings are intensified for there is an animated nay headlong impetuosity about their movements that indicates but too well what is going on in their minds Surely my own are a faithful index to their feelings and I do not feel a whit too proud to acknowledge the great joy that possesses me I feel proud to think that I have been successful but honestly I do not feel so elated at that as at the hope that to morrow I shall sit before a table bounteous with the good things of this life How I will glory in the hams and potatoes and good bread What a deplorable state of mind is it not Ah my friend wait till you are reduced to a skeleton by gaunt famine and coarse loathsome food until you have waded a Makata swamp and marched five hundred twenty five miles in thirty five days through such weather as we have had then you will think such pabula food fit for gods Happy are we that after completing our mission after the hurry and worry of the march after the anxiety and vexation suffered from fractious tribes after tramping for the last fifteen days through mire and Stygian marsh we near Beulah s peace and rest Can we do otherwise than express our happiness by firing away gunpowder until our horns are emptied than shout our hurrahs until we are hoarse than with the hearty soul inspiring Yambos greet every mother s son fresh from the sea Not so think the Wangwana soldiers and I so sympathize with them that I permit them to act their maddest without censure At sunset we enter the town of Bagamoyo More pilgrims come to town were the words heard in Beulah The white man has come to town were the words we heard in Bagamoyo And we shall cross the water tomorrow to Zanzibar and shall enter the golden gate we shall see nothing smell nothing taste nothing that is offensive to the stomach any more The kirangozi blows his horn and gives forth blasts potential as Astolpho s as the natives and Arabs throng around us And that bright flag whose stars have waved over the waters of the great lake in Central Africa which promised relief to the harassed Livingstone when in distress at Ujiji returns to the sea once again torn it is true but not dishonoured tattered but not disgraced As we reached the middle of the town I saw on the steps of a large white house a white man in flannels and helmet similar to that I wore I thought myself rather akin to white men in general and I walked up to him He advanced towards me and we shook hands did everything but embrace Won t you walk in said he Thanks What will you have to drink beer stout brandy Eh by George I congratulate you on your splendid success said he impetuously I knew him immediately He was an Englishman He was Lieut William Henn R N chief of the Livingstone Search and Relief Expedition about to be despatched by the Royal Geographical Society to find and relieve Livingstone The former chief as the Expedition was at first organized was Lieut Llewellyn S Dawson who as soon as he heard from my men that I had found Livingstone had crossed over to Zanzibar and after consultation with doctor John Kirk had resigned He had now nothing further to do with it the command having formally devolved on Lieut Henn A mister Charles New also missionary from Mombasah had joined the expedition but he had resigned too So now there were left but Lieut Henn and mister Oswell Livingstone second son of the Doctor Is mister Oswell Livingstone here I asked with considerable surprise Yes he will be here directly What are you going to do now I asked I don t think it worth my while to go now You have taken the wind out of our sails completely If you have relieved him I don t see the use of my going Do you Well it depends You know your own orders best If you have come only to find and relieve him I can tell you truly he is found and relieved and that he wants nothing more than a few canned meats and some other little things which I dare say you have not got I have his list in his own handwriting with me But his son must go anyhow and I can get men easily enough for him Well if he is relieved it is of no use my going At this time in walked a slight young gentlemanly man with light complexion light hair dark lustrous eyes who was introduced to me as mister Oswell Livingstone The introduction was hardly necessary for in his features there was much of what were the specialities of his father There was an air of quiet resolution about him and in the greeting which he gave me he exhibited rather a reticent character but I attributed that to a receptive nature which augured well for the future I was telling Lieut Henn that whether he goes or not you must go to your father mister Livingstone Oh I mean to go Yes that s right I will furnish you with men and what stores your father needs My men will take you to Unyanyembe without any difficulty They know the road well and that is a great advantage They know how to deal with the negro chiefs and you will have no need to trouble your head about them but march The great thing that is required is speed Your father will be waiting for the things I will march them fast enough if that is all Oh they will be going up light and they can easily make long marches It was settled then Henn made up his mind that as the Doctor had been relieved he was not wanted but before formally resigning he intended to consult with doctor Kirk and for that purpose he would cross over to Zanzibar the next day with the Herald Expedition At two A M I retired to sleep on a comfortable bed There was a great smell of newness about certain articles in the bedroom such as haversacks knapsacks portmanteaus leather gun cases c Evidently the new Expedition had some crudities about it but a journey into the interior would soon have lessened the stock of superfluities which all new men at first load themselves with Ah what a sigh of relief was that I gave as I threw myself on my bed at the thought that Thank God my marching was ended CHAPTER XVI VALEDICTORY At five P M on the seventh of May eighteen seventy two the dhow which conveyed my Expedition back to Zanzibar arrived in the harbor and the men delighted to find themselves once more so near their homes fired volley after volley the American flag was hoisted up and we soon saw the house roofs and wharves lined with spectators many of whom were Europeans with glasses levelled at us We drew ashore slowly but a boat putting off to take us to land we stepped into it and I was soon in presence of my friend the Consul who heartily welcomed me back to Zanzibar and soon after was introduced to the reverend Charles New who was but a day or two previous to my arrival an important member of the English Search Expedition a small slight man in appearance who though he looked weakly had a fund of energy or nervousness in him which was almost too great for such a body He also heartily congratulated me After a bounteous dinner to which I did justice in a manner that astonished my new friends Lieut Dawson called to see me and said mister Stanley let me congratulate you sir Lieut Dawson then went on to state how he envied me my success how I had taken the wind out of his sails a nautical phrase similar to that used by Lieut Henn how when he heard from my men that doctor Livingstone had been found he at once crossed over from Bagamoyo to Zanzibar and after a short talk with doctor Kirk at once resigned But do you not think mister Dawson you have been rather too hasty in tendering your resignation from the more verbal report of my men Perhaps said he but I heard that mister Webb had received a letter from you and that you and Livingstone had discovered that the Rusizi ran into the lake that you had the Doctor s letters and despatches with you Yes but you acquired all this information from my men you have seen nothing yourself You have therefore resigned before you had personal evidence of the fact Well doctor Livingstone is relieved and found as mister Henn tells me is he not Yes that is true enough He is well supplied he only requires a few little luxuries which I am going to send him by an expedition of fifty freemen doctor Livingstone is found and relieved most certainly and I have all the letters and despatches which he could possibly send to his friends But don t you think I did perfectly right Hardly though perhaps it would come to the same thing in the end Any more cloth and beads than he has already would be an incumbrance Still you have your orders from the Royal Geographical Society I have not seen those yet and I am not prepared to judge what your best course would have been But I think you did wrong in resigning before you saw me for then you would have had probably a legitimate excuse for resigning I should have held on to the Expedition until I had consulted with those who sent me though in such an event as this the order would be perhaps to Come home As it has turned out though don t you think I did right Most certainly it would be useless for you to go to search for and relieve Livingstone now because he has already been sought found and relieved but perhaps you had other orders Only if I went into the country I was then to direct my attention to exploration but the primary object having been forestalled by you I am compelled to return home The Admiralty granted me leave of absence only for the search and never said anything about exploration That evening I despatched a boy over to the English Consulate with letters from the great traveller for doctor Kirk and mister Oswell Livingstone I was greeted warmly by the American and German residents who could not have shown warmer feeling than if doctor Livingstone had been a near and dear relation of their own captain H A Fraser and doctor James Christie were also loud in their praises It seems that both of these gentlemen had attempted to despatch a private expedition to the relief of their countryman but through some means it had failed They had contributed the sum of five hundred dollars to effect this laudable object but the man to whom they had entrusted its command had been engaged by another for a different purpose at a higher sum But instead of feeling annoyed that I had performed what they had intended to do they were among my most enthusiastic admirers The next day I received a call from doctor Kirk who warmly congratulated me upon my success Bishop Tozer also came and thanked me for tie service I had rendered to doctor Livingstone On this day I also discharged my men and re engaged twenty of them to return to the Great Master Bombay though in the interior he had scorned the idea of money rewards and though he had systematically in my greatest need endeavoured to baffle me in every way received besides his pay a present of fifty dollars and each man according to his merits from twenty dollars to fifty dollars For this was a day to bury all animosities and condone all offences They poor people had only acted according to their nature and I remembered that from Ujiji to the coast they had all behaved admirably I saw I was terribly emaciated and changed when I presented myself before a full length mirror All confirmed my opinion that I was much older in my appearance and that my hair had become grey captain Fraser had said when I hailed him You have the advantage of me sir and until I mentioned my name he did not know me Even then he jocosely remarked that he believed that it was another Tichborne affair I was so different that identity was almost lost even during the short period of thirteen months that is from March twenty third eighteen seventy one to May seventh eighteen seventy two Lieut Henn the morning after my arrival formally resigned and the Expedition was from this time in the hands of mister Oswell Livingstone who made up his mind to sell the stores retaining such as would be useful to his father After disbanding my Expedition I set about preparing another according to doctor Livingstone s request What the English Expedition lacked I purchased out of the money advanced by mister Oswell Livingstone The guns fifty in number were also furnished out of the stores of the English Expedition by him and so were the ammunition the honga cloth for the tribute to the Wagogo and the cloth for provisioning the force mister Livingstone worked hard in the interests of his father and assisted me to the utmost of his ability He delivered over to me to be packed up Nautical Almanacs for eighteen seventy two eighteen seventy three eighteen seventy four also a chronometer which formerly belonged to doctor Livingstone All these things besides a journal envelopes note books writing paper medicines canned fruits and fish a little wine some tea cutlery and table ware newspapers and private letters and despatches were packed up in air tight tin boxes as well as one hundred lbs of fine American flour and some boxes of soda biscuits Until the nineteenth of May it was understood that mister Oswell Livingstone would take charge of the caravan to his father but about this date he changed his mind and surprised me with a note stating he had decided not to go to Unyanyembe for reasons he thought just and sufficient Under these circumstances my duty was to follow out the instructions of doctor Livingstone in procuring a good and efficient leader to take charge of the caravan as far as Unyanyembe In a few hours I succeeded in obtaining an Arab highly recommended from Sheikh Hashid whom I engaged at an advance of one hundred dollars The young Arab though not remarkably bright seemed honest and able but I left his further employment after reaching Unyanyembe to doctor Livingstone who would be able to decide then whether he was quite trustworthy The next day I collected the men of the new Livingstone Expedition together and as it was dangerous to allow them to wander about the city I locked them up in a courtyard and fed them there until every soul fifty seven in number answered to their names In the meantime through the American Consul s assistance I obtained the services of Johari the chief dragoman of the American Consulate who was charged with the conduct of the party across the inundated plain of the Kingani and who was enjoined on no account to return until the Expedition had started on its march from the western bank of the Kingani River mister Oswell Livingstone generously paid him a douceur for the promise of doing his work thoroughly A dhow having been brought to anchor before the American Consulate I then addressed my old companions saying You are now about to return to Unyanyembe to the Great Master You know him you know he is a good man and has a kind heart He is different from me he will not beat you as I have done But you know I have rewarded you all how I have made you all rich in cloth and money You know how when you behaved yourselves well I was your friend I gave you plenty to eat and plenty to wear When you were sick I looked after you If I was so good to you the Great Master will be much more so He has a pleasant voice and speaks kind When did you ever see him lift his hand against an offender When you were wicked he did not speak to you in anger he spoke to you in tones of sorrow Now will you promise me that you will follow him do what he tells you obey him in all things and not desert him We will we will my master they all cried fervently Then there is one thing more I want to shake hands with you all before you go and we part for ever and they all rushed up at once and a vigorous shake was interchanged with each man Now let every man take up his load In a short time I marched them out into the street and to the beach saw them all on board and the canvas hoisted and the dhow speeding westward on her way to Bagamoyo I felt strange and lonely somehow My dark friends who had travelled over so many hundreds of miles and shared so many dangers with me were gone and I was left behind How many of their friendly faces shall I see again On the twenty ninth the steamer Africa belonging to the German Consulate was chartered by a party of five of us and we departed from Zanzibar to Seychelles with the good wishes of almost all the European residents on the island We arrived at Seychelles on the ninth of June about twelve hours after the French mail had departed for Aden As there is only monthly communication between Mahe Seychelles and Aden we were compelled to remain on the island of Mahe one month My life in Mahe is among the most agreeable things connected with my return from Africa I found my companions estimable gentlemen and true Christians mister Livingstone exhibited many amiable traits of character and proved himself to be a studious thoughtful earnest man When at last the French steamer came from Mauritius there was not one of our party who did not regret leaving the beautiful island and the hospitable British officers who were stationed there The Civil Commissioner mister Hales Franklyn and doctor Brooks did their utmost to welcome the wanderer and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the many civilities I personally received from them At Aden the passengers from the south were transferred on board the French mail steamer the Mei kong en route from China to Marseilles At the latter port I was received with open arms by doctor Hosmer and the representative of the Daily Telegraph and was then told how men regarded the results of the Expedition but it was not until I arrived in England that I realised it mister Bennett who originated and sustained the enterprise now crowned it by one of the most generous acts that could be conceived I had promised doctor Livingstone that twenty four hours after I saw his letters to mister Bennett published in the London journals I would post his letters to his family and friends in England In order to permit me to keep my plighted word and in order that there might be no delay in the delivery of his family letters mister Bennett s agent telegraphed to New York the Herald letters I had received from doctor Livingstone at an expense of nearly Ltwo thousand And now dear reader the time has come for you and I to part Let us hope that it is not final A traveller finds himself compelled to repeat the regretful parting word often During the career recorded in the foregoing book I have bidden many farewells to the Wagogo with their fierce effrontery to Mionvu whose blackmailing once so affected me to the Wavinza whose noisy clatter promised to provoke dire hostilities to the inhospitable Warundi to the Arab slave traders and half castes to all fevers remittent and intermittent to the sloughs and swamps of Makata to the brackish waters and howling wastes to my own dusky friends and followers and to the hero traveller and Christian gentleman David Livingstone It is with kindliest wishes to all who have followed my footsteps on these pages that I repeat once more Farewell CONCLUDING CHAPTER The following correspondence and especially the last letter which was accompanied by a beautiful and valuable gold snuff box set with brilliants will be treasured by me as among the pleasantest results of my undertaking H M S Foreign Office August one Sir I am directed by Earl Granville to acknowledge the receipt of a packet containing letters and despatches from doctor Livingstone which you were good enough to deliver to her Majesty s ambassador at Paris

reason to doubt that this is my father s journal and I certify that the letters he has brought home are my father s letters and no others Tom S Livingstone oooo August two eighteen seventy two Sir I

of what you said I have inquired into the matter and I find that mister Hammond the Under Secretary of the Foreign Office and mister Wylde the head of the Consular and Slave Trade Department have not the slightest doubt as to the genuineness of the papers which have been received from Lord Lyons and which are being printed I cannot omit this opportunity of expressing to you my admiration of the qualities which have enabled you to achieve the object of your mission and to attain a result which has been hailed with so much enthusiasm both in the United States and in this country I am Sir Your
