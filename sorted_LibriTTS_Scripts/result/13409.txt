none	none	and where there had been a red blur there sprang up a small squat little house with a steep thatched roof Of the three little windows one covered on the inside with something red was lighted up What sort of place was it Yergunov remembered that to the right of the road three and a half or four miles from the hospital there was Andrey Tchirikov s tavern He remembered too that this Tchirikov who had been lately killed by some sledge drivers had left a wife and a daughter called Lyubka who had come to the hospital two years before as a patient The inn had a bad reputation and to visit it late in the evening and especially with someone else s horse was not free from risk But there was no help for it Yergunov fumbled in his knapsack for his revolver and coughing sternly tapped at the window frame with his whip Hey who is within he cried Hey granny let me come in and get warm With a hoarse bark a black dog rolled like a ball under the horse s feet then another white one then another black one there must have been a dozen of them Yergunov looked to see which was the biggest swung his whip and lashed at it with all his might A small long legged puppy turned its sharp muzzle upwards and set up a shrill piercing howl Yergunov stood for a long while at the window tapping But at last the hoar frost on the trees near the house glowed red and a muffled female figure appeared with a lantern in her hands Let me in to get warm granny said Yergunov I was driving to the hospital and I have lost my way It s such weather God preserve us Don t be afraid we are your own people granny All my own people are at home and we didn t invite strangers said the figure grimly And what are you knocking for The gate is not locked Yergunov drove into the yard and stopped at the steps Bid your labourer take my horse out granny said he I am not granny And indeed she was not a granny While she was putting out the lantern the light fell on her face and Yergunov saw black eyebrows and recognized Lyubka There are no labourers about now she said as she went into the house Some are drunk and asleep and some have been gone to Ryepino since the morning It s a holiday As he fastened his horse up in the shed Yergunov heard a neigh and distinguished in the darkness another horse and felt on it a Cossack saddle So there must be someone else in the house besides the woman and her daughter For greater security Yergunov unsaddled his horse and when he went into the house took with him both his purchases and his saddle The first room into which he went was large and very hot and smelt of freshly washed floors A short lean peasant of about forty with a small fair beard wearing a dark blue shirt was sitting at the table under the holy images It was Kalashnikov an arrant scoundrel and horse stealer whose father and uncle kept a tavern in Bogalyovka and disposed of the stolen horses where they could He too had been to the hospital more than once not for medical treatment but to see the doctor about horses to ask whether he had not one for sale and whether his honour would not like to swop his bay mare for a dun coloured gelding Now his head was pomaded and a silver ear ring glittered in his ear and altogether he had a holiday air Frowning and dropping his lower lip he was looking intently at a big dog s eared picture book Another peasant lay stretched on the floor near the stove his head his shoulders and his chest were covered with a sheepskin he was probably asleep beside his new boots with shining bits of metal on the heels there were two dark pools of melted snow Seeing the hospital assistant Kalashnikov greeted him Yes it is weather said Yergunov rubbing his chilled knees with his open hands The snow is up to one s neck I am soaked to the skin I can tell you And I believe my revolver is too He took out his revolver looked it all over and put it back in his knapsack But the revolver made no impression at all the peasant went on looking at the book Yes it is weather I lost my way and if it had not been for the dogs here I do believe it would have been my death There would have been a nice to do And where are the women The old woman has gone to Ryepino and the girl is getting supper ready answered Kalashnikov Silence followed Yergunov shivering and gasping breathed on his hands huddled up and made a show of being very cold and exhausted The still angry dogs could be heard howling outside It was dreary You come from Bogalyovka don t you he asked the peasant sternly Yes from Bogalyovka And to while away the time Yergunov began to think about Bogalyovka It was a big village and it lay in a deep ravine so that when one drove along the highroad on a moonlight night and looked down into the dark ravine and then up at the sky it seemed as though the moon were hanging over a bottomless abyss and it were the end of the world The path going down was steep winding and so narrow that when one drove down to Bogalyovka on account of some epidemic or to vaccinate the people one had to shout at the top of one s voice or whistle all the way for if one met a cart coming up one could not pass The peasants of Bogalyovka had the reputation of being good gardeners and horse stealers They had well stocked gardens In spring the whole village was buried in white cherry blossom and in the summer they sold cherries at three kopecks a pail One could pay three kopecks and pick as one liked Their women were handsome and looked well fed they were fond of finery and never did anything even on working days but spent all their time sitting on the ledge in front of their houses and searching in each other s heads But at last there was the sound of footsteps Lyubka a girl of twenty with bare feet and a red dress came into the room She looked sideways at Yergunov and walked twice from one end of the room to the other She did not move simply but with tiny steps thrusting forward her bosom evidently she enjoyed padding about with her bare feet on the freshly washed floor and had taken off her shoes on purpose Kalashnikov laughed at something and beckoned her with his finger She went up to the table and he showed her a picture of the Prophet Elijah who driving three horses abreast was dashing up to the sky Lyubka put her elbow on the table her plait fell across her shoulder a long chestnut plait tied with red ribbon at the end and it almost touched the floor She too smiled A splendid wonderful picture said Kalashnikov Wonderful he repeated and motioned with his hand as though he wanted to take the reins instead of Elijah The wind howled in the stove something growled and squeaked as though a big dog had strangled a rat Ugh the unclean spirits are abroad said Lyubka That s the wind said Kalashnikov and after a pause he raised his eyes to Yergunov and asked And what is your learned opinion Osip Vassilyitch are there devils in this world or not What s one to say brother said Yergunov and he shrugged one shoulder If one reasons from science of course there are no devils for it s a superstition but if one looks at it simply as you and I do now there are devils to put it shortly I have seen a great deal in my life When I finished my studies I served as medical assistant in the army in a regiment of the dragoons and I have been in the war of course I have a medal and a decoration from the Red Cross but after the treaty of San Stefano I returned to Russia and went into the service of the Zemstvo And in consequence of my enormous circulation about the world I may say I have seen more than many another has dreamed of It has happened to me to see devils too that is not devils with horns and a tail that is all nonsense but just to speak precisely something of the sort Where asked Kalashnikov In various places There is no need to go far Last year I met him here speak of him not at night near this very inn I was driving I remember to Golyshino I was going there to vaccinate Of course as usual I had the racing droshky and a horse and all the necessary paraphernalia and what s more I had a watch and all the rest of it so I was on my guard as I drove along for fear of some mischance There are lots of tramps of all sorts I came up to the Zmeinoy Ravine damnation take it and was just going down it when all at once somebody comes up to me such a fellow Black hair black eyes and his whole face looked smutted with soot He comes straight up to the horse and takes hold of the left rein Stop He looked at the horse then at me then dropped the reins and without saying a bad word Where are you going says he And he showed his teeth in a grin and his eyes were spiteful looking Ah thought I you are a queer customer I am going to vaccinate for the smallpox said I And what is that to you Well if that s so says he vaccinate me He bared his arm and thrust it under my nose Of course I did not bandy words with him I just vaccinated him to get rid of him Afterwards I looked at my lancet and it had gone rusty The peasant who was asleep near the stove suddenly turned over and flung off the sheepskin to his great surprise Yergunov recognized the stranger he had met that day at Zmeinoy Ravine This peasant s hair beard and eyes were black as soot his face was swarthy and to add to the effect there was a black spot the size of a lentil on his right cheek He looked mockingly at the hospital assistant and said I did take hold of the left rein that was so but about the smallpox you are lying sir And there was not a word said about the smallpox between us Yergunov was disconcerted I m not talking about you he said Lie down since you are lying down The dark skinned peasant had never been to the hospital and Yergunov did not know who he was or where he came from and now looking at him he made up his mind that the man must be a gypsy The peasant got up and stretching and yawning loudly went up to Lyubka and Kalashnikov and sat down beside them and he too began looking at the book His sleepy face softened and a look of envy came into it Look Merik Lyubka said to him get me such horses and I will drive to heaven Sinners can t drive to heaven said Kalashnikov That s for holiness Then Lyubka laid the table and brought in a big piece of fat bacon salted cucumbers a wooden platter of boiled meat cut up into little pieces then a frying pan in which there were sausages and cabbage spluttering A cut glass decanter of vodka which diffused a smell of orange peel all over the room when it was poured out was put on the table also Yergunov was annoyed that Kalashnikov and the dark fellow Merik talked together and took no notice of him at all behaving exactly as though he were not in the room And he wanted to talk to them to brag to drink to have a good meal and if possible to have a little fun with Lyubka who sat down near him half a dozen times while they were at supper and as though by accident brushed against him with her handsome shoulders and passed her hands over her broad hips She was a healthy active girl always laughing and never still she would sit down then get up and when she was sitting down she would keep turning first her face and then her back to her neighbour like a fidgety child and never failed to brush against him with her elbows or her knees And he was displeased too that the peasants drank only a glass each and no more and it was awkward for him to drink alone But he could not refrain from taking a second glass all the same then a third and he ate all the sausage He brought himself to flatter the peasants that they might accept him as one of the party instead of holding him at arm s length You are a fine set of fellows in Bogalyovka he said and wagged his head In what way fine fellows enquired Kalashnikov Why about horses for instance Fine fellows at stealing H m fine fellows you call them Nothing but thieves and drunkards They have had their day but it is over said Merik after a pause But now they have only Filya left and he is blind Yes there is no one but Filya said Kalashnikov with a sigh Reckon it up he must be seventy the German settlers knocked out one of his eyes and he does not see well with the other It is cataract In old days the police officer would shout as soon as he saw him Hey you Shamil and all the peasants called him that he was Shamil all over the place and now his only name is One eyed Filya But he was a fine fellow Lyuba s father Andrey Grigoritch and he stole one night into Rozhnovo there were cavalry regiments stationed there and carried off nine of the soldiers horses the very best of them They weren t frightened of the sentry and in the morning they sold all the horses for twenty roubles to the gypsy Afonka Yes But nowadays a man contrives to carry off a horse whose rider is drunk or asleep and has no fear of God but will take the very boots from a drunkard and then slinks off and goes away a hundred and fifty miles with a horse and haggles at the market haggles like a Jew till the policeman catches him the fool There is no fun in it it is simply a disgrace A paltry set of people I must say What about Merik asked Lyubka Merik is not one of us said Kalashnikov He is a Harkov man from Mizhiritch But that he is a bold fellow that s the truth there s no gainsaying that he is a fine fellow Lyubka looked slily and gleefully at Merik and said It wasn t for nothing they dipped him in a hole in the ice How was that asked Yergunov It was like this said Merik and he laughed Filya carried off three horses from the Samoylenka tenants and they pitched upon me There were ten of the tenants at Samoylenka and with their labourers there were thirty altogether and all of them Molokans So one of them says to me at the market Come and have a look Merik we have brought some new horses from the fair I was interested of course I went up to them and the whole lot of them thirty men tied my hands behind me and led me to the river We ll show you fine horses they said One hole in the ice was there already they cut another beside it seven feet away Then to be sure they took a cord and put a noose under my armpits and tied a crooked stick to the other end long enough to reach both holes They thrust the stick in and dragged it through I went plop into the ice hole just as I was in my fur coat and my high boots while they stood and shoved me one with his foot and one with his stick then dragged me under the ice and pulled me out of the other hole Lyubka shuddered and shrugged At first I was in a fever from the cold Merik went on but when they pulled me out I was helpless and lay in the snow and the Molokans stood round and hit me with sticks on my knees and my elbows It hurt fearfully They beat me and they went away and everything on me was frozen my clothes were covered with ice I got up but I couldn t move Thank God a woman drove by and gave me a lift Meanwhile Yergunov had drunk five or six glasses of vodka his heart felt lighter and he longed to tell some extraordinary wonderful story too and to show that he too was a bold fellow and not afraid of anything I ll tell you what happened to us in Penza Province he began Either because he had drunk a great deal and was a little tipsy or perhaps because he had twice been detected in a lie the peasants took not the slightest notice of him and even left off answering his questions What was worse they permitted themselves a frankness in his presence that made him feel uncomfortable and cold all over and that meant that they took no notice of him Kalashnikov had the dignified manners of a sedate and sensible man he spoke weightily and made the sign of the cross over his mouth every time he yawned and no one could have supposed that this was a thief a heartless thief who had stripped poor creatures who had already been twice in prison and who had been sentenced by the commune to exile in Siberia and had been bought off by his father and uncle who were as great thieves and rogues as he was Merik gave himself the airs of a bravo He saw that Lyubka and Kalashnikov were admiring him and looked upon himself as a very fine fellow and put his arms akimbo squared his chest or stretched so that the bench creaked under him After supper Kalashnikov prayed to the holy image without getting up from his seat and shook hands with Merik the latter prayed too and shook Kalashnikov s hand Lyubka cleared away the supper shook out on the table some peppermint biscuits dried nuts and pumpkin seeds and placed two bottles of sweet wine The kingdom of heaven and peace everlasting to Andrey Grigoritch said Kalashnikov clinking glasses with Merik When he was alive we used to gather together here or at his brother Martin s and my word my word what men what talks Remarkable conversations Martin used to be here and Filya and Fyodor Stukotey It was all done in style it was all in keeping And what fun we had We did have fun we did have fun Lyubka went out and soon afterwards came back wearing a green kerchief and beads Look Merik what Kalashnikov brought me to day she said She looked at herself in the looking glass and tossed her head several times to make the beads jingle And then she opened a chest and began taking out first a cotton dress with red and blue flowers on it and then a red one with flounces which rustled and crackled like paper then a new kerchief dark blue shot with many colours and all these things she showed and flung up her hands laughing as though astonished that she had such treasures Kalashnikov tuned the balalaika and began playing it but Yergunov could not make out what sort of song he was singing and whether it was gay or melancholy because at one moment it was so mournful he wanted to cry and at the next it would be merry Merik suddenly jumped up and began tapping with his heels on the same spot then brandishing his arms he moved on his heels from the table to the stove from the stove to the chest then he bounded up as though he had been stung clicked the heels of his boots together in the air and began going round and round in a crouching position Lyubka waved both her arms uttered a desperate shriek and followed him At first she moved sideways like a snake as though she wanted to steal up to someone and strike him from behind She tapped rapidly with her bare heels as Merik had done with the heels of his boots then she turned round and round like a top and crouched down and her red dress was blown out like a bell Merik looking angrily at her and showing his teeth in a grin flew towards her in the same crouching posture as though he wanted to crush her with his terrible legs while she jumped up flung back her head and waving her arms as a big bird does its wings floated across the room scarcely touching the floor What a flame of a girl thought Yergunov sitting on the chest and from there watching the dance What fire Give up everything for her and it would be too little And he regretted that he was a hospital assistant and not a simple peasant that he wore a reefer coat and a chain with a gilt key on it instead of a blue shirt with a cord tied round the waist Then he could boldly have sung danced flung both arms round Lyubka as Merik did The sharp tapping shouts and whoops set the crockery ringing in the cupboard and the flame of the candle dancing The thread broke and the beads were scattered all over the floor the green kerchief slipped off and Lyubka was transformed into a red cloud flitting by and flashing black eyes and it seemed as though in another second Merik s arms and legs would drop off But finally Merik stamped for the last time and stood still as though turned to stone Exhausted and almost breathless Lyubka sank on to his bosom and leaned against him as against a post and he put his arms round her and looking into her eyes said tenderly and caressingly as though in jest I ll find out where your old mother s money is hidden I ll murder her and cut your little throat for you and after that I will set fire to the inn People will think you have perished in the fire and with your money I shall go to Kuban I ll keep droves of horses and flocks of sheep Lyubka made no answer but only looked at him with a guilty air and asked And is it nice in Kuban Merik He said nothing but went to the chest sat down and sank into thought most likely he was dreaming of Kuban It s time for me to be going said Kalashnikov getting up Filya must be waiting for me Goodbye Lyuba Yergunov went out into the yard to see that Kalashnikov did not go off with his horse The snowstorm still persisted White clouds were floating about the yard their long tails clinging to the rough grass and the bushes while on the other side of the fence in the open country huge giants in white robes with wide sleeves were whirling round and falling to the ground and getting up again to wave their arms and fight And the wind the wind The bare birches and cherry trees unable to endure its rude caresses bowed low down to the ground and wailed God for what sin hast Thou bound us to the earth and will not let us go free Wo said Kalashnikov sternly and he got on his horse one half of the gate was opened and by it lay a high snowdrift Well get on shouted Kalashnikov His little short legged nag set off and sank up to its stomach in the drift at once Kalashnikov was white all over with the snow and soon vanished from sight with his horse When Yergunov went back into the room Lyubka was creeping about the floor picking up her beads Merik was not there A splendid girl thought Yergunov as he lay down on the bench and put his coat under his head Oh if only Merik were not here Lyubka excited him as she crept about the floor by the bench and he thought that if Merik had not been there he would certainly have got up and embraced her and then one would see what would happen It was true she was only a girl but not likely to be chaste and even if she were need one stand on ceremony in a den of thieves Lyubka collected her beads and went out The candle burnt down and the flame caught the paper in the candlestick Yergunov laid his revolver and matches beside him and put out the candle The light before the holy images flickered so much that it hurt his eyes and patches of light danced on the ceiling on the floor and on the cupboard and among them he had visions of Lyubka buxom full bosomed now she was turning round like a top now she was exhausted and breathless Oh if the devils would carry off that Merik he thought The little lamp gave a last flicker spluttered and went out Someone it must have been Merik came into the room and sat down on the bench He puffed at his pipe and for an instant lighted up a dark cheek with a patch on it Yergunov s throat was irritated by the horrible fumes of the tobacco smoke What filthy tobacco you have got damnation take it said Yergunov It makes me positively sick I mix my tobacco with the flowers of the oats answered Merik after a pause It is better for the chest He smoked spat and went out again Half an hour passed and all at once there was the gleam of a light in the passage Merik appeared in a coat and cap then Lyubka with a candle in her hand Do stay Merik said Lyubka in an imploring voice No Lyuba don t keep me Listen Merik said Lyubka and her voice grew soft and tender I know you will find mother s money and will do for her and for me and will go to Kuban and love other girls but God be with you I only ask you one thing sweetheart do stay No I want some fun said Merik fastening his belt But you have nothing to go on You came on foot what are you going on Merik bent down to Lyubka and whispered something in her ear she looked towards the door and laughed through her tears He is asleep the puffed up devil she said Merik embraced her kissed her vigorously and went out Yergunov thrust his revolver into his pocket jumped up and ran after him Get out of the way he said to Lyubka who hurriedly bolted the door of the entry and stood across the threshold Let me pass Why are you standing here What do you want to go out for To have a look at my horse Lyubka gazed up at him with a sly and caressing look Why look at it You had better look at me she said then she bent down and touched with her finger the gilt watch key that hung on his chain Let me pass or he will go off on my horse said Yergunov Let me go you devil he shouted and giving her an angry blow on the shoulder he pressed his chest against her with all his might to push her away from the door but she kept tight hold of the bolt and was like iron Let me go he shouted exhausted he will go off with it I tell you Why should he He won t Breathing hard and rubbing her shoulder which hurt she looked up at him again flushed a little and laughed Don t go away dear heart she said I am dull alone Yergunov looked into her eyes hesitated and put his arms round her she did not resist Come no nonsense let me go he begged her She did not speak I heard you just now he said telling Merik that you love him I dare say My heart knows who it is I love She put her finger on the key again and said softly Give me that Yergunov unfastened the key and gave it to her She suddenly craned her neck and listened with a grave face and her expression struck Yergunov as cold and cunning he thought of his horse and now easily pushed her aside and ran out into the yard In the shed a sleepy pig was grunting with lazy regularity and a cow was knocking her horn Yergunov lighted a match and saw the pig and the cow and the dogs which rushed at him on all sides at seeing the light but there was no trace of the horse Shouting and waving his arms at the dogs stumbling over the drifts and sticking in the snow he ran out at the gate and fell to gazing into the darkness He strained his eyes to the utmost and saw only the snow flying and the snowflakes distinctly forming into all sorts of shapes at one moment the white laughing face of a corpse would peep out of the darkness at the next a white horse would gallop by with an Amazon in a muslin dress upon it at the next a string of white swans would fly overhead Shaking with anger and cold and not knowing what to do Yergunov fired his revolver at the dogs and did not hit one of them then he rushed back to the house When he went into the entry he distinctly heard someone scurry out of the room and bang the door It was dark in the room Yergunov pushed against the door it was locked Then lighting match after match he rushed back into the entry from there into the kitchen and from the kitchen into a little room where all the walls were hung with petticoats and dresses where there was a smell of cornflowers and fennel and a bedstead with a perfect mountain of pillows standing in the corner by the stove this must have been the old mother s room From there he passed into another little room and here he saw Lyubka She was lying on a chest covered with a gay coloured patchwork cotton quilt pretending to be asleep A little ikon lamp was burning in the corner above the pillow Where is my horse Yergunov asked Lyubka did not stir Where is my horse I am asking you Yergunov repeated still more sternly and he tore the quilt off her I am asking you she devil he shouted She jumped up on her knees and with one hand holding her shift and with the other trying to clutch the quilt huddled against the wall She looked at Yergunov with repulsion and terror in her eyes and like a wild beast in a trap kept cunning watch on his faintest movement Tell me where my horse is or I ll knock the life out of you shouted Yergunov Get away dirty brute she said in a hoarse voice Yergunov seized her by the shift near the neck and tore it And then he could not restrain himself and with all his might embraced the girl But hissing with fury she slipped out of his arms and freeing one hand the other was tangled in the torn shift hit him a blow with her fist on the skull His head was dizzy with the pain there was a ringing and rattling in his ears he staggered back and at that moment received another blow this time on the temple Reeling and clutching at the doorposts that he might not fall he made his way to the room where his things were and lay down on the bench then after lying for a little time took the matchbox out of his pocket and began lighting match after match for no object he lit it blew it out and threw it under the table and went on till all the matches were gone Meanwhile the air began to turn blue outside the cocks began to crow but his head still ached and there was an uproar in his ears as though he were sitting under a railway bridge and hearing the trains passing over his head He got somehow into his coat and cap the saddle and the bundle of his purchases he could not find his knapsack was empty it was not for nothing that someone had scurried out of the room when he came in from the yard He took a poker from the kitchen to keep off the dogs and went out into the yard leaving the door open The snow storm had subsided and it was calm outside When he went out at the gate the white plain looked dead and there was not a single bird in the morning sky On both sides of the road and in the distance there were bluish patches of young copse Yergunov began thinking how he would be greeted at the hospital and what the doctor would say to him it was absolutely necessary to think of that and to prepare beforehand to answer questions he would be asked but this thought grew blurred and slipped away He walked along thinking of nothing but Lyubka of the peasants with whom he had passed the night he remembered how after Lyubka struck him the second time she had bent down to the floor for the quilt and how her loose hair had fallen on the floor His mind was in a maze and he wondered why there were in the world doctors hospital assistants merchants clerks and peasants instead of simple free men There are to be sure free birds free beasts a free Merik and they are not afraid of anyone and don t need anyone And whose idea was it who had decreed that one must get up in the morning dine at midday go to bed in the evening that a doctor takes precedence of a hospital assistant that one must live in rooms and love only one s wife And why not the contrary dine at night and sleep in the day Ah to jump on a horse without enquiring whose it is to ride races with the wind like a devil over fields and forests and ravines to make love to girls to mock at everyone Yergunov thrust the poker into the snow pressed his forehead to the cold white trunk of a birch tree and sank into thought and his grey monotonous life his wages his subordinate position the dispensary the everlasting to do with the bottles and blisters struck him as contemptible sickening Who says it s a sin to enjoy oneself he asked himself with vexation Those who say that have never lived in freedom like Merik and Kalashnikov and have never loved Lyubka they have been beggars all their lives have lived without any pleasure and have only loved their wives who are like frogs And he thought about himself that he had not hitherto been a thief a swindler or even a brigand simply because he could not or had not yet met with a suitable opportunity A year and a half passed In spring after Easter Yergunov who had long before been dismissed from the hospital and was hanging about without a job came out of the tavern in Ryepino and sauntered aimlessly along the street He went out into the open country Here there was the scent of spring and a warm caressing wind was blowing The calm starry night looked down from the sky on the earth My God how infinite the depth of the sky and with what fathomless immensity it stretched over the world The world is created well enough only why and with what right do people thought Yergunov divide their fellows into the sober and the drunken the employed and the dismissed and so on Why do the sober and well fed sleep comfortably in their homes while the drunken and the hungry must wander about the country without a refuge Why was it that if anyone had not a job and did not get a salary he had to go hungry without clothes and boots Whose idea was it Why was it the birds and the wild beasts in the woods did not have jobs and get salaries but lived as they pleased Far away in the sky a beautiful crimson glow lay quivering stretched wide over the horizon Yergunov stopped and for a long time he gazed at it and kept wondering why was it that if he had carried off someone else s samovar the day before and sold it for drink in the taverns it would be a sin Why was it Two carts drove by on the road in one of them there was a woman asleep in the other sat an old man without a cap on Grandfather where is that fire asked Yergunov Andrey Tchirikov s inn answered the old man And Yergunov recalled what had happened to him eighteen months before in the winter in that very inn and how Merik had boasted and he imagined the old woman and Lyubka with their throats cut burning and he envied Merik And when he walked back to the tavern looking at the houses of the rich publicans cattle dealers and blacksmiths he reflected how nice it would be to steal by night into some rich man s house WARD NO six I In the hospital yard there stands a small lodge surrounded by a perfect forest of burdocks nettles and wild hemp Its roof is rusty the chimney is tumbling down the steps at the front door are rotting away and overgrown with grass and there are only traces left of the stucco The front of the lodge faces the hospital at the back it looks out into the open country from which it is separated by the grey hospital fence with nails on it These nails with their points upwards and the fence and the lodge itself have that peculiar desolate God forsaken look which is only found in our hospital and prison buildings If you are not afraid of being stung by the nettles come by the narrow footpath that leads to the lodge and let us see what is going on inside Opening the first door we walk into the entry Here along the walls and by the stove every sort of hospital rubbish lies littered about Mattresses old tattered dressing gowns trousers blue striped shirts boots and shoes no good for anything all these remnants are piled up in heaps mixed up and crumpled mouldering and giving out a sickly smell The porter Nikita an old soldier wearing rusty good conduct stripes is always lying on the litter with a pipe between his teeth He has a grim surly battered looking face overhanging eyebrows which give him the expression of a sheep dog of the steppes and a red nose he is short and looks thin and scraggy but he is of imposing deportment and his fists are vigorous He belongs to the class of simple hearted practical and dull witted people prompt in carrying out orders who like discipline better than anything in the world and so are convinced that it is their duty to beat people He showers blows on the face on the chest on the back on whatever comes first and is convinced that there would be no order in the place if he did not Next you come into a big spacious room which fills up the whole lodge except for the entry Here the walls are painted a dirty blue the ceiling is as sooty as in a hut without a chimney it is evident that in the winter the stove smokes and the room is full of fumes The windows are disfigured by iron gratings on the inside The wooden floor is grey and full of splinters There is a stench of sour cabbage of smouldering wicks of bugs and of ammonia and for the first minute this stench gives you the impression of having walked into a menagerie There are bedsteads screwed to the floor Men in blue hospital dressing gowns and wearing nightcaps in the old style are sitting and lying on them These are the lunatics There are five of them in all here Only one is of the upper class the rest are all artisans The one nearest the door a tall lean workman with shining red whiskers and tear stained eyes sits with his head propped on his hand staring at the same point Day and night he grieves shaking his head sighing and smiling bitterly He takes a part in conversation and usually makes no answer to questions he eats and drinks mechanically when food is offered him From his agonizing throbbing cough his thinness and the flush on his cheeks one may judge that he is in the first stage of consumption Next to him is a little alert very lively old man with a pointed beard and curly black hair like a negro s By day he walks up and down the ward from window to window or sits on his bed cross legged like a Turk and ceaselessly as a bullfinch whistles softly sings and titters He shows his childish gaiety and lively character at night also when he gets up to say his prayers that is to beat himself on the chest with his fists and to scratch with his fingers at the door This is the Jew Moiseika an imbecile who went crazy twenty years ago when his hat factory was burnt down And of all the inhabitants of Ward No six he is the only one who is allowed to go out of the lodge and even out of the yard into the street He has enjoyed this privilege for years probably because he is an old inhabitant of the hospital a quiet harmless imbecile the buffoon of the town where people are used to seeing him surrounded by boys and dogs In his wretched gown in his absurd night cap and in slippers sometimes with bare legs and even without trousers he walks about the streets stopping at the gates and little shops and begging for a copper In one place they will give him some kvass in another some bread in another a copper so that he generally goes back to the ward feeling rich and well fed Everything that he brings back Nikita takes from him for his own benefit The soldier does this roughly angrily turning the Jew s pockets inside out and calling God to witness that he will not let him go into the street again and that breach of the regulations is worse to him than anything in the world Moiseika likes to make himself useful He gives his companions water and covers them up when they are asleep he promises each of them to bring him back a kopeck and to make him a new cap he feeds with a spoon his neighbour on the left who is paralyzed He acts in this way not from compassion nor from any considerations of a humane kind but through imitation unconsciously dominated by Gromov his neighbour on the right hand Ivan Dmitritch Gromov a man of thirty three who is a gentleman by birth and has been a court usher and provincial secretary suffers from the mania of persecution He either lies curled up in bed or walks from corner to corner as though for exercise he very rarely sits down He is always excited agitated and overwrought by a sort of vague undefined expectation The faintest rustle in the entry or shout in the yard is enough to make him raise his head and begin listening whether they are coming for him whether they are looking for him And at such times his face expresses the utmost uneasiness and repulsion I like his broad face with its high cheek bones always pale and unhappy and reflecting as though in a mirror a soul tormented by conflict and long continued terror His grimaces are strange and abnormal but the delicate lines traced on his face by profound genuine suffering show intelligence and sense and there is a warm and healthy light in his eyes I like the man himself courteous anxious to be of use and extraordinarily gentle to everyone except Nikita When anyone drops a button or a spoon he jumps up from his bed quickly and picks it up every day he says good morning to his companions and when he goes to bed he wishes them good night Besides his continually overwrought condition and his grimaces his madness shows itself in the following way also Sometimes in the evenings he wraps himself in his dressing gown and trembling all over with his teeth chattering begins walking rapidly from corner to corner and between the bedsteads It seems as though he is in a violent fever From the way he suddenly stops and glances at his companions it can be seen that he is longing to say something very important but apparently reflecting that they would not listen or would not understand him he shakes his head impatiently and goes on pacing up and down But soon the desire to speak gets the upper hand of every consideration and he will let himself go and speak fervently and passionately His talk is disordered and feverish like delirium disconnected and not always intelligible but on the other hand something extremely fine may be felt in it both in the words and the voice When he talks you recognize in him the lunatic and the man It is difficult to reproduce on paper his insane talk He speaks of the baseness of mankind of violence trampling on justice of the glorious life which will one day be upon earth of the window gratings which remind him every minute of the stupidity and cruelty of oppressors It makes a disorderly incoherent potpourri of themes old but not yet out of date II Some twelve or fifteen years ago an official called Gromov a highly respectable and prosperous person was living in his own house in the principal street of the town He had two sons Sergey and Ivan When Sergey was a student in his fourth year he was taken ill with galloping consumption and died and his death was as it were the first of a whole series of calamities which suddenly showered on the Gromov family Within a week of Sergey s funeral the old father was put on trial for fraud and misappropriation and he died of typhoid in the prison hospital soon afterwards The house with all their belongings was sold by auction and Ivan Dmitritch and his mother were left entirely without means Hitherto in his father s lifetime Ivan Dmitritch who was studying in the University of Petersburg had received an allowance of sixty or seventy roubles a month and had had no conception of poverty now he had to make an abrupt change in his life He had to spend his time from morning to night giving lessons for next to nothing to work at copying and with all that to go hungry as all his earnings were sent to keep his mother Ivan Dmitritch could not stand such a life he lost heart and strength and giving up the university went home Here through interest he obtained the post of teacher in the district school but could not get on with his colleagues was not liked by the boys and soon gave up the post His mother died He was for six months without work living on nothing but bread and water then he became a court usher He kept this post until he was dismissed owing to his illness He had never even in his young student days given the impression of being perfectly healthy He had always been pale thin and given to catching cold he ate little and slept badly A single glass of wine went to his head and made him hysterical He always had a craving for society but owing to his irritable temperament and suspiciousness he never became very intimate with anyone and had no friends He always spoke with contempt of his fellow townsmen saying that their coarse ignorance and sleepy animal existence seemed to him loathsome and horrible He spoke in a loud tenor with heat and invariably either with scorn and indignation or with wonder and enthusiasm and always with perfect sincerity Whatever one talked to him about he always brought it round to the same subject that life was dull and stifling in the town that the townspeople had no lofty interests but lived a dingy meaningless life diversified by violence coarse profligacy and hypocrisy that scoundrels were well fed and clothed while honest men lived from hand to mouth that they needed schools a progressive local paper a theatre public lectures the company ordination of the intellectual elements that society must see its failings and be horrified In his criticisms of people he laid on the colours thick using only black and white and no fine shades mankind was divided for him into honest men and scoundrels there was nothing in between He always spoke with passion and enthusiasm of women and of love but he had never been in love In spite of the severity of his judgments and his nervousness he was liked and behind his back was spoken of affectionately as Vanya His innate refinement and readiness to be of service his good breeding his moral purity and his shabby coat his frail appearance and family misfortunes aroused a kind warm sorrowful feeling Moreover he was well educated and well read according to the townspeople s notions he knew everything and was in their eyes something like a walking encyclopedia He had read a great deal He would sit at the club nervously pulling at his beard and looking through the magazines and books and from his face one could see that he was not reading but devouring the pages without giving himself time to digest what he read It must be supposed that reading was one of his morbid habits as he fell upon anything that came into his hands with equal avidity even last year s newspapers and calendars At home he always read lying down III One autumn morning Ivan Dmitritch turning up the collar of his greatcoat and splashing through the mud made his way by side streets and back lanes to see some artisan and to collect some payment that was owing He was in a gloomy mood as he always was in the morning In one of the side streets he was met by two convicts in fetters and four soldiers with rifles in charge of them Ivan Dmitritch had very often met convicts before and they had always excited feelings of compassion and discomfort in him but now this meeting made a peculiar strange impression on him It suddenly seemed to him for some reason that he too might be put into fetters and led through the mud to prison like that After visiting the artisan on the way home he met near the post office a police superintendent of his acquaintance who greeted him and walked a few paces along the street with him and for some reason this seemed to him suspicious At home he could not get the convicts or the soldiers with their rifles out of his head all day and an unaccountable inward agitation prevented him from reading or concentrating his mind In the evening he did not light his lamp and at night he could not sleep but kept thinking that he might be arrested put into fetters and thrown into prison He did not know of any harm he had done and could be certain that he would never be guilty of murder arson or theft in the future either but was it not easy to commit a crime by accident unconsciously and was not false witness always possible and indeed miscarriage of justice It was not without good reason that the agelong experience of the simple people teaches that beggary and prison are ills none can be safe from A judicial mistake is very possible as legal proceedings are conducted nowadays and there is nothing to be wondered at in it People who have an official professional relation to other men s sufferings for instance judges police officers doctors in course of time through habit grow so callous that they cannot even if they wish it take any but a formal attitude to their clients in this respect they are not different from the peasant who slaughters sheep and calves in the back yard and does not notice the blood With this formal soulless attitude to human personality the judge needs but one thing time in order to deprive an innocent man of all rights of property and to condemn him to penal servitude Only the time spent on performing certain formalities for which the judge is paid his salary and then it is all over Then you may look in vain for justice and protection in this dirty wretched little town a hundred and fifty miles from a railway station And indeed is it not absurd even to think of justice when every kind of violence is accepted by society as a rational and consistent necessity and every act of mercy for instance a verdict of acquittal calls forth a perfect outburst of dissatisfied and revengeful feeling In the morning Ivan Dmitritch got up from his bed in a state of horror with cold perspiration on his forehead completely convinced that he might be arrested any minute Since his gloomy thoughts of yesterday had haunted him so long he thought it must be that there was some truth in them They could not indeed have come into his mind without any grounds whatever A policeman walking slowly passed by the windows that was not for nothing Here were two men standing still and silent near the house Why were they silent And agonizing days and nights followed for Ivan Dmitritch Everyone who passed by the windows or came into the yard seemed to him a spy or a detective At midday the chief of the police usually drove down the street with a pair of horses he was going from his estate near the town to the police department but Ivan Dmitritch fancied every time that he was driving especially quickly and that he had a peculiar expression it was evident that he was in haste to announce that there was a very important criminal in the town Ivan Dmitritch started at every ring at the bell and knock at the gate and was agitated whenever he came upon anyone new at his landlady s when he met police officers and gendarmes he smiled and began whistling so as to seem unconcerned He could not sleep for whole nights in succession expecting to be arrested but he snored loudly and sighed as though in deep sleep that his landlady might think he was asleep for if he could not sleep it meant that he was tormented by the stings of conscience what a piece of evidence Facts and common sense persuaded him that all these terrors were nonsense and morbidity that if one looked at the matter more broadly there was nothing really terrible in arrest and imprisonment so long as the conscience is at ease but the more sensibly and logically he reasoned the more acute and agonizing his mental distress became It might be compared with the story of a hermit who tried to cut a dwelling place for himself in a virgin forest the more zealously he worked with his axe the thicker the forest grew In the end Ivan Dmitritch seeing it was useless gave up reasoning altogether and abandoned himself entirely to despair and terror He began to avoid people and to seek solitude His official work had been distasteful to him before now it became unbearable to him He was afraid they would somehow get him into trouble would put a bribe in his pocket unnoticed and then denounce him or that he would accidentally make a mistake in official papers that would appear to be fraudulent or would lose other people s money It is strange that his imagination had never at other times been so agile and inventive as now when every day he thought of thousands of different reasons for being seriously anxious over his freedom and honour but on the other hand his interest in the outer world in books in particular grew sensibly fainter and his memory began to fail him In the spring when the snow melted there were found in the ravine near the cemetery two half decomposed corpses the bodies of an old woman and a boy bearing the traces of death by violence Nothing was talked of but these bodies and their unknown murderers That people might not think he had been guilty of the crime Ivan Dmitritch walked about the streets smiling and when he met acquaintances he turned pale flushed and began declaring that there was no greater crime than the murder of the weak and defenceless But this duplicity soon exhausted him and after some reflection he decided that in his position the best thing to do was to hide in his landlady s cellar He sat in the cellar all day and then all night then another day was fearfully cold and waiting till dusk stole secretly like a thief back to his room He stood in the middle of the room till daybreak listening without stirring Very early in the morning before sunrise some workmen came into the house Ivan Dmitritch knew perfectly well that they had come to mend the stove in the kitchen but terror told him that they were police officers disguised as workmen He slipped stealthily out of the flat and overcome by terror ran along the street without his cap and coat Dogs raced after him barking a peasant shouted somewhere behind him the wind whistled in his ears and it seemed to Ivan Dmitritch that the force and violence of the whole world was massed together behind his back and was chasing after him He was stopped and brought home and his landlady sent for a doctor Doctor Andrey Yefimitch of whom we shall have more to say hereafter prescribed cold compresses on his head and laurel drops shook his head and went away telling the landlady he should not come again as one should not interfere with people who are going out of their minds As he had not the means to live at home and be nursed Ivan Dmitritch was soon sent to the hospital and was there put into the ward for venereal patients He could not sleep at night was full of whims and fancies and disturbed the patients and was soon afterwards by Andrey Yefimitch s orders transferred to Ward No six Within a year Ivan Dmitritch was completely forgotten in the town and his books heaped up by his landlady in a sledge in the shed were pulled to pieces by boys IV Ivan Dmitritch s neighbour on the left hand is as I have said already the Jew Moiseika his neighbour on the right hand is a peasant so rolling in fat that he is almost spherical with a blankly stupid face utterly devoid of thought This is a motionless gluttonous unclean animal who has long ago lost all powers of thought or feeling An acrid stifling stench always comes from him Nikita who has to clean up after him beats him terribly with all his might not sparing his fists and what is dreadful is not his being beaten that one can get used to but the fact that this stupefied creature does not respond to the blows with a sound or a movement nor by a look in the eyes but only sways a little like a heavy barrel The fifth and last inhabitant of Ward No six is a man of the artisan class who had once been a sorter in the post office a thinnish fair little man with a good natured but rather sly face To judge from the clear cheerful look in his calm and intelligent eyes he has some pleasant idea in his mind and has some very important and agreeable secret He has under his pillow and under his mattress something that he never shows anyone not from fear of its being taken from him and stolen but from modesty Sometimes he goes to the window and turning his back to his companions puts something on his breast and bending his head looks at it if you go up to him at such a moment he is overcome with confusion and snatches something off his breast But it is not difficult to guess his secret Congratulate me he often says to Ivan Dmitritch I have been presented with the Stanislav order of the second degree with the star The second degree with the star is only given to foreigners but for some reason they want to make an exception for me he says with a smile shrugging his shoulders in perplexity That I must confess I did not expect I don t understand anything about that Ivan Dmitritch replies morosely But do you know what I shall attain to sooner or later the former sorter persists screwing up his eyes slyly I shall certainly get the Swedish Polar Star That s an order it is worth working for a white cross with a black ribbon It s very beautiful Probably in no other place is life so monotonous as in this ward In the morning the patients except the paralytic and the fat peasant wash in the entry at a big tab and wipe themselves with the skirts of their dressing gowns after that they drink tea out of tin mugs which Nikita brings them out of the main building Everyone is allowed one mugful At midday they have soup made out of sour cabbage and boiled grain in the evening their supper consists of grain left from dinner In the intervals they lie down sleep look out of window and walk from one corner to the other And so every day Even the former sorter always talks of the same orders Fresh faces are rarely seen in Ward No six The doctor has not taken in any new mental cases for a long time and the people who are fond of visiting lunatic asylums are few in this world Once every two months Semyon Lazaritch the barber appears in the ward How he cuts the patients hair and how Nikita helps him to do it and what a trepidation the lunatics are always thrown into by the arrival of the drunken smiling barber we will not describe No one even looks into the ward except the barber The patients are condemned to see day after day no one but Nikita A rather strange rumour has however been circulating in the hospital of late It is rumoured that the doctor has begun to visit Ward No six V A strange rumour doctor Andrey Yefimitch Ragin is a strange man in his way They say that when he was young he was very religious and prepared himself for a clerical career and that when he had finished his studies at the high school in eighteen sixty three he intended to enter a theological academy but that his father a surgeon and doctor of medicine jeered at him and declared point blank that he would disown him if he became a priest How far this is true I don t know but Andrey Yefimitch himself has more than once confessed that he has never had a natural bent for medicine or science in general However that may have been when he finished his studies in the medical faculty he did not enter the priesthood He showed no special devoutness and was no more like a priest at the beginning of his medical career than he is now His exterior is heavy coarse like a peasant s his face his beard his flat hair and his coarse clumsy figure suggest an overfed intemperate and harsh innkeeper on the highroad His face is surly looking and covered with blue veins his eyes are little and his nose is red With his height and broad shoulders he has huge hands and feet one would think that a blow from his fist would knock the life out of anyone but his step is soft and his walk is cautious and insinuating when he meets anyone in a narrow passage he is always the first to stop and make way and to say not in a bass as one would expect but in a high soft tenor I beg your pardon He has a little swelling on his neck which prevents him from wearing stiff starched collars and so he always goes about in soft linen or cotton shirts Altogether he does not dress like a doctor He wears the same suit for ten years and the new clothes which he usually buys at a Jewish shop look as shabby and crumpled on him as his old ones he sees patients and dines and pays visits all in the same coat but this is not due to niggardliness but to complete carelessness about his appearance When Andrey Yefimitch came to the town to take up his duties the institution founded to the glory of God was in a terrible condition One could hardly breathe for the stench in the wards in the passages and in the courtyards of the hospital The hospital servants the nurses and their children slept in the wards together with the patients They complained that there was no living for beetles bugs and mice The surgical wards were never free from erysipelas There were only two scalpels and not one thermometer in the whole hospital potatoes were kept in the baths The superintendent the housekeeper and the medical assistant robbed the patients and of the old doctor Andrey Yefimitch s predecessor people declared that he secretly sold the hospital alcohol and that he kept a regular harem consisting of nurses and female patients These disorderly proceedings were perfectly well known in the town and were even exaggerated but people took them calmly some justified them on the ground that there were only peasants and working men in the hospital who could not be dissatisfied since they were much worse off at home than in the hospital they couldn t be fed on woodcocks Others said in excuse that the town alone without help from the Zemstvo was not equal to maintaining a good hospital thank God for having one at all even a poor one And the newly formed Zemstvo did not open infirmaries either in the town or the neighbourhood relying on the fact that the town already had its hospital After looking over the hospital Andrey Yefimitch came to the conclusion that it was an immoral institution and extremely prejudicial to the health of the townspeople In his opinion the most sensible thing that could be done was to let out the patients and close the hospital But he reflected that his will alone was not enough to do this and that it would be useless if physical and moral impurity were driven out of one place they would only move to another one must wait for it to wither away of itself Besides if people open a hospital and put up with having it it must be because they need it superstition and all the nastiness and abominations of daily life were necessary since in process of time they worked out to something sensible just as manure turns into black earth There was nothing on earth so good that it had not something nasty about its first origin When Andrey Yefimitch undertook his duties he was apparently not greatly concerned about the irregularities at the hospital He only asked the attendants and nurses not to sleep in the wards and had two cupboards of instruments put up the superintendent the housekeeper the medical assistant and the erysipelas remained unchanged Andrey Yefimitch loved intelligence and honesty intensely but he had no strength of will nor belief in his right to organize an intelligent and honest life about him He was absolutely unable to give orders to forbid things and to insist It seemed as though he had taken a vow never to raise his voice and never to make use of the imperative It was difficult for him to say Fetch or Bring when he wanted his meals he would cough hesitatingly and say to the cook How about tea or How about dinner To dismiss the superintendent or to tell him to leave off stealing or to abolish the unnecessary parasitic post altogether was absolutely beyond his powers When Andrey Yefimitch was deceived or flattered or accounts he knew to be cooked were brought him to sign he would turn as red as a crab and feel guilty but yet he would sign the accounts When the patients complained to him of being hungry or of the roughness of the nurses he would be confused and mutter guiltily Very well very well I will go into it later Most likely there is some misunderstanding At first Andrey Yefimitch worked very zealously He saw patients every day from morning till dinner time performed operations and even attended confinements The ladies said of him that he was attentive and clever at diagnosing diseases especially those of women and children But in process of time the work unmistakably wearied him by its monotony and obvious uselessness To day one sees thirty patients and to morrow they have increased to thirty five the next day forty and so on from day to day from year to year while the mortality in the town did not decrease and the patients did not leave off coming To be any real help to forty patients between morning and dinner was not physically possible so it could but lead to deception If twelve thousand patients were seen in a year it meant if one looked at it simply that twelve thousand men were deceived To put those who were seriously ill into wards and to treat them according to the principles of science was impossible too because though there were principles there was no science if he were to put aside philosophy and pedantically follow the rules as other doctors did the things above all necessary were cleanliness and ventilation instead of dirt wholesome nourishment instead of broth made of stinking sour cabbage and good assistants instead of thieves and indeed why hinder people dying if death is the normal and legitimate end of everyone What is gained if some shop keeper or clerk lives an extra five or ten years If the aim of medicine is by drugs to alleviate suffering the question forces itself on one why alleviate it In the first place they say that suffering leads man to perfection and in the second if mankind really learns to alleviate its sufferings with pills and drops it will completely abandon religion and philosophy in which it has hitherto found not merely protection from all sorts of trouble but even happiness Pushkin suffered terrible agonies before his death poor Heine lay paralyzed for several years why then should not some Andrey Yefimitch or Matryona Savishna be ill since their lives had nothing of importance in them and would have been entirely empty and like the life of an amoeba except for suffering Oppressed by such reflections Andrey Yefimitch relaxed his efforts and gave up visiting the hospital every day VI 
8713_300047_000002_000000	train-clean-360	His life was passed like this 
8713_300047_000002_000001	train-clean-360	As a rule he got up at eight o clock in the morning dressed and drank his tea 
8713_300047_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Then he sat down in his study to read or went to the hospital 
8713_300047_000002_000003	train-clean-360	At the hospital the out patients were sitting in the dark narrow little corridor waiting to be seen by the doctor 
none	none	The nurses and the attendants tramping with their boots over the brick floors ran by them gaunt looking patients in dressing gowns passed dead bodies and vessels full of filth were carried by the children were crying and there was a cold draught 
8713_300047_000002_000005	train-clean-360	Andrey Yefimitch knew that such surroundings were torture to feverish consumptive and impressionable patients but what could be done 
8713_300047_000002_000006	train-clean-360	In the consulting room he was met by his assistant Sergey Sergeyitch a fat little man with a plump well washed shaven face with soft smooth manners wearing a new loosely cut suit and looking more like a senator than a medical assistant 
8713_300047_000002_000007	train-clean-360	He had an immense practice in the town wore a white tie and considered himself more proficient than the doctor who had no practice 
none	none	In the corner of the consulting room there stood a large ikon in a shrine with a heavy lamp in front of it and near it a candle stand with a white cover on it On the walls hung portraits of bishops a view of the Svyatogorsky Monastery and wreaths of dried cornflowers Sergey Sergeyitch was religious and liked solemnity and decorum 
8713_300047_000002_000011	train-clean-360	The ikon had been put up at his expense at his instructions some one of the patients read the hymns of praise in the consulting room on Sundays and after the reading Sergey Sergeyitch himself went through the wards with a censer and burned incense 
8713_300047_000003_000000	train-clean-360	There were a great many patients but the time was short and so the work was confined to the asking of a few brief questions and the administration of some drugs such as castor oil or volatile ointment 
8713_300047_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Andrey Yefimitch would sit with his cheek resting in his hand lost in thought and asking questions mechanically 
8713_300047_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Sergey Sergeyitch sat down too rubbing his hands and from time to time putting in his word 
8713_300047_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 We suffer pain and poverty he would say because we do not pray to the merciful God as we should 
none	none	Yes Andrey Yefimitch never performed any operation when he was seeing patients he had long ago given up doing so and the sight of blood upset him 
8713_300047_000005_000001	train-clean-360	When he had to open a child s mouth in order to look at its throat and the child cried and tried to defend itself with its little hands the noise in his ears made his head go round and brought tears to his eyes 
8713_300047_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He would make haste to prescribe a drug and motion to the woman to take the child away 
8713_300047_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He was soon wearied by the timidity of the patients and their incoherence by the proximity of the pious Sergey Sergeyitch by the portraits on the walls and by his own questions which he had asked over and over again for twenty years 
8713_300047_000006_000001	train-clean-360	And he would go away after seeing five or six patients 
8713_300047_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The rest would be seen by his assistant in his absence 
8713_300047_000007_000000	train-clean-360	With the agreeable thought that thank God he had no private practice now and that no one would interrupt him Andrey Yefimitch sat down to the table immediately on reaching home and took up a book 
none	none	He read a great deal and always with enjoyment 
8713_300047_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Half his salary went on buying books and of the six rooms that made up his abode three were heaped up with books and old magazines 
none	none	He liked best of all works on history and philosophy the only medical publication to which he subscribed was The Doctor of which he always read the last pages first 
8713_300047_000007_000004	train-clean-360	He would always go on reading for several hours without a break and without being weary 
8713_300047_000007_000005	train-clean-360	He did not read as rapidly and impulsively as Ivan Dmitritch had done in the past but slowly and with concentration often pausing over a passage which he liked or did not find intelligible 
8713_300047_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Near the books there always stood a decanter of vodka and a salted cucumber or a pickled apple lay beside it not on a plate but on the baize table cloth Every half hour he would pour himself out a glass of vodka and drink it without taking his eyes off the book 
8713_300047_000007_000007	train-clean-360	Then without looking at it he would feel for the cucumber and bite off a bit 
8713_300047_000008_000000	train-clean-360	At three o clock he would go cautiously to the kitchen door cough and say Daryushka what about dinner 
8713_300047_000009_000000	train-clean-360	After his dinner a rather poor and untidily served one Andrey Yefimitch would walk up and down his rooms with his arms folded thinking 
8713_300047_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The clock would strike four then five and still he would be walking up and down thinking 
8713_300047_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Occasionally the kitchen door would creak and the red and sleepy face of Daryushka would appear

8713_300047_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 No it s not time yet he would answer 
none	none	I ll wait a little I ll wait a little Towards the evening the postmaster Mihail Averyanitch the only man in town whose society did not bore Andrey Yefimitch would come in Mihail Averyanitch had once been a very rich landowner and had served in the calvary but had come to ruin and was forced by poverty to take a job in the post office late in life 
8713_300047_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He had a hale and hearty appearance luxuriant grey whiskers the manners of a well bred man and a loud pleasant voice 
8713_300047_000012_000003	train-clean-360	He was good natured and emotional but hot tempered 
none	none	When anyone in the post office made a protest expressed disagreement or even began to argue Mihail Averyanitch would turn crimson shake all over and shout in a voice of thunder Hold your tongue so that the post office had long enjoyed the reputation of an institution which it was terrible to visit Mihail Averyanitch liked and respected Andrey Yefimitch for his culture and the loftiness of his soul he treated the other inhabitants of the town superciliously as though they were his subordinates
8713_300047_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Here I am he would say going in to Andrey Yefimitch 
8713_300047_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Good evening my dear fellow 
none	none	I ll be bound you are getting sick of me aren t you On the contrary I am delighted said the doctor
8713_300047_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 I am always glad to see you 
8713_300047_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The friends would sit on the sofa in the study and for some time would smoke in silence 
8713_300047_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Daryushka what about the beer Andrey Yefimitch would say 
none	none	They would drink their first bottle still in silence the doctor brooding and Mihail Averyanitch with a gay and animated face like a man who has something very interesting to tell 
8713_300047_000017_000001	train-clean-360	The doctor was always the one to begin the conversation 
8713_300047_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 What a pity he would say quietly and slowly not looking his friend in the face he never looked anyone in the face what a great pity it is that there are no people in our town who are capable of carrying on intelligent and interesting conversation or care to do so 
8713_300047_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It is an immense privation for us 
8713_300047_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Even the educated class do not rise above vulgarity the level of their development I assure you is not a bit higher than that of the lower orders 
8713_300047_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Perfectly true 
8713_300047_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Perfectly true 
8713_300047_000019_000001	train-clean-360	I agree 
8713_300047_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 You know of course the doctor went on quietly and deliberately that everything in this world is insignificant and uninteresting except the higher spiritual manifestations of the human mind Intellect draws a sharp line between the animals and man suggests the divinity of the latter and to some extent even takes the place of the immortality which does not exist 
8713_300047_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Consequently the intellect is the only possible source of enjoyment 
none	none	We see and hear of no trace of intellect about us so we are deprived of enjoyment 
8713_300047_000020_000003	train-clean-360	We have books it is true but that is not at all the same as living talk and converse 
8713_300047_000020_000004	train-clean-360	If you will allow me to make a not quite apt comparison books are the printed score while talk is the singing 
none	none	Perfectly true 
8713_300047_000022_000000	train-clean-360	A silence would follow 
8713_300047_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Daryushka would come out of the kitchen and with an expression of blank dejection would stand in the doorway to listen with her face propped on her fist 
none	none	Eh Mihail Averyanitch would sigh
8713_300047_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 To expect intelligence of this generation 
8713_300047_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And he would describe how wholesome entertaining and interesting life had been in the past 
8713_300047_000024_000001	train-clean-360	How intelligent the educated class in Russia used to be and what lofty ideas it had of honour and friendship how they used to lend money without an IOU and it was thought a disgrace not to give a helping hand to a comrade in need and what campaigns what adventures what skirmishes what comrades what women 
none	none	And the Caucasus what a marvellous country 
8713_300047_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The wife of a battalion commander a queer woman used to put on an officer s uniform and drive off into the mountains in the evening alone without a guide 
8713_300047_000024_000004	train-clean-360	It was said that she had a love affair with some princeling in the native village 
8713_300047_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Queen of Heaven Holy Mother Daryushka would sigh 
8713_300047_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 And how we drank 
none	none	And how we ate And what desperate liberals we were Andrey Yefimitch would listen without hearing he was musing as he sipped his beer
8713_300047_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I often dream of intellectual people and conversation with them he said suddenly interrupting Mihail Averyanitch 
8713_300047_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 My father gave me an excellent education but under the influence of the ideas of the sixties made me become a doctor 
8713_300047_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I believe if I had not obeyed him then by now I should have been in the very centre of the intellectual movement 
8713_300047_000028_000003	train-clean-360	Most likely I should have become a member of some university 
8713_300047_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Of course intellect too is transient and not eternal but you know why I cherish a partiality for it 
8713_300047_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Life is a vexatious trap when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to full consciousness he cannot help feeling that he is in a trap from which there is no escape 
8713_300047_000028_000006	train-clean-360	Indeed he is summoned without his choice by fortuitous circumstances from non existence into life what for 
none	none	He tries to find out the meaning and object of his existence he is told nothing or he is told absurdities he knocks and it is not opened to him death comes to him also without his choice 
8713_300047_000028_000008	train-clean-360	And so just as in prison men held together by common misfortune feel more at ease when they are together so one does not notice the trap in life when people with a bent for analysis and generalization meet together and pass their time in the interchange of proud and free ideas 
8713_300047_000028_000009	train-clean-360	In that sense the intellect is the source of an enjoyment nothing can replace 
none	none	Perfectly true Not looking his friend in the face Andrey Yefimitch would go on quietly and with pauses talking about intellectual people and conversation with them and Mihail Averyanitch would listen attentively and agree Perfectly true And you do not believe in the immortality of the soul he would ask suddenly
8713_300047_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 No honoured Mihail Averyanitch I do not believe it and have no grounds for believing it 
8713_300047_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I must own I doubt it too 
8713_300047_000033_000001	train-clean-360	And yet I have a feeling as though I should never die 
8713_300047_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Oh I think to myself Old fogey it is time you were dead But there is a little voice in my soul says Don t believe it you won t die 
8713_300047_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Soon after nine o clock Mihail Averyanitch would go away 
8713_300047_000034_000001	train-clean-360	As he put on his fur coat in the entry he would say with a sigh 
none	none	What a wilderness fate has carried us to though really 
8713_300047_000035_000001	train-clean-360	What s most vexatious of all is to have to die here 
none	none	Ech VII After seeing his friend out Andrey Yefimitch would sit down at the table and begin reading again The stillness of the evening and afterwards of the night was not broken by a single sound and it seemed as though time were standing still and brooding with the doctor over the book and as though there were nothing in existence but the books and the lamp with the green shade The doctor s coarse peasant like face was gradually lighted up by a smile of delight and enthusiasm over the progress of the human intellect Oh why is not man immortal he thought What is the good of the brain centres and convolutions what is the good of sight speech self consciousness genius if it is all destined to depart into the soil and in the end to grow cold together with the earth s crust and then for millions of years to fly with the earth round the sun with no meaning and no object To do that there was no need at all to draw man with his lofty almost godlike intellect out of non existence and then as though in mockery to turn him into clay The transmutation of substances But what cowardice to comfort oneself with that cheap substitute for immortality The unconscious processes that take place in nature are lower even than the stupidity of man since in stupidity there is anyway consciousness and will while in those processes there is absolutely nothing Only the coward who has more fear of death than dignity can comfort himself with the fact that his body will in time live again in the grass in the stones in the toad To find one s immortality in the transmutation of substances is as strange as to prophesy a brilliant future for the case after a precious violin has been broken and become useless When the clock struck Andrey Yefimitch would sink back into his chair and close his eyes to think a little And under the influence of the fine ideas of which he had been reading he would unawares recall his past and his present The past was hateful better not to think of it And it was the same in the present as in the past He knew that at the very time when his thoughts were floating together with the cooling earth round the sun in the main building beside his abode people were suffering in sickness and physical impurity someone perhaps could not sleep and was making war upon the insects someone was being infected by erysipelas or moaning over too tight a bandage perhaps the patients were playing cards with the nurses and drinking vodka According to the yearly return twelve thousand people had been deceived the whole hospital rested as it had done twenty years ago on thieving filth scandals gossip on gross quackery and as before it was an immoral institution extremely injurious to the health of the inhabitants He knew that Nikita knocked the patients about behind the barred windows of Ward No six and that Moiseika went about the town every day begging alms On the other hand he knew very well that a magical change had taken place in medicine during the last twenty five years When he was studying at the university he had fancied that medicine would soon be overtaken by the fate of alchemy and metaphysics but now when he was reading at night the science of medicine touched him and excited his wonder and even enthusiasm What unexpected brilliance what a revolution Thanks to the antiseptic system operations were performed such as the great Pirogov had considered impossible even in spe Ordinary Zemstvo doctors were venturing to perform the resection of the kneecap of abdominal operations only one per cent was fatal while stone was considered such a trifle that they did not even write about it A radical cure for syphilis had been discovered And the theory of heredity hypnotism the discoveries of Pasteur and of Koch hygiene based on statistics and the work of Zemstvo doctors Psychiatry with its modern classification of mental diseases methods of diagnosis and treatment was a perfect Elborus in comparison with what had been in the past They no longer poured cold water on the heads of lunatics nor put strait waistcoats upon them they treated them with humanity and even so it was stated in the papers got up balls and entertainments for them Andrey Yefimitch knew that with modern tastes and views such an abomination as Ward No six was possible only a hundred and fifty miles from a railway in a little town where the mayor and all the town council were half illiterate tradesmen who looked upon the doctor as an oracle who must be believed without any criticism even if he had poured molten lead into their mouths in any other place the public and the newspapers would long ago have torn this little Bastille to pieces But after all what of it Andrey Yefimitch would ask himself opening his eyes There is the antiseptic system there is Koch there is Pasteur but the essential reality is not altered a bit ill health and mortality are still the same They get up balls and entertainments for the mad but still they don t let them go free so it s all nonsense and vanity and there is no difference in reality between the best Vienna clinic and my hospital But depression and a feeling akin to envy prevented him from feeling indifferent it must have been owing to exhaustion His heavy head sank on to the book he put his hands under his face to make it softer and thought I serve in a pernicious institution and receive a salary from people whom I am deceiving I am not honest but then I of myself am nothing I am only part of an inevitable social evil all local officials are pernicious and receive their salary for doing nothing And so for my dishonesty it is not I who am to blame but the times If I had been born two hundred years later I should have been different When it struck three he would put out his lamp and go into his bedroom he was not sleepy VIII Two years before the Zemstvo in a liberal mood had decided to allow three hundred roubles a year to pay for additional medical service in the town till the Zemstvo hospital should be opened and the district doctor Yevgeny Fyodoritch Hobotov was invited to the town to assist Andrey Yefimitch He was a very young man not yet thirty tall and dark with broad cheek bones and little eyes his forefathers had probably come from one of the many alien races of Russia He arrived in the town without a farthing with a small portmanteau and a plain young woman whom he called his cook This woman had a baby at the breast Yevgeny Fyodoritch used to go about in a cap with a peak and in high boots and in the winter wore a sheepskin He made great friends with Sergey Sergeyitch the medical assistant and with the treasurer but held aloof from the other officials and for some reason called them aristocrats He had only one book in his lodgings The Latest Prescriptions of the Vienna Clinic for eighteen eighty one When he went to a patient he always took this book with him He played billiards in the evening at the club he did not like cards He was very fond of using in conversation such expressions as endless bobbery canting soft soap shut up with your finicking He visited the hospital twice a week made the round of the wards and saw out patients The complete absence of antiseptic treatment and the cupping roused his indignation but he did not introduce any new system being afraid of offending Andrey Yefimitch He regarded his colleague as a sly old rascal suspected him of being a man of large means and secretly envied him He would have been very glad to have his post IX On a spring evening towards the end of March when there was no snow left on the ground and the starlings were singing in the hospital garden the doctor went out to see his friend the postmaster as far as the gate At that very moment the Jew Moiseika returning with his booty came into the yard He had no cap on and his bare feet were thrust into goloshes in his hand he had a little bag of coppers Give me a kopeck he said to the doctor smiling and shivering with cold Andrey Yefimitch who could never refuse anyone anything gave him a ten kopeck piece How bad that is he thought looking at the Jew s bare feet with their thin red ankles Why it s wet And stirred by a feeling akin both to pity and disgust he went into the lodge behind the Jew looking now at his bald head now at his ankles As the doctor went in Nikita jumped up from his heap of litter and stood at attention Good day Nikita Andrey Yefimitch said mildly That Jew should be provided with boots or something he will catch cold Certainly your honour I ll inform the superintendent Please do ask him in my name Tell him that I asked The door into the ward was open Ivan Dmitritch lying propped on his elbow on the bed listened in alarm to the unfamiliar voice and suddenly recognized the doctor He trembled all over with anger jumped up and with a red and wrathful face with his eyes starting out of his head ran out into the middle of the road The doctor has come he shouted and broke into a laugh At last Gentlemen I congratulate you The doctor is honouring us with a visit Cursed reptile he shrieked and stamped in a frenzy such as had never been seen in the ward before Kill the reptile No killing s too good Drown him in the midden pit Andrey Yefimitch hearing this looked into the ward from the entry and asked gently What for What for shouted Ivan Dmitritch going up to him with a menacing air and convulsively wrapping himself in his dressing gown What for Thief he said with a look of repulsion moving his lips as though he would spit at him Quack hangman Calm yourself said Andrey Yefimitch smiling guiltily I assure you I have never stolen anything and as to the rest most likely you greatly exaggerate I see you are angry with me Calm yourself I beg if you can and tell me coolly what are you angry for What are you keeping me here for Because you are ill Yes I am ill But you know dozens hundreds of madmen are walking about in freedom because your ignorance is incapable of distinguishing them from the sane Why am I and these poor wretches to be shut up here like scapegoats for all the rest You your assistant the superintendent and all your hospital rabble are immeasurably inferior to every one of us morally why then are we shut up and you not Where s the logic of it Morality and logic don t come in it all depends on chance If anyone is shut up he has to stay and if anyone is not shut up he can walk about that s all There is neither morality nor logic in my being a doctor and your being a mental patient there is nothing but idle chance That twaddle I don t understand Ivan Dmitritch brought out in a hollow voice and he sat down on his bed Moiseika whom Nikita did not venture to search in the presence of the doctor laid out on his bed pieces of bread bits of paper and little bones and still shivering with cold began rapidly in a singsong voice saying something in Yiddish He most likely imagined that he had opened a shop Let me out said Ivan Dmitritch and his voice quivered I cannot But why why Because it is not in my power Think what use will it be to you if I do let you out Go The townspeople or the police will detain you or bring you back Yes yes that s true said Ivan Dmitritch and he rubbed his forehead It s awful But what am I to do what Andrey Yefimitch liked Ivan Dmitritch s voice and his intelligent young face with its grimaces He longed to be kind to the young man and soothe him he sat down on the bed beside him thought and said You ask me what to do The very best thing in your position would be to run away But unhappily that is useless You would be taken up When society protects itself from the criminal mentally deranged or otherwise inconvenient people it is invincible There is only one thing left for you to resign yourself to the thought that your presence here is inevitable It is no use to anyone So long as prisons and madhouses exist someone must be shut up in them If not you I If not I some third person Wait till in the distant future prisons and madhouses no longer exist and there will be neither bars on the windows nor hospital gowns Of course that time will come sooner or later Ivan Dmitritch smiled ironically You are jesting he said screwing up his eyes Such gentlemen as you and your assistant Nikita have nothing to do with the future but you may be sure sir better days will come I may express myself cheaply you may laugh but the dawn of a new life is at hand truth and justice will triumph and our turn will come I shall not live to see it I shall perish but some people s great grandsons will see it I greet them with all my heart and rejoice rejoice with them Onward God be your help friends With shining eyes Ivan Dmitritch got up and stretching his hands towards the window went on with emotion in his voice From behind these bars I bless you Hurrah for truth and justice I rejoice I see no particular reason to rejoice said Andrey Yefimitch who thought Ivan Dmitritch s movement theatrical though he was delighted by it Prisons and madhouses there will not be and truth as you have just expressed it will triumph but the reality of things you know will not change the laws of nature will still remain the same People will suffer pain grow old and die just as they do now However magnificent a dawn lighted up your life you would yet in the end be nailed up in a coffin and thrown into a hole And immortality Oh come now You don t believe in it but I do Somebody in Dostoevsky or Voltaire said that if there had not been a God men would have invented him And I firmly believe that if there is no immortality the great intellect of man will sooner or later invent it Well said observed Andrey Yefimitch smiling with pleasure its a good thing you have faith With such a belief one may live happily even shut up within walls You have studied somewhere I presume Yes I have been at the university but did not complete my studies You are a reflecting and a thoughtful man In any surroundings you can find tranquillity in yourself Free and deep thinking which strives for the comprehension of life and complete contempt for the foolish bustle of the world those are two blessings beyond any that man has ever known And you can possess them even though you lived behind threefold bars Diogenes lived in a tub yet he was happier than all the kings of the earth Your Diogenes was a blockhead said Ivan Dmitritch morosely Why do you talk to me about Diogenes and some foolish comprehension of life he cried growing suddenly angry and leaping up I love life I love it passionately I have the mania of persecution a continual agonizing terror but I have moments when I am overwhelmed by the thirst for life and then I am afraid of going mad I want dreadfully to live dreadfully He walked up and down the ward in agitation and said dropping his voice When I dream I am haunted by phantoms People come to me I hear voices and music and I fancy I am walking through woods or by the seashore and I long so passionately for movement for interests Come tell me what news is there asked Ivan Dmitritch what s happening Do you wish to know about the town or in general Well tell me first about the town and then in general Well in the town it is appallingly dull There s no one to say a word to no one to listen to There are no new people A young doctor called Hobotov has come here recently He had come in my time Well he is a low cad isn t he Yes he is a man of no culture It s strange you know Judging by every sign there is no intellectual stagnation in our capital cities there is a movement so there must be real people there too but for some reason they always send us such men as I would rather not see It s an unlucky town Yes it is an unlucky town sighed Ivan Dmitritch and he laughed And how are things in general What are they writing in the papers and reviews It was by now dark in the ward The doctor got up and standing began to describe what was being written abroad and in Russia and the tendency of thought that could be noticed now Ivan Dmitritch listened attentively and put questions but suddenly as though recalling something terrible clutched at his head and lay down on the bed with his back to the doctor What s the matter asked Andrey Yefimitch You will not hear another word from me said Ivan Dmitritch rudely Leave me alone Why so I tell you leave me alone Why the devil do you persist Andrey Yefimitch shrugged his shoulders heaved a sigh and went out As he crossed the entry he said You might clear up here Nikita there s an awfully stuffy smell Certainly your honour What an agreeable young man thought Andrey Yefimitch going back to his flat In all the years I have been living here I do believe he is the first I have met with whom one can talk He is capable of reasoning and is interested in just the right things While he was reading and afterwards while he was going to bed he kept thinking about Ivan Dmitritch and when he woke next morning he remembered that he had the day before made the acquaintance of an intelligent and interesting man and determined to visit him again as soon as possible X Ivan Dmitritch was lying in the same position as on the previous day with his head clutched in both hands and his legs drawn up His face was not visible Good day my friend said Andrey Yefimitch You are not asleep are you In the first place I am not your friend Ivan Dmitritch articulated into the pillow and in the second your efforts are useless you will not get one word out of me Strange muttered Andrey Yefimitch in confusion Yesterday we talked peacefully but suddenly for some reason you took offence and broke off all at once Probably I expressed myself awkwardly or perhaps gave utterance to some idea which did not fit in with your convictions Yes a likely idea said Ivan Dmitritch sitting up and looking at the doctor with irony and uneasiness His eyes were red You can go and spy and probe somewhere else it s no use your doing it here I knew yesterday what you had come for A strange fancy laughed the doctor So you suppose me to be a spy Yes I do A spy or a doctor who has been charged to test me it s all the same Oh excuse me what a queer fellow you are really The doctor sat down on the stool near the bed and shook his head reproachfully But let us suppose you are right he said let us suppose that I am treacherously trying to trap you into saying something so as to betray you to the police You would be arrested and then tried But would you be any worse off being tried and in prison than you are here If you are banished to a settlement or even sent to penal servitude would it be worse than being shut up in this ward I imagine it would be no worse What then are you afraid of These words evidently had an effect on Ivan Dmitritch He sat down quietly It was between four and five in the afternoon the time when Andrey Yefimitch usually walked up and down his rooms and Daryushka asked whether it was not time for his beer It was a still bright day I came out for a walk after dinner and here I have come as you see said the doctor It is quite spring What month is it March asked Ivan Dmitritch Yes the end of March Is it very muddy No not very There are already paths in the garden It would be nice now to drive in an open carriage somewhere into the country said Ivan Dmitritch rubbing his red eyes as though he were just awake then to come home to a warm snug study and and to have a decent doctor to cure one s headache It s so long since I have lived like a human being It s disgusting here Insufferably disgusting After his excitement of the previous day he was exhausted and listless and spoke unwillingly His fingers twitched and from his face it could be seen that he had a splitting headache There is no real difference between a warm snug study and this ward said Andrey Yefimitch A man s peace and contentment do not lie outside a man but in himself What do you mean The ordinary man looks for good and evil in external things that is in carriages in studies but a thinking man looks for it in himself You should go and preach that philosophy in Greece where it s warm and fragrant with the scent of pomegranates but here it is not suited to the climate With whom was it I was talking of Diogenes Was it with you Yes with me yesterday Diogenes did not need a study or a warm habitation it s hot there without You can lie in your tub and eat oranges and olives But bring him to Russia to live he d be begging to be let indoors in May let alone December He d be doubled up with the cold No One can be insensible to cold as to every other pain Marcus Aurelius says A pain is a vivid idea of pain make an effort of will to change that idea dismiss it cease to complain and the pain will disappear That is true The wise man or simply the reflecting thoughtful man is distinguished precisely by his contempt for suffering he is always contented and surprised at nothing Then I am an idiot since I suffer and am discontented and surprised at the baseness of mankind You are wrong in that if you will reflect more on the subject you will understand how insignificant is all that external world that agitates us One must strive for the comprehension of life and in that is true happiness Comprehension repeated Ivan Dmitritch frowning External internal Excuse me but I don t understand it I only know he said getting up and looking angrily at the doctor I only know that God has created me of warm blood and nerves yes indeed If organic tissue is capable of life it must react to every stimulus And I do To pain I respond with tears and outcries to baseness with indignation to filth with loathing To my mind that is just what is called life The lower the organism the less sensitive it is and the more feebly it reacts to stimulus and the higher it is the more responsively and vigorously it reacts to reality How is it you don t know that A doctor and not know such trifles To despise suffering to be always contented and to be surprised at nothing one must reach this condition and Ivan Dmitritch pointed to the peasant who was a mass of fat or to harden oneself by suffering to such a point that one loses all sensibility to it that is in other words to cease to live You must excuse me I am not a sage or a philosopher Ivan Dmitritch continued with irritation and I don t understand anything about it I am not capable of reasoning On the contrary your reasoning is excellent The Stoics whom you are parodying were remarkable people but their doctrine crystallized two thousand years ago and has not advanced and will not advance an inch forward since it is not practical or living It had a success only with the minority which spends its life in savouring all sorts of theories and ruminating over them the majority did not understand it A doctrine which advocates indifference to wealth and to the comforts of life and a contempt for suffering and death is quite unintelligible to the vast majority of men since that majority has never known wealth or the comforts of life and to despise suffering would mean to it despising life itself since the whole existence of man is made up of the sensations of hunger cold injury and a Hamlet like dread of death The whole of life lies in these sensations one may be oppressed by it one may hate it but one cannot despise it Yes so I repeat the doctrine of the Stoics can never have a future from the beginning of time up to to day you see continually increasing the struggle the sensibility to pain the capacity of responding to stimulus Ivan Dmitritch suddenly lost the thread of his thoughts stopped and rubbed his forehead with vexation I meant to say something important but I have lost it he said What was I saying Oh yes This is what I mean one of the Stoics sold himself into slavery to redeem his neighbour so you see even a Stoic did react to stimulus since for such a generous act as the destruction of oneself for the sake of one s neighbour he must have had a soul capable of pity and indignation Here in prison I have forgotten everything I have learned or else I could have recalled something else Take Christ for instance Christ responded to reality by weeping smiling being sorrowful and moved to wrath even overcome by misery He did not go to meet His sufferings with a smile He did not despise death but prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane that this cup might pass Him by Ivan Dmitritch laughed and sat down Granted that a man s peace and contentment lie not outside but in himself he said granted that one must despise suffering and not be surprised at anything yet on what ground do you preach the theory Are you a sage A philosopher No I am not a philosopher but everyone ought to preach it because it is reasonable No I want to know how it is that you consider yourself competent to judge of comprehension contempt for suffering and so on Have you ever suffered Have you any idea of suffering Allow me to ask you were you ever thrashed in your childhood No my parents had an aversion for corporal punishment My father used to flog me cruelly my father was a harsh sickly Government clerk with a long nose and a yellow neck But let us talk of you No one has laid a finger on you all your life no one has scared you nor beaten you you are as strong as a bull You grew up under your father s wing and studied at his expense and then you dropped at once into a sinecure For more than twenty years you have lived rent free with heating lighting and service all provided and had the right to work how you pleased and as much as you pleased even to do nothing You were naturally a flabby lazy man and so you have tried to arrange your life so that nothing should disturb you or make you move You have handed over your work to the assistant and the rest of the rabble while you sit in peace and warmth save money read amuse yourself with reflections with all sorts of lofty nonsense and Ivan Dmitritch looked at the doctor s red nose with boozing in fact you have seen nothing of life you know absolutely nothing of it and are only theoretically acquainted with reality you despise suffering and are surprised at nothing for a very simple reason vanity of vanities the external and the internal contempt for life for suffering and for death comprehension true happiness that s the philosophy that suits the Russian sluggard best You see a peasant beating his wife for instance Why interfere Let him beat her they will both die sooner or later anyway and besides he who beats injures by his blows not the person he is beating but himself To get drunk is stupid and unseemly but if you drink you die and if you don t drink you die A peasant woman comes with toothache well what of it Pain is the idea of pain and besides there is no living in this world without illness we shall all die and so go away woman don t hinder me from thinking and drinking vodka A young man asks advice what he is to do how he is to live anyone else would think before answering but you have got the answer ready strive for comprehension or for true happiness And what is that fantastic true happiness There s no answer of course We are kept here behind barred windows tortured left to rot but that is very good and reasonable because there is no difference at all between this ward and a warm snug study A convenient philosophy You can do nothing and your conscience is clear and you feel you are wise No sir it is not philosophy it s not thinking it s not breadth of vision but laziness fakirism drowsy stupefaction Yes cried Ivan Dmitritch getting angry again you despise suffering but I ll be bound if you pinch your finger in the door you will howl at the top of your voice And perhaps I shouldn t howl said Andrey Yefimitch with a gentle smile Oh I dare say Well if you had a stroke of paralysis or supposing some fool or bully took advantage of his position and rank to insult you in public and if you knew he could do it with impunity then you would understand what it means to put people off with comprehension and true happiness That s original said Andrey Yefimitch laughing with pleasure and rubbing his hands I am agreeably struck by your inclination for drawing generalizations and the sketch of my character you have just drawn is simply brilliant I must confess that talking to you gives me great pleasure Well I ve listened to you and now you must graciously listen to me XI The conversation went on for about an hour longer and apparently made a deep impression on Andrey Yefimitch He began going to the ward every day He went there in the mornings and after dinner and often the dusk of evening found him in conversation with Ivan Dmitritch At first Ivan Dmitritch held aloof from him suspected him of evil designs and openly expressed his hostility But afterwards he got used to him and his abrupt manner changed to one of condescending irony Soon it was all over the hospital that the doctor Andrey Yefimitch had taken to visiting Ward No six No one neither Sergey Sergevitch nor Nikita nor the nurses could conceive why he went there why he stayed there for hours together what he was talking about and why he did not write prescriptions His actions seemed strange Often Mihail Averyanitch did not find him at home which had never happened in the past and Daryushka was greatly perturbed for the doctor drank his beer now at no definite time and sometimes was even late for dinner One day it was at the end of June doctor Hobotov went to see Andrey Yefimitch about something Not finding him at home he proceeded to look for him in the yard there he was told that the old doctor had gone to see the mental patients Going into the lodge and stopping in the entry Hobotov heard the following conversation We shall never agree and you will not succeed in converting me to your faith Ivan Dmitritch was saying irritably you are utterly ignorant of reality and you have never known suffering but have only like a leech fed beside the sufferings of others while I have been in continual suffering from the day of my birth till to day For that reason I tell you frankly I consider myself superior to you and more competent in every respect It s not for you to teach me I have absolutely no ambition to convert you to my faith said Andrey Yefimitch gently and with regret that the other refused to understand him And that is not what matters my friend what matters is not that you have suffered and I have not Joy and suffering are passing let us leave them never mind them What matters is that you and I think we see in each other people who are capable of thinking and reasoning and that is a common bond between us however different our views If you knew my friend how sick I am of the universal senselessness ineptitude stupidity and with what delight I always talk with you You are an intelligent man and I enjoyed your company Hobotov opened the door an inch and glanced into the ward Ivan Dmitritch in his night cap and the doctor Andrey Yefimitch were sitting side by side on the bed The madman was grimacing twitching and convulsively wrapping himself in his gown while the doctor sat motionless with bowed head and his face was red and look helpless and sorrowful Hobotov shrugged his shoulders grinned and glanced at Nikita Nikita shrugged his shoulders too Next day Hobotov went to the lodge accompanied by the assistant Both stood in the entry and listened I fancy our old man has gone clean off his chump said Hobotov as he came out of the lodge Lord have mercy upon us sinners sighed the decorous Sergey Sergeyitch scrupulously avoiding the puddles that he might not muddy his polished boots I must own honoured Yevgeny Fyodoritch I have been expecting it for a long time XII After this Andrey Yefimitch began to notice a mysterious air in all around him The attendants the nurses and the patients looked at him inquisitively when they met him and then whispered together The superintendent s little daughter Masha whom he liked to meet in the hospital garden for some reason ran away from him now when he went up with a smile to stroke her on the head The postmaster no longer said Perfectly true as he listened to him but in unaccountable confusion muttered Yes yes yes and looked at him with a grieved and thoughtful expression for some reason he took to advising his friend to give up vodka and beer but as a man of delicate feeling he did not say this directly but hinted it telling him first about the commanding officer of his battalion an excellent man and then about the priest of the regiment a capital fellow both of whom drank and fell ill but on giving up drinking completely regained their health On two or three occasions Andrey Yefimitch was visited by his colleague Hobotov who also advised him to give up spirituous liquors and for no apparent reason recommended him to take bromide In August Andrey Yefimitch got a letter from the mayor of the town asking him to come on very important business On arriving at the town hall at the time fixed Andrey Yefimitch found there the military commander the superintendent of the district school a member of the town council Hobotov and a plump fair gentleman who was introduced to him as a doctor This doctor with a Polish surname difficult to pronounce lived at a pedigree stud farm twenty miles away and was now on a visit to the town There s something that concerns you said the member of the town council addressing Andrey Yefimitch after they had all greeted one another and sat down to the table Here Yevgeny Fyodoritch says that there is not room for the dispensary in the main building and that it ought to be transferred to one of the lodges That s of no consequence of course it can be transferred but the point is that the lodge wants doing up Yes it would have to be done up said Andrey Yefimitch after a moment s thought If the corner lodge for instance were fitted up as a dispensary I imagine it would cost at least five hundred roubles An unproductive expenditure Everyone was silent for a space I had the honour of submitting to you ten years ago Andrey Yefimitch went on in a low voice that the hospital in its present form is a luxury for the town beyond its means It was built in the forties but things were different then The town spends too much on unnecessary buildings and superfluous staff I believe with a different system two model hospitals might be maintained for the same money Well let us have a different system then the member of the town council said briskly I have already had the honour of submitting to you that the medical department should be transferred to the supervision of the Zemstvo Yes transfer the money to the Zemstvo and they will steal it laughed the fair haired doctor That s what it always comes to the member of the council assented and he also laughed Andrey Yefimitch looked with apathetic lustreless eyes at the fair haired doctor and said One should be just Again there was silence Tea was brought in The military commander for some reason much embarrassed touched Andrey Yefimitch s hand across the table and said You have quite forgotten us doctor But of course you are a hermit you don t play cards and don t like women You would be dull with fellows like us They all began saying how boring it was for a decent person to live in such a town No theatre no music and at the last dance at the club there had been about twenty ladies and only two gentlemen The young men did not dance but spent all the time crowding round the refreshment bar or playing cards Not looking at anyone and speaking slowly in a low voice Andrey Yefimitch began saying what a pity what a terrible pity it was that the townspeople should waste their vital energy their hearts and their minds on cards and gossip and should have neither the power nor the inclination to spend their time in interesting conversation and reading and should refuse to take advantage of the enjoyments of the mind The mind alone was interesting and worthy of attention all the rest was low and petty Hobotov listened to his colleague attentively and suddenly asked Andrey Yefimitch what day of the month is it Having received an answer the fair haired doctor and he in the tone of examiners conscious of their lack of skill began asking Andrey Yefimitch what was the day of the week how many days there were in the year and whether it was true that there was a remarkable prophet living in Ward No six In response to the last question Andrey Yefimitch turned rather red and said Yes he is mentally deranged but he is an interesting young man They asked him no other questions When he was putting on his overcoat in the entry the military commander laid a hand on his shoulder and said with a sigh It s time for us old fellows to rest As he came out of the hall Andrey Yefimitch understood that it had been a committee appointed to enquire into his mental condition He recalled the questions that had been asked him flushed crimson and for some reason for the first time in his life felt bitterly grieved for medical science My God he thought remembering how these doctors had just examined him why they have only lately been hearing lectures on mental pathology they had passed an examination what s the explanation of this crass ignorance They have not a conception of mental pathology And for the first time in his life he felt insulted and moved to anger In the evening of the same day Mihail Averyanitch came to see him The postmaster went up to him without waiting to greet him took him by both hands and said in an agitated voice My dear fellow my dear friend show me that you believe in my genuine affection and look on me as your friend And preventing Andrey Yefimitch from speaking he went on growing excited I love you for your culture and nobility of soul Listen to me my dear fellow The rules of their profession compel the doctors to conceal the truth from you but I blurt out the plain truth like a soldier You are not well Excuse me my dear fellow but it is the truth everyone about you has been noticing it for a long time doctor Yevgeny Fyodoritch has just told me that it is essential for you to rest and distract your mind for the sake of your health Perfectly true Excellent In a day or two I am taking a holiday and am going away for a sniff of a different atmosphere Show that you are a friend to me let us go together Let us go for a jaunt as in the good old days I feel perfectly well said Andrey Yefimitch after a moment s thought I can t go away Allow me to show you my friendship in some other way To go off with no object without his books without his Daryushka without his beer to break abruptly through the routine of life established for twenty years the idea for the first minute struck him as wild and fantastic but he remembered the conversation at the Zemstvo committee and the depressing feelings with which he had returned home and the thought of a brief absence from the town in which stupid people looked on him as a madman was pleasant to him And where precisely do you intend to go he asked To Moscow to Petersburg to Warsaw I spent the five happiest years of my life in Warsaw What a marvellous town Let us go my dear fellow XIII A week later it was suggested to Andrey Yefimitch that he should have a rest that is send in his resignation a suggestion he received with indifference and a week later still Mihail Averyanitch and he were sitting in a posting carriage driving to the nearest railway station The days were cool and bright with a blue sky and a transparent distance They were two days driving the hundred and fifty miles to the railway station and stayed two nights on the way When at the posting station the glasses given them for their tea had not been properly washed or the drivers were slow in harnessing the horses Mihail Averyanitch would turn crimson and quivering all over would shout Hold your tongue Don t argue And in the carriage he talked without ceasing for a moment describing his campaigns in the Caucasus and in Poland What adventures he had had what meetings He talked loudly and opened his eyes so wide with wonder that he might well be thought to be lying Moreover as he talked he breathed in Andrey Yefimitch s face and laughed into his ear This bothered the doctor and prevented him from thinking or concentrating his mind In the train they travelled from motives of economy third class in a non smoking compartment Half the passengers were decent people Mihail Averyanitch soon made friends with everyone and moving from one seat to another kept saying loudly that they ought not to travel by these appalling lines It was a regular swindle A very different thing riding on a good horse one could do over seventy miles a day and feel fresh and well after it And our bad harvests were due to the draining of the Pinsk marshes altogether the way things were done was dreadful He got excited talked loudly and would not let others speak This endless chatter to the accompaniment of loud laughter and expressive gestures wearied Andrey Yefimitch Which of us is the madman he thought with vexation I who try not to disturb my fellow passengers in any way or this egoist who thinks that he is cleverer and more interesting than anyone here and so will leave no one in peace In Moscow Mihail Averyanitch put on a military coat without epaulettes and trousers with red braid on them He wore a military cap and overcoat in the street and soldiers saluted him It seemed to Andrey Yefimitch now that his companion was a man who had flung away all that was good and kept only what was bad of all the characteristics of a country gentleman that he had once possessed He liked to be waited on even when it was quite unnecessary The matches would be lying before him on the table and he would see them and shout to the waiter to give him the matches he did not hesitate to appear before a maidservant in nothing but his underclothes he used the familiar mode of address to all footmen indiscriminately even old men and when he was angry called them fools and blockheads This Andrey Yefimitch thought was like a gentleman but disgusting First of all Mihail Averyanitch led his friend to the Iversky Madonna He prayed fervently shedding tears and bowing down to the earth and when he had finished heaved a deep sigh and said Even though one does not believe it makes one somehow easier when one prays a little Kiss the ikon my dear fellow Andrey Yefimitch was embarrassed and he kissed the image while Mihail Averyanitch pursed up his lips and prayed in a whisper and again tears came into his eyes Then they went to the Kremlin and looked there at the Tsar cannon and the Tsar bell and even touched them with their fingers admired the view over the river visited saint Saviour s and the Rumyantsev museum They dined at Tyestov s Mihail Averyanitch looked a long time at the menu stroking his whiskers and said in the tone of a gourmand accustomed to dine in restaurants We shall see what you give us to eat to day angel XIV The doctor walked about looked at things ate and drank but he had all the while one feeling annoyance with Mihail Averyanitch He longed to have a rest from his friend to get away from him to hide himself while the friend thought it was his duty not to let the doctor move a step away from him and to provide him with as many distractions as possible When there was nothing to look at he entertained him with conversation For two days Andrey Yefimitch endured it but on the third he announced to his friend that he was ill and wanted to stay at home for the whole day his friend replied that in that case he would stay too that really he needed rest for he was run off his legs already Andrey Yefimitch lay on the sofa with his face to the back and clenching his teeth listened to his friend who assured him with heat that sooner or later France would certainly thrash Germany that there were a great many scoundrels in Moscow and that it was impossible to judge of a horse s quality by its outward appearance The doctor began to have a buzzing in his ears and palpitations of the heart but out of delicacy could not bring himself to beg his friend to go away or hold his tongue Fortunately Mihail Averyanitch grew weary of sitting in the hotel room and after dinner he went out for a walk As soon as he was alone Andrey Yefimitch abandoned himself to a feeling of relief How pleasant to lie motionless on the sofa and to know that one is alone in the room Real happiness is impossible without solitude The fallen angel betrayed God probably because he longed for solitude of which the angels know nothing Andrey Yefimitch wanted to think about what he had seen and heard during the last few days but he could not get Mihail Averyanitch out of his head Why he has taken a holiday and come with me out of friendship out of generosity thought the doctor with vexation nothing could be worse than this friendly supervision I suppose he is good natured and generous and a lively fellow but he is a bore An insufferable bore In the same way there are people who never say anything but what is clever and good yet one feels that they are dull witted people For the following days Andrey Yefimitch declared himself ill and would not leave the hotel room he lay with his face to the back of the sofa and suffered agonies of weariness when his friend entertained him with conversation or rested when his friend was absent He was vexed with himself for having come and with his friend who grew every day more talkative and more free and easy he could not succeed in attuning his thoughts to a serious and lofty level This is what I get from the real life Ivan Dmitritch talked about he thought angry at his own pettiness It s of no consequence though I shall go home and everything will go on as before It was the same thing in Petersburg too for whole days together he did not leave the hotel room but lay on the sofa and only got up to drink beer Mihail Averyanitch was all haste to get to Warsaw My dear man what should I go there for said Andrey Yefimitch in an imploring voice You go alone and let me get home I entreat you On no account protested Mihail Averyanitch It s a marvellous town Andrey Yefimitch had not the strength of will to insist on his own way and much against his inclination went to Warsaw There he did not leave the hotel room but lay on the sofa furious with himself with his friend and with the waiters who obstinately refused to understand Russian while Mihail Averyanitch healthy hearty and full of spirits as usual went about the town from morning to night looking for his old acquaintances Several times he did not return home at night After one night spent in some unknown haunt he returned home early in the morning in a violently excited condition with a red face and tousled hair For a long time he walked up and down the rooms muttering something to himself then stopped and said Honour before everything After walking up and down a little longer he clutched his head in both hands and pronounced in a tragic voice Yes honour before everything Accursed be the moment when the idea first entered my head to visit this Babylon My dear friend he added addressing the doctor you may despise me I have played and lost lend me five hundred roubles Andrey Yefimitch counted out five hundred roubles and gave them to his friend without a word The latter still crimson with shame and anger incoherently articulated some useless vow put on his cap and went out Returning two hours later he flopped into an easy chair heaved a loud sigh and said My honour is saved Let us go my friend I do not care to remain another hour in this accursed town Scoundrels Austrian spies By the time the friends were back in their own town it was November and deep snow was lying in the streets doctor Hobotov had Andrey Yefimitch s post he was still living in his old lodgings waiting for Andrey Yefimitch to arrive and clear out of the hospital apartments The plain woman whom he called his cook was already established in one of the lodges Fresh scandals about the hospital were going the round of the town It was said that the plain woman had quarrelled with the superintendent and that the latter had crawled on his knees before her begging forgiveness On the very first day he arrived Andrey Yefimitch had to look out for lodgings My friend the postmaster said to him timidly excuse an indiscreet question what means have you at your disposal Andrey Yefimitch without a word counted out his money and said Eighty six roubles I don t mean that Mihail Averyanitch brought out in confusion misunderstanding him I mean what have you to live on I tell you eighty six roubles I have nothing else Mihail Averyanitch looked upon the doctor as an honourable man yet he suspected that he had accumulated a fortune of at least twenty thousand Now learning that Andrey Yefimitch was a beggar that he had nothing to live on he was for some reason suddenly moved to tears and embraced his friend XV Andrey Yefimitch now lodged in a little house with three windows There were only three rooms besides the kitchen in the little house The doctor lived in two of them which looked into the street while Daryushka and the landlady with her three children lived in the third room and the kitchen Sometimes the landlady s lover a drunken peasant who was rowdy and reduced the children and Daryushka to terror would come for the night When he arrived and established himself in the kitchen and demanded vodka they all felt very uncomfortable and the doctor would be moved by pity to take the crying children into his room and let them lie on his floor and this gave him great satisfaction He got up as before at eight o clock and after his morning tea sat down to read his old books and magazines he had no money for new ones Either because the books were old or perhaps because of the change in his surroundings reading exhausted him and did not grip his attention as before That he might not spend his time in idleness he made a detailed catalogue of his books and gummed little labels on their backs and this mechanical tedious work seemed to him more interesting than reading The monotonous tedious work lulled his thoughts to sleep in some unaccountable way and the time passed quickly while he thought of nothing Even sitting in the kitchen peeling potatoes with Daryushka or picking over the buckwheat grain seemed to him interesting On Saturdays and Sundays he went to church Standing near the wall and half closing his eyes he listened to the singing and thought of his father of his mother of the university of the religions of the world he felt calm and melancholy and as he went out of the church afterwards he regretted that the service was so soon over He went twice to the hospital to talk to Ivan Dmitritch But on both occasions Ivan Dmitritch was unusually excited and ill humoured he bade the doctor leave him in peace as he had long been sick of empty chatter and declared to make up for all his sufferings he asked from the damned scoundrels only one favour solitary confinement Surely they would not refuse him even that On both occasions when Andrey Yefimitch was taking leave of him and wishing him good night he answered rudely and said Go to hell And Andrey Yefimitch did not know now whether to go to him for the third time or not He longed to go In old days Andrey Yefimitch used to walk about his rooms and think in the interval after dinner but now from dinner time till evening tea he lay on the sofa with his face to the back and gave himself up to trivial thoughts which he could not struggle against He was mortified that after more than twenty years of service he had been given neither a pension nor any assistance It is true that he had not done his work honestly but then all who are in the Service get a pension without distinction whether they are honest or not Contemporary justice lies precisely in the bestowal of grades orders and pensions not for moral qualities or capacities but for service whatever it may have been like Why was he alone to be an exception He had no money at all He was ashamed to pass by the shop and look at the woman who owned it He owed thirty two roubles for beer already There was money owing to the landlady also Daryushka sold old clothes and books on the sly and told lies to the landlady saying that the doctor was just going to receive a large sum of money He was angry with himself for having wasted on travelling the thousand roubles he had saved up How useful that thousand roubles would have been now He was vexed that people would not leave him in peace Hobotov thought it his duty to look in on his sick colleague from time to time Everything about him was revolting to Andrey Yefimitch his well fed face and vulgar condescending tone and his use of the word colleague and his high top boots the most revolting thing was that he thought it was his duty to treat Andrey Yefimitch and thought that he really was treating him On every visit he brought a bottle of bromide and rhubarb pills Mihail Averyanitch too thought it his duty to visit his friend and entertain him Every time he went in to Andrey Yefimitch with an affectation of ease laughed constrainedly and began assuring him that he was looking very well to day and that thank God he was on the highroad to recovery and from this it might be concluded that he looked on his friend s condition as hopeless He had not yet repaid his Warsaw debt and was overwhelmed by shame he was constrained and so tried to laugh louder and talk more amusingly His anecdotes and descriptions seemed endless now and were an agony both to Andrey Yefimitch and himself In his presence Andrey Yefimitch usually lay on the sofa with his face to the wall and listened with his teeth clenched his soul was oppressed with rankling disgust and after every visit from his friend he felt as though this disgust had risen higher and was mounting into his throat To stifle petty thoughts he made haste to reflect that he himself and Hobotov and Mihail Averyanitch would all sooner or later perish without leaving any trace on the world If one imagined some spirit flying by the earthly globe in space in a million years he would see nothing but clay and bare rocks Everything culture and the moral law would pass away and not even a burdock would grow out of them Of what consequence was shame in the presence of a shopkeeper of what consequence was the insignificant Hobotov or the wearisome friendship of Mihail Averyanitch It was all trivial and nonsensical But such reflections did not help him now Scarcely had he imagined the earthly globe in a million years when Hobotov in his high top boots or Mihail Averyanitch with his forced laugh would appear from behind a bare rock and he even heard the shamefaced whisper The Warsaw debt I will repay it in a day or two my dear fellow without fail XVI One day Mihail Averyanitch came after dinner when Andrey Yefimitch was lying on the sofa It so happened that Hobotov arrived at the same time with his bromide Andrey Yefimitch got up heavily and sat down leaning both arms on the sofa You have a much better colour to day than you had yesterday my dear man began Mihail Averyanitch Yes you look jolly Upon my soul you do It s high time you were well dear colleague said Hobotov yawning I ll be bound you are sick of this bobbery And we shall recover said Mihail Averyanitch cheerfully We shall live another hundred years To be sure Not a hundred years but another twenty Hobotov said reassuringly It s all right all right colleague don t lose heart Don t go piling it on We ll show what we can do laughed Mihail Averyanitch and he slapped his friend on the knee We ll show them yet Next summer please God we shall be off to the Caucasus and we will ride all over it on horseback trot trot trot And when we are back from the Caucasus I shouldn t wonder if we will all dance at the wedding Mihail Averyanitch gave a sly wink We ll marry you my dear boy we ll marry you Andrey Yefimitch felt suddenly that the rising disgust had mounted to his throat his heart began beating violently That s vulgar he said getting up quickly and walking away to the window Don t you understand that you are talking vulgar nonsense He meant to go on softly and politely but against his will he suddenly clenched his fists and raised them above his head Leave me alone he shouted in a voice unlike his own blushing crimson and shaking all over Go away both of you Mihail Averyanitch and Hobotov got up and stared at him first with amazement and then with alarm Go away both Andrey Yefimitch went on shouting Stupid people Foolish people I don t want either your friendship or your medicines stupid man Vulgar Nasty Hobotov and Mihail Averyanitch looking at each other in bewilderment staggered to the door and went out Andrey Yefimitch snatched up the bottle of bromide and flung it after them the bottle broke with a crash on the door frame Go to the devil he shouted in a tearful voice running out into the passage To the devil When his guests were gone Andrey Yefimitch lay down on the sofa trembling as though in a fever and went on for a long while repeating Stupid people Foolish people When he was calmer what occurred to him first of all was the thought that poor Mihail Averyanitch must be feeling fearfully ashamed and depressed now and that it was all dreadful Nothing like this had ever happened to him before Where was his intelligence and his tact Where was his comprehension of things and his philosophical indifference The doctor could not sleep all night for shame and vexation with himself and at ten o clock next morning he went to the post office and apologized to the postmaster We won t think again of what has happened Mihail Averyanitch greatly touched said with a sigh warmly pressing his hand Let bygones be bygones Lyubavkin he suddenly shouted so loud that all the postmen and other persons present started hand a chair and you wait he shouted to a peasant woman who was stretching out a registered letter to him through the grating Don t you see that I am busy We will not remember the past he went on affectionately addressing Andrey Yefimitch sit down I beg you my dear fellow For a minute he stroked his knees in silence and then said I have never had a thought of taking offence Illness is no joke I understand Your attack frightened the doctor and me yesterday and we had a long talk about you afterwards My dear friend why won t you treat your illness seriously You can t go on like this Excuse me speaking openly as a friend whispered Mihail Averyanitch You live in the most unfavourable surroundings in a crowd in uncleanliness no one to look after you no money for proper treatment My dear friend the doctor and I implore you with all our hearts listen to our advice go into the hospital There you will have wholesome food and attendance and treatment Though between ourselves Yevgeny Fyodoritch is mauvais ton yet he does understand his work you can fully rely upon him He has promised me he will look after you Andrey Yefimitch was touched by the postmaster s genuine sympathy and the tears which suddenly glittered on his cheeks My honoured friend don t believe it he whispered laying his hand on his heart don t believe them It s all a sham My illness is only that in twenty years I have only found one intelligent man in the whole town and he is mad I am not ill at all it s simply that I have got into an enchanted circle which there is no getting out of I don t care I am ready for anything Go into the hospital my dear fellow I don t care if it were into the pit Give me your word my dear man that you will obey Yevgeny Fyodoritch in everything Certainly I will give you my word But I repeat my honoured friend I have got into an enchanted circle Now everything even the genuine sympathy of my friends leads to the same thing to my ruin I am going to my ruin and I have the manliness to recognize it My dear fellow you will recover What s the use of saying that said Andrey Yefimitch with irritation There are few men who at the end of their lives do not experience what I am experiencing now When you are told that you have something such as diseased kidneys or enlarged heart and you begin being treated for it or are told you are mad or a criminal that is in fact when people suddenly turn their attention to you you may be sure you have got into an enchanted circle from which you will not escape You will try to escape and make things worse You had better give in for no human efforts can save you So it seems to me Meanwhile the public was crowding at the grating That he might not be in their way Andrey Yefimitch got up and began to take leave Mihail Averyanitch made him promise on his honour once more and escorted him to the outer door Towards evening on the same day Hobotov in his sheepskin and his high top boots suddenly made his appearance and said to Andrey Yefimitch in a tone as though nothing had happened the day before I have come on business colleague I have come to ask you whether you would not join me in a consultation Eh Thinking that Hobotov wanted to distract his mind with an outing or perhaps really to enable him to earn something Andrey Yefimitch put on his coat and hat and went out with him into the street He was glad of the opportunity to smooth over his fault of the previous day and to be reconciled and in his heart thanked Hobotov who did not even allude to yesterday s scene and was evidently sparing him One would never have expected such delicacy from this uncultured man Where is your invalid asked Andrey Yefimitch In the hospital I have long wanted to show him to you A very interesting case They went into the hospital yard and going round the main building turned towards the lodge where the mental cases were kept and all this for some reason in silence When they went into the lodge Nikita as usual jumped up and stood at attention One of the patients here has a lung complication Hobotov said in an undertone going into the yard with Andrey Yefimitch You wait here I ll be back directly I am going for a stethoscope And he went away XVII It was getting dusk Ivan Dmitritch was lying on his bed with his face thrust unto his pillow the paralytic was sitting motionless crying quietly and moving his lips The fat peasant and the former sorter were asleep It was quiet Andrey Yefimitch sat down on Ivan Dmitritch s bed and waited But half an hour passed and instead of Hobotov Nikita came into the ward with a dressing gown some underlinen and a pair of slippers in a heap on his arm Please change your things your honour he said softly Here is your bed come this way he added pointing to an empty bedstead which had obviously recently been brought into the ward It s all right please God you will recover Andrey Yefimitch understood it all Without saying a word he crossed to the bed to which Nikita pointed and sat down seeing that Nikita was standing waiting he undressed entirely and he felt ashamed Then he put on the hospital clothes the drawers were very short the shirt was long and the dressing gown smelt of smoked fish Please God you will recover repeated Nikita and he gathered up Andrey Yefimitch s clothes into his arms went out and shut the door after him No matter thought Andrey Yefimitch wrapping himself in his dressing gown in a shamefaced way and feeling that he looked like a convict in his new costume It s no matter It does not matter whether it s a dress coat or a uniform or this dressing gown But how about his watch And the notebook that was in the side pocket And his cigarettes Where had Nikita taken his clothes Now perhaps to the day of his death he would not put on trousers a waistcoat and high boots It was all somehow strange and even incomprehensible at first Andrey Yefimitch was even now convinced that there was no difference between his landlady s house and Ward No six that everything in this world was nonsense and vanity of vanities And yet his hands were trembling his feet were cold and he was filled with dread at the thought that soon Ivan Dmitritch would get up and see that he was in a dressing gown He got up and walked across the room and sat down again Here he had been sitting already half an hour an hour and he was miserably sick of it was it really possible to live here a day a week and even years like these people Why he had been sitting here had walked about and sat down again he could get up and look out of window and walk from corner to corner again and then what Sit so all the time like a post and think No that was scarcely possible Andrey Yefimitch lay down but at once got up wiped the cold sweat from his brow with his sleeve and felt that his whole face smelt of smoked fish He walked about again It s some misunderstanding he said turning out the palms of his hands in perplexity It must be cleared up There is a misunderstanding Meanwhile Ivan Dmitritch woke up he sat up and propped his cheeks on his fists He spat Then he glanced lazily at the doctor and apparently for the first minute did not understand but soon his sleepy face grew malicious and mocking Aha so they have put you in here too old fellow he said in a voice husky from sleepiness screwing up one eye Very glad to see you You sucked the blood of others and now they will suck yours Excellent It s a misunderstanding Andrey Yefimitch brought out frightened by Ivan Dmitritch s words he shrugged his shoulders and repeated It s some misunderstanding Ivan Dmitritch spat again and lay down Cursed life he grumbled and what s bitter and insulting this life will not end in compensation for our sufferings it will not end with apotheosis as it would in an opera but with death peasants will come and drag one s dead body by the arms and the legs to the cellar Ugh Well it does not matter We shall have our good time in the other world I shall come here as a ghost from the other world and frighten these reptiles I ll turn their hair grey Moiseika returned and seeing the doctor held out his hand Give me one little kopeck he said XVIII Andrey Yefimitch walked away to the window and looked out into the open country It was getting dark and on the horizon to the right a cold crimson moon was mounting upwards Not far from the hospital fence not much more than two hundred yards away stood a tall white house shut in by a stone wall This was the prison So this is real life thought Andrey Yefimitch and he felt frightened The moon and the prison and the nails on the fence and the far away flames at the bone charring factory were all terrible Behind him there was the sound of a sigh Andrey Yefimitch looked round and saw a man with glittering stars and orders on his breast who was smiling and slyly winking And this too seemed terrible Andrey Yefimitch assured himself that there was nothing special about the moon or the prison that even sane persons wear orders and that everything in time will decay and turn to earth but he was suddenly overcome with desire he clutched at the grating with both hands and shook it with all his might The strong grating did not yield Then that it might not be so dreadful he went to Ivan Dmitritch s bed and sat down I have lost heart my dear fellow he muttered trembling and wiping away the cold sweat I have lost heart You should be philosophical said Ivan Dmitritch ironically My God my God Yes yes You were pleased to say once that there was no philosophy in Russia but that all people even the paltriest talk philosophy But you know the philosophizing of the paltriest does not harm anyone said Andrey Yefimitch in a tone as if he wanted to cry and complain Why then that malignant laugh my friend and how can these paltry creatures help philosophizing if they are not satisfied For an intelligent educated man made in God s image proud and loving freedom to have no alternative but to be a doctor in a filthy stupid wretched little town and to spend his whole life among bottles leeches mustard plasters Quackery narrowness vulgarity Oh my God You are talking nonsense If you don t like being a doctor you should have gone in for being a statesman I could not I could not do anything We are weak my dear friend I used to be indifferent I reasoned boldly and soundly but at the first coarse touch of life upon me I have lost heart Prostration We are weak we are poor creatures and you too my dear friend you are intelligent generous you drew in good impulses with your mother s milk but you had hardly entered upon life when you were exhausted and fell ill Weak weak Andrey Yefimitch was all the while at the approach of evening tormented by another persistent sensation besides terror and the feeling of resentment At last he realized that he was longing for a smoke and for beer I am going out my friend he said I will tell them to bring a light I can t put up with this I am not equal to it Andrey Yefimitch went to the door and opened it but at once Nikita jumped up and barred his way Where are you going You can t you can t he said It s bedtime But I m only going out for a minute to walk about the yard said Andrey Yefimitch You can t you can t it s forbidden You know that yourself But what difference will it make to anyone if I do go out asked Andrey Yefimitch shrugging his shoulders I don t understand Nikita I must go out he said in a trembling voice I must Don t be disorderly it s not right Nikita said peremptorily This is beyond everything Ivan Dmitritch cried suddenly and he jumped up What right has he not to let you out How dare they keep us here I believe it is clearly laid down in the law that no one can be deprived of freedom without trial It s an outrage It s tyranny Of course it s tyranny said Andrey Yefimitch encouraged by Ivan Dmitritch s outburst I must go out I want to He has no right Open I tell you Do you hear you dull witted brute cried Ivan Dmitritch and he banged on the door with his fist Open the door or I will break it open Torturer Open the door cried Andrey Yefimitch trembling all over I insist Talk away Nikita answered through the door talk away Anyhow go and call Yevgeny Fyodoritch Say that I beg him to come for a minute His honour will come of himself to morrow They will never let us out Ivan Dmitritch was going on meanwhile They will leave us to rot here Oh Lord can there really be no hell in the next world and will these wretches be forgiven Where is justice Open the door you wretch I am choking he cried in a hoarse voice and flung himself upon the door I ll dash out my brains murderers Nikita opened the door quickly and roughly with both his hands and his knee shoved Andrey Yefimitch back then swung his arm and punched him in the face with his fist It seemed to Andrey Yefimitch as though a huge salt wave enveloped him from his head downwards and dragged him to the bed there really was a salt taste in his mouth most likely the blood was running from his teeth He waved his arms as though he were trying to swim out and clutched at a bedstead and at the same moment felt Nikita hit him twice on the back Ivan Dmitritch gave a loud scream He must have been beaten too Then all was still the faint moonlight came through the grating and a shadow like a net lay on the floor It was terrible Andrey Yefimitch lay and held his breath he was expecting with horror to be struck again He felt as though someone had taken a sickle thrust it into him and turned it round several times in his breast and bowels He bit the pillow from pain and clenched his teeth and all at once through the chaos in his brain there flashed the terrible unbearable thought that these people who seemed now like black shadows in the moonlight had to endure such pain day by day for years How could it have happened that for more than twenty years he had not known it and had refused to know it He knew nothing of pain had no conception of it so he was not to blame but his conscience as inexorable and as rough as Nikita made him turn cold from the crown of his head to his heels He leaped up tried to cry out with all his might and to run in haste to kill Nikita and then Hobotov the superintendent and the assistant and then himself but no sound came from his chest and his legs would not obey him Gasping for breath he tore at the dressing gown and the shirt on his breast rent them and fell senseless on the bed XIX Next morning his head ached there was a droning in his ears and a feeling of utter weakness all over He was not ashamed at recalling his weakness the day before He had been cowardly had even been afraid of the moon had openly expressed thoughts and feelings such as he had not expected in himself before for instance the thought that the paltry people who philosophized were really dissatisfied But now nothing mattered to him He ate nothing he drank nothing He lay motionless and silent It is all the same to me he thought when they asked him questions I am not going to answer It s all the same to me After dinner Mihail Averyanitch brought him a quarter pound of tea and a pound of fruit pastilles Daryushka came too and stood for a whole hour by the bed with an expression of dull grief on her face doctor Hobotov visited him He brought a bottle of bromide and told Nikita to fumigate the ward with something Towards evening Andrey Yefimitch died of an apoplectic stroke At first he had a violent shivering fit and a feeling of sickness something revolting as it seemed penetrating through his whole body even to his finger tips strained from his stomach to his head and flooded his eyes and ears There was a greenness before his eyes Andrey Yefimitch understood that his end had come and remembered that Ivan Dmitritch Mihail Averyanitch and millions of people believed in immortality And what if it really existed But he did not want immortality and he thought of it only for one instant A herd of deer extraordinarily beautiful and graceful of which he had been reading the day before ran by him then a peasant woman stretched out her hand to him with a registered letter Mihail Averyanitch said something then it all vanished and Andrey Yefimitch sank into oblivion for ever The hospital porters came took him by his arms and legs and carried him away to the chapel There he lay on the table with open eyes and the moon shed its light upon him at night In the morning Sergey Sergeyitch came prayed piously before the crucifix and closed his former chief s eyes Next day Andrey Yefimitch was buried Mihail Averyanitch and Daryushka were the only people at the funeral THE PETCHENYEG IVAN ABRAMITCH ZHMUHIN a retired Cossack officer who had once served in the Caucasus but now lived on his own farm and who had once been young strong and vigorous but now was old dried up and bent with shaggy eyebrows and a greenish grey moustache was returning from the town to his farm one hot summer s day In the town he had confessed and received absolution and had made his will at the notary s a fortnight before he had had a slight stroke and now all the while he was in the railway carriage he was haunted by melancholy serious thoughts of approaching death of the vanity of vanities of the transitoriness of all things earthly At the station of Provalye there is such a one on the Donetz line a fair haired plump middle aged gentleman with a shabby portfolio stepped into the carriage and sat down opposite They got into conversation Yes said Ivan Abramitch looking pensively out of window it is never too late to marry I myself married when I was forty eight I was told it was late but it has turned out that it was not late or early but simply that it would have been better not to marry at all Everyone is soon tired of his wife but not everyone tells the truth because you know people are ashamed of an unhappy home life and conceal it It s Manya this and Manya that with many a man by his wife s side but if he had his way he d put that Manya in a sack and drop her in the water It s dull with one s wife it s mere foolishness And it s no better with one s children I make bold to assure you I have two of them the rascals There s nowhere for them to be taught out here in the steppe I haven t the money to send them to school in Novo Tcherkask and they live here like young wolves Next thing they will be murdering someone on the highroad The fair haired gentleman listened attentively answered questions briefly in a low voice and was apparently a gentleman of gentle and modest disposition He mentioned that he was a lawyer and that he was going to the village Dyuevka on business Why merciful heavens that is six miles from me said Zhmuhin in a tone of voice as though someone were disputing with him But excuse me you won t find horses at the station now To my mind the very best thing you can do you know is to come straight to me stay the night you know and in the morning drive over with my horses The lawyer thought a moment and accepted the invitation When they reached the station the sun was already low over the steppe They said nothing all the way from the station to the farm the jolting prevented conversation The trap bounded up and down squeaked and seemed to be sobbing and the lawyer who was sitting very uncomfortably stared before him miserably hoping to see the farm After they had driven five or six miles there came into view in the distance a low pitched house and a yard enclosed by a fence made of dark flat stones standing on end the roof was green the stucco was peeling off and the windows were little narrow slits like screwed up eyes The farm stood in the full sunshine and there was no sign either of water or trees anywhere round Among the neighbouring landowners and the peasants it was known as the Petchenyegs farm Many years before a land surveyor who was passing through the neighbourhood and put up at the farm spent the whole night talking to Ivan Abramitch was not favourably impressed and as he was driving away in the morning said to him grimly You are a Petchenyeg my good sir The Petchenyegs were a tribe of wild Mongolian nomads who made frequent inroads upon the Russians in the tenth and eleventh centuries Translator s Note From this came the nickname the Petchenyegs farm which stuck to the place even more when Zhmuhin s boys grew up and began to make raids on the orchards and kitchen gardens Ivan Abramitch was called You Know as he usually talked a very great deal and frequently made use of that expression In the yard near a barn Zhmuhin s sons were standing one a young man of nineteen the other a younger lad both barefoot and bareheaded Just at the moment when the trap drove into the yard the younger one flung high up a hen which cackling described an arc in the air the elder shot at it with a gun and the hen fell dead on the earth Those are my boys learning to shoot birds flying said Zhmuhin In the entry the travellers were met by a little thin woman with a pale face still young and beautiful from her dress she might have been taken for a servant And this allow me to introduce her said Zhmuhin is the mother of my young cubs Come Lyubov Osipovna he said addressing her you must be spry mother and get something for our guest Let us have supper Look sharp The house consisted of two parts in one was the parlour and beside it old Zhmuhin s bedroom both stuffy rooms with low ceilings and multitudes of flies and wasps and in the other was the kitchen in which the cooking and washing was done and the labourers had their meals here geese and turkey hens were sitting on their eggs under the benches and here were the beds of Lyubov Osipovna and her two sons The furniture in the parlour was unpainted and evidently roughly made by a carpenter guns game bags and whips were hanging on the walls and all this old rubbish was covered with the rust of years and looked grey with dust There was not one picture in the corner was a dingy board which had at one time been an ikon A young Little Russian woman laid the table and handed ham then beetroot soup The visitor refused vodka and ate only bread and cucumbers How about ham asked Zhmuhin Thank you I don t eat it answered the visitor I don t eat meat at all Why is that I am a vegetarian Killing animals is against my principles Zhmuhin thought a minute and then said slowly with a sigh Yes to be sure I saw a man who did not eat meat in town too It s a new religion they ve got now Well it s good We can t go on always shooting and slaughtering you know we must give it up some day and leave even the beasts in peace It s a sin to kill it s a sin there is no denying it Sometimes one kills a hare and wounds him in the leg and he cries like a child So it must hurt him Of course it hurts him animals suffer just like human beings That s true Zhmuhin assented I understand that very well he went on musing only there is this one thing I don t understand suppose you know everyone gave up eating meat what would become of the domestic animals fowls and geese for instance Fowls and geese would live in freedom like wild birds Now I understand To be sure crows and jackdaws get on all right without us Yes Fowls and geese and hares and sheep all will live in freedom rejoicing you know and praising God and they will not fear us peace and concord will come Only there is one thing you know I can t understand Zhmuhin went on glancing at the ham How will it be with the pigs What is to be done with them They will be like all the rest that is they will live in freedom Ah Yes But allow me to say if they were not slaughtered they would multiply you know and then good bye to the kitchen gardens and the meadows Why a pig if you let it free and don t look after it will ruin everything in a day A pig is a pig and it is not for nothing it is called a pig They finished supper Zhmuhin got up from the table and for a long while walked up and down the room talking and talking He was fond of talking of something important or serious and was fond of meditating and in his old age he had a longing to reach some haven to be reassured that he might not be so frightened of dying He had a longing for meekness spiritual calm and confidence in himself such as this guest of theirs had who had satisfied his hunger on cucumbers and bread and believed that doing so made him more perfect he was sitting on a chest plump and healthy keeping silent and patiently enduring his boredom and in the dusk when one glanced at him from the entry he looked like a big round stone which one could not move from its place If a man has something to lay hold of in life he is all right Zhmuhin went through the entry to the porch and then he could be heard sighing and saying reflectively to himself Yes To be sure By now it was dark and here and there stars could be seen in the sky They had not yet lighted up indoors Someone came into the parlour as noiselessly as a shadow and stood still near the door It was Lyubov Osipovna Zhmuhin s wife Are you from the town she asked timidly not looking at her visitor Yes I live in the town Perhaps you are something in the learned way sir be so kind as to advise us We ought to send in a petition To whom asked the visitor We have two sons kind gentleman and they ought to have been sent to school long ago but we never see anyone and have no one to advise us And I know nothing For if they are not taught they will have to serve in the army as common Cossacks It s not right sir They can t read and write they are worse than peasants and Ivan Abramitch himself can t stand them and won t let them indoors But they are not to blame The younger one at any rate ought to be sent to school it is such a pity she said slowly and there was a quiver in her voice and it seemed incredible that a woman so small and so youthful could have grown up children Oh it s such a pity You don t know anything about it mother and it is not your affair said Zhmuhin appearing in the doorway Don t pester our guest with your wild talk Go away mother Lyubov Osipovna went out and in the entry repeated once more in a thin little voice Oh it s such a pity A bed was made up for the visitor on the sofa in the parlour and that it might not be dark for him they lighted the lamp before the ikon Zhmuhin went to bed in his own room And as he lay there he thought of his soul of his age of his recent stroke which had so frightened him and made him think of death He was fond of philosophizing when he was in quietness by himself and then he fancied that he was a very earnest deep thinker and that nothing in this world interested him but serious questions And now he kept thinking and he longed to pitch upon some one significant thought unlike others which would be a guide to him in life and he wanted to think out principles of some sort for himself so as to make his life as deep and earnest as he imagined that he felt himself to be It would be a good thing for an old man like him to abstain altogether from meat from superfluities of all sorts The time when men give up killing each other and animals would come sooner or later it could not but be so and he imagined that time to himself and clearly pictured himself living in peace with all the animals and suddenly he thought again of the pigs and everything was in a tangle in his brain It s a queer business Lord have mercy upon us he muttered sighing heavily Are you asleep he asked No Zhmuhin got out of bed and stopped in the doorway with nothing but his shirt on displaying to his guest his sinewy legs that looked as dry as sticks Nowadays you know he began all sorts of telegraphs telephones and marvels of all kinds in fact have come in but people are no better than they were They say that in our day thirty or forty years ago men were coarse and cruel but isn t it just the same now We certainly did not stand on ceremony in our day I remember in the Caucasus when we were stationed by a little river with nothing to do for four whole months I was an under officer at that time something queer happened quite in the style of a novel Just on the banks of that river you know where our division was encamped a wretched prince whom we had killed not long before was buried And at night you know the princess used to come to his grave and weep She would wail and wail and moan and moan and make us so depressed we couldn t sleep and that s the fact We couldn t sleep one night we couldn t sleep a second well we got sick of it And from a common sense point of view you really can t go without your sleep for the devil knows what excuse the expression We took that princess and gave her a good thrashing and she gave up coming There s an instance for you Nowadays of course there is not the same class of people and they are not given to thrashing and they live in cleaner style and there is more learning but you know the soul is just the same there is no change Now look here there s a landowner living here among us he has mines you know all sorts of tramps without passports who don t know where to go work for him On Saturdays he has to settle up with the workmen but he doesn t care to pay them you know he grudges the money So he s got hold of a foreman who is a tramp too though he does wear a hat Don t you pay them anything he says not a kopeck they ll beat you and let them beat you says he but you put up with it and I ll pay you ten roubles every Saturday for it So on the Saturday evening the workmen come to settle up in the usual way the foreman says to them Nothing Well word for word as the master said they begin swearing and using their fists They beat him and they kick him you know they are a set of men brutalized by hunger they beat him till he is senseless and then they go each on his way The master gives orders for cold water to be poured on the foreman then flings ten roubles in his face And he takes it and is pleased too for indeed he d be ready to be hanged for three roubles let alone ten Yes and on Monday a new gang of workmen arrive they work for they have nowhere to go On Saturday it is the same story over again The visitor turned over on the other side with his face to the back of the sofa and muttered something And here s another instance Zhmuhin went on We had the Siberian plague here you know the cattle die off like flies I can tell you and the veterinary surgeons came here and strict orders were given that the dead cattle were to be buried at a distance deep in the earth that lime was to be thrown over them and so on you know on scientific principles My horse died too I buried it with every precaution and threw over three hundredweight of lime over it And what do you think My fine fellows my precious sons I mean dug it up skinned it and sold the hide for three roubles there s an instance for you So people have grown no better and however you feed a wolf he will always look towards the forest there it is It gives one something to think about eh How do you look at it On one side a flash of lightning gleamed through a chink in the window blinds There was the stifling feeling of a storm coming the gnats were biting and Zhmuhin as he lay in his bedroom meditating sighed and groaned and said to himself Yes to be sure and there was no possibility of getting to sleep Somewhere far far away there was a growl of thunder Are you asleep No answered the visitor Zhmuhin got up and thudding with his heels walked through the parlour and the entry to the kitchen to get a drink of water The worst thing in the world you know is stupidity he said a little later coming back with a dipper My Lyubov Osipovna is on her knees saying her prayers She prays every night you know and bows down to the ground first that her children may be sent to school she is afraid her boys will go into the army as simple Cossacks and that they will be whacked across their backs with sabres But for teaching one must have money and where is one to get it You may break the floor beating your head against it but if you haven t got it you haven t And the other reason she prays is because you know every woman imagines there is no one in the world as unhappy as she is I am a plain spoken man and I don t want to conceal anything from you She comes of a poor family a village priest s daughter I married her when she was seventeen and they accepted my offer chiefly because they hadn t enough to eat it was nothing but poverty and misery while I have anyway land you see a farm and after all I am an officer it was a step up for her to marry me you know On the very first day when she was married she cried and she has been crying ever since all these twenty years she has got a watery eye And she s always sitting and thinking and what do you suppose she is thinking about What can a woman think about Why nothing I must own I don t consider a woman a human being The visitor got up abruptly and sat on the bed Excuse me I feel stifled he said I will go outside Zhmuhin still talking about women drew the bolt in the entry and they both went out A full moon was floating in the sky just over the yard and in the moonlight the house and barn looked whiter than by day and on the grass brilliant streaks of moonlight white too stretched between the black shadows Far away on the right could be seen the steppe above it the stars were softly glowing and it was all mysterious infinitely far away as though one were gazing into a deep abyss while on the left heavy storm clouds black as soot were piling up one upon another above the steppe their edges were lighted up by the moon and it looked as though there were mountains there with white snow on their peaks dark forests the sea There was a flash of lightning a faint rumble of thunder and it seemed as though a battle were being fought in the mountains Quite close to the house a little night owl screeched monotonously Asleep asleep What time is it now asked the visitor Just after one How long it is still to dawn They went back to the house and lay down again It was time to sleep and one can usually sleep so splendidly before rain but the old man had a hankering after serious weighty thoughts he wanted not simply to think but to meditate and he meditated how good it would be as death was near at hand for the sake of his soul to give up the idleness which so imperceptibly swallowed up day after day year after year leaving no trace to think out for himself some great exploit for instance to walk on foot far far away or to give up meat like this young man And again he pictured to himself the time when animals would not be killed pictured it clearly and distinctly as though he were living through that time himself but suddenly it was all in a tangle again in his head and all was muddled The thunderstorm had passed over but from the edges of the storm clouds came rain softly pattering on the roof Zhmuhin got up stretching and groaning with old age and looked into the parlour Noticing that his visitor was not asleep he said When we were in the Caucasus you know there was a colonel there who was a vegetarian too he didn t eat meat never went shooting and would not let his servants catch fish Of course I understand that every animal ought to live in freedom and enjoy its life only I don t understand how a pig can go about where it likes without being looked after The visitor got up and sat down His pale haggard face expressed weariness and vexation it was evident that he was exhausted and only his gentleness and the delicacy of his soul prevented him from expressing his vexation in words It s getting light he said mildly Please have the horse brought round for me Why so Wait a little and the rain will be over No I entreat you said the visitor in horror with a supplicating voice it is essential for me to go at once And he began hurriedly dressing By the time the horse was harnessed the sun was rising It had just left off raining the clouds were racing swiftly by and the patches of blue were growing bigger and bigger in the sky The first rays of the sun were timidly reflected below in the big puddles The visitor walked through the entry with his portfolio to get into the trap and at that moment Zhmuhin s wife pale and it seemed paler than the day before with tear stained eyes looked at him intently without blinking with the naive expression of a little girl and it was evident from her dejected face that she was envying him his freedom oh with what joy she would have gone away from there and she wanted to say something to him most likely to ask advice about her children And what a pitiable figure she was This was not a wife not the head of a house not even a servant but more like a dependent a poor relation not wanted by anyone a nonentity Her husband fussing about talking unceasingly was seeing his visitor off continually running in front of him while she huddled up to the wall with a timid guilty air waiting for a convenient minute to speak Please come again another time the old man kept repeating incessantly what we have we are glad to offer you know The visitor hurriedly got into the trap evidently with relief as though he were afraid every minute that they would detain him The trap lurched about as it had the day before squeaked and furiously rattled the pail that was tied on at the back He glanced round at Zhmuhin with a peculiar expression it looked as though he wanted to call him a Petchenyeg as the surveyor had once done or some such name but his gentleness got the upper hand He controlled himself and said nothing But in the gateway he suddenly could not restrain himself he got up and shouted loudly and angrily You have bored me to death And he disappeared through the gate Near the barn Zhmuhin s sons were standing the elder held a gun while the younger had in his hands a grey cockerel with a bright red comb The younger flung up the cockerel with all his might the bird flew upwards higher than the house and turned over in the air like a pigeon The elder boy fired and the cockerel fell like a stone The old man overcome with confusion not knowing how to explain the visitor s strange unexpected shout went slowly back into the house And sitting down at the table he spent a long while meditating on the intellectual tendencies of the day on the universal immorality on the telegraph on the telephone on velocipedes on how unnecessary it all was little by little he regained his composure then slowly had a meal drank five glasses of tea and lay down for a nap A DEAD BODY A STILL August night A mist is rising slowly from the fields and casting an opaque veil over everything within eyesight Lighted up by the moon the mist gives the impression at one moment of a calm boundless sea at the next of an immense white wall The air is damp and chilly Morning is still far off A step from the bye road which runs along the edge of the forest a little fire is gleaming A dead body covered from head to foot with new white linen is lying under a young oak tree A wooden ikon is lying on its breast Beside the corpse almost on the road sits the watch two peasants performing one of the most disagreeable and uninviting of peasants duties One a tall young fellow with a scarcely perceptible moustache and thick black eyebrows in a tattered sheepskin and bark shoes is sitting on the wet grass his feet stuck out straight in front of him and is trying to while away the time with work He bends his long neck and breathing loudly through his nose makes a spoon out of a big crooked bit of wood the other a little scraggy pock marked peasant with an aged face a scanty moustache and a little goat s beard sits with his hands dangling loose on his knees and without moving gazes listlessly at the light A small camp fire is lazily burning down between them throwing a red glow on their faces There is perfect stillness The only sounds are the scrape of the knife on the wood and the crackling of damp sticks in the fire Don t you go to sleep Syoma says the young man I I am not asleep stammers the goat beard That s all right It would be dreadful to sit here alone one would be frightened You might tell me something Syoma You are a queer fellow Syomushka Other people will laugh and tell a story and sing a song but you there is no making you out You sit like a scarecrow in the garden and roll your eyes at the fire You can t say anything properly when you speak you seem frightened I dare say you are fifty but you have less sense than a child Aren t you sorry that you are a simpleton I am sorry the goat beard answers gloomily And we are sorry to see your foolishness you may be sure You are a good natured sober peasant and the only trouble is that you have no sense in your head You should have picked up some sense for yourself if the Lord has afflicted you and given you no understanding You must make an effort Syoma You should listen hard when anything good s being said note it well and keep thinking and thinking If there is any word you don t understand you should make an effort and think over in your head in what meaning the word is used Do you see Make an effort If you don t gain some sense for yourself you ll be a simpleton and of no account at all to your dying day All at once a long drawn out moaning sound is heard in the forest Something rustles in the leaves as though torn from the very top of the tree and falls to the ground All this is faintly repeated by the echo The young man shudders and looks enquiringly at his companion It s an owl at the little birds says Syoma gloomily Why Syoma it s time for the birds to fly to the warm countries To be sure it is time It is chilly at dawn now It is company old The crane is a chilly creature it is tender Such cold is death to it I am not a crane but I am frozen Put some more wood on Syoma gets up and disappears in the dark undergrowth While he is busy among the bushes breaking dry twigs his companion puts his hand over his eyes and starts at every sound Syoma brings an armful of wood and lays it on the fire The flame irresolutely licks the black twigs with its little tongues then suddenly as though at the word of command catches them and throws a crimson light on the faces the road the white linen with its prominences where the hands and feet of the corpse raise it the ikon The watch is silent The young man bends his neck still lower and sets to work with still more nervous haste The goat beard sits motionless as before and keeps his eyes fixed on the fire Ye that love not Zion shall be put to shame by the Lord A falsetto voice is suddenly heard singing in the stillness of the night then slow footsteps are audible and the dark figure of a man in a short monkish cassock and a broad brimmed hat with a wallet on his shoulders comes into sight on the road in the crimson firelight Thy will be done O Lord Holy Mother the figure says in a husky falsetto I saw the fire in the outer darkness and my soul leapt for joy At first I thought it was men grazing a drove of horses then I thought it can t be that since no horses were to be seen Aren t they thieves I wondered aren t they robbers lying in wait for a rich Lazarus Aren t they the gypsy people offering sacrifices to idols And my soul leapt for joy Go Feodosy servant of God I said to myself and win a martyr s crown And I flew to the fire like a light winged moth Now I stand before you and from your outer aspect I judge of your souls you are not thieves and you are not heathens Peace be to you Good evening Good orthodox people do you know how to reach the Makuhinsky Brickyards from here It s close here You go straight along the road when you have gone a mile and a half there will be Ananova our village From the village father you turn to the right by the river bank and so you will get to the brickyards It s two miles from Ananova God give you health And why are you sitting here We are sitting here watching You see there is a dead body What what body Holy Mother The pilgrim sees the white linen with the ikon on it and starts so violently that his legs give a little skip This unexpected sight has an overpowering effect upon him He huddles together and stands as though rooted to the spot with wide open mouth and staring eyes For three minutes he is silent as though he could not believe his eyes then begins muttering O Lord Holy Mother I was going along not meddling with anyone and all at once such an affliction What may you be enquires the young man Of the clergy No no I go from one monastery to another Do you know Mi Mihail Polikarpitch the foreman of the brickyard Well I am his nephew Thy will be done O Lord Why are you here We are watching we are told to Yes yes mutters the man in the cassock passing his hand over his eyes And where did the deceased come from He was a stranger Such is life But I ll er be getting on brothers I feel flustered I am more afraid of the dead than of anything my dear souls And only fancy while this man was alive he wasn t noticed while now when he is dead and given over to corruption we tremble before him as before some famous general or a bishop Such is life was he murdered or what The Lord knows Maybe he was murdered or maybe he died of himself Yes yes Who knows brothers Maybe his soul is now tasting the joys of Paradise His soul is still hovering here near his body says the young man It does not depart from the body for three days H m yes How chilly the nights are now It sets one s teeth chattering So then I am to go straight on and on Till you get to the village and then you turn to the right by the river bank By the river bank To be sure Why am I standing still I must go on Farewell brothers The man in the cassock takes five steps along the road and stops I ve forgotten to put a kopeck for the burying he says Good orthodox friends can I give the money You ought to know best you go the round of the monasteries If he died a natural death it would go for the good of his soul if it s a suicide it s a sin That s true And maybe it really was a suicide So I had better keep my money Oh sins sins Give me a thousand roubles and I would not consent to sit here Farewell brothers The cassock slowly moves away and stops again I can t make up my mind what I am to do he mutters To stay here by the fire and wait till daybreak I am frightened to go on is dreadful too The dead man will haunt me all the way in the darkness The Lord has chastised me indeed Over three hundred miles I have come on foot and nothing happened and now I am near home and there s trouble I can t go on It is dreadful that is true I am not afraid of wolves of thieves or of darkness but I am afraid of the dead I am afraid of them and that is all about it Good orthodox brothers I entreat you on my knees see me to the village We ve been told not to go away from the body No one will see brothers Upon my soul no one will see The Lord will reward you a hundredfold Old man come with me I beg Old man Why are you silent He is a bit simple says the young man You come with me friend I will give you five kopecks For five kopecks I might says the young man scratching his head but I was told not to If Syoma here our simpleton will stay alone I will take you Syoma will you stay here alone I ll stay the simpleton consents Well that s all right then Come along The young man gets up and goes with the cassock A minute later the sound of their steps and their talk dies away Syoma shuts his eyes and gently dozes The fire begins to grow dim and a big black shadow falls on the dead body A HAPPY ENDING LYUBOV GRIGORYEVNA a substantial buxom lady of forty who undertook matchmaking and many other matters of which it is usual to speak only in whispers had come to see Stytchkin the head guard on a day when he was off duty Stytchkin somewhat embarrassed but as always grave practical and severe was walking up and down the room smoking a cigar and saying Very pleased to make your acquaintance Semyon Ivanovitch recommended you on the ground that you may be able to assist me in a delicate and very important matter affecting the happiness of my life I have Lyubov Grigoryevna reached the age of fifty two that is a period of life at which very many have already grown up children My position is a secure one Though my fortune is not large yet I am in a position to support a beloved being and children at my side I may tell you between ourselves that apart from my salary I have also money in the bank which my manner of living has enabled me to save I am a practical and sober man I lead a sensible and consistent life so that I may hold myself up as an example to many But one thing I lack a domestic hearth of my own and a partner in life and I live like a wandering Magyar moving from place to place without any satisfaction I have no one with whom to take counsel and when I am ill no one to give me water and so on Apart from that Lyubov Grigoryevna a married man has always more weight in society than a bachelor I am a man of the educated class with money but if you look at me from a point of view what am I A man with no kith and kin no better than some Polish priest And therefore I should be very desirous to be united in the bonds of Hymen that is to enter into matrimony with some worthy person An excellent thing said the matchmaker with a sigh I am a solitary man and in this town I know no one Where can I go and to whom can I apply since all the people here are strangers to me That is why Semyon Ivanovitch advised me to address myself to a person who is a specialist in this line and makes the arrangement of the happiness of others her profession And therefore I most earnestly beg you Lyubov Grigoryevna to assist me in ordering my future You know all the marriageable young ladies in the town and it is easy for you to accommodate me I can A glass of wine I beg you With an habitual gesture the matchmaker raised her glass to her mouth and tossed it off without winking I can she repeated And what sort of bride would you like Nikolay Nikolayitch Should I like The bride fate sends me Well of course it depends on your fate but everyone has his own taste you know One likes dark ladies the other prefers fair ones You see Lyubov Grigoryevna said Stytchkin sighing sedately I am a practical man and a man of character for me beauty and external appearance generally take a secondary place for as you know yourself beauty is neither bowl nor platter and a pretty wife involves a great deal of anxiety The way I look at it is what matters most in a woman is not what is external but what lies within that is that she should have soul and all the qualities A glass of wine I beg Of course it would be very agreeable that one s wife should be rather plump but for mutual happiness it is not of great consequence what matters is the mind Properly speaking a woman does not need mind either for if she has brains she will have too high an opinion of herself and take all sorts of ideas into her head One cannot do without education nowadays of course but education is of different kinds It would be pleasing for one s wife to know French and German to speak various languages very pleasing but what s the use of that if she can t sew on one s buttons perhaps I am a man of the educated class I am just as much at home I may say with Prince Kanitelin as I am with you here now But my habits are simple and I want a girl who is not too much a fine lady Above all she must have respect for me and feel that I have made her happiness To be sure Well now as regards the essential I do not want a wealthy bride I would never condescend to anything so low as to marry for money I desire not to be kept by my wife but to keep her and that she may be sensible of it But I do not want a poor girl either Though I am a man of means and am marrying not from mercenary motives but from love yet I cannot take a poor girl for as you know yourself prices have gone up so and there will be children One might find one with a dowry said the matchmaker A glass of wine I beg There was a pause of five minutes The matchmaker heaved a sigh took a sidelong glance at the guard and asked Well now my good sir do you want anything in the bachelor line I have some fine bargains One is a French girl and one is a Greek Well worth the money The guard thought a moment and said No I thank you In view of your favourable disposition allow me to enquire now how much you ask for your exertions in regard to a bride I don t ask much Give me twenty five roubles and the stuff for a dress as is usual and I will say thank you but for the dowry that s a different account Stytchkin folded his arms over his chest and fell to pondering in silence After some thought he heaved a sigh and said That s dear It s not at all dear Nikolay Nikolayitch In old days when there were lots of weddings one did do it cheaper but nowadays what are our earnings If you make fifty roubles in a month that is not a fast you may be thankful It s not on weddings we make our money my good sir Stytchkin looked at the matchmaker in amazement and shrugged his shoulders H m Do you call fifty roubles little he asked Of course it is little In old days we sometimes made more than a hundred H m I should never have thought it was possible to earn such a sum by these jobs Fifty roubles It is not every man that earns as much Pray drink your wine The matchmaker drained her glass without winking Stytchkin looked her over from head to foot in silence then said Fifty roubles Why that is six hundred roubles a year Please take some more With such dividends you know Lyubov Grigoryevna you would have no difficulty in making a match for yourself For myself laughed the matchmaker I am an old woman Not at all You have such a figure and your face is plump and fair and all the rest of it The matchmaker was embarrassed Stytchkin was also embarrassed and sat down beside her You are still very attractive said he if you met with a practical steady careful husband with his salary and your earnings you might even attract him very much and you d get on very well together Goodness knows what you are saying Nikolay Nikolayitch Well I meant no harm A silence followed Stytchkin began loudly blowing his nose while the matchmaker turned crimson and looking bashfully at him asked And how much do you get Nikolay Nikolayitch I Seventy five roubles besides tips Apart from that we make something out of candles and hares You go hunting then No Passengers who travel without tickets are called hares with us Another minute passed in silence Stytchkin got up and walked about the room in excitement I don t want a young wife said he I am a middle aged man and I want someone who as it might be like you staid and settled and a figure something like yours Goodness knows what you are saying giggled the matchmaker hiding her crimson face in her kerchief There is no need to be long thinking about it You are after my own heart and you suit me in your qualities I am a practical sober man and if you like me what could be better Allow me to make you a proposal The matchmaker dropped a tear laughed and in token of her consent clinked glasses with Stytchkin Well said the happy railway guard now allow me to explain to you the behaviour and manner of life I desire from you I am a strict respectable practical man I take a gentlemanly view of everything And I desire that my wife should be strict also and should understand that to her I am a benefactor and the foremost person in the world He sat down and heaving a deep sigh began expounding to his bride elect his views on domestic life and a wife s duties THE LOOKING GLASS NEW YEAR S EVE Nellie the daughter of a landowner and general a young and pretty girl dreaming day and night of being married was sitting in her room gazing with exhausted half closed eyes into the looking glass She was pale tense and as motionless as the looking glass The non existent but apparent vista of a long narrow corridor with endless rows of candles the reflection of her face her hands of the frame all this was already clouded in mist and merged into a boundless grey sea The sea was undulating gleaming and now and then flaring crimson Looking at Nellie s motionless eyes and parted lips one could hardly say whether she was asleep or awake but nevertheless she was seeing At first she saw only the smile and soft charming expression of someone s eyes then against the shifting grey background there gradually appeared the outlines of a head a face eyebrows beard It was he the destined one the object of long dreams and hopes The destined one was for Nellie everything the significance of life personal happiness career fate Outside him as on the grey background of the looking glass all was dark empty meaningless And so it was not strange that seeing before her a handsome gently smiling face she was conscious of bliss of an unutterably sweet dream that could not be expressed in speech or on paper Then she heard his voice saw herself living under the same roof with him her life merged into his Months and years flew by against the grey background And Nellie saw her future distinctly in all its details Picture followed picture against the grey background Now Nellie saw herself one winter night knocking at the door of Stepan Lukitch the district doctor The old dog hoarsely and lazily barked behind the gate The doctor s windows were in darkness All was silence For God s sake for God s sake whispered Nellie But at last the garden gate creaked and Nellie saw the doctor s cook Is the doctor at home His honour s asleep whispered the cook into her sleeve as though afraid of waking her master He s only just got home from his fever patients and gave orders he was not to be waked But Nellie scarcely heard the cook Thrusting her aside she rushed headlong into the doctor s house Running through some dark and stuffy rooms upsetting two or three chairs she at last reached the doctor s bedroom Stepan Lukitch was lying on his bed dressed but without his coat and with pouting lips was breathing into his open hand A little night light glimmered faintly beside him Without uttering a word Nellie sat down and began to cry She wept bitterly shaking all over My husband is ill she sobbed out Stepan Lukitch was silent He slowly sat up propped his head on his hand and looked at his visitor with fixed sleepy eyes My husband is ill Nellie continued restraining her sobs For mercy s sake come quickly Make haste Make haste Eh growled the doctor blowing into his hand Come Come this very minute Or it s terrible to think For mercy s sake And pale exhausted Nellie gasping and swallowing her tears began describing to the doctor her husband s illness her unutterable terror Her sufferings would have touched the heart of a stone but the doctor looked at her blew into his open hand and not a movement I ll come to morrow he muttered That s impossible cried Nellie I know my husband has typhus At once this very minute you are needed I er have only just come in muttered the doctor For the last three days I ve been away seeing typhus patients and I m exhausted and ill myself I simply can t Absolutely I ve caught it myself There And the doctor thrust before her eyes a clinical thermometer My temperature is nearly forty I absolutely can t I can scarcely sit up Excuse me I ll lie down The doctor lay down But I implore you doctor Nellie moaned in despair I beseech you Help me for mercy s sake Make a great effort and come I will repay you doctor Oh dear Why I have told you already Ah Nellie leapt up and walked nervously up and down the bedroom She longed to explain to the doctor to bring him to reason She thought if only he knew how dear her husband was to her and how unhappy she was he would forget his exhaustion and his illness But how could she be eloquent enough Go to the Zemstvo doctor she heard Stepan Lukitch s voice That s impossible He lives more than twenty miles from here and time is precious And the horses can t stand it It is thirty miles from us to you and as much from here to the Zemstvo doctor No it s impossible Come along Stepan Lukitch I ask of you an heroic deed Come perform that heroic deed Have pity on us It s beyond everything I m in a fever my head s in a whirl and she won t understand Leave me alone But you are in duty bound to come You cannot refuse to come It s egoism A man is bound to sacrifice his life for his neighbour and you you refuse to come I will summon you before the Court Nellie felt that she was uttering a false and undeserved insult but for her husband s sake she was capable of forgetting logic tact sympathy for others In reply to her threats the doctor greedily gulped a glass of cold water Nellie fell to entreating and imploring like the very lowest beggar At last the doctor gave way He slowly got up puffing and panting looking for his coat Here it is cried Nellie helping him Let me put it on to you Come along I will repay you All my life I shall be grateful to you But what agony After putting on his coat the doctor lay down again Nellie got him up and dragged him to the hall Then there was an agonizing to do over his goloshes his overcoat His cap was lost But at last Nellie was in the carriage with the doctor Now they had only to drive thirty miles and her husband would have a doctor s help The earth was wrapped in darkness One could not see one s hand before one s face A cold winter wind was blowing There were frozen lumps under their wheels The coachman was continually stopping and wondering which road to take Nellie and the doctor sat silent all the way It was fearfully jolting but they felt neither the cold nor the jolts Get on get on Nellie implored the driver At five in the morning the exhausted horses drove into the yard Nellie saw the familiar gates the well with the crane the long row of stables and barns At last she was at home Wait a moment I will be back directly she said to Stepan Lukitch making him sit down on the sofa in the dining room Sit still and wait a little and I ll see how he is going on On her return from her husband Nellie found the doctor lying down He was lying on the sofa and muttering Doctor please doctor Eh Ask Domna muttered Stepan Lukitch What They said at the meeting Vlassov said Who what And to her horror Nellie saw that the doctor was as delirious as her husband What was to be done I must go for the Zemstvo doctor she decided Then again there followed darkness a cutting cold wind lumps of frozen earth She was suffering in body and in soul and delusive nature has no arts no deceptions to compensate these sufferings Then she saw against the grey background how her husband every spring was in straits for money to pay the interest for the mortgage to the bank He could not sleep she could not sleep and both racked their brains till their heads ached thinking how to avoid being visited by the clerk of the Court She saw her children the everlasting apprehension of colds scarlet fever diphtheria bad marks at school separation Out of a brood of five or six one was sure to die The grey background was not untouched by death That might well be A husband and wife cannot die simultaneously Whatever happened one must bury the other And Nellie saw her husband dying This terrible event presented itself to her in every detail She saw the coffin the candles the deacon and even the footmarks in the hall made by the undertaker Why is it what is it for she asked looking blankly at her husband s face And all the previous life with her husband seemed to her a stupid prelude to this Something fell from Nellie s hand and knocked on the floor She started jumped up and opened her eyes wide One looking glass she saw lying at her feet The other was standing as before on the table She looked into the looking glass and saw a pale tear stained face There was no grey background now I must have fallen asleep she thought with a sigh of relief OLD AGE UZELKOV an architect with the rank of civil councillor arrived in his native town to which he had been invited to restore the church in the cemetery He had been born in the town had been at school had grown up and married in it But when he got out of the train he scarcely recognized it Everything was changed Eighteen years ago when he had moved to Petersburg the street boys used to catch marmots for instance on the spot where now the station was standing now when one drove into the chief street a hotel of four storeys stood facing one in old days there was an ugly grey fence just there but nothing neither fences nor houses had changed as much as the people From his enquiries of the hotel waiter Uzelkov learned that more than half of the people he remembered were dead reduced to poverty forgotten And do you remember Uzelkov he asked the old waiter about himself Uzelkov the architect who divorced his wife He used to have a house in Svirebeyevsky Street you must remember I don t remember sir How is it you don t remember The case made a lot of noise even the cabmen all knew about it Think now Shapkin the attorney managed my divorce for me the rascal the notorious cardsharper the fellow who got a thrashing at the club Ivan Nikolaitch Yes yes Well is he alive Is he dead Alive sir thank God He is a notary now and has an office He is very well off He has two houses in Kirpitchny Street His daughter was married the other day Uzelkov paced up and down the room thought a bit and in his boredom made up his mind to go and see Shapkin at his office When he walked out of the hotel and sauntered slowly towards Kirpitchny Street it was midday He found Shapkin at his office and scarcely recognized him From the once well made adroit attorney with a mobile insolent and always drunken face Shapkin had changed into a modest grey headed decrepit old man You don t recognize me you have forgotten me began Uzelkov I am your old client Uzelkov Uzelkov what Uzelkov Ah Shapkin remembered recognized and was struck all of a heap There followed a shower of exclamations questions recollections This is a surprise This is unexpected cackled Shapkin What can I offer you Do you care for champagne Perhaps you would like oysters My dear fellow I have had so much from you in my time that I can t offer you anything equal to the occasion Please don t put yourself out said Uzelkov I have no time to spare I must go at once to the cemetery and examine the church I have undertaken the restoration of it That s capital We ll have a snack and a drink and drive together I have capital horses I ll take you there and introduce you to the church warden I will arrange it all But why is it my angel you seem to be afraid of me and hold me at arm s length Sit a little nearer There is no need for you to be afraid of me nowadays He he At one time it is true I was a cunning blade a dog of a fellow no one dared approach me but now I am stiller than water and humbler than the grass I have grown old I am a family man I have children It s time I was dead The friends had lunch had a drink and with a pair of horses drove out of the town to the cemetery Yes those were times Shapkin recalled as he sat in the sledge When you remember them you simply can t believe in them Do you remember how you divorced your wife It s nearly twenty years ago and I dare say you have forgotten it all but I remember it as though I d divorced you yesterday Good Lord what a lot of worry I had over it I was a sharp fellow tricky and cunning a desperate character Sometimes I was burning to tackle some ticklish business especially if the fee were a good one as for instance in your case What did you pay me then Five or six thousand That was worth taking trouble for wasn t it You went off to Petersburg and left the whole thing in my hands to do the best I could and though Sofya Mihailovna your wife came only of a merchant family she was proud and dignified To bribe her to take the guilt on herself was difficult awfully difficult I would go to negotiate with her and as soon as she saw me she called to her maid Masha didn t I tell you not to admit that scoundrel Well I tried one thing and another I wrote her letters and contrived to meet her accidentally it was no use I had to act through a third person I had a lot of trouble with her for a long time and she only gave in when you agreed to give her ten thousand She couldn t resist ten thousand she couldn t hold out She cried she spat in my face but she consented she took the guilt on herself I thought it was fifteen thousand she had from me not ten said Uzelkov Yes yes fifteen I made a mistake said Shapkin in confusion It s all over and done with though it s no use concealing it I gave her ten and the other five I collared for myself I deceived you both It s all over and done with it s no use to be ashamed And indeed judge for yourself Boris Petrovitch weren t you the very person for me to get money out of You were a wealthy man and had everything you wanted Your marriage was an idle whim and so was your divorce You were making a lot of money I remember you made a scoop of twenty thousand over one contract Whom should I have fleeced if not you And I must own I envied you If you grabbed anything they took off their caps to you while they would thrash me for a rouble and slap me in the face at the club But there why recall it It is high time to forget it Tell me please how did Sofya Mihailovna get on afterwards With her ten thousand Very badly God knows what it was she lost her head perhaps or maybe her pride and her conscience tormented her at having sold her honour or perhaps she loved you but do you know she took to drink As soon as she got her money she was off driving about with officers It was drunkenness dissipation debauchery When she went to a restaurant with officers she was not content with port or anything light she must have strong brandy fiery stuff to stupefy her Yes she was eccentric I had a lot to put up with from her sometimes she would take offence at something and begin being hysterical And what happened afterwards One week passed and then another I was sitting at home writing something All at once the door opened and she walked in drunk Take back your cursed money she said and flung a roll of notes in my face So she could not keep it up I picked up the notes and counted them It was five hundred short of the ten thousand so she had only managed to get through five hundred Where did you put the money It s all ancient history there s no reason to conceal it now In my pocket of course Why do you look at me like that Wait a bit for what will come later It s a regular novel a pathological study A couple of months later I was going home one night in a nasty drunken condition I lighted a candle and lo and behold Sofya Mihailovna was sitting on my sofa and she was drunk too and in a frantic state as wild as though she had run out of Bedlam Give me back my money she said I have changed my mind if I must go to ruin I won t do it by halves I ll have my fling Be quick you scoundrel give me my money A disgraceful scene And you gave it her I gave her I remember ten roubles Oh How could you cried Uzelkov frowning If you couldn t or wouldn t have given it her you might have written to me And I didn t know I didn t know My dear fellow what use would it have been for me to write considering that she wrote to you herself when she was lying in the hospital afterwards Yes but I was so taken up then with my second marriage I was in such a whirl that I had no thoughts to spare for letters But you were an outsider you had no antipathy for Sofya why didn t you give her a helping hand You can t judge by the standards of to day Boris Petrovitch that s how we look at it now but at the time we thought very differently Now maybe I d give her a thousand roubles but then even that ten rouble note I did not give her for nothing It was a bad business We must forget it But here we are The sledge stopped at the cemetery gates Uzelkov and Shapkin got out of the sledge went in at the gate and walked up a long broad avenue The bare cherry trees and acacias the grey crosses and tombstones were silvered with hoar frost every little grain of snow reflected the bright sunny day There was the smell there always is in cemeteries the smell of incense and freshly dug earth Our cemetery is a pretty one said Uzelkov quite a garden Yes but it is a pity thieves steal the tombstones And over there beyond that iron monument on the right Sofya Mihailovna is buried Would you like to see The friends turned to the right and walked through the deep snow to the iron monument Here it is said Shapkin pointing to a little slab of white marble A lieutenant put the stone on her grave Uzelkov slowly took off his cap and exposed his bald head to the sun Shapkin looking at him took off his cap too and another bald patch gleamed in the sunlight There was the stillness of the tomb all around as though the air too were dead The friends looked at the grave pondered and said nothing She sleeps in peace said Shapkin breaking the silence It s nothing to her now that she took the blame on herself and drank brandy You must own Boris Petrovitch Own what Uzelkov asked gloomily Why However hateful the past it was better than this And Shapkin pointed to his grey head I used not to think of the hour of death I fancied I could have given death points and won the game if we had had an encounter but now But what s the good of talking Uzelkov was overcome with melancholy He suddenly had a passionate longing to weep as once he had longed for love and he felt those tears would have tasted sweet and refreshing A moisture came into his eyes and there was a lump in his throat but Shapkin was standing beside him and Uzelkov was ashamed to show weakness before a witness He turned back abruptly and went into the church Only two hours later after talking to the churchwarden and looking over the church he seized a moment when Shapkin was in conversation with the priest and hastened away to weep He stole up to the grave secretly furtively looking round him every minute The little white slab looked at him pensively mournfully and innocently as though a little girl lay under it instead of a dissolute divorced wife To weep to weep thought Uzelkov But the moment for tears had been missed though the old man blinked his eyes though he worked up his feelings the tears did not flow nor the lump come in his throat After standing for ten minutes with a gesture of despair Uzelkov went to look for Shapkin DARKNESS A YOUNG peasant with white eyebrows and eyelashes and broad cheekbones in a torn sheepskin and big black felt overboots waited till the Zemstvo doctor had finished seeing his patients and came out to go home from the hospital then he went up to him diffidently Please your honour he said What do you want The young man passed the palm of his hand up and over his nose looked at the sky and then answered Please your honour You ve got my brother Vaska the blacksmith from Varvarino in the convict ward here your honour Yes what then I am Vaska s brother you see Father has the two of us him Vaska and me Kirila besides us there are three sisters and Vaska s a married man with a little one There are a lot of us and no one to work In the smithy it s nearly two years now since the forge has been heated I am at the cotton factory I can t do smith s work and how can father work Let alone work he can t eat properly he can t lift the spoon to his mouth What do you want from me Be merciful Let Vaska go The doctor looked wonderingly at Kirila and without saying a word walked on The young peasant ran on in front and flung himself in a heap at his feet Doctor kind gentleman he besought him blinking and again passing his open hand over his nose Show heavenly mercy let Vaska go home We shall remember you in our prayers for ever Your honour let him go They are all starving Mother s wailing day in day out Vaska s wife s wailing it s worse than death I don t care to look upon the light of day Be merciful let him go kind gentleman Are you stupid or out of your senses asked the doctor angrily How can I let him go Why he is a convict Kirila began crying Let him go Tfoo queer fellow What right have I Am I a gaoler or what They brought him to the hospital for me to treat him but I have as much right to let him out as I have to put you in prison silly fellow But they have shut him up for nothing He was in prison a year before the trial and now there is no saying what he is there for It would have been a different thing if he had murdered someone let us say or stolen horses but as it is what is it all about Very likely but how do I come in They shut a man up and they don t know themselves what for He was drunk your honour did not know what he was doing and even hit father on the ear and scratched his own cheek on a branch and two of our fellows they wanted some Turkish tobacco you see began telling him to go with them and break into the Armenian s shop at night for tobacco Being drunk he obeyed them the fool They broke the lock you know got in and did no end of mischief they turned everything upside down broke the windows and scattered the flour about They were drunk that is all one can say Well the constable turned up and with one thing and another they took them off to the magistrate They have been a whole year in prison and a week ago on the Wednesday they were all three tried in the town A soldier stood behind them with a gun people were sworn in Vaska was less to blame than any but the gentry decided that he was the ringleader The other two lads were sent to prison but Vaska to a convict battalion for three years And what for One should judge like a Christian I have nothing to do with it I tell you again Go to the authorities I have been already I ve been to the court I have tried to send in a petition they wouldn t take a petition I have been to the police captain and I have been to the examining magistrate and everyone says It is not my business Whose business is it then But there is no one above you here in the hospital you do what you like your honour You simpleton sighed the doctor once the jury have found him guilty not the governor not even the minister could do anything let alone the police captain It s no good your trying to do anything And who judged him then The gentlemen of the jury They weren t gentlemen they were our peasants Andrey Guryev was one Aloshka Huk was one Well I am cold talking to you The doctor waved his hand and walked quickly to his own door Kirila was on the point of following him but seeing the door slam he stopped For ten minutes he stood motionless in the middle of the hospital yard and without putting on his cap stared at the doctor s house then he heaved a deep sigh slowly scratched himself and walked towards the gate To whom am I to go he muttered as he came out on to the road One says it is not his business another says it is not his business Whose business is it then No till you grease their hands you will get nothing out of them The doctor says that but he keeps looking all the while at my fist to see whether I am going to give him a blue note Well brother I ll go if it has to be to the governor Shifting from one foot to the other and continually looking round him in an objectless way he trudged lazily along the road and was apparently wondering where to go It was not cold and the snow faintly crunched under his feet Not more than half a mile in front of him the wretched little district town in which his brother had just been tried lay outstretched on the hill On the right was the dark prison with its red roof and sentry boxes at the corners on the left was the big town copse now covered with hoar frost It was still only an old man wearing a woman s short jacket and a huge cap was walking ahead coughing and shouting to a cow which he was driving to the town Good day grandfather said Kirila overtaking him Good day Are you driving it to the market No the old man answered lazily Are you a townsman They got into conversation Kirila told him what he had come to the hospital for and what he had been talking about to the doctor The doctor does not know anything about such matters that is a sure thing the old man said to him as they were both entering the town though he is a gentleman he is only taught to cure by every means but to give you real advice or let us say write out a petition for you that he cannot do There are special authorities to do that You have been to the justice of the peace and to the police captain they are no good for your business either Where am I to go The permanent member of the rural board is the chief person for peasants affairs Go to him mister Sineokov The one who is at Zolotovo Why yes at Zolotovo He is your chief man If it is anything that has to do with you peasants even the police captain has no authority against him It s a long way to go old man I dare say it s twelve miles and may be more One who needs something will go seventy That is so Should I send in a petition to him or what You will find out there If you should have a petition the clerk will write you one quick enough The permanent member has a clerk After parting from the old man Kirila stood still in the middle of the square thought a little and walked back out of the town He made up his mind to go to Zolotovo Five days later as the doctor was on his way home after seeing his patients he caught sight of Kirila again in his yard This time the young peasant was not alone but with a gaunt very pale old man who nodded his head without ceasing like a pendulum and mumbled with his lips Your honour I have come again to ask your gracious mercy began Kirila Here I have come with my father Be merciful let Vaska go The permanent member would not talk to me He said Go away Your honour the old man hissed in his throat raising his twitching eyebrows be merciful We are poor people we cannot repay your honour but if you graciously please Kiryushka or Vaska can repay you in work Let them work We will pay with work said Kirila and he raised his hand above his head as though he would take an oath Let him go They are starving they are crying day and night your honour The young peasant bent a rapid glance on his father pulled him by the sleeve and both of them as at the word of command fell at the doctor s feet The latter waved his hand in despair and without looking round walked quickly in at his door THE BEGGAR KIND sir be so good as to notice a poor hungry man I have not tasted food for three days I have not a five kopeck piece for a night s lodging I swear by God For five years I was a village schoolmaster and lost my post through the intrigues of the Zemstvo I was the victim of false witness I have been out of a place for a year now Skvortsov a Petersburg lawyer looked at the speaker s tattered dark blue overcoat at his muddy drunken eyes at the red patches on his cheeks and it seemed to him that he had seen the man before And now I am offered a post in the Kaluga province the beggar continued but I have not the means for the journey there Graciously help me I am ashamed to ask but I am compelled by circumstances Skvortsov looked at his goloshes of which one was shallow like a shoe while the other came high up the leg like a boot and suddenly remembered Listen the day before yesterday I met you in Sadovoy Street he said and then you told me not that you were a village schoolmaster but that you were a student who had been expelled Do you remember N o No that cannot be so the beggar muttered in confusion I am a village schoolmaster and if you wish it I can show you documents to prove it That s enough lies You called yourself a student and even told me what you were expelled for Do you remember Skvortsov flushed and with a look of disgust on his face turned away from the ragged figure It s contemptible sir he cried angrily It s a swindle I ll hand you over to the police damn you You are poor and hungry but that does not give you the right to lie so shamelessly The ragged figure took hold of the door handle and like a bird in a snare looked round the hall desperately I I am not lying he muttered I can show documents Who can believe you Skvortsov went on still indignant To exploit the sympathy of the public for village schoolmasters and students it s so low so mean so dirty It s revolting Skvortsov flew into a rage and gave the beggar a merciless scolding The ragged fellow s insolent lying aroused his disgust and aversion was an offence against what he Skvortsov loved and prized in himself kindliness a feeling heart sympathy for the unhappy By his lying by his treacherous assault upon compassion the individual had as it were defiled the charity which he liked to give to the poor with no misgivings in his heart The beggar at first defended himself protested with oaths then he sank into silence and hung his head overcome with shame Sir he said laying his hand on his heart I really was lying I am not a student and not a village schoolmaster All that s mere invention I used to be in the Russian choir and I was turned out of it for drunkenness But what can I do Believe me in God s name I can t get on without lying when I tell the truth no one will give me anything With the truth one may die of hunger and freeze without a night s lodging What you say is true I understand that but what am I to do What are you to do You ask what are you to do cried Skvortsov going close up to him Work that s what you must do You must work Work I know that myself but where can I get work Nonsense You are young strong and healthy and could always find work if you wanted to But you know you are lazy pampered drunken You reek of vodka like a pothouse You have become false and corrupt to the marrow of your bones and fit for nothing but begging and lying If you do graciously condescend to take work you must have a job in an office in the Russian choir or as a billiard marker where you will have a salary and have nothing to do But how would you like to undertake manual labour I ll be bound you wouldn t be a house porter or a factory hand You are too genteel for that What things you say really said the beggar and he gave a bitter smile How can I get manual work It s rather late for me to be a shopman for in trade one has to begin from a boy no one would take me as a house porter because I am not of that class And I could not get work in a factory one must know a trade and I know nothing Nonsense You always find some justification Wouldn t you like to chop wood I would not refuse to but the regular woodchoppers are out of work now Oh all idlers argue like that As soon as you are offered anything you refuse it Would you care to chop wood for me Certainly I will Very good we shall see Excellent We ll see Skvortsov in nervous haste and not without malignant pleasure rubbing his hands summoned his cook from the kitchen Here Olga he said to her take this gentleman to the shed and let him chop some wood The beggar shrugged his shoulders as though puzzled and irresolutely followed the cook It was evident from his demeanour that he had consented to go and chop wood not because he was hungry and wanted to earn money but simply from shame and amour propre because he had been taken at his word It was clear too that he was suffering from the effects of vodka that he was unwell and felt not the faintest inclination to work Skvortsov hurried into the dining room There from the window which looked out into the yard he could see the woodshed and everything that happened in the yard Standing at the window Skvortsov saw the cook and the beggar come by the back way into the yard and go through the muddy snow to the woodshed Olga scrutinized her companion angrily and jerking her elbow unlocked the woodshed and angrily banged the door open Most likely we interrupted the woman drinking her coffee thought Skvortsov What a cross creature she is Then he saw the pseudo schoolmaster and pseudo student seat himself on a block of wood and leaning his red cheeks upon his fists sink into thought The cook flung an axe at his feet spat angrily on the ground and judging by the expression of her lips began abusing him The beggar drew a log of wood towards him irresolutely set it up between his feet and diffidently drew the axe across it The log toppled and fell over The beggar drew it towards him breathed on his frozen hands and again drew the axe along it as cautiously as though he were afraid of its hitting his golosh or chopping off his fingers The log fell over again Skvortsov s wrath had passed off by now he felt sore and ashamed at the thought that he had forced a pampered drunken and perhaps sick man to do hard rough work in the cold Never mind let him go on he thought going from the dining room into his study I am doing it for his good An hour later Olga appeared and announced that the wood had been chopped up Here give him half a rouble said Skvortsov If he likes let him come and chop wood on the first of every month There will always be work for him On the first of the month the beggar turned up and again earned half a rouble though he could hardly stand From that time forward he took to turning up frequently and work was always found for him sometimes he would sweep the snow into heaps or clear up the shed at another he used to beat the rugs and the mattresses He always received thirty to forty kopecks for his work and on one occasion an old pair of trousers was sent out to him When he moved Skvortsov engaged him to assist in packing and moving the furniture On this occasion the beggar was sober gloomy and silent he scarcely touched the furniture walked with hanging head behind the furniture vans and did not even try to appear busy he merely shivered with the cold and was overcome with confusion when the men with the vans laughed at his idleness feebleness and ragged coat that had once been a gentleman s After the removal Skvortsov sent for him Well I see my words have had an effect upon you he said giving him a rouble This is for your work I see that you are sober and not disinclined to work What is your name Lushkov I can offer you better work not so rough Lushkov Can you write Yes sir Then go with this note to morrow to my colleague and he will give you some copying to do Work don t drink and don t forget what I said to you Good bye Skvortsov pleased that he had put a man in the path of rectitude patted Lushkov genially on the shoulder and even shook hands with him at parting Lushkov took the letter departed and from that time forward did not come to the back yard for work Two years passed One day as Skvortsov was standing at the ticket office of a theatre paying for his ticket he saw beside him a little man with a lambskin collar and a shabby cat s skin cap The man timidly asked the clerk for a gallery ticket and paid for it with kopecks Lushkov is it you asked Skvortsov recognizing in the little man his former woodchopper Well what are you doing Are you getting on all right Pretty well I am in a notary s office now I earn thirty five roubles Well thank God that s capital I rejoice for you I am very very glad Lushkov You know in a way you are my godson It was I who shoved you into the right way Do you remember what a scolding I gave you eh You almost sank through the floor that time Well thank you my dear fellow for remembering my words Thank you too said Lushkov If I had not come to you that day maybe I should be calling myself a schoolmaster or a student still Yes in your house I was saved and climbed out of the pit I am very very glad Thank you for your kind words and deeds What you said that day was excellent I am grateful to you and to your cook God bless that kind noble hearted woman What you said that day was excellent I am indebted to you as long as I live of course but it was your cook Olga who really saved me How was that Why it was like this I used to come to you to chop wood and she would begin Ah you drunkard You God forsaken man And yet death does not take you and then she would sit opposite me lamenting looking into my face and wailing You unlucky fellow You have no gladness in this world and in the next you will burn in hell poor drunkard You poor sorrowful creature and she always went on in that style you know How often she upset herself and how many tears she shed over me I can t tell you But what affected me most she chopped the wood for me Do you know sir I never chopped a single log for you she did it all How it was she saved me how it was I changed looking at her and gave up drinking I can t explain I only know that what she said and the noble way she behaved brought about a change in my soul and I shall never forget it It s time to go up though they are just going to ring the bell Lushkov bowed and went off to the gallery A STORY WITHOUT A TITLE IN the fifth century just as now the sun rose every morning and every evening retired to rest In the morning when the first rays kissed the dew the earth revived the air was filled with the sounds of rapture and hope while in the evening the same earth subsided into silence and plunged into gloomy darkness One day was like another one night like another From time to time a storm cloud raced up and there was the angry rumble of thunder or a negligent star fell out of the sky or a pale monk ran to tell the brotherhood that not far from the monastery he had seen a tiger and that was all and then each day was like the next The monks worked and prayed and their Father Superior played on the organ made Latin verses and wrote music The wonderful old man possessed an extraordinary gift He played on the organ with such art that even the oldest monks whose hearing had grown somewhat dull towards the end of their lives could not restrain their tears when the sounds of the organ floated from his cell When he spoke of anything even of the most ordinary things for instance of the trees of the wild beasts or of the sea they could not listen to him without a smile or tears and it seemed that the same chords vibrated in his soul as in the organ If he were moved to anger or abandoned himself to intense joy or began speaking of something terrible or grand then a passionate inspiration took possession of him tears came into his flashing eyes his face flushed and his voice thundered and as the monks listened to him they felt that their souls were spell bound by his inspiration at such marvellous splendid moments his power over them was boundless and if he had bidden his elders fling themselves into the sea they would all every one of them have hastened to carry out his wishes His music his voice his poetry in which he glorified God the heavens and the earth were a continual source of joy to the monks It sometimes happened that through the monotony of their lives they grew weary of the trees the flowers the spring the autumn their ears were tired of the sound of the sea and the song of the birds seemed tedious to them but the talents of their Father Superior were as necessary to them as their daily bread Dozens of years passed by and every day was like every other day every night was like every other night Except the birds and the wild beasts not one soul appeared near the monastery The nearest human habitation was far away and to reach it from the monastery or to reach the monastery from it meant a journey of over seventy miles across the desert Only men who despised life who had renounced it and who came to the monastery as to the grave ventured to cross the desert What was the amazement of the monks therefore when one night there knocked at their gate a man who turned out to be from the town and the most ordinary sinner who loved life Before saying his prayers and asking for the Father Superior s blessing this man asked for wine and food To the question how he had come from the town into the desert he answered by a long story of hunting he had gone out hunting had drunk too much and lost his way To the suggestion that he should enter the monastery and save his soul he replied with a smile I am not a fit companion for you When he had eaten and drunk he looked at the monks who were serving him shook his head reproachfully and said You don t do anything you monks You are good for nothing but eating and drinking Is that the way to save one s soul Only think while you sit here in peace eat and drink and dream of beatitude your neighbours are perishing and going to hell You should see what is going on in the town Some are dying of hunger others not knowing what to do with their gold sink into profligacy and perish like flies stuck in honey There is no faith no truth in men Whose task is it to save them Whose work is it to preach to them It is not for me drunk from morning till night as I am Can a meek spirit a loving heart and faith in God have been given you for you to sit here within four walls doing nothing The townsman s drunken words were insolent and unseemly but they had a strange effect upon the Father Superior The old man exchanged glances with his monks turned pale and said My brothers he speaks the truth you know Indeed poor people in their weakness and lack of understanding are perishing in vice and infidelity while we do not move as though it did not concern us Why should I not go and remind them of the Christ whom they have forgotten The townsman s words had carried the old man away The next day he took his staff said farewell to the brotherhood and set off for the town And the monks were left without music and without his speeches and verses They spent a month drearily then a second but the old man did not come back At last after three months had passed the familiar tap of his staff was heard The monks flew to meet him and showered questions upon him but instead of being delighted to see them he wept bitterly and did not utter a word The monks noticed that he looked greatly aged and had grown thinner his face looked exhausted and wore an expression of profound sadness and when he wept he had the air of a man who has been outraged The monks fell to weeping too and began with sympathy asking him why he was weeping why his face was so gloomy but he locked himself in his cell without uttering a word For seven days he sat in his cell eating and drinking nothing weeping and not playing on his organ To knocking at his door and to the entreaties of the monks to come out and share his grief with them he replied with unbroken silence At last he came out Gathering all the monks around him with a tear stained face and with an expression of grief and indignation he began telling them of what had befallen him during those three months His voice was calm and his eyes were smiling while he described his journey from the monastery to the town On the road he told them the birds sang to him the brooks gurgled and sweet youthful hopes agitated his soul he marched on and felt like a soldier going to battle and confident of victory he walked on dreaming and composed poems and hymns and reached the end of his journey without noticing it But his voice quivered his eyes flashed and he was full of wrath when he came to speak of the town and of the men in it Never in his life had he seen or even dared to imagine what he met with when he went into the town Only then for the first time in his life in his old age he saw and understood how powerful was the devil how fair was evil and how weak and faint hearted and worthless were men By an unhappy chance the first dwelling he entered was the abode of vice Some fifty men in possession of much money were eating and drinking wine beyond measure Intoxicated by the wine they sang songs and boldly uttered terrible revolting words such as a God fearing man could not bring himself to pronounce boundlessly free self confident and happy they feared neither God nor the devil nor death but said and did what they liked and went whither their lust led them And the wine clear as amber flecked with sparks of gold must have been irresistibly sweet and fragrant for each man who drank it smiled blissfully and wanted to drink more To the smile of man it responded with a smile and sparkled joyfully when they drank it as though it knew the devilish charm it kept hidden in its sweetness The old man growing more and more incensed and weeping with wrath went on to describe what he had seen On a table in the midst of the revellers he said stood a sinful half naked woman It was hard to imagine or to find in nature anything more lovely and fascinating This reptile young longhaired dark skinned with black eyes and full lips shameless and insolent showed her snow white teeth and smiled as though to say Look how shameless how beautiful I am Silk and brocade fell in lovely folds from her shoulders but her beauty would not hide itself under her clothes but eagerly thrust itself through the folds like the young grass through the ground in spring The shameless woman drank wine sang songs and abandoned herself to anyone who wanted her Then the old man wrathfully brandishing his arms described the horse races the bull fights the theatres the artists studios where they painted naked women or moulded them of clay He spoke with inspiration with sonorous beauty as though he were playing on unseen chords while the monks petrified greedily drank in his words and gasped with rapture After describing all the charms of the devil the beauty of evil and the fascinating grace of the dreadful female form the old man cursed the devil turned and shut himself up in his cell When he came out of his cell in the morning there was not a monk left in the monastery they had all fled to the town IN TROUBLE PYOTR SEMYONITCH the bank manager together with the book keeper his assistant and two members of the board were taken in the night to prison The day after the upheaval the merchant Avdeyev who was one of the committee of auditors was sitting with his friends in the shop saying So it is God s will it seems There is no escaping your fate Here to day we are eating caviare and to morrow for aught we know it will be prison beggary or maybe death Anything may happen Take Pyotr Semyonitch for instance He spoke screwing up his drunken eyes while his friends went on drinking eating caviare and listening Having described the disgrace and helplessness of Pyotr Semyonitch who only the day before had been powerful and respected by all Avdeyev went on with a sigh The tears of the mouse come back to the cat Serve them right the scoundrels They could steal the rooks so let them answer for it You d better look out Ivan Danilitch that you don t catch it too one of his friends observed What has it to do with me Why they were stealing and what were you auditors thinking about I ll be bound you signed the audit It s all very well to talk laughed Avdeyev Signed it indeed They used to bring the accounts to my shop and I signed them As though I understood Give me anything you like I ll scrawl my name to it If you were to write that I murdered someone I d sign my name to it I haven t time to go into it besides I can t see without my spectacles After discussing the failure of the bank and the fate of Pyotr Semyonitch Avdeyev and his friends went to eat pie at the house of a friend whose wife was celebrating her name day At the name day party everyone was discussing the bank failure Avdeyev was more excited than anyone and declared that he had long foreseen the crash and knew two years before that things were not quite right at the bank While they were eating pie he described a dozen illegal operations which had come to his knowledge If you knew why did you not give information asked an officer who was present I wasn t the only one the whole town knew of it laughed Avdeyev Besides I haven t the time to hang about the law courts damn them He had a nap after the pie and then had dinner then had another nap then went to the evening service at the church of which he was a warden after the service he went back to the name day party and played preference till midnight Everything seemed satisfactory But when Avdeyev hurried home after midnight the cook who opened the door to him looked pale and was trembling so violently that she could not utter a word His wife Elizaveta Trofimovna a flabby overfed woman with her grey hair hanging loose was sitting on the sofa in the drawing room quivering all over and vacantly rolling her eyes as though she were drunk Her elder son Vassily a high school boy pale too and extremely agitated was fussing round her with a glass of water What s the matter asked Avdeyev and looked angrily sideways at the stove his family was constantly being upset by the fumes from it The examining magistrate has just been with the police answered Vassily they ve made a search Avdeyev looked round him The cupboards the chests the tables everything bore traces of the recent search For a minute Avdeyev stood motionless as though petrified unable to understand then his whole inside quivered and seemed to grow heavy his left leg went numb and unable to endure his trembling he lay down flat on the sofa He felt his inside heaving and his rebellious left leg tapping against the back of the sofa In the course of two or three minutes he recalled the whole of his past but could not remember any crime deserving of the attention of the police It s all nonsense he said getting up They must have slandered me To morrow I must lodge a complaint of their having dared to do such a thing Next morning after a sleepless night Avdeyev as usual went to his shop His customers brought him the news that during the night the public prosecutor had sent the deputy manager and the head clerk to prison as well This news did not disturb Avdeyev He was convinced that he had been slandered and that if he were to lodge a complaint to day the examining magistrate would get into trouble for the search of the night before Between nine and ten o clock he hurried to the town hall to see the secretary who was the only educated man in the town council Vladimir Stepanitch what s this new fashion he said bending down to the secretary s ear People have been stealing but how do I come in What has it to do with me My dear fellow he whispered there has been a search at my house last night Upon my word Have they gone crazy Why touch me Because one shouldn t be a sheep the secretary answered calmly Before you sign you ought to look Look at what But if I were to look at those accounts for a thousand years I could not make head or tail of them It s all Greek to me I am no book keeper They used to bring them to me and I signed them Excuse me Apart from that you and your committee are seriously compromised You borrowed nineteen thousand from the bank giving no security Lord have mercy upon us cried Avdeyev in amazement I am not the only one in debt to the bank The whole town owes it money I pay the interest and I shall repay the debt What next And besides to tell the honest truth it wasn t I myself borrowed the money Pyotr Semyonitch forced it upon me Take it he said take it If you don t take it he said it means that you don t trust us and fight shy of us You take it he said and build your father a mill So I took it Well you see none but children or sheep can reason like that In any case signor you need not be anxious You can t escape trial of course but you are sure to be acquitted The secretary s indifference and calm tone restored Avdeyev s composure Going back to his shop and finding friends there he again began drinking eating caviare and airing his views He almost forgot the police search and he was only troubled by one circumstance which he could not help noticing his left leg was strangely numb and his stomach for some reason refused to do its work That evening destiny dealt another overwhelming blow at Avdeyev at an extraordinary meeting of the town council all members who were on the staff of the bank Avdeyev among them were asked to resign on the ground that they were charged with a criminal offence In the morning he received a request to give up immediately his duties as churchwarden After that Avdeyev lost count of the blows dealt him by fate and strange unprecedented days flitted rapidly by one after another and every day brought some new unexpected surprise Among other things the examining magistrate sent him a summons and he returned home after the interview insulted and red in the face He gave me no peace pestering me to tell him why I had signed I signed that s all about it I didn t do it on purpose They brought the papers to the shop and I signed them I am no great hand at reading writing Young men with unconcerned faces arrived sealed up the shop and made an inventory of all the furniture of the house Suspecting some intrigue behind this and as before unconscious of any wrongdoing Avdeyev in his mortification ran from one Government office to another lodging complaints He spent hours together in waiting rooms composed long petitions shed tears swore To his complaints the public prosecutor and the examining magistrate made the indifferent and rational reply Come to us when you are summoned we have not time to attend to you now While others answered It is not our business The secretary an educated man who Avdeyev thought might have helped him merely shrugged his shoulders and said It s your own fault You shouldn t have been a sheep The old man exerted himself to the utmost but his left leg was still numb and his digestion was getting worse and worse When he was weary of doing nothing and was getting poorer and poorer he made up his mind to go to his father s mill or to his brother and begin dealing in corn His family went to his father s and he was left alone The days flitted by one after another Without a family without a shop and without money the former churchwarden an honoured and respected man spent whole days going the round of his friends shops drinking eating and listening to advice In the mornings and in the evenings to while away the time he went to church Looking for hours together at the ikons he did not pray but pondered His conscience was clear and he ascribed his position to mistake and misunderstanding to his mind it was all due to the fact that the officials and the examining magistrates were young men and inexperienced It seemed to him that if he were to talk it over in detail and open his heart to some elderly judge everything would go right again He did not understand his judges and he fancied they did not understand him The days raced by and at last after protracted harassing delays the day of the trial came Avdeyev borrowed fifty roubles and providing himself with spirit to rub on his leg and a decoction of herbs for his digestion set off for the town where the circuit court was being held The trial lasted for ten days Throughout the trial Avdeyev sat among his companions in misfortune with the stolid composure and dignity befitting a respectable and innocent man who is suffering for no fault of his own he listened and did not understand a word He was in an antagonistic mood He was angry at being detained so long in the court at being unable to get Lenten food anywhere at his defending counsel s not understanding him and as he thought saying the wrong thing He thought that the judges did not understand their business They took scarcely any notice of Avdeyev they only addressed him once in three days and the questions they put to him were of such a character that Avdeyev raised a laugh in the audience each time he answered them When he tried to speak of the expenses he had incurred of his losses and of his meaning to claim his costs from the court his counsel turned round and made an incomprehensible grimace the public laughed and the judge announced sternly that that had nothing to do with the case The last words that he was allowed to say were not what his counsel had instructed him to say but something quite different which raised a laugh again During the terrible hour when the jury were consulting in their room he sat angrily in the refreshment bar not thinking about the jury at all He did not understand why they were so long deliberating when everything was so clear and what they wanted of him Getting hungry he asked the waiter to give him some cheap Lenten dish For forty kopecks they gave him some cold fish and carrots He ate it and felt at once as though the fish were heaving in a chilly lump in his stomach it was followed by flatulence heartburn and pain Afterwards as he listened to the foreman of the jury reading out the questions point by point there was a regular revolution taking place in his inside his whole body was bathed in a cold sweat his left leg was numb he did not follow understood nothing and suffered unbearably at not being able to sit or lie down while the foreman was reading At last when he and his companions were allowed to sit down the public prosecutor got up and said something unintelligible and all at once as though they had sprung out of the earth some police officers appeared on the scene with drawn swords and surrounded all the prisoners Avdeyev was told to get up and go Now he understood that he was found guilty and in charge of the police but he was not frightened nor amazed such a turmoil was going on in his stomach that he could not think about his guards So they won t let us go back to the hotel he asked one of his companions But I have three roubles and an untouched quarter of a pound of tea in my room there He spent the night at the police station all night he was aware of a loathing for fish and was thinking about the three roubles and the quarter of a pound of tea Early in the morning when the sky was beginning to turn blue he was told to dress and set off Two soldiers with bayonets took him to prison Never before had the streets of the town seemed to him so long and endless He walked not on the pavement but in the middle of the road in the muddy thawing snow His inside was still at war with the fish his left leg was numb he had forgotten his goloshes either in the court or in the police station and his feet felt frozen Five days later all the prisoners were brought before the court again to hear their sentence Avdeyev learnt that he was sentenced to exile in the province of Tobolsk And that did not frighten nor amaze him either He fancied for some reason that the trial was not yet over that there were more adjournments to come and that the final decision had not been reached yet He went on in the prison expecting this final decision every day Only six months later when his wife and his son Vassily came to say good bye to him and when in the wasted wretchedly dressed old woman he scarcely recognized his once fat and dignified Elizaveta Trofimovna and when he saw his son wearing a short shabby reefer jacket and cotton trousers instead of the high school uniform he realized that his fate was decided and that whatever new decision there might be his past would never come back to him And for the first time since the trial and his imprisonment the angry expression left his face and he wept bitterly FROST A POPULAR fete with a philanthropic object had been arranged on the Feast of Epiphany in the provincial town of N They had selected a broad part of the river between the market and the bishop s palace fenced it round with a rope with fir trees and with flags and provided everything necessary for skating sledging and tobogganing The festivity was organized on the grandest scale possible The notices that were distributed were of huge size and promised a number of delights skating a military band a lottery with no blank tickets an electric sun and so on But the whole scheme almost came to nothing owing to the hard frost From the eve of Epiphany there were twenty eight degrees of frost with a strong wind it was proposed to put off the fete and this was not done only because the public which for a long while had been looking forward to the fete impatiently would not consent to any postponement Only think what do you expect in winter but a frost said the ladies persuading the governor who tried to insist that the fete should be postponed If anyone is cold he can go and warm himself The trees the horses the men s beards were white with frost it even seemed that the air itself crackled as though unable to endure the cold but in spite of that the frozen public were skating Immediately after the blessing of the waters and precisely at one o clock the military band began playing Between three and four o clock in the afternoon when the festivity was at its height the select society of the place gathered together to warm themselves in the governor s pavilion which had been put up on the river bank The old governor and his wife the bishop the president of the local court the head master of the high school and many others were there The ladies were sitting in armchairs while the men crowded round the wide glass door looking at the skating Holy Saints said the bishop in surprise what flourishes they execute with their legs Upon my soul many a singer couldn t do a twirl with his voice as those cut throats do with their legs Aie he ll kill himself That s Smirnov That s Gruzdev said the head master mentioning the names of the schoolboys who flew by the pavilion Bah he s all alive oh laughed the governor Look gentlemen our mayor is coming He is coming this way That s a nuisance he will talk our heads off now A little thin old man wearing a big cap and a fur lined coat hanging open came from the opposite bank towards the pavilion avoiding the skaters This was the mayor of the town a merchant Eremeyev by name a millionaire and an old inhabitant of N Flinging wide his arms and shrugging at the cold he skipped along knocking one golosh against the other evidently in haste to get out of the wind Half way he suddenly bent down stole up to some lady and plucked at her sleeve from behind When she looked round he skipped away and probably delighted at having succeeded in frightening her went off into a loud aged laugh Lively old fellow said the governor It s a wonder he s not skating As he got near the pavilion the mayor fell into a little tripping trot waved his hands and taking a run slid along the ice in his huge golosh boots up to the very door Yegor Ivanitch you ought to get yourself some skates the governor greeted him That s just what I am thinking he answered in a squeaky somewhat nasal tenor taking off his cap I wish you good health your Excellency Your Holiness Long life to all the other gentlemen and ladies Here s a frost Yes it is a frost bother it It s deadly Winking with his red frozen eyes Yegor Ivanitch stamped on the floor with his golosh boots and swung his arms together like a frozen cabman Such a damnable frost worse than any dog he went on talking smiling all over his face It s a real affliction It s healthy said the governor frost strengthens a man and makes him vigorous Though it may be healthy it would be better without it at all said the mayor wiping his wedge shaped beard with a red handkerchief It would be a good riddance To my thinking your Excellency the Lord sends it us as a punishment the frost I mean We sin in the summer and are punished in the winter Yes Yegor Ivanitch looked round him quickly and flung up his hands Why where s the needful to warm us up he asked looking in alarm first at the governor and then at the bishop Your Excellency Your Holiness I ll be bound the ladies are frozen too We must have something this won t do Everyone began gesticulating and declaring that they had not come to the skating to warm themselves but the mayor heeding no one opened the door and beckoned to someone with his crooked finger A workman and a fireman ran up to him Here run off to Savatin he muttered and tell him to make haste and send here what do you call it What s it to be Tell him to send a dozen glasses a dozen glasses of mulled wine the very hottest or punch perhaps There was laughter in the pavilion A nice thing to treat us to Never mind we will drink it muttered the mayor a dozen glasses then and some Benedictine perhaps and tell them to warm two bottles of red wine Oh and what for the ladies Well you tell them to bring cakes nuts sweets of some sort perhaps There run along look sharp The mayor was silent for a minute and then began again abusing the frost banging his arms across his chest and thumping with his golosh boots No Yegor Ivanitch said the governor persuasively don t be unfair the Russian frost has its charms I was reading lately that many of the good qualities of the Russian people are due to the vast expanse of their land and to the climate the cruel struggle for existence that s perfectly true It may be true your Excellency but it would be better without it The frost did drive out the French of course and one can freeze all sorts of dishes and the children can go skating that s all true For the man who is well fed and well clothed the frost is only a pleasure but for the working man the beggar the pilgrim the crazy wanderer it s the greatest evil and misfortune It s misery your Holiness In a frost like this poverty is twice as hard and the thief is more cunning and evildoers more violent There s no gainsaying it I am turned seventy I ve a fur coat now and at home I have a stove and rums and punches of all sorts The frost means nothing to me now I take no notice of it I don t care to know of it but how it used to be in old days Holy Mother It s dreadful to recall it My memory is failing me with years and I have forgotten everything my enemies and my sins and troubles of all sorts I forget them all but the frost ough How I remember it When my mother died I was left a little devil this high a homeless orphan no kith nor kin wretched ragged little clothes hungry nowhere to sleep in fact we have here no abiding city but seek the one to come In those days I used to lead an old blind woman about the town for five kopecks a day the frosts were cruel wicked One would go out with the old woman and begin suffering torments My Creator First of all you would be shivering as in a fever shrugging and dancing about Then your ears your fingers your feet would begin aching They would ache as though someone were squeezing them with pincers But all that would have been nothing a trivial matter of no great consequence The trouble was when your whole body was chilled One would walk for three blessed hours in the frost your Holiness and lose all human semblance Your legs are drawn up there is a weight on your chest your stomach is pinched above all there is a pain in your heart that is worse than anything Your heart aches beyond all endurance and there is a wretchedness all over your body as though you were leading Death by the hand instead of an old woman You are numb all over turned to stone like a statue you go on and feel as though it were not you walking but someone else moving your legs instead of you When your soul is frozen you don t know what you are doing you are ready to leave the old woman with no one to guide her or to pull a hot roll from off a hawker s tray or to fight with someone And when you come to your night s lodging into the warmth after the frost there is not much joy in that either You lie awake till midnight crying and don t know yourself what you are crying for We must walk about the skating ground before it gets dark said the governor s wife who was bored with listening Who s coming with me The governor s wife went out and the whole company trooped out of the pavilion after her Only the governor the bishop and the mayor remained Queen of Heaven and what I went through when I was a shopboy in a fish shop Yegor Ivanitch went on flinging up his arms so that his fox lined coat fell open One would go out to the shop almost before it was light by eight o clock I was completely frozen my face was blue my fingers were stiff so that I could not fasten my buttons nor count the money One would stand in the cold turn numb and think Lord I shall have to stand like this right on till evening By dinner time my stomach was pinched and my heart was aching Yes And I was not much better afterwards when I had a shop of my own The frost was intense and the shop was like a mouse trap with draughts blowing in all directions the coat I had on was pardon me mangy as thin as paper threadbare One would be chilled through and through half dazed and turn as cruel as the frost oneself I would pull one by the ear so that I nearly pulled the ear off I would smack another on the back of the head I d glare at a customer like a ruffian a wild beast and be ready to fleece him and when I got home in the evening and ought to have gone to bed I d be ill humoured and set upon my family throwing it in their teeth that they were living upon me I would make a row and carry on so that half a dozen policemen couldn t have managed me The frost makes one spiteful and drives one to drink Yegor Ivanitch clasped his hands and went on And when we were taking fish to Moscow in the winter Holy Mother And spluttering as he talked he began describing the horrors he endured with his shopmen when he was taking fish to Moscow Yes sighed the governor it is wonderful what a man can endure You used to take wagon loads of fish to Moscow Yegor Ivanitch while I in my time was at the war I remember one extraordinary instance And the governor described how during the last Russo Turkish War one frosty night the division in which he was had stood in the snow without moving for thirteen hours in a piercing wind from fear of being observed the division did not light a fire nor make a sound or a movement they were forbidden to smoke Reminiscences followed The governor and the mayor grew lively and good humoured and interrupting each other began recalling their experiences And the bishop told them how when he was serving in Siberia he had travelled in a sledge drawn by dogs how one day being drowsy in a time of sharp frost he had fallen out of the sledge and been nearly frozen when the Tunguses turned back and found him he was barely alive Then as by common agreement the old men suddenly sank into silence sat side by side and mused Ech whispered the mayor you d think it would be time to forget but when you look at the water carriers at the schoolboys at the convicts in their wretched gowns it brings it all back Why only take those musicians who are playing now I ll be bound there is a pain in their hearts a pinch at their stomachs and their trumpets are freezing to their lips They play and think Holy Mother we have another three hours to sit here in the cold The old men sank into thought They thought of that in man which is higher than good birth higher than rank and wealth and learning of that which brings the lowest beggar near to God of the helplessness of man of his sufferings and his patience Meanwhile the air was turning blue the door opened and two waiters from Savatin s walked in carrying trays and a big muffled teapot When the glasses had been filled and there was a strong smell of cinnamon and clove in the air the door opened again and there came into the pavilion a beardless young policeman whose nose was crimson and who was covered all over with frost he went up to the governor and saluting said Her Excellency told me to inform you that she has gone home Looking at the way the policeman put his stiff frozen fingers to his cap looking at his nose his lustreless eyes and his hood covered with white frost near the mouth they all for some reason felt that this policeman s heart must be aching that his stomach must feel pinched and his soul numb I say said the governor hesitatingly have a drink of mulled wine It s all right it s all right Drink it up the mayor urged him gesticulating don t be shy The policeman took the glass in both hands moved aside and trying to drink without making any sound began discreetly sipping from the glass He drank and was overwhelmed with embarrassment while the old men looked at him in silence and they all fancied that the pain was leaving the young policeman s heart and that his soul was thawing The governor heaved a sigh It s time we were at home he said getting up Good bye I say he added addressing the policeman tell the musicians there to leave off playing and ask Pavel Semyonovitch from me to see they are given beer or vodka The governor and the bishop said good bye to the mayor and went out of the pavilion Yegor Ivanitch attacked the mulled wine and before the policeman had finished his glass succeeded in telling him a great many interesting things He could not be silent A SLANDER SERGE KAPITONICH AHINEEV the writing master was marrying his daughter to the teacher of history and geography The wedding festivities were going off most successfully In the drawing room there was singing playing and dancing Waiters hired from the club were flitting distractedly about the rooms dressed in black swallow tails and dirty white ties There was a continual hubbub and din of conversation Sitting side by side on the sofa the teacher of mathematics Tarantulov the French teacher Pasdequoi and the junior assessor of taxes Mzda were talking hurriedly and interrupting one another as they described to the guests cases of persons being buried alive and gave their opinions on spiritualism None of them believed in spiritualism but all admitted that there were many things in this world which would always be beyond the mind of man In the next room the literature master Dodonsky was explaining to the visitors the cases in which a sentry has the right to fire on passers by The subjects as you perceive were alarming but very agreeable Persons whose social position precluded them from entering were looking in at the windows from the yard Just at midnight the master of the house went into the kitchen to see whether everything was ready for supper The kitchen from floor to ceiling was filled with fumes composed of goose duck and many other odours On two tables the accessories the drinks and light refreshments were set out in artistic disorder The cook Marfa a red faced woman whose figure was like a barrel with a belt around it was bustling about the tables Show me the sturgeon Marfa said Ahineev rubbing his hands and licking his lips What a perfume I could eat up the whole kitchen Come show me the sturgeon Marfa went up to one of the benches and cautiously lifted a piece of greasy newspaper Under the paper on an immense dish there reposed a huge sturgeon masked in jelly and decorated with capers olives and carrots Ahineev gazed at the sturgeon and gasped His face beamed he turned his eyes up He bent down and with his lips emitted the sound of an ungreased wheel After standing a moment he snapped his fingers with delight and once more smacked his lips Ah ah the sound of a passionate kiss Who is it you re kissing out there little Marfa came a voice from the next room and in the doorway there appeared the cropped head of the assistant usher Vankin Who is it A a h Delighted to meet you Sergei Kapitonich You re a fine grandfather I must say Tete a tete with the fair sex tette I m not kissing said Ahineev in confusion Who told you so you fool I was only I smacked my lips in reference to as an indication of pleasure at the sight of the fish Tell that to the marines The intrusive face vanished wearing a broad grin Ahineev flushed Hang it he thought the beast will go now and talk scandal He ll disgrace me to all the town the brute Ahineev went timidly into the drawing room and looked stealthily round for Vankin Vankin was standing by the piano and bending down with a jaunty air was whispering something to the inspector s sister in law who was laughing Talking about me thought Ahineev About me blast him And she believes it believes it She laughs Mercy on us No I can t let it pass I can t I must do something to prevent his being believed I ll speak to them all and he ll be shown up for a fool and a gossip Ahineev scratched his head and still overcome with embarrassment went up to Pasdequoi I ve just been in the kitchen to see after the supper he said to the Frenchman I know you are fond of fish and I ve a sturgeon my dear fellow beyond everything A yard and a half long Ha ha ha And by the way I was just forgetting In the kitchen just now with that sturgeon quite a little story I went into the kitchen just now and wanted to look at the supper dishes I looked at the sturgeon and I smacked my lips with relish at the piquancy of it And at the very moment that fool Vankin came in and said Ha ha ha So you re kissing here Kissing Marfa the cook What a thing to imagine silly fool The woman is a perfect fright like all the beasts put together and he talks about kissing Queer fish Who s a queer fish asked Tarantulov coming up Why he over there Vankin I went into the kitchen And he told the story of Vankin He amused me queer fish I d rather kiss a dog than Marfa if you ask me added Ahineev He looked round and saw behind him Mzda We were talking of Vankin he said Queer fish he is He went into the kitchen saw me beside Marfa and began inventing all sorts of silly stories Why are you kissing he says He must have had a drop too much And I d rather kiss a turkeycock than Marfa I said And I ve a wife of my own you fool said I He did amuse me Who amused you asked the priest who taught Scripture in the school going up to Ahineev Vankin I was standing in the kitchen you know looking at the sturgeon And so on Within half an hour or so all the guests knew the incident of the sturgeon and Vankin Let him tell away now thought Ahineev rubbing his hands Let him He ll begin telling his story and they ll say to him at once Enough of your improbable nonsense you fool we know all about it And Ahineev was so relieved that in his joy he drank four glasses too many After escorting the young people to their room he went to bed and slept like an innocent babe and next day he thought no more of the incident with the sturgeon But alas man proposes but God disposes An evil tongue did its evil work and Ahineev s strategy was of no avail Just a week later to be precise on Wednesday after the third lesson when Ahineev was standing in the middle of the teacher s room holding forth on the vicious propensities of a boy called Visekin the head master went up to him and drew him aside Look here Sergei Kapitonich said the head master you must excuse me It s not my business but all the same I must make you realize It s my duty You see there are rumors that you are romancing with that cook It s nothing to do with me but flirt with her kiss her as you please but don t let it be so public please I entreat you Don t forget that you re a schoolmaster Ahineev turned cold and faint He went home like a man stung by a whole swarm of bees like a man scalded with boiling water As he walked home it seemed to him that the whole town was looking at him as though he were smeared with pitch At home fresh trouble awaited him Why aren t you gobbling up your food as usual his wife asked him at dinner What are you so pensive about Brooding over your amours Pining for your Marfa I know all about it Mohammedan Kind friends have opened my eyes O o o you savage And she slapped him in the face He got up from the table not feeling the earth under his feet and without his hat or coat made his way to Vankin He found him at home You scoundrel he addressed him Why have you covered me with mud before all the town Why did you set this slander going about me What slander What are you talking about Who was it gossiped of my kissing Marfa Wasn t it you Tell me that Wasn t it you you brigand Vankin blinked and twitched in every fibre of his battered countenance raised his eyes to the icon and articulated God blast me Strike me blind and lay me out if I said a single word about you May I be left without house and home may I be stricken with worse than cholera Vankin s sincerity did not admit of doubt It was evidently not he who was the author of the slander But who then who Ahineev wondered going over all his acquaintances in his mind and beating himself on the breast Who then Who then We too ask the reader MINDS IN FERMENT FROM THE ANNALS OF A TOWN THE earth was like an oven The afternoon sun blazed with such energy that even the thermometer hanging in the excise officer s room lost its head it ran up to one hundred twelve point five and stopped there irresolute The inhabitants streamed with perspiration like overdriven horses and were too lazy to mop their faces Two of the inhabitants were walking along the market place in front of the closely shuttered houses One was Potcheshihin the local treasury clerk and the other was Optimov the agent for many years a correspondent of the Son of the Fatherland newspaper They walked in silence speechless from the heat Optimov felt tempted to find fault with the local authorities for the dust and disorder of the market place but aware of the peace loving disposition and moderate views of his companion he said nothing In the middle of the market place Potcheshihin suddenly halted and began gazing into the sky What are you looking at Those starlings that flew up I wonder where they have settled Clouds and clouds of them If one were to go and take a shot at them and if one were to pick them up and if They have settled in the Father Prebendary s garden Oh no They are not in the Father Prebendary s they are in the Father Deacon s If you did have a shot at them from here you wouldn t kill anything Fine shot won t carry so far it loses its force And why should you kill them anyway They re birds destructive of the fruit that s true still they re fowls of the air works of the Lord The starling sings you know And what does it sing pray A song of praise All ye fowls of the air praise ye the Lord No I do believe they have settled in the Father Prebendary s garden Three old pilgrim women wearing bark shoes and carrying wallets passed noiselessly by the speakers Looking enquiringly at the gentlemen who were for some unknown reason staring at the Father Prebendary s house they slackened their pace and when they were a few yards off stopped glanced at the friends once more and then fell to gazing at the house themselves Yes you were right they have settled in the Father Prebendary s said Optimov His cherries are ripe now so they have gone there to peck them From the garden gate emerged the Father Prebendary himself accompanied by the sexton Seeing the attention directed upon his abode and wondering what people were staring at he stopped and he too as well as the sexton began looking upwards to find out The father is going to a service somewhere I suppose said Potcheshihin The Lord be his succour Some workmen from Purov s factory who had been bathing in the river passed between the friends and the priest Seeing the latter absorbed in contemplation of the heavens and the pilgrim women too standing motionless with their eyes turned upwards they stood still and stared in the same direction A small boy leading a blind beggar and a peasant carrying a tub of stinking fish to throw into the market place did the same There must be something the matter I should think said Potcheshihin a fire or something But there s no sign of smoke anywhere Hey Kuzma he shouted to the peasant what s the matter The peasant made some reply but Potcheshihin and Optimov did not catch it Sleepy looking shopmen made their appearance at the doors of all the shops Some plasterers at work on a warehouse near left their ladders and joined the workmen The fireman who was describing circles with his bare feet on the watch tower halted and after looking steadily at them for a few minutes came down The watch tower was left deserted This seemed suspicious There must be a fire somewhere Don t shove me You damned swine Where do you see the fire What fire Pass on gentlemen I ask you civilly It must be a fire indoors Asks us civilly and keeps poking with his elbows Keep your hands to yourself Though you are a head constable you have no sort of right to make free with your fists He s trodden on my corn Ah I ll crush you Crushed Who s crushed Lads a man s been crushed What s the meaning of this crowd What do you want A man s been crushed please your honour Where Pass on I ask you civilly I ask you civilly you blockheads You may shove a peasant but you daren t touch a gentleman Hands off Did you ever know such people There s no doing anything with them by fair words the devils Sidorov run for Akim Danilitch Look sharp It ll be the worse for you gentlemen Akim Danilitch is coming and he ll give it to you You here Parfen A blind man and at his age too Can t see but he must be like other people and won t do what he s told Smirnov put his name down Yes sir And shall I write down the men from Purov s That man there with the swollen cheek he s from Purov s works Don t put down the men from Purov s It s Purov s birthday to morrow The starlings rose in a black cloud from the Father Prebendary s garden but Potcheshihin and Optimov did not notice them They stood staring into the air wondering what could have attracted such a crowd and what it was looking at Akim Danilitch appeared Still munching and wiping his lips he cut his way into the crowd bellowing Firemen be ready Disperse mister Optimov disperse or it ll be the worse for you Instead of writing all kinds of things about decent people in the papers you had better try to behave yourself more conformably No good ever comes of reading the papers Kindly refrain from reflections upon literature cried Optimov hotly I am a literary man and I will allow no one to make reflections upon literature though as is the duty of a citizen I respect you as a father and benefactor Firemen turn the hose on them There s no water please your honour Don t answer me Go and get some Look sharp We ve nothing to get it in your honour The major has taken the fire brigade horses to drive his aunt to the station Disperse Stand back damnation take you Is that to your taste Put him down the devil I ve lost my pencil please your honour The crowd grew larger and larger There is no telling what proportions it might have reached if the new organ just arrived from Moscow had not fortunately begun playing in the tavern close by Hearing their favourite tune the crowd gasped and rushed off to the tavern So nobody ever knew why the crowd had assembled and Potcheshihin and Optimov had by now forgotten the existence of the starlings who were innocently responsible for the proceedings An hour later the town was still and silent again and only a solitary figure was to be seen the fireman pacing round and round on the watch tower The same evening Akim Danilitch sat in the grocer s shop drinking limonade gaseuse and brandy and writing In addition to the official report I venture your Excellency to append a few supplementary observations of my own Father and benefactor In very truth but for the prayers of your virtuous spouse in her salubrious villa near our town there s no knowing what might not have come to pass What I have been through to day I can find no words to express The efficiency of Krushensky and of the major of the fire brigade are beyond all praise I am proud of such devoted servants of our country As for me I did all that a weak man could do whose only desire is the welfare of his neighbour and sitting now in the bosom of my family with tears in my eyes I thank Him Who spared us bloodshed In absence of evidence the guilty parties remain in custody but I propose to release them in a week or so It was their ignorance that led them astray GONE ASTRAY A COUNTRY village wrapped in the darkness of night One o clock strikes from the belfry Two lawyers called Kozyavkin and Laev both in the best of spirits and a little unsteady on their legs come out of the wood and turn towards the cottages Well thank God we ve arrived says Kozyavkin drawing a deep breath Tramping four miles from the station in our condition is a feat I am fearfully done up And as ill luck would have it not a fly to be seen Petya my dear fellow I can t I feel like dying if I m not in bed in five minutes In bed Don t you think it my boy First we ll have supper and a glass of red wine and then you can go to bed Verotchka and I will wake you up Ah my dear fellow it s a fine thing to be married You don t understand it you cold hearted wretch I shall be home in a minute worn out and exhausted A loving wife will welcome me give me some tea and something to eat and repay me for my hard work and my love with such a fond and loving look out of her darling black eyes that I shall forget how tired I am and forget the burglary and the law courts and the appeal division It s glorious Yes I say I feel as though my legs were dropping off I can scarcely get along I am frightfully thirsty Well here we are at home The friends go up to one of the cottages and stand still under the nearest window It s a jolly cottage said Kozyavkin You will see to morrow what views we have There s no light in the windows Verotchka must have gone to bed then she must have got tired of sitting up She s in bed and must be worrying at my not having turned up He pushes the window with his stick and it opens Plucky girl She goes to bed without bolting the window He takes off his cape and flings it with his portfolio in at the window I am hot Let us strike up a serenade and make her laugh He sings The moon floats in the midnight sky Faintly stir the tender breezes Faintly rustle in the treetops Sing sing Alyosha Verotchka shall we sing you Schubert s Serenade He sings His performance is cut short by a sudden fit of coughing Tphoo Verotchka tell Aksinya to unlock the gate for us A pause Verotchka don t be lazy get up darling He stands on a stone and looks in at the window Verotchka my dumpling Verotchka my poppet my little angel my wife beyond compare get up and tell Aksinya to unlock the gate for us You are not asleep you know Little wife we are really so done up and exhausted that we re not in the mood for jokes We ve trudged all the way from the station Don t you hear Ah hang it all He makes an effort to climb up to the window and falls down You know this isn t a nice trick to play on a visitor I see you are just as great a schoolgirl as ever Vera you are always up to mischief Perhaps Vera Stepanovna is asleep says Laev She isn t asleep I bet she wants me to make an outcry and wake up the whole neighbourhood I m beginning to get cross Vera Ach damn it all Give me a leg up Alyosha I ll get in You are a naughty girl nothing but a regular schoolgirl Give me a hoist Puffing and panting Laev gives him a leg up and Kozyavkin climbs in at the window and vanishes into the darkness within Vera Laev hears a minute later where are you D damnation Tphoo I ve put my hand into something Tphoo There is a rustling sound a flapping of wings and the desperate cackling of a fowl A nice state of things Laev hears Vera where on earth did these chickens come from Why the devil there s no end of them There s a basket with a turkey in it It pecks the nasty creature Two hens fly out of the window and cackling at the top of their voices flutter down the village street Alyosha we ve made a mistake says Kozyavkin in a lachrymose voice There are a lot of hens here I must have mistaken the house Confound you you are all over the place you cursed brutes Well then make haste and come down Do you hear I am dying of thirst In a minute I am looking for my cape and portfolio Light a match The matches are in the cape I was a crazy idiot to get into this place The cottages are exactly alike the devil himself couldn t tell them apart in the dark Aie the turkey s pecked my cheek nasty creature Make haste and get out or they ll think we are stealing the chickens In a minute I can t find my cape anywhere There are lots of old rags here and I can t tell where the cape is Throw me a match I haven t any We are in a hole I must say What am I to do I can t go without my cape and my portfolio I must find them I can t understand a man s not knowing his own cottage says Laev indignantly Drunken beast If I d known I was in for this sort of thing I would never have come with you I should have been at home and fast asleep by now and a nice fix I m in here I m fearfully done up and thirsty and my head is going round In a minute in a minute You won t expire A big cock flies crowing over Laev s head Laev heaves a deep sigh and with a hopeless gesture sits down on a stone He is beset with a burning thirst his eyes are closing his head drops forward Five minutes pass ten twenty and Kozyavkin is still busy among the hens Petya will you be long A minute I found the portfolio but I have lost it again Laev lays his head on his fists and closes his eyes The cackling of the fowls grows louder and louder The inhabitants of the empty cottage fly out of the window and flutter round in circles he fancies like owls over his head His ears ring with their cackle he is overwhelmed with terror The beast he thinks He invited me to stay promising me wine and junket and then he makes me walk from the station and listen to these hens In the midst of his indignation his chin sinks into his collar he lays his head on his portfolio and gradually subsides Weariness gets the upper hand and he begins to doze I ve found the portfolio he hears Kozyavkin cry triumphantly I shall find the cape in a minute and then off we go Then through his sleep he hears the barking of dogs First one dog barks then a second and a third And the barking of the dogs blends with the cackling of the fowls into a sort of savage music Someone comes up to Laev and asks him something Then he hears someone climb over his head into the window then a knocking and a shouting A woman in a red apron stands beside him with a lantern in her hand and asks him something You ve no right to say so he hears Kozyavkin s voice I am a lawyer a bachelor of laws Kozyavkin here s my visiting card What do I want with your card says someone in a husky bass You ve disturbed all my fowls you ve smashed the eggs Look what you ve done The turkey poults were to have come out to day or to morrow and you ve smashed them What s the use of your giving me your card sir How dare you interfere with me No I won t have it I am thirsty thinks Laev trying to open his eyes and he feels somebody climb down from the window over his head My name is Kozyavkin I have a cottage here Everyone knows me We don t know anyone called Kozyavkin What are you saying Call the elder He knows me Don t get excited the constable will be here directly We know all the summer visitors here but I ve never seen you in my life I ve had a cottage in Rottendale for five years Whew Do you take this for the Dale This is Sicklystead but Rottendale is farther to the right beyond the match factory It s three miles from here Bless my soul Then I ve taken the wrong turning The cries of men and fowls mingle with the barking of dogs and the voice of Kozyavkin rises above the chaos of confused sounds You shut up I ll pay I ll show you whom you have to deal with Little by little the voices die down Laev feels himself being shaken by the shoulder AN AVENGER SHORTLY after finding his wife in flagrante delicto Fyodor Fyodorovitch Sigaev was standing in Schmuck and company s the gunsmiths selecting a suitable revolver His countenance expressed wrath grief and unalterable determination I know what I must do he was thinking The sanctities of the home are outraged honour is trampled in the mud vice is triumphant and therefore as a citizen and a man of honour I must be their avenger First I will kill her and her lover and then myself He had not yet chosen a revolver or killed anyone but already in imagination he saw three bloodstained corpses broken skulls brains oozing from them the commotion the crowd of gaping spectators the post mortem With the malignant joy of an insulted man he pictured the horror of the relations and the public the agony of the traitress and was mentally reading leading articles on the destruction of the traditions of the home The shopman a sprightly little Frenchified figure with rounded belly and white waistcoat displayed the revolvers and smiling respectfully and scraping with his little feet observed I would advise you M sieur to take this superb revolver the Smith and Wesson pattern the last word in the science of firearms triple action with ejector kills at six hundred paces central sight Let me draw your attention M sieu to the beauty of the finish The most fashionable system M sieu We sell a dozen every day for burglars wolves and lovers Very correct and powerful action hits at a great distance and kills wife and lover with one bullet As for suicide M sieu I don t know a better pattern The shopman pulled and cocked the trigger breathed on the barrel took aim and affected to be breathless with delight Looking at his ecstatic countenance one might have supposed that he would readily have put a bullet through his brains if he had only possessed a revolver of such a superb pattern as a Smith Wesson And what price asked Sigaev Forty five roubles M sieu Mm that s too dear for me In that case M sieu let me offer you another make somewhat cheaper Here if you ll kindly look we have an immense choice at all prices Here for instance this revolver of the Lefaucher pattern costs only eighteen roubles but the shopman pursed up his face contemptuously but M sieu it s an old fashioned make They are only bought by hysterical ladies or the mentally deficient To commit suicide or shoot one s wife with a Lefaucher revolver is considered bad form nowadays Smith Wesson is the only pattern that s correct style I don t want to shoot myself or to kill anyone said Sigaev lying sullenly I am buying it simply for a country cottage to frighten away burglars That s not our business what object you have in buying it The shopman smiled dropping his eyes discreetly If we were to investigate the object in each case M sieu we should have to close our shop To frighten burglars Lefaucher is not a suitable pattern M sieu for it goes off with a faint muffled sound I would suggest Mortimer s the so called duelling pistol Shouldn t I challenge him to a duel flashed through Sigaev s mind It s doing him too much honour though Beasts like that are killed like dogs The shopman swaying gracefully and tripping to and fro on his little feet still smiling and chattering displayed before him a heap of revolvers The most inviting and impressive of all was the Smith and Wesson s Sigaev picked up a pistol of that pattern gazed blankly at it and sank into brooding His imagination pictured how he would blow out their brains how blood would flow in streams over the rug and the parquet how the traitress s legs would twitch in her last agony But that was not enough for his indignant soul The picture of blood wailing and horror did not satisfy him He must think of something more terrible I know I ll kill myself and him he thought but I ll leave her alive Let her pine away from the stings of conscience and the contempt of all surrounding her For a sensitive nature like hers that will be far more agonizing than death And he imagined his own funeral he the injured husband lies in his coffin with a gentle smile on his lips and she pale tortured by remorse follows the coffin like a Niobe not knowing where to hide herself to escape from the withering contemptuous looks cast upon her by the indignant crowd I see M sieu that you like the Smith and Wesson make the shopman broke in upon his broodings If you think it too dear very well I ll knock off five roubles But we have other makes cheaper The little Frenchified figure turned gracefully and took down another dozen cases of revolvers from the shelf Here M sieu price thirty roubles That s not expensive especially as the rate of exchange has dropped terribly and the Customs duties are rising every hour M sieu I vow I am a Conservative but even I am beginning to murmur Why with the rate of exchange and the Customs tariff only the rich can purchase firearms There s nothing left for the poor but Tula weapons and phosphorus matches and Tula weapons are a misery You may aim at your wife with a Tula revolver and shoot yourself through the shoulder blade Sigaev suddenly felt mortified and sorry that he would be dead and would miss seeing the agonies of the traitress Revenge is only sweet when one can see and taste its fruits and what sense would there be in it if he were lying in his coffin knowing nothing about it Hadn t I better do this he pondered I ll kill him then I ll go to his funeral and look on and after the funeral I ll kill myself They d arrest me though before the funeral and take away my pistol And so I ll kill him she shall remain alive and I for the time I ll not kill myself but go and be arrested I shall always have time to kill myself There will be this advantage about being arrested that at the preliminary investigation I shall have an opportunity of exposing to the authorities and to the public all the infamy of her conduct If I kill myself she may with her characteristic duplicity and impudence throw all the blame on me and society will justify her behaviour and will very likely laugh at me If I remain alive then A minute later he was thinking Yes if I kill myself I may be blamed and suspected of petty feeling Besides why should I kill myself That s one thing And for another to shoot oneself is cowardly And so I ll kill him and let her live and I ll face my trial I shall be tried and she will be brought into court as a witness I can imagine her confusion her disgrace when she is examined by my counsel The sympathies of the court of the Press and of the public will certainly be with me While he deliberated the shopman displayed his wares and felt it incumbent upon him to entertain his customer Here are English ones a new pattern only just received he prattled on But I warn you M sieu all these systems pale beside the Smith and Wesson The other day as I dare say you have read an officer bought from us a Smith and Wesson He shot his wife s lover and would you believe it the bullet passed through him pierced the bronze lamp then the piano and ricochetted back from the piano killing the lap dog and bruising the wife A magnificent record redounding to the honour of our firm The officer is now under arrest He will no doubt be convicted and sent to penal servitude In the first place our penal code is quite out of date and secondly M sieu the sympathies of the court are always with the lover Why is it Very simple M sieu The judges and the jury and the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence are all living with other men s wives and it ll add to their comfort that there will be one husband the less in Russia Society would be pleased if the Government were to send all the husbands to Sahalin Oh M sieu you don t know how it excites my indignation to see the corruption of morals nowadays To love other men s wives is as much the regular thing to day as to smoke other men s cigarettes and to read other men s books Every year our trade gets worse and worse it doesn t mean that wives are more faithful but that husbands resign themselves to their position and are afraid of the law and penal servitude The shopman looked round and whispered And whose fault is it M sieu The Government s To go to Sahalin for the sake of a pig like that there s no sense in that either Sigaev pondered If I go to penal servitude it will only give my wife an opportunity of marrying again and deceiving a second husband She would triumph And so I will leave her alive I won t kill myself him I won t kill either I must think of something more sensible and more effective I will punish them with my contempt and will take divorce proceedings that will make a scandal Here M sieu is another make said the shopman taking down another dozen from the shelf Let me call your attention to the original mechanism of the lock In view of his determination a revolver was now of no use to Sigaev but the shopman meanwhile getting more and more enthusiastic persisted in displaying his wares before him The outraged husband began to feel ashamed that the shopman should be taking so much trouble on his account for nothing that he should be smiling wasting time displaying enthusiasm for nothing Very well in that case he muttered I ll look in again later on or I ll send someone He didn t see the expression of the shopman s face but to smooth over the awkwardness of the position a little he felt called upon to make some purchase But what should he buy He looked round the walls of the shop to pick out something inexpensive and his eyes rested on a green net hanging near the door That s what s that he asked That s a net for catching quails And what price is it Eight roubles M sieu Wrap it up for me The outraged husband paid his eight roubles took the net and feeling even more outraged walked out of the shop THE JEUNE PREMIER YEVGENY ALEXEYITCH PODZHAROV the jeune premier a graceful elegant young man with an oval face and little bags under his eyes had come for the season to one of the southern towns of Russia and tried at once to make the acquaintance of a few of the leading families of the place Yes signor he would often say gracefully swinging his foot and displaying his red socks an artist ought to act upon the masses both directly and indirectly the first aim is attained by his work on the stage the second by an acquaintance with the local inhabitants On my honour parole d honneur I don t understand why it is we actors avoid making acquaintance with local families Why is it To say nothing of dinners name day parties feasts soirees fixes to say nothing of these entertainments think of the moral influence we may have on society Is it not agreeable to feel one has dropped a spark in some thick skull The types one meets The women Mon Dieu what women they turn one s head One penetrates into some huge merchant s house into the sacred retreats and picks out some fresh and rosy little peach it s heaven parole d honneur In the southern town among other estimable families he made the acquaintance of that of a manufacturer called Zybaev Whenever he remembers that acquaintance now he frowns contemptuously screws up his eyes and nervously plays with his watch chain One day it was at a name day party at Zybaev s the actor was sitting in his new friends drawing room and holding forth as usual Around him types were sitting in armchairs and on the sofa listening affably from the next room came feminine laughter and the sounds of evening tea Crossing his legs after each phrase sipping tea with rum in it and trying to assume an expression of careless boredom he talked of his stage triumphs I am a provincial actor principally he said smiling condescendingly but I have played in Petersburg and Moscow too By the way I will describe an incident which illustrates pretty well the state of mind of to day At my benefit in Moscow the young people brought me such a mass of laurel wreaths that I swear by all I hold sacred I did not know where to put them Parole d honneur Later on at a moment when funds were short I took the laurel wreaths to the shop and guess what they weighed Eighty pounds altogether Ha ha you can t think how useful the money was Artists indeed are often hard up To day I have hundreds thousands tomorrow nothing To day I haven t a crust of bread to morrow I have oysters and anchovies hang it all The local inhabitants sipped their glasses decorously and listened The well pleased host not knowing how to make enough of his cultured and interesting visitor presented to him a distant relative who had just arrived one Pavel Ignatyevitch Klimov a bulky gentleman about forty wearing a long frock coat and very full trousers You ought to know each other said Zybaev as he presented Klimov he loves theatres and at one time used to act himself He has an estate in the Tula province Podzharov and Klimov got into conversation It appeared to the great satisfaction of both that the Tula landowner lived in the very town in which the jeune premier had acted for two seasons in succession Enquiries followed about the town about common acquaintances and about the theatre Do you know I like that town awfully said the jeune premier displaying his red socks What streets what a charming park and what society Delightful society Yes delightful society the landowner assented A commercial town but extremely cultured For instance er er er the head master of the high school the public prosecutor the officers The police captain too was not bad a man as the French say enchante and the women Allah what women Yes the women certainly Perhaps I am partial the fact is that in your town I don t know why I was devilishly lucky with the fair sex I could write a dozen novels To take this episode for instance I was staying in Yegoryevsky Street in the very house where the Treasury is The red house without stucco Yes yes without stucco Close by as I remember now lived a local beauty Varenka Not Varvara Nikolayevna asked Klimov and he beamed with satisfaction She really is a beauty the most beautiful girl in the town The most beautiful girl in the town A classic profile great black eyes and hair to her waist She saw me in Hamlet she wrote me a letter a la Pushkin s Tatyana I answered as you may guess Podzharov looked round and having satisfied himself that there were no ladies in the room rolled his eyes smiled mournfully and heaved a sigh I came home one evening after a performance he whispered and there she was sitting on my sofa There followed tears protestations of love kisses Oh that was a marvellous that was a divine night Our romance lasted two months but that night was never repeated It was a night parole d honneur Excuse me what s that muttered Klimov turning crimson and gazing open eyed at the actor I know Varvara Nikolayevna well she s my niece Podzharov was embarrassed and he too opened his eyes wide How s this Klimov went on throwing up his hands I know the girl and and I am surprised I am very sorry this has come up muttered the actor getting up and rubbing something out of his left eye with his little finger Though of course of course you as her uncle The other guests who had hitherto been listening to the actor with pleasure and rewarding him with smiles were embarrassed and dropped their eyes Please do be so good take your words back said Klimov in extreme embarrassment I beg you to do so If er er er it offends you certainly answered the actor with an undefined movement of his hand And confess you have told a falsehood I no er er er It was not a lie but I greatly regret having spoken too freely And in fact I don t understand your tone Klimov walked up and down the room in silence as though in uncertainty and hesitation His fleshy face grew more and more crimson and the veins in his neck swelled up After walking up and down for about two minutes he went up to the actor and said in a tearful voice No do be so good as to confess that you told a lie about Varenka Have the goodness to do so It s queer said the actor with a strained smile shrugging his shoulders and swinging his leg This is positively insulting So you will not confess it I do on t understand You will not In that case excuse me I shall have to resort to unpleasant measures Either sir I shall insult you at once on the spot or if you are an honourable man you will kindly accept my challenge to a duel We will fight Certainly rapped out the jeune premier with a contemptuous gesture Certainly Extremely perturbed the guests and the host not knowing what to do drew Klimov aside and began begging him not to get up a scandal Astonished feminine countenances appeared in the doorway The jeune premier turned round said a few words and with an air of being unable to remain in a house where he was insulted took his cap and made off without saying good bye On his way home the jeune premier smiled contemptuously and shrugged his shoulders but when he reached his hotel room and stretched himself on his sofa he felt exceedingly uneasy The devil take him he thought A duel does not matter he won t kill me but the trouble is the other fellows will hear of it and they know perfectly well it was a yarn It s abominable I shall be disgraced all over Russia Podzharov thought a little smoked and to calm himself went out into the street I ought to talk to this bully ram into his stupid noddle that he is a blockhead and a fool and that I am not in the least afraid of him The jeune premier stopped before Zybaev s house and looked at the windows Lights were still burning behind the muslin curtains and figures were moving about I ll wait for him the actor decided It was dark and cold A hateful autumn rain was drizzling as though through a sieve Podzharov leaned his elbow on a lamp post and abandoned himself to a feeling of uneasiness He was wet through and exhausted At two o clock in the night the guests began coming out of Zybaev s house The landowner from Tula was the last to make his appearance He heaved a sigh that could be heard by the whole street and scraped the pavement with his heavy overboots Excuse me said the jeune premier overtaking him One minute Klimov stopped The actor gave a smile hesitated and began stammering I I confess I told a lie No sir you will please confess that publicly said Klimov and he turned crimson again I can t leave it like that But you see I am apologizing I beg you don t you understand I beg you because you will admit a duel will make talk and I am in a position My fellow actors goodness knows what they may think The jeune premier tried to appear unconcerned to smile to stand erect but his body would not obey him his voice trembled his eyes blinked guiltily and his head drooped For a good while he went on muttering something Klimov listened to him thought a little and heaved a sigh Well so be it he said May God forgive you Only don t lie in future young man Nothing degrades a man like lying yes indeed You are a young man you have had a good education The landowner from Tula in a benignant fatherly way gave him a lecture while the jeune premier listened and smiled meekly When it was over he smirked bowed and with a guilty step and a crestfallen air set off for his hotel As he went to bed half an hour later he felt that he was out of danger and was already in excellent spirits Serene and satisfied that the misunderstanding had ended so satisfactorily he wrapped himself in the bedclothes soon fell asleep and slept soundly till ten o clock next morning A DEFENCELESS CREATURE IN spite of a violent attack of gout in the night and the nervous exhaustion left by it Kistunov went in the morning to his office and began punctually seeing the clients of the bank and persons who had come with petitions He looked languid and exhausted and spoke in a faint voice hardly above a whisper as though he were dying What can I do for you he asked a lady in an antediluvian mantle whose back view was extremely suggestive of a huge dung beetle You see your Excellency the petitioner in question began speaking rapidly my husband Shtchukin a collegiate assessor was ill for five months and while he if you will excuse my saying so was laid up at home he was for no sort of reason dismissed your Excellency and when I went for his salary they deducted if you please your Excellency twenty four roubles thirty six kopecks from his salary What for I asked He borrowed from the club fund they told me and the other clerks had stood security for him How was that How could he have borrowed it without my consent It s impossible your Excellency What s the reason of it I am a poor woman I earn my bread by taking in lodgers I am a weak defenceless woman I have to put up with ill usage from everyone and never hear a kind word The petitioner was blinking and dived into her mantle for her handkerchief Kistunov took her petition from her and began reading it Excuse me what s this he asked shrugging his shoulders I can make nothing of it Evidently you have come to the wrong place madam Your petition has nothing to do with us at all You will have to apply to the department in which your husband was employed Why my dear sir I have been to five places already and they would not even take the petition anywhere said Madame Shtchukin I d quite lost my head but thank goodness God bless him for it my son in law Boris Matveyitch advised me to come to you You go to mister Kistunov mamma he is an influential man he can do anything for you Help me your Excellency We can do nothing for you Madame Shtchukin You must understand your husband served in the Army Medical Department and our establishment is a purely private commercial undertaking a bank Surely you must understand that Kistunov shrugged his shoulders again and turned to a gentleman in a military uniform with a swollen face Your Excellency piped Madame Shtchukin in a pitiful voice I have the doctor s certificate that my husband was ill Here it is if you will kindly look at it Very good I believe you Kistunov said irritably but I repeat it has nothing to do with us It s queer and positively absurd Surely your husband must know where you are to apply He knows nothing your Excellency He keeps on It s not your business Get away that s all I can get out of him Whose business is it then It s I have to keep them all Kistunov again turned to Madame Shtchukin and began explaining to her the difference between the Army Medical Department and a private bank She listened attentively nodded in token of assent and said Yes yes yes I understand sir In that case your Excellency tell them to pay me fifteen roubles at least I agree to take part on account Ough sighed Kistunov letting his head drop back There s no making you see reason Do understand that to apply to us with such a petition is as strange as to send in a petition concerning divorce for instance to a chemist s or to the Assaying Board You have not been paid your due but what have we to do with it Your Excellency make me remember you in my prayers for the rest of my days have pity on a lone lorn woman wailed Madame Shtchukin I am a weak defenceless woman I am worried to death I ve to settle with the lodgers and see to my husband s affairs and fly round looking after the house and I am going to church every day this week and my son in law is out of a job I might as well not eat or drink I can scarcely keep on my feet I haven t slept all night Kistunov was conscious of the palpitation of his heart With a face of anguish pressing his hand on his heart he began explaining to Madame Shtchukin again but his voice failed him No excuse me I cannot talk to you he said with a wave of his hand My head s going round You are hindering us and wasting your time Ough Alexey Nikolaitch he said addressing one of his clerks please will you explain to Madame Shtchukin Kistunov passing by all the petitioners went to his private room and signed about a dozen papers while Alexey Nikolaitch was still engaged with Madame Shtchukin As he sat in his room Kistunov heard two voices the monotonous restrained bass of Alexey Nikolaitch and the shrill wailing voice of Madame Shtchukin I am a weak defenceless woman I am a woman in delicate health said Madame Shtchukin I look strong but if you were to overhaul me there is not one healthy fibre in me I can scarcely keep on my feet and my appetite is gone I drank my cup of coffee this morning without the slightest relish Alexey Nikolaitch explained to her the difference between the departments and the complicated system of sending in papers He was soon exhausted and his place was taken by the accountant A wonderfully disagreeable woman said Kistunov revolted nervously cracking his fingers and continually going to the decanter of water She s a perfect idiot She s worn me out and she ll exhaust them the nasty creature Ough my heart is throbbing Half an hour later he rang his bell Alexey Nikolaitch made his appearance How are things going Kistunov asked languidly We can t make her see anything Pyotr Alexandritch We are simply done We talk of one thing and she talks of something else I I can t stand the sound of her voice I am ill I can t bear it Send for the porter Pyotr Alexandritch let him put her out No no cried Kistunov in alarm She will set up a squeal and there are lots of flats in this building and goodness knows what they would think of us Do try and explain to her my dear fellow A minute later the deep drone of Alexey Nikolaitch s voice was audible again A quarter of an hour passed and instead of his bass there was the murmur of the accountant s powerful tenor Re mark ably nasty woman Kistunov thought indignantly nervously shrugging his shoulders No more brains than a sheep I believe that s a twinge of the gout again My migraine is coming back In the next room Alexey Nikolaitch at the end of his resources at last tapped his finger on the table and then on his own forehead The fact of the matter is you haven t a head on your shoulders he said but this Come come said the old lady offended Talk to your own wife like that You screw Don t be too free with your hands And looking at her with fury with exasperation as though he would devour her Alexey Nikolaitch said in a quiet stifled voice Clear out Wha at squealed Madame Shtchukin How dare you I am a weak defenceless woman I won t endure it My husband is a collegiate assessor You screw I will go to Dmitri Karlitch the lawyer and there will be nothing left of you I ve had the law of three lodgers and I will make you flop down at my feet for your saucy words I ll go to your general Your Excellency your Excellency Be off you pest hissed Alexey Nikolaitch Kistunov opened his door and looked into the office What is it he asked in a tearful voice Madame Shtchukin as red as a crab was standing in the middle of the room rolling her eyes and prodding the air with her fingers The bank clerks were standing round red in the face too and evidently harassed were looking at each other distractedly Your Excellency cried Madame Shtchukin pouncing upon Kistunov Here this man he here this man she pointed to Alexey Nikolaitch tapped himself on the forehead and then tapped the table You told him to go into my case and he s jeering at me I am a weak defenceless woman My husband is a collegiate assessor and I am a major s daughter myself Very good madam moaned Kistunov I will go into it I will take steps Go away later And when shall I get the money your Excellency I need it to day Kistunov passed his trembling hand over his forehead heaved a sigh and began explaining again Madam I have told you already this is a bank a private commercial establishment What do you want of us And do understand that you are hindering us Madame Shtchukin listened to him and sighed To be sure to be sure she assented Only your Excellency do me the kindness make me pray for you for the rest of my life be a father protect me If a medical certificate is not enough I can produce an affidavit from the police Tell them to give me the money Everything began swimming before Kistunov s eyes He breathed out all the air in his lungs in a prolonged sigh and sank helpless on a chair How much do you want he asked in a weak voice Twenty four roubles and thirty six kopecks Kistunov took his pocket book out of his pocket extracted a twenty five rouble note and gave it to Madame Shtchukin Take it and and go away Madame Shtchukin wrapped the money up in her handkerchief put it away and pursing up her face into a sweet mincing even coquettish smile asked Your Excellency and would it be possible for my husband to get a post again I am going I am ill said Kistunov in a weary voice I have dreadful palpitations When he had driven home Alexey Nikolaitch sent Nikita for some laurel drops and after taking twenty drops each all the clerks set to work while Madame Shtchukin stayed another two hours in the vestibule talking to the porter and waiting for Kistunov to return She came again next day AN ENIGMATIC NATURE ON the red velvet seat of a first class railway carriage a pretty lady sits half reclining An expensive fluffy fan trembles in her tightly closed fingers a pince nez keeps dropping off her pretty little nose the brooch heaves and falls on her bosom like a boat on the ocean She is greatly agitated On the seat opposite sits the Provincial Secretary of Special Commissions a budding young author who from time to time publishes long stories of high life or Novelli as he calls them in the leading paper of the province He is gazing into her face gazing intently with the eyes of a connoisseur He is watching studying catching every shade of this exceptional enigmatic nature He understands it he fathoms it Her soul her whole psychology lies open before him Oh I understand I understand you to your inmost depths says the Secretary of Special Commissions kissing her hand near the bracelet Your sensitive responsive soul is seeking to escape from the maze of Yes the struggle is terrific titanic But do not lose heart you will be triumphant Yes Write about me Voldemar says the pretty lady with a mournful smile My life has been so full so varied so chequered Above all I am unhappy I am a suffering soul in some page of Dostoevsky Reveal my soul to the world Voldemar Reveal that hapless soul You are a psychologist We have not been in the train an hour together and you have already fathomed my heart Tell me I beseech you tell me Listen My father was a poor clerk in the Service He had a good heart and was not without intelligence but the spirit of the age of his environment vous comprenez I do not blame my poor father He drank gambled took bribes My mother but why say more Poverty the struggle for daily bread the consciousness of insignificance ah do not force me to recall it I had to make my own way You know the monstrous education at a boarding school foolish novel reading the errors of early youth the first timid flutter of love It was awful The vacillation And the agonies of losing faith in life in oneself Ah you are an author You know us women You will understand Unhappily I have an intense nature I looked for happiness and what happiness I longed to set my soul free Yes In that I saw my happiness Exquisite creature murmured the author kissing her hand close to the bracelet It s not you I am kissing but the suffering of humanity Do you remember Raskolnikov and his kiss Oh Voldemar I longed for glory renown success like every why affect modesty every nature above the commonplace I yearned for something extraordinary above the common lot of woman And then and then there crossed my path an old general very well off Understand me Voldemar It was self sacrifice renunciation You must see that I could do nothing else I restored the family fortunes was able to travel to do good Yet how I suffered how revolting how loathsome to me were his embraces though I will be fair to him he had fought nobly in his day There were moments terrible moments but I was kept up by the thought that from day to day the old man might die that then I would begin to live as I liked to give myself to the man I adore be happy There is such a man Voldemar indeed there is The pretty lady flutters her fan more violently Her face takes a lachrymose expression She goes on But at last the old man died He left me something I was free as a bird of the air Now is the moment for me to be happy isn t it Voldemar Happiness comes tapping at my window I had only to let it in but Voldemar listen I implore you Now is the time for me to give myself to the man I love to become the partner of his life to help to uphold his ideals to be happy to find rest but how ignoble repulsive and senseless all our life is How mean it all is Voldemar I am wretched wretched wretched Again there is an obstacle in my path Again I feel that my happiness is far far away Ah what anguish if only you knew what anguish But what what stands in your way I implore you tell me What is it Another old general very well off The broken fan conceals the pretty little face The author props on his fist his thought heavy brow and ponders with the air of a master in psychology The engine is whistling and hissing while the window curtains flush red with the glow of the setting sun A HAPPY MAN THE passenger train is just starting from Bologoe the junction on the Petersburg Moscow line In a second class smoking compartment five passengers sit dozing shrouded in the twilight of the carriage They had just had a meal and now snugly ensconced in their seats they are trying to go to sleep Stillness The door opens and in there walks a tall lanky figure straight as a poker with a ginger coloured hat and a smart overcoat wonderfully suggestive of a journalist in Jules Verne or on the comic stage The figure stands still in the middle of the compartment for a long while breathing heavily screwing up his eyes and peering at the seats No wrong again he mutters What the deuce It s positively revolting No the wrong one again One of the passengers stares at the figure and utters a shout of joy Ivan Alexyevitch what brings you here Is it you The poker like gentleman starts stares blankly at the passenger and recognizing him claps his hands with delight Ha Pyotr Petrovitch he says How many summers how many winters I didn t know you were in this train How are you getting on I am all right the only thing is my dear fellow I ve lost my compartment and I simply can t find it What an idiot I am I ought to be thrashed The poker like gentleman sways a little unsteadily and sniggers Queer things do happen he continues I stepped out just after the second bell to get a glass of brandy I got it of course Well I thought since it s a long way to the next station it would be as well to have a second glass While I was thinking about it and drinking it the third bell rang I ran like mad and jumped into the first carriage I am an idiot I am the son of a hen But you seem in very good spirits observes Pyotr Petrovitch Come and sit down There s room and a welcome No no I m off to look for my carriage Good bye You ll fall between the carriages in the dark if you don t look out Sit down and when we get to a station you ll find your own compartment Sit down Ivan Alexyevitch heaves a sigh and irresolutely sits down facing Pyotr Petrovitch He is visibly excited and fidgets as though he were sitting on thorns Where are you travelling to Pyotr Petrovitch enquires I Into space There is such a turmoil in my head that I couldn t tell where I am going myself I go where fate takes me Ha ha My dear fellow have you ever seen a happy fool No Well then take a look at one You behold the happiest of mortals Yes Don t you see something from my face Well one can see you re a bit a tiny bit so so I dare say I look awfully stupid just now Ach it s a pity I haven t a looking glass I should like to look at my counting house My dear fellow I feel I am turning into an idiot honour bright Ha ha Would you believe it I m on my honeymoon Am I not the son of a hen You Do you mean to say you are married To day my dear boy We came away straight after the wedding Congratulations and the usual questions follow Well you are a fellow laughs Pyotr Petrovitch That s why you are rigged out such a dandy Yes indeed To complete the illusion I ve even sprinkled myself with scent I am over my ears in vanity No care no thought nothing but a sensation of something or other deuce knows what to call it beatitude or something I ve never felt so grand in my life Ivan Alexyevitch shuts his eyes and waggles his head I m revoltingly happy he says Just think in a minute I shall go to my compartment There on the seat near the window is sitting a being who is so to say devoted to you with her whole being A little blonde with a little nose little fingers My little darling My angel My little poppet Phylloxera of my soul And her little foot Good God A little foot not like our beetle crushers but something miniature fairylike allegorical I could pick it up and eat it that little foot Oh but you don t understand You re a materialist of course you begin analyzing at once and one thing and another You are cold hearted bachelors that s what you are When you get married you ll think of me Where s Ivan Alexyevitch now you ll say Yes so in a minute I m going to my compartment There she is waiting for me with impatience in joyful anticipation of my appearance She ll have a smile to greet me I sit down beside her and take her chin with my two fingers Ivan Alexyevitch waggles his head and goes off into a chuckle of delight Then I lay my noddle on her shoulder and put my arm round her waist Around all is silence you know poetic twilight I could embrace the whole world at such a moment Pyotr Petrovitch allow me to embrace you Delighted I m sure The two friends embrace while the passengers laugh in chorus And the happy bridegroom continues And to complete the idiocy or as the novelists say to complete the illusion one goes to the refreshment room and tosses off two or three glasses And then something happens in your head and your heart finer than you can read of in a fairy tale I am a man of no importance but I feel as though I were limitless I embrace the whole world The passengers looking at the tipsy and blissful bridegroom are infected by his cheerfulness and no longer feel sleepy Instead of one listener Ivan Alexyevitch has now an audience of five He wriggles and splutters gesticulates and prattles on without ceasing He laughs and they all laugh Gentlemen gentlemen don t think so much Damn all this analysis If you want a drink drink no need to philosophize as to whether it s bad for you or not Damn all this philosophy and psychology The guard walks through the compartment My dear fellow the bridegroom addresses him when you pass through the carriage No two hundred nine look out for a lady in a grey hat with a white bird and tell her I m here Yes sir Only there isn t a No two hundred nine in this train there s two hundred nineteen Well two hundred nineteen then It s all the same Tell that lady then that her husband is all right Ivan Alexyevitch suddenly clutches his head and groans Husband Lady All in a minute Husband Ha ha I am a puppy that needs thrashing and here I am a husband Ach idiot But think of her Yesterday she was a little girl a midget it s simply incredible Nowadays it really seems strange to see a happy man observes one of the passengers one as soon expects to see a white elephant Yes and whose fault is it says Ivan Alexyevitch stretching his long legs and thrusting out his feet with their very pointed toes If you are not happy it s your own fault Yes what else do you suppose it is Man is the creator of his own happiness If you want to be happy you will be but you don t want to be You obstinately turn away from happiness Why what next How do you make that out Very simply Nature has ordained that at a certain stage in his life man should love When that time comes you should love like a house on fire but you won t heed the dictates of nature you keep waiting for something What s more it s laid down by law that the normal man should enter upon matrimony There s no happiness without marriage When the propitious moment has come get married There s no use in shilly shallying But you don t get married you keep waiting for something Then the Scriptures tell us that wine maketh glad the heart of man If you feel happy and you want to feel better still then go to the refreshment bar and have a drink The great thing is not to be too clever but to follow the beaten track The beaten track is a grand thing You say that man is the creator of his own happiness How the devil is he the creator of it when a toothache or an ill natured mother in law is enough to scatter his happiness to the winds Everything depends on chance If we had an accident at this moment you d sing a different tune Stuff and nonsense retorts the bridegroom Railway accidents only happen once a year I m not afraid of an accident for there is no reason for one Accidents are exceptional Confound them I don t want to talk of them Oh I believe we

Petersburg express weeps the bridegroom the creator of his own happiness And how am I to get a ticket for the Petersburg express All my money is with my wife The passengers laughing and whispering together make a collection and furnish the happy man with funds A TROUBLESOME VISITOR IN the low pitched crooked little hut of Artyom the forester two men were sitting under the big dark ikon Artyom himself a short and lean peasant with a wrinkled aged looking face and a little beard that grew out of his neck and a well grown young man in a new crimson shirt and big wading boots who had been out hunting and come in for the night They were sitting on a bench at a little three legged table on which a tallow candle stuck into a bottle was lazily burning Outside the window the darkness of the night was full of the noisy uproar into which nature usually breaks out before a thunderstorm The wind howled angrily and the bowed trees moaned miserably One pane of the window had been pasted up with paper and leaves torn off by the wind could be heard pattering against the paper I tell you what good Christian said Artyom in a hoarse little tenor half whisper staring with unblinking scared looking eyes at the hunter I am not afraid of wolves or bears or wild beasts of any sort but I am afraid of man You can save yourself from beasts with a gun or some other weapon but you have no means of saving yourself from a wicked man To be sure you can fire at a beast but if you shoot at a robber you will have to answer for it you will go to Siberia I ve been forester my lad for thirty years and I couldn t tell you what I have had to put up with from wicked men There have been lots and lots of them here The hut s on a track it s a cart road and that brings them the devils Every sort of ruffian turns up and without taking off his cap or making the sign of the cross bursts straight in upon one with Give us some bread you old so and so And where am I to get bread for him What claim has he Am I a millionaire to feed every drunkard that passes They are half blind with spite They have no cross on them the devils They ll give you a clout on the ear and not think twice about it Give us bread Well one gives it One is not going to fight with them the idols Some of them are two yards across the shoulders and a great fist as big as your boot and you see the sort of figure I am One of them could smash me with his little finger Well one gives him bread and he gobbles it up and stretches out full length across the hut with not a word of thanks And there are some that ask for money Tell me where is your money As though I had money How should I come by it A forester and no money laughed the hunter You get wages every month and I ll be bound you sell timber on the sly Artyom took a timid sideway glance at his visitor and twitched his beard as a magpie twitches her tail You are still young to say a thing like that to me he said You will have to answer to God for those words Whom may your people be Where do you come from I am from Vyazovka I am the son of Nefed the village elder You have gone out for sport with your gun I used to like sport too when I was young H m Ah our sins are grievous said Artyom with a yawn It s a sad thing There are few good folks but villains and murderers no end God have mercy upon us You seem to be frightened of me too Come what next What should I be afraid of you for I see I understand You came in and not just anyhow but you made the sign of the cross you bowed all decent and proper I understand One can give you bread I am a widower I don t heat the stove I sold the samovar I am too poor to keep meat or anything else but bread you are welcome to At that moment something began growling under the bench the growl was followed by a hiss Artyom started drew up his legs and looked enquiringly at the hunter It s my dog worrying your cat said the hunter You devils he shouted under the bench Lie down You ll be beaten I say your cat s thin mate She is nothing but skin and bone She is old it is time she was dead So you say you are from Vyazovka I see you don t feed her Though she s a cat she s a creature every breathing thing You should have pity on her You are a queer lot in Vyazovka Artyom went on as though not listening The church has been robbed twice in one year To think that there are such wicked men So they fear neither man nor God To steal what is the Lord s Hanging s too good for them In old days the governors used to have such rogues flogged However you punish whether it is with flogging or anything else it will be no good you will not knock the wickedness out of a wicked man Save and preserve us Queen of Heaven The forester sighed abruptly Save us from all enemies and evildoers Last week at Volovy Zaimishtchy a mower struck another on the chest with his scythe he killed him outright And what was it all about God bless me One mower came out of the tavern drunk The other met him drunk too The young man who had been listening attentively suddenly started and his face grew tense as he listened Stay he said interrupting the forester I fancy someone is shouting The hunter and the forester fell to listening with their eyes fixed on the window Through the noise of the forest they could hear sounds such as the strained ear can always distinguish in every storm so that it was difficult to make out whether people were calling for help or whether the wind was wailing in the chimney But the wind tore at the roof tapped at the paper on the window and brought a distinct shout of Help Talk of your murderers said the hunter turning pale and getting up Someone is being robbed Lord have mercy on us whispered the forester and he too turned pale and got up The hunter looked aimlessly out of window and walked up and down the hut What a night what a night he muttered You can t see your hand before your face The very time for a robbery Do you hear There is a shout again The forester looked at the ikon and from the ikon turned his eyes upon the hunter and sank on to the bench collapsing like a man terrified by sudden bad news Good Christian he said in a tearful voice you might go into the passage and bolt the door And we must put out the light What for By ill luck they may find their way here Oh our sins We ought to be going and you talk of bolting the door You are a clever one Are you coming The hunter threw his gun over his shoulder and picked up his cap Get ready take your gun Hey Flerka here he called to his dog Flerka A dog with long frayed ears a mongrel between a setter and a house dog came out from under the bench He stretched himself by his master s feet and wagged his tail Why are you sitting there cried the hunter to the forester You mean to say you are not going Where To help How can I said the forester with a wave of his hand shuddering all over I can t bother about it Why won t you come After talking of such dreadful things I won t stir a step into the darkness Bless them And what should I go for What are you afraid of Haven t you got a gun Let us go please do It s scaring to go alone it will be more cheerful the two of us Do you hear There was a shout again Get up Whatever do you think of me lad wailed the forester Do you think I am such a fool to go straight to my undoing So you are not coming The forester did not answer The dog probably hearing a human cry gave a plaintive whine Are you coming I ask you cried the hunter rolling his eyes angrily You do keep on upon my word said the forester with annoyance Go yourself Ugh low cur growled the hunter turning towards the door Flerka here He went out and left the door open The wind flew into the hut The flame of the candle flickered uneasily flared up and went out As he bolted the door after the hunter the forester saw the puddles in the track the nearest pine trees and the retreating figure of his guest lighted up by a flash of lightning Far away he heard the rumble of thunder Holy holy holy whispered the forester making haste to thrust the thick bolt into the great iron rings What weather the Lord has sent us Going back into the room he felt his way to the stove lay down and covered himself from head to foot Lying under the sheepskin and listening intently he could no longer hear the human cry but the peals of thunder kept growing louder and more prolonged He could hear the big wind lashed raindrops pattering angrily on the panes and on the paper of the window He s gone on a fool s errand he thought picturing the hunter soaked with rain and stumbling over the tree stumps I bet his teeth are chattering with terror Not more than ten minutes later there was a sound of footsteps followed by a loud knock at the door Who s there cried the forester It s I he heard the young man s voice Unfasten the door The forester clambered down from the stove felt for the candle and lighting it went to the door The hunter and his dog were drenched to the skin They had come in for the heaviest of the downpour and now the water ran from them as from washed clothes before they have been wrung out What was it asked the forester A peasant woman driving in a cart she had got off the road answered the young man struggling with his breathlessness She was caught in a thicket Ah the silly thing She was frightened then Well did you put her on the road I don t care to talk to a scoundrel like you The young man flung his wet cap on the bench and went on I know now that you are a scoundrel and the lowest of men And you a keeper too getting a salary You blackguard The forester slunk with a guilty step to the stove cleared his throat and lay down The young man sat on the bench thought a little and lay down on it full length Not long afterwards he got up put out the candle and lay down again During a particularly loud clap of thunder he turned over spat on the floor and growled out He s afraid And what if the woman were being murdered Whose business is it to defend her And he an old man too and a Christian He s a pig and nothing else The forester cleared his throat and heaved a deep sigh Somewhere in the darkness Flerka shook his wet coat vigorously which sent drops of water flying about all over the room So you wouldn t care if the woman were murdered the hunter went on Well strike me God I had no notion you were that sort of man A silence followed The thunderstorm was by now over and the thunder came from far away but it was still raining And suppose it hadn t been a woman but you shouting Help said the hunter breaking the silence How would you feel you beast if no one ran to your aid You have upset me with your meanness plague take you After another long interval the hunter said You must have money to be afraid of people A man who is poor is not likely to be afraid For those words you will answer before God Artyom said hoarsely from the stove I have no money I dare say Scoundrels always have money Why are you afraid of people then So you must have I d like to take and rob you for spite to teach you a lesson Artyom slipped noiselessly from the stove lighted a candle and sat down under the holy image He was pale and did not take his eyes off the hunter Here I ll rob you said the hunter getting up What do you think about it Fellows like you want a lesson Tell me where is your money hidden Artyom drew his legs up under him and blinked What are you wriggling for Where is your money hidden Have you lost your tongue you fool Why don t you answer The young man jumped up and went up to the forester He is blinking like an owl Well Give me your money or I will shoot you with my gun Why do you keep on at me squealed the forester and big tears rolled from his eyes What s the reason of it God sees all You will have to answer for every word you say to God You have no right whatever to ask for my money The young man looked at Artyom s tearful face frowned and walked up and down the hut then angrily clapped his cap on his head and picked up his gun Ugh ugh it makes me sick to look at you he filtered through his teeth I can t bear the sight of you I won t sleep in your house anyway Good bye Hey Flerka The door slammed and the troublesome visitor went out with his dog Artyom bolted the door after him crossed himself and lay down AN ACTOR S END SHTCHIPTSOV the heavy father and good hearted simpleton a tall and thick set old man not so much distinguished by his talents as an actor as by his exceptional physical strength had a desperate quarrel with the manager during the performance and just when the storm of words was at its height felt as though something had snapped in his chest Zhukov the manager as a rule began at the end of every heated discussion to laugh hysterically and to fall into a swoon on this occasion however Shtchiptsov did not remain for this climax but hurried home The high words and the sensation of something ruptured in his chest so agitated him as he left the theatre that he forgot to wash off his paint and did nothing but take off his beard When he reached his hotel room Shtchiptsov spent a long time pacing up and down then sat down on the bed propped his head on his fists and sank into thought He sat like that without stirring or uttering a sound till two o clock the next afternoon when Sigaev the comic man walked into his room Why is it you did not come to the rehearsal Booby Ivanitch the comic man began panting and filling the room with fumes of vodka Where have you been Shtchiptsov made no answer but simply stared at the comic man with lustreless eyes under which there were smudges of paint You might at least have washed your phiz Sigaev went on You are a disgraceful sight Have you been boozing or are you ill or what But why don t you speak I am asking you are you ill Shtchiptsov did not speak In spite of the paint on his face the comic man could not help noticing his striking pallor the drops of sweat on his forehead and the twitching of his lips His hands and feet were trembling too and the whole huge figure of the good natured simpleton looked somehow crushed and flattened The comic man took a rapid glance round the room but saw neither bottle nor flask nor any other suspicious vessel I say Mishutka you know you are ill he said in a flutter Strike me dead you are ill You don t look yourself Shtchiptsov remained silent and stared disconsolately at the floor You must have caught cold said Sigaev taking him by the hand Oh dear how hot your hands are What s the trouble I wa ant to go home muttered Shtchiptsov But you are at home now aren t you No To Vyazma Oh my anywhere else It would take you three years to get to your Vyazma What do you want to go and see your daddy and mummy I ll be bound they ve kicked the bucket years ago and you won t find their graves My ho ome s there Come it s no good giving way to the dismal dumps These neurotic feelings are the limit old man You must get well for you have to play Mitka in The Terrible Tsar to morrow There is nobody else to do it Drink something hot and take some castor oil Have you got the money for some castor oil Or stay I ll run and buy some The comic man fumbled in his pockets found a fifteen kopeck piece and ran to the chemist s A quarter of an hour later he came back Come drink it he said holding the bottle to the heavy father s mouth Drink it straight out of the bottle All at a go That s the way Now nibble at a clove that your very soul mayn t stink of the filthy stuff The comic man sat a little longer with his sick friend then kissed him tenderly and went away Towards evening the jeune premier Brama Glinsky ran in to see Shtchiptsov The gifted actor was wearing a pair of prunella boots had a glove on his left hand was smoking a cigar and even smelt of heliotrope yet nevertheless he strongly suggested a traveller cast away in some land in which there were neither baths nor laundresses nor tailors I hear you are ill he said to Shtchiptsov twirling round on his heel What s wrong with you What s wrong with you really Shtchiptsov did not speak nor stir Why don t you speak Do you feel giddy Oh well don t talk I won t pester you don t talk Brama Glinsky that was his stage name in his passport he was called Guskov walked away to the window put his hands in his pockets and fell to gazing into the street Before his eyes stretched an immense waste bounded by a grey fence beside which ran a perfect forest of last year s burdocks Beyond the waste ground was a dark deserted factory with windows boarded up A belated jackdaw was flying round the chimney This dreary lifeless scene was beginning to be veiled in the dusk of evening I must go home the jeune premier heard Where is home To Vyazma to my home It is a thousand miles to Vyazma my boy sighed Brama Glinsky drumming on the window pane And what do you want to go to Vyazma for I want to die there What next Now he s dying He has fallen ill for the first time in his life and already he fancies that his last hour is come No my boy no cholera will carry off a buffalo like you You ll live to be a hundred Where s the pain There s no pain but I feel You don t feel anything it all comes from being too healthy Your surplus energy upsets you You ought to get jolly tight drink you know till your whole inside is topsy turvy Getting drunk is wonderfully restoring Do you remember how screwed you were at Rostov on the Don Good Lord the very thought of it is alarming Sashka and I together could only just carry in the barrel and you emptied it alone and even sent for rum afterwards You got so drunk you were catching devils in a sack and pulled a lamp post up by the roots Do you remember Then you went off to beat the Greeks Under the influence of these agreeable reminiscences Shtchiptsov s face brightened a little and his eyes began to shine And do you remember how I beat Savoikin the manager he muttered raising his head But there I ve beaten thirty three managers in my time and I can t remember how many smaller fry And what managers they were Men who would not permit the very winds to touch them I ve beaten two celebrated authors and one painter What are you crying for At Kherson I killed a horse with my fists And at Taganrog some roughs fell upon me at night fifteen of them I took off their caps and they followed me begging Uncle give us back our caps That s how I used to go on What are you crying for then you silly But now it s all over I feel it If only I could go to Vyazma A pause followed After a silence Shtchiptsov suddenly jumped up and seized his cap He looked distraught Good bye I am going to Vyazma he articulated staggering And the money for the journey H m I shall go on foot You are crazy The two men looked at each other probably because the same thought of the boundless plains the unending forests and swamps struck both of them at once Well I see you have gone off your head the jeune premier commented I ll tell you what old man First thing go to bed then drink some brandy and tea to put you into a sweat And some castor oil of course Stay where am I to get some brandy Brama Glinsky thought a minute then made up his mind to go to a shopkeeper called Madame Tsitrinnikov to try and get it from her on tick who knows perhaps the woman would feel for them and let them have it The jeune premier went off and half an hour later returned with a bottle of brandy and some castor oil Shtchiptsov was sitting motionless as before on the bed gazing dumbly at the floor He drank the castor oil offered him by his friend like an automaton with no consciousness of what he was doing Like an automaton he sat afterwards at the table and drank tea and brandy mechanically he emptied the whole bottle and let the jeune premier put him to bed The latter covered him up with a quilt and an overcoat advised him to get into a perspiration and went away The night came on Shtchiptsov had drunk a great deal of brandy but he did not sleep He lay motionless under the quilt and stared at the dark ceiling then seeing the moon looking in at the window he turned his eyes from the ceiling towards the companion of the earth and lay so with open eyes till the morning At nine o clock in the morning Zhukov the manager ran in What has put it into your head to be ill my angel he cackled wrinkling up his nose Aie aie A man with your physique has no business to be ill For shame for shame Do you know I was quite frightened Can our conversation have had such an effect on him I wondered My dear soul I hope it s not through me you ve fallen ill You know you gave me as good er And besides comrades can never get on without words You called me all sorts of names and have gone at me with your fists too and yet I am fond of you Upon my soul I am I respect you and am fond of you Explain my angel why I am so fond of you You are neither kith nor kin nor wife but as soon as I heard you had fallen ill it cut me to the heart Zhukov spent a long time declaring his affection then fell to kissing the invalid and finally was so overcome by his feelings that he began laughing hysterically and was even meaning to fall into a swoon but probably remembering that he was not at home nor at the theatre put off the swoon to a more convenient opportunity and went away Soon after him Adabashev the tragic actor a dingy short sighted individual who talked through his nose made his appearance For a long while he looked at Shtchiptsov for a long while he pondered and at last he made a discovery Do you know what Mifa he said pronouncing through his nose f instead of sh and assuming a mysterious expression Do you know what You ought to have a dose of castor oil Shtchiptsov was silent He remained silent too a little later as the tragic actor poured the loathsome oil into his mouth Two hours later Yevlampy or as the actors for some reason called him Rigoletto the hairdresser of the company came into the room He too like the tragic man stared at Shtchiptsov for a long time then sighed like a steam engine and slowly and deliberately began untying a parcel he had brought with him In it there were twenty cups and several little flasks You should have sent for me and I would have cupped you long ago he said tenderly baring Shtchiptsov s chest It is easy to neglect illness Thereupon Rigoletto stroked the broad chest of the heavy father and covered it all over with suction cups Yes he said as after this operation he packed up his paraphernalia crimson with Shtchiptsov s blood You should have sent for me and I would have come You needn t trouble about payment I do it from sympathy Where are you to get the money if that idol won t pay you Now please take these drops They are nice drops And now you must have a dose of this castor oil It s the real thing That s right I hope it will do you good Well now good bye Rigoletto took his parcel and withdrew pleased that he had been of assistance to a fellow creature The next morning Sigaev the comic man going in to see Shtchiptsov found him in a terrible condition He was lying under his coat breathing in gasps while his eyes strayed over the ceiling In his hands he was crushing convulsively the crumpled quilt To Vyazma he whispered when he saw the comic man To Vyazma Come I don t like that old man said the comic man flinging up his hands You see you see you see old man that s not the thing Excuse me but it s positively stupid To go to Vyazma My God to Vyazma I I did not expect it of you the comic man muttered utterly distracted What the deuce do you want to collapse like this for Aie aie aie that s not the thing A giant as tall as a watch tower and crying Is it the thing for actors to cry No wife nor children muttered Shtchiptsov I ought not to have gone for an actor but have stayed at Vyazma My life has been wasted Semyon Oh to be in Vyazma Aie aie aie that s not the thing You see it s stupid contemptible indeed Recovering his composure and setting his feelings in order Sigaev began comforting Shtchiptsov telling him untruly that his comrades had decided to send him to the Crimea at their expense and so on but the sick man did not listen and kept muttering about Vyazma At last with a wave of his hand the comic man began talking about Vyazma himself to comfort the invalid It s a fine town he said soothingly a capital town old man It s famous for its cakes The cakes are classical but between ourselves h m they are a bit groggy For a whole week after eating them I was h m But what is fine there is the merchants They are something like merchants When they treat you they do treat you The comic man talked while Shtchiptsov listened in silence and nodded his head approvingly Towards evening he died End of the Project Gutenberg
