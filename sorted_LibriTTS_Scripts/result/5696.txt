none	none	XXI FORT SUMTER IS FIRED UPON CHAPTER I SYLVIA Your name is in a song isn t it said Grace Waite as she and her new playmate Sylvia Fulton walked down the pleasant street on their way to school Is it Can you sing the song questioned Sylvia eagerly her blue eyes shining at what promised to be such a delightful discovery Grace nodded smilingly She was a year older than Sylvia nearly eleven years old and felt that it was quite proper that she should be able to explain to Sylvia more about her name than Sylvia knew herself It is something about spelling she explained and then sang very softly Then to Sylvia let us sing That Sylvia is spelling She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling I suppose it means she was the best speller Grace said soberly 
6627-67844-0000	train-other-500	I think it is a lovely song said Sylvia I ll tell my mother about it I am so glad you told me Grace Sylvia Fulton was ten years old and had lived in Charleston South Carolina for the past year Before that the Fultons had lived in Boston
6627-67844-0001	train-other-500	Grace Waite lived in the house next to the one which mister Fulton had hired in the beautiful southern city and the two little girls had become fast friends They both attended Miss Patten s school Usually Grace s black mammy Esther escorted them to and from Miss Patten s
6627-67844-0002	train-other-500	but on this morning in early October they were allowed to go by themselves As they walked along they could look out across the blue harbor and see sailing vessels and rowboats coming and going In the distance were the three forts whose historic names were known to every child in Charleston
6627-67844-0003	train-other-500	Grace never failed to point them out to the little northern girl and to repeat their names Castle Pinckney she would say pointing to the one nearest the city
none	none	 and then to the long dark forts at the mouth of the harbor 
6627-67844-0004	train-other-500	Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie Don t stop to tell me the names of those old forts this morning said Sylvia I know just as much about them now as you do We shall be late if we don t hurry Miss Patten s house stood in a big garden which ran nearly to the water s edge
6627-67844-0005	train-other-500	The schoolroom opened on each side to broad piazzas and there was always the pleasant fragrance of flowers in the big airy room Sylvia was sure that no one could be more beautiful than Miss Patten She looks just like one of the ladies in your Godey s Magazine
none	none	 she had told her mother on returning home from her first day at school 
6627-67844-0006	train-other-500	And with her pretty soft black curls her rosy cheeks and pleasant voice no one could imagine a more desirable teacher than Miss Rosalie Pattten There were just twelve little girls in her school There were never ten or fourteen
6627-67844-0007	train-other-500	Miss Patten would never engage to take more than twelve pupils and the twelve always came
none	none	 missus Waite Grace s mother had told missus Fulton that Sylvia was very fortunate to attend the school 
6627-67844-0008	train-other-500	School had opened the previous week and Sylvia had begun to feel quite at home with her new schoolmates The winter before missus Fulton had taught her little daughter at home
none	none	 so this was her first term at Miss Patten s 
6627-67844-0009	train-other-500	Miss Patten always stood near the schoolroom door until all her pupils had arrived As each girl entered the room she made a curtsey to the pretty teacher and then said good morning to the pupils who had already arrived and took her seat
none	none	 When the clock struck nine Miss Rosalie would take her place behind the desk on the platform at the further end of the room and say a little prayer 
6627-67844-0010	train-other-500	Then the pupils were ready for their lessons Isn t Miss Rosalie lovely Sylvia whispered as she and Grace moved to their seats and doesn t she wear pretty clothes Grace nodded She had been to Miss Rosalie s school for three years and she wondered a little at Sylvia s admiration for their teacher
none	none	 although she too thought Miss Patten looked exactly like a fashion plate 
6627-67844-0011	train-other-500	Grace was eager to get to her desk From where she sat she could see the grim lines of the distant forts and this morning they had a new value and interest for her for at breakfast she had heard her father say
none	none	 that although the forts were occupied by the soldiers of the United States Government 
6627-67844-0012	train-other-500	it was only justice that South Carolina should control them and if the State seceded from the Union Charleston must take possession of the forts With the consent of the United States Government if possible but if this was refused by force Grace had been thinking about this all the morning
none	none	 wondering if Charleston men would really send off the soldiers in the forts She had not spoken of this to Sylvia as they came along the street facing the harbor and now as she looked at the distant forts on guard at the entrance of the harbor 
6627-67844-0013	train-other-500	she resolved to ask Miss Rosalie why the United States should interfere with the Sovereign State of South Carolina which her father had said would defend its rights Question time was just before the morning session ended Then each pupil could ask a question
6627-67844-0014	train-other-500	But as a rule only one or two of the girls had any inquiry to make To day however there were several who had questions to ask and Grace waited with what patience she could until it was her turn When Miss Rosalie smiled at her and called her name Grace rose and said Please Miss Rosalie
none	none	 if Charleston owns the forts could anyone take them away 
6627-67844-0015	train-other-500	The teacher s dark eyes seemed to grow larger and brighter and she straightened her slender shoulders as if preparing to defend the rights of her State My dear girl who would question the right of South Carolina to control all forts on her territory
6627-67844-0016	train-other-500	We all realize that this is a time of uncertainty for our beloved State we may be treated with harshness with injustice but every loyal Carolinian will protect his State The little girls looked at each other with startled eyes What was Miss Rosalie talking about they wondered
6627-67844-0017	train-other-500	and what did Grace Waite mean about anybody taking Fort Sumter or Fort Moultrie
none	none	 Of course nobody could do such a thing 
6627-67844-0018	train-other-500	School was dismissed with less ceremony than usual that morning and the little girls started off in groups talking and questioning each other about what Miss Rosalie had said Two or three ran after Grace and Sylvia to ask Grace what she meant by her question
6627-67844-0019	train-other-500	Of course we know that northern people want to take our slaves away from us
none	none	 declared Elinor Mayhew the oldest girl in school whose dark eyes and curling hair 
6627-67844-0020	train-other-500	were greatly admired by auburn haired blue eyed Sylvia but of course they can t do that But how could they take our forts I don t know responded Grace That s why I asked Miss Rosalie I guess I ll have to ask my father
6627-67844-0021	train-other-500	We ll all ask our fathers said Elinor and to morrow we will tell each other what they say I don t suppose YOUR father would care if the forts were taken and she turned suddenly toward Sylvia
6627-67844-0022	train-other-500	I suppose all the Yankees would like to tell us what we ought to do Sylvia looked at her in surprise The tall girl had never taken any notice of the little Boston girl before and Sylvia could not understand why Elinor should look at her so scornfully or speak so unkindly
6627-67844-0023	train-other-500	The other girls had stopped talking and now looked at Sylvia as if wondering what she would say I don t know what you mean she answered bravely but I know one thing my father would want what was right That s real Yankee talk said Elinor
6627-67844-0024	train-other-500	They say slavery isn t right There was a little murmur of laughter among the other girls For in eighteen sixty the people of South Carolina believed they were quite right in buying negroes for slaves and in selling them when they desired
6627-67844-0025	train-other-500	so these little girls some of whom already owned a colored girl who waited upon them had no idea but what slavery was a right and natural condition and were amused at Elinor s words
none	none	 Why do you want to be so hateful Elinor 
6627-67844-0026	train-other-500	demanded Grace before Sylvia could reply Sylvia has not said or done anything to make you talk to her this way and Grace linked her arm in Sylvia s and stood facing the other girls Well Grace Waite you can associate with Yankees if you wish to
none	none	 But my mother says that Miss Patten ought not to have Sylvia Fulton in her school 
6627-67844-0027	train-other-500	Come on girls Grace Waite can do as she pleases and Elinor followed by two or three of the older girls went scornfully down the street Sylvia Wait and a little girl about Sylvia s age came running down the path It was Flora Hayes
6643_67851_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Flora 
none	none	Hayes 
6627-67844-0028	train-other-500	and next to Grace Waite Sylvia liked her the best of any of her new companions Don t mind what Elinor Mayhew says She s always horrid when she dares to be said Flora Flora s father was a wealthy cotton planter
6627-67844-0029	train-other-500	and their Charleston home was in one of the historic mansions of that city Beside that there was the big old house on the Ashley River ten miles from the city where the family stayed a part of the time
none	none	 Flora s eyes were as blue as Sylvia s and her hair was very much the same color 
6627-67844-0030	train-other-500	She was always smiling and friendly and was better liked than Elinor Mayhew who as Flora said was always ready to tease the younger girls I don t know what she meant said Sylvia as with Grace on one side and Flora on the other they started toward home She is just hateful declared Grace
none	none	 I wish I had not asked Miss Rosalie about the forts 
6627-67844-0031	train-other-500	But I did want to know It would be dreadful not to see them where they have always been
none	none	 Oh Grace You didn t think they were going to move the forts to Washington did you laughed Flora 
6627-67844-0032	train-other-500	I know better than that Taking the forts means that the Government of the United States would own them instead of South Carolina Grace laughed good naturedly
none	none	 She was always as ready to laugh at her own mistakes as at those of others and in the year that Sylvia had known her she had never seen Grace vexed or angry 
6627-67844-0033	train-other-500	Both Grace and Flora advised Sylvia not to tell her mother of Elinor s unkindness or of her taunting words
none	none	 But it was rather difficult for Sylvia to keep a secret from her mother 
6627-67844-0034	train-other-500	You see it will make your mother sorry and she will fret about it Flora had said
none	none	 and at this Sylvia had decided that no matter what happened at school 
6627-67844-0035	train-other-500	she would not tell her mother about it She almost dreaded seeing Elinor again and wondered why Elinor s mother had not wanted Miss Patten to take her as a pupil mister and missus Fulton were surprised when at supper time Sylvia demanded to know what a Yankee was
6627-67844-0036	train-other-500	She thought her mother looked a little troubled But her father smiled Yankee is what Britishers call all Americans he answered Then Elinor Mayhew is just as much a Yankee as I am
6627-67844-0037	train-other-500	thought Sylvia and she smiled so radiantly at the thought that missus Fulton was reassured and did not question her The next day was Saturday and mister Fulton had planned to take his wife and Sylvia to Fort Moultrie
none	none	 The military band of the fort played every afternoon and the parapet of the fort was a daily promenade for many Charleston people 
6627-67844-0038	train-other-500	During the summer workmen had been making necessary repairs on the fortifications but visitors were always welcomed by the officers in charge one of whom Captain Carleton was a college friend of Sylvia s father
6627-67844-0039	train-other-500	Sylvia could row a small boat very well and her father had purchased a pretty sailboat which he was teaching her to steer She often went with her father on trips about the harbor and the little girl always thought that these excursions were the most delightful of pleasures
6627-67844-0040	train-other-500	There was a favorable breeze this Saturday afternoon and the little boat with its shining white paint and snowy sail skimmed swiftly across the harbor Sylvia watched the little waves which seemed to dance forward to meet them
6627-67844-0041	train-other-500	looked at the many boats and vessels and quite forgot Elinor Mayhew s unkindness Her mother and father were talking of the black servants whom they had hired with the house of mister Robert Waite Grace s uncle
6627-67844-0042	train-other-500	Sylvia heard them speak of Aunt Connie the good natured black cook who lived in a cabin behind the Fultons kitchen Aunt Connie wants to bring her little girl to live with her Their master is willing if we have no objections Sylvia heard her mother say Oh let the child come mister Fulton responded
none	none	 how old is she Just Sylvia s age Her name is Estralla replied missus Fulton You ll have a little darky for a playmate Sylvia How will you like that her father asked But before Sylvia could answer the boat swung alongside the landing place at the fort and she saw her father s friend Captain Carleton waiting to welcome them The band was playing and a few people were on the parapet Not many visitors to day said the Captain as they all walked on together I am afraid the Charleston people resent the fact that the United States is protecting its property As they walked along the Captain pointed to the sand which the wind had blown into heaps about the sea front of the old fort A child of ten could easily come into the fort over those sand banks he said Whose fort is this asked Sylvia so earnestly that both the Captain and her father smiled It belongs to the United States of which South Carolina is one replied the Captain Sylvia gave a little sigh of satisfaction Even Elinor Mayhew could not find any fault with that she thought and she was eager to get home and tell Grace what the Captain had said On the way back Sylvia asked her mother if she knew that there was a song with her name in it Why of course dear child You were named for that very Sylvia replied her mother Then to Sylvia let us sing That Sylvia is excelling She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling To her let us garlands bring sang missus Fulton and you can thank your father for choosing your name she added gaily Oh But Grace said it was about spelling explained Sylvia but I like your way best she added quickly There were a good many pleasant things for Sylvia to think of that night Not every girl could be named out of a song she reflected Then there was the little colored girl Estralla who was to arrive the next day and besides these interesting facts she had discovered who really owned the forts and could tell her schoolmates on Monday All these pleasant happenings made Sylvia forgetful of Elinor Mayhew s unkindness Before bedtime she had learned the words of the song from which she was named She knew Grace would think that excelling was much better than spelling CHAPTER II A NEW FRIEND The next morning Sylvia was awakened by a tapping on her chamber door Usually Jennie the colored girl who helped Aunt Connie in the work of the house would come into the room before Sylvia was awake with a big pitcher of hot water 
6614-67845-0000	train-other-500	and Sylvia would open her eyes to see Jennie unfastening the shutters and spreading out the fresh clothes So this morning she wondered what the tapping meant and called out Come in The door opened very slowly and a little negro girl
6614-67845-0001	train-other-500	with a round woolly head and big startled eyes stood peering in She was barefooted and wore a straight garment of faded blue cotton For a moment the two children stared at each other
6614-67845-0002	train-other-500	Then Sylvia remembered that Aunt Connie s little girl was coming to live with her mother Are you Estralla she asked eagerly sitting up in bed Yas Missy replied the little darky lifting the big pitcher of water and bringing it into the room
6614-67845-0003	train-other-500	where she stood holding it as if not knowing what to do next Set the pitcher down said Sylvia Yas Missy said Estralla her big eyes fixed on the little white girl in the pretty bed who was smiling at her in so friendly a fashion
6614-67845-0004	train-other-500	She took a step or two forward her eyes still fixed on Sylvia and not noticing the little footstool directly in front of her over which she stumbled with a loud crash breaking the pitcher and sending the hot water over her bare feet Oh Mammy Mammy
6614-67845-0005	train-other-500	Mammy she screamed lying face downward on the floor with the overturned footstool and broken pitcher while the steaming water soaked through the cotton dress In a moment Sylvia was out of bed Get up Estralla she commanded
6614-67845-0006	train-other-500	and stop screaming The little darky s wails ceased and she looked up at the slender white figure standing in front of her
none	none	 I kyan t git up 
6614-67845-0007	train-other-500	I se all scalded and cut she sobbed an if I does get up
none	none	 I se gwine to get whipped for breaking the pitcher 
6614-67845-0008	train-other-500	and at the thought of new trouble in store for her she began to scream again Get up this minute said Sylvia I don t believe the water was hot enough to scald you it never is really hot Here help me sop it up and grabbing her bath towel
6614-67845-0009	train-other-500	Sylvia began to mop up the little stream of water which was trickling across the floor Estralla managed to get to her feet She was still holding fast to the handle of the broken pitcher The front of her cotton dress was soaked but she was not hurt
6614-67845-0010	train-other-500	I ll get whipped yas m I will fer breaking the pitcher You won t declared Sylvia half angrily It s my mother s pitcher and I ll tell her you didn t mean to break it Now you go and put on another dress and tell Jennie to come up here and wipe up this floor
6614-67845-0011	train-other-500	I ain t got no other dress an if I goes an tells I ll get whipped persisted the child Sylvia began to wonder what she could do She thought Estralla was stupid and clumsy to fall down and break the pitcher
6614-67845-0012	train-other-500	and now she thought her silly to be so frightened I tells you Missy I su ly will be whipped she repeated so earnestly that Sylvia began to believe it An when my mammy sees my dress all wet and Estralla began to sob
6614-67845-0013	train-other-500	but so quietly that Sylvia realized the little darky was really frightened and unhappy Don t cry Estralla she said more gently patting her on the shoulder I ll tell you what to do You are just about my size and I ll give you one of my dresses
6614-67845-0014	train-other-500	It s pink and it s faded a little but it s pretty And you take this towel and wipe up the floor as well as you can Then you slip off your dress and put on mine While Sylvia talked Estralla stopped crying and began to look a little more cheerful
6614-67845-0015	train-other-500	Sylvia ran to the closet and was back in a moment with a pink checked gingham It had a number of tiny ruffles on the skirt and a little frill of lace around the neck Landy You don t mean I kin KEEP that Missy exclaimed Estralla
6614-67845-0016	train-other-500	her face radiant at the very thought Yes quick Somebody may come Slip off your dress In a moment the old blue frock lay in a little heap on the floor and Sylvia had slipped the pink dress over Estralla s head and was fastening it
6614-67845-0017	train-other-500	The little darky chuckled and laughed now as if she had not a trouble in the world Listen Estralla Here pick up every bit of the pitcher and put the pieces on the chair Nobody shall know that you broke it
none	none	 And now you take this wet towel and your dress and spread them somewhere outdoors to dry 
6614-67845-0018	train-other-500	You can tell your mammy I gave you the dress Now run quick My mother may come Estralla stood quite still looking at Sylvia She had stopped laughing
none	none	 Will you mammy scold you bout dat pitcher 
6614-67845-0019	train-other-500	she asked I don t know Anyway nobody shall know that you broke it You won t be whipped Run along urged Sylvia But Estralla did not move I don t keer if I is whipped she announced
none	none	 I guess mebbe my mammy won t whip hard 
6614-67845-0020	train-other-500	Sylvia Sylvia sounded her mother s voice and both the little girls looked at each other with startled eyes Run said Sylvia giving Estralla a little push Run out on the balcony
6614-67845-0021	train-other-500	Estralla did not question the command and in a moment carrying dress and towel
none	none	 she had vanished through the open window 
6614-67845-0022	train-other-500	Why child What has happened exclaimed missus Fulton coming into the room and looking at the overturned footstool the pieces of the broken pitcher and at Sylvia standing in the middle of the floor with an anxious half frightened expression
6614-67845-0023	train-other-500	Don t look so frightened dear child A broken pitcher isn t worth it said missus Fulton smilingly It s only hot water and won t hurt anything Only Father is waiting for breakfast so use cold water this morning Here is your blue muslin I ll tie your sash when you come down
6614-67845-0024	train-other-500	and giving Sylvia a kiss her mother hurried away My landy whispered Estralla peering in from the balcony window Your mammy s a angel An so is you Missy
none	none	 I was gwine tell her the trufe if she d scolded I su ly was 
6614-67845-0025	train-other-500	Landy I d a sight ruther be whipped than have you scolded Missy Sylvia looked at her in astonishment Estralla with round serious eyes stood gazing at her as if she was ready to do anything that Sylvia could possibly ask Run
6614-67845-0026	train-other-500	It s all right said Sylvia with a little smile and Estralla with a backward look over her shoulder went slowly out of the room I m gwine to recollect this jes as long as I live Estralla whispered as she made her way back to the kitchen
6614-67845-0027	train-other-500	Nobuddy ever cared if I was whipped before or if I wasn t whipped An I ll do somethin fer Missy sometime I will An she give me dis fine dress too She bent over and smoothed out one of the little ruffles and chuckled happily
6614-67845-0028	train-other-500	Her mammy was busy preparing breakfast when Estralla slid quietly into the kitchen When she did look around and saw the child wearing the pink dress she nearly dropped the dish of hot bacon which Jennie was waiting to take to the dining room
none	none	 Wha on earth did you get you pink dress 
6614-67845-0029	train-other-500	Did Missy give it to you Well you step out to the cabin and take it off This minute Put you blue frock right on Like as not her mammy won t let you keep it and Aunt Connie hurried Jennie off to the dining room with the breakfast tray
6614-67845-0030	train-other-500	Estralla did not know what to do Her blue dress was hung over a syringa bush behind the cabin And at the dreadful thought that missus Fulton might take away the pink dress she began to cry Missy Sylvia said twas faded She said to put it on
6614-67845-0031	train-other-500	whimpered Estralla Aunt Connie began to be more hopeful If the dress was faded and she turned and looked at it more closely Well honey tis faded An I guess Missy Sylvia s mammy won take it back
6614-67845-0032	train-other-500	An it s the Sabbath day so you jes wear it she said patting the little woolly head Mammy s glad to have you dressed up but you be mighty keerful Yas Mammy I jes love Missy Sylvia replied the little girl
6614-67845-0033	train-other-500	now all smiles and forgetting how nearly she had come to serious trouble Nothing more was said to Sylvia about the broken pitcher but when Jennie put the room in order and brought down the broken pieces Aunt Connie exclaimed Good massy
6614-67845-0034	train-other-500	It s a good thing my Estralla didn t do that I d a cuffed her well I su ly would Sylvia did not think to tell her mother about the gift of the pink dress to Estralla She did not feel quite happy that she had not explained the broken pitcher to her mother
6614-67845-0035	train-other-500	but she had promised Estralla that she would not tell and Sylvia knew that a promise was a very serious thing something not to be easily forgotten She did not see Estralla again that day
6614-67845-0036	train-other-500	and Jennie brought the hot water as usual the next morning Grace and Mammy Esther called for Sylvia on Monday morning and Sylvia at once told her friend that she had been named from the song This seemed very wonderful to Grace and she listened to Sylvia s explanation of
6614-67845-0037	train-other-500	excelling instead of spelling and said she didn t think it was of any consequence But when Sylvia told her what Captain Carleton had said about the forts Grace shook her head and looked very serious Don t tell Elinor Mayhew Sylvia
6614-67845-0038	train-other-500	Because really South Carolina does own the forts My father said so He said that South Carolina was a Sovereign State she concluded What s that What s a sovereign questioned Sylvia Grace shook her head
6614-67845-0039	train-other-500	It had sounded like a very fine thing when her father had spoken it so she had repeated it with great pride We can ask Miss Rosalie she suggested Mammy Esther left the girls at the gate of Miss Patten s garden As they went up the path
6614-67845-0040	train-other-500	Flora Hayes came to meet them I was waiting for you she said
none	none	 I want to ask you both to come out to our plantation next Saturday and spend Sunday 
6614-67845-0041	train-other-500	My mother is going to write and ask your mothers if they will give me the pleasure of your company I am sure I can come declared Grace and I think it s lovely of you to ask me
none	none	 You ll come won t you Sylvia said Flora putting her arm over the little girl s shoulders as they went up the steps
6643_67858_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed 
6643_67857_000053_000010	train-clean-360	Yes indeed 
6614-67845-0042	train-other-500	Yes indeed thank you very much for asking me replied Sylvia She had visited the Hayes plantation early in the summer and thought it a more wonderful place even than the big mansion on Tradd Street
6614-67845-0043	train-other-500	where the Hayes family lived in the winter months mister Hayes owned hundreds of negroes and raised a great quantity of cotton The house at the plantation was large with many balconies and cool pleasant rooms
6614-67845-0044	train-other-500	Flora had a pair of white ponies and there were pigeons and a number of dogs Sylvia was sure that it would be a beautiful visit especially as Grace would be there As she went smilingly toward her seat in the schoolroom she passed Elinor Mayhew who was already seated
6614-67845-0045	train-other-500	Yankee whispered Elinor sharply looking at her with scornful eyes But Sylvia remembering that her father had said that all Americans were Yankees
none	none	 nodded to the older girl and responded Yankee your self CHAPTER III SYLVIA IN TROUBLE The Hayes plantation was about ten miles distant from Charleston on the opposite side of the Ashley River Flora told Sylvia and Grace that the Hayes coachman would drive them out 
6614-67846-0001	train-other-500	and that they would start early on Saturday morning Sylvia remembering her former visit knew well how delightful the drive would be and thinking of the pleasure in store quite forgot to be troubled by Elinor Mayhew s hostility
6614-67846-0002	train-other-500	At recess the girls usually walked about in the garden or tossed a ball back and forth Miss Rosalie would sit on the broad piazza overlooking the garden her fingers busy with some piece of delicate embroidery To day
6614-67846-0003	train-other-500	as they filed out and down the steps Elinor whispered to several of her companions And suddenly Sylvia realized that she was standing alone Grace Waite had lingered to speak to Miss Rosalie
6614-67846-0004	train-other-500	Flora had been excused just before recess as her black mammy had arrived with a note from missus Hayes The other girls were gathered in a little group about Elinor who was evidently telling them something of great interest
6614-67846-0005	train-other-500	Sylvia walked slowly along toward a little summer house where Miss Patten sometimes had little tea parties She hoped Grace would not stay long with Miss Patten The other girls were between Sylvia and the arbor and none of them moved to let her pass
6614-67846-0006	train-other-500	nor did any of them speak to her as she paused with a word of greeting Now girls she heard Elinor say and the others half under their breath but only too distinctly for Sylvia
none	none	 called out Yankee Yankee Then like a flock of bright colored birds they ran swiftly into the summer house For a moment Sylvia stood quite still She realized that Elinor meant to be hateful but she remembered that her father had said that all Americans were called Yankees and she was not a coward She went straight on to the arbor 
6614-67846-0007	train-other-500	Elinor Mayhew stood on the steps You are just as much a Yankee as I am And you ought to be proud of it declared Sylvia facing the older girl Hear that girls called Elinor to the group about her
6614-67846-0008	train-other-500	There was a little angry murmur from the others Don t you dare say that again Miss Boston called May Bailey who stood next to Elinor Sylvia was now thoroughly angry
6614-67846-0009	train-other-500	She knew of no reason why these girls should treat her in so unkind a fashion She felt very desolate and unhappy but she faced them bravely Yankees Yankees It s what all Americans are she declared defiantly
6614-67846-0010	train-other-500	In an instant the little girls were all about her Elinor Mayhew was holding her hands and the others were pushing her along the path to the shore The thick growing shrubs hid them from the house Sylvia did not cry out or speak
6614-67846-0011	train-other-500	She was not at all afraid nor did she resist We ought to make her take it back said May Bailey as Elinor stopped and they all stood in a close group about Sylvia
none	none	 Of course she s got to take it back and apologize on her knees declared Elinor 
6614-67846-0012	train-other-500	She might as well learn that South Carolinians will not be insulted and Elinor lifted her head proudly I won t take it back retorted Sylvia and you are the ones who will have to apologize Yes
6614-67846-0013	train-other-500	every one of you before I will ever speak to you again Hear that girls
none	none	 Wouldn t it be dreadful if she never spoke to us again sneered Elinor 
6614-67846-0014	train-other-500	She means she will tell Miss Rosalie said one of the girls I don t either I can look after my own afffairs retorted Sylvia bravely I m not a tell tale
none	none	 Although I suppose girls who act the way you do would tell 
6614-67846-0015	train-other-500	Get down on your knees commanded Elinor trying to push the little girl There s the bell and they all turned and scampered back to the house leaving Sylvia on the path
6614-67846-0016	train-other-500	for Elinor had let go of her so suddenly that she had fallen forward Her knees were hurt and one of her hands was bruised by the fall For a moment she lay sobbing quietly She was angry and miserable
6614-67846-0017	train-other-500	She had been brave enough when the girls had seemed to threaten her but now her courage was gone She could not go back to the schoolroom and face all those enemies If Miss Rosalie came in search of her she might not be able to resist telling her what had happened
6614-67846-0018	train-other-500	and miserable and unhappy as she was Sylvia resolved that she would never tell But Elinor Mayhew and all the rest of them shall be sorry for this Yes
6614-67846-0019	train-other-500	they shall she sobbed as she got to her feet and turned toward the shore She knew she must either go straight back to the schoolroom or else find a hiding place until they had ceased to search for her There was a wall at the foot of the garden covered with fragrant jessamine and myrtle
6614-67846-0020	train-other-500	If she could only get over that wall thought Sylvia she would be safe She ran swiftly forward and began to scramble up grasping the sturdy vines and finding a foothold on some bit of rough brick
6614-67846-0021	train-other-500	She reached the top just as she heard Miss Rosalie s servant calling her name Sylvia looked down to the further side The vines drooped over and below the wall a high bank of sand sloped to the shore Holding tight to the vines she slid down
6614-67846-0022	train-other-500	hitting her bruised knees against the rough surface The vines cut her hands and when she tumbled into the sand her dress was torn and soiled her pretty hair ribbon was gone and her once white stockings were grimy Beside these misfortunes her hands were bleeding
6614-67846-0023	train-other-500	Never in all her life had Sylvia been so wretched She sat quite still in the warm sand and wondered what she could do If she went home her mother would insist upon an explanation of her untidy condition Beside that
6614-67846-0024	train-other-500	Sylvia was not sure if she could find her way home unless she climbed back into the garden She looked along the shore at the landing place not far distant where several boats were bobbing up and down in the wash of the incoming tide
6614-67846-0025	train-other-500	She could see boats coming and going between the forts and the city She could see grim Fort Sumter with its guns that seemed to look straight at her She watched a schooner coming across the bay and realized that it was coming to that very wharf
6614-67846-0026	train-other-500	A number of men landed and several carts came down and boxes were unloaded and negroes carried them to the schooner Sylvia got up and walked along the shore until she was near the wharf and stood watching the negroes as they lifted the heavy boxes
6614-67846-0027	train-other-500	She wished she could ask one of them to tell her the way home Then she noticed a tall figure in uniform coming up the wharf It s Captain Carleton she exclaimed joyfully quite forgetting for the moment her torn dress and scratched hands as she ran toward him
none	none	 Why 
6614-67846-0028	train-other-500	Is it Sylvia Fulton exclaimed the surprised Captain looking down at the untidy little figure Why what has happened Oh dear sobbed Sylvia I guess I m lost
6643_67858_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear 
none	none	sobbed Sylvia I guess I m lost 
6614-67846-0029	train-other-500	Well well It s lucky you came down to this wharf
none	none	 Come on board the schooner and we ll see to these little hands first thing 
6614-67846-0030	train-other-500	and the good natured Captain rested a kindly hand on the little girl s shoulder and walked down the wharf Sylvia heard the men talking of the Charleston Arsenal and of the boxes of arms which were to be taken on the schooner to Fort Sumter
6614-67846-0031	train-other-500	The Captain bathed the little hurt hands and flushed face talking pleasantly to the little girl about the schooner and asking her if she did not think it a much finer craft than her father s small boat so in a little while she was comforted and quite at home
6614-67846-0032	train-other-500	Now sit here by the cabin window and I will come back and take you home as soon as I settle this trouble about my supplies and the Captain hurried back to the wharf Sylvia sat quite still and looked out of the round port hole
6614-67846-0033	train-other-500	She felt very tired and leaned her head against the cushioned wall She could hear the monotonous chant of the negroes and feel the swaying motion of the vessel and soon was fast asleep
6614-67846-0034	train-other-500	She did not know when the schooner was towed out into the channel nor when the sails were hoisted and they went sailing down the bay For Captain Carleton had entirely forgotten his little guest
6614-67846-0035	train-other-500	When he hurried back to the wharf he discovered a little group of Charleston citizens one of whom was Elinor Mayhew s father disputing the right of the United States officers to take guns from the Charleston Arsenal to Fort Sumter and when the matter was settled
none	none	 he had hurried the departure of the vessel 
6614-67846-0036	train-other-500	Not until they were ready to land at the fort did he remember his little friend He went down to the cabin and found Sylvia fast asleep Poor little Yankee
6614-67846-0037	train-other-500	I wonder what will happen to her if South Carolina really leaves the Union he thought and then his face grew troubled as he remembered that mister and missus Fulton must be in great trouble and anxiety over the disappearance of their little daughter
6614-67846-0038	train-other-500	But first of all he must see the schooner s cargo safely unloaded at Fort Sumter and send his men back to Fort Moultrie
none	none	 then he would take Sylvia home or find some way to notify her parents that she was safe and well cared for CHAPTER IV 
6614-67847-0000	train-other-500	AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY When Sylvia did not come in with the other girls Miss Patten sent a maid in search of her But she did not search very carefully She called Sylvia s name a few times sauntered about the garden
6614-67847-0001	train-other-500	and then reported Can t find Missy Sylvia She was then told to go straight to missus Fulton s house on the East Battery and see if Miss Sylvia had reached home Miss Patten did not feel anxious
6614-67847-0002	train-other-500	She thought it probable that the little northern girl did not realize the rules of the school had become tired and so started for home Did Miss Sylvia say anything to any of you young ladies about leaving the grounds
none	none	 she questioned the pupils 
6614-67847-0003	train-other-500	But they all declared that they knew nothing of her whereabouts She was on the path behind us when the bell rang volunteered May Bailey Elinor s face was unusually flushed and she kept her eyes on her book Probably
6614-67847-0004	train-other-500	the little Yankee as she called Sylvia even in her thoughts had run home to tell her mother of the trouble By the time Miss Patten s messenger had reached the Fulton house Sylvia was in the cabin of the little schooner
6614-67847-0005	train-other-500	The girl gave her message to missus Fulton in so indefinite a manner that at first Sylvia s mother hardly understood whether Sylvia was in the garden of the school or had started for home Estralla was standing near the steps and began whimpering
6643_67851_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Missy 
none	none	Sylvia los That w at she say She lost 
6614-67847-0006	train-other-500	Nonsense Estralla Sylvia could not be lost in Miss Patten s garden said missus Fulton but she decided to return to the school with the maid As they went down the street
none	none	 Estralla followed close behind Her bare feet made no noise but now and then she choked back a despairing little wail For the little colored girl was sure that some harm had befallen her new friend When missus Fulton appeared at the school room door Miss Patten was greatly alarmed Elinor Mayhew and May Bailey exchanged a look of surprised apprehension They felt sure that Sylvia had hurried home and told her mother just what had happened If she had and missus Fulton had come to inform Miss Patten they knew there would be unpleasant things in store for them In a short time a thorough search for the lost girl was in progress Servants were sent along the streets and missus Fulton hastened home thinking it possible that Sylvia might be in her own room No one paid any attention to the little colored girl in the faded blue cotton gown 
6614-67847-0007	train-other-500	who wandered about the paths and around the summer house Estralla noticed two of the older girls talking together and heard the taller one say Well wherever she is she needn t think we will ever take back one word She IS a Yankee
6614-67847-0008	train-other-500	They se done somethin to my missy decided Estralla They se scairt her She ran down the path toward the wall at the end of the garden and stopped suddenly for right in front of her caught on the jessamine vine which grew over the wall
6614-67847-0009	train-other-500	she saw a fluttering blue ribbon Dat s off n Missy Sylvia s hair dat ribbon is she whispered reaching up for it Holding it fast in her hands she looked closely at the mass of heavy vines and nodded her little woolly head
none	none	 Dat s w at she done She dumb right up here to git away frum those imps o Satan w at was a plaguein her 
6614-67847-0010	train-other-500	decided Estralla and in an instant she was going up the wall in a much easier manner than had been possible for Sylvia She dropped on the further side just as Sylvia had done and traced Sylvia s steps to near the landing place
6614-67847-0011	train-other-500	Then she stopped short Men were loading boxes on a schooner at the end of the pier and she could see a tall officer in uniform standing on the deck of the vessel Hullo here s another small girl
6614-67847-0012	train-other-500	Black one this time said one of the white sailors Yas Massa Please
none	none	 whar is my missy 
6614-67847-0013	train-other-500	replied the little darky eagerly Safe in the cabin nodded the good natured man Estralla slipped behind a pile of boxes and watched for a chance to get on board the vessel without being seen She had heard many tales
6614-67847-0014	train-other-500	told by the older colored people of little children yes and grown people too who had been enticed on board vessels in far off African ports and carried off to be sold into slavery Estralla remembered that all those people in the stories were black
none	none	 but who could tell but what there was some place in the world where white people were sold 
6614-67847-0015	train-other-500	Anyway she resolved that wherever Missy Sylvia went she would go with her In a few moments she saw a chance to run over the gangplank She went straight toward the cabin door and peered in
6614-67847-0016	train-other-500	Yes there was Missy Sylvia on the broad cushioned seat under the window Very softly Estralla tiptoed across the cabin Just as she was about to speak Sylvia s name the sound of approaching footsteps startled her and
6614-67847-0017	train-other-500	sure that she would be sent on shore by whoever might discover her she looked about for a hiding place and the next instant she was curled up under the very seat on which Sylvia was asleep It was not long before Estralla followed her missy s example
6614-67847-0018	train-other-500	But she was wide awake when Captain Carleton came into the cabin As soon as he returned to the deck Estralla crawled out from her hiding place and looked about her Wake up Missy she whispered leaning over Sylvia
6614-67847-0019	train-other-500	and Sylvia sat up quickly with a little cry of astonishment Don t you be skeered said Estralla softly
none	none	 cause I ain gwine to let you be carried off 
6614-67847-0020	train-other-500	I knows jes how slaves are ketched Yas m I does My mammy tole me
none	none	 They gits folks in ships and carries em off an sells em to folks An I ain gwine to let em have you Missy 
6614-67847-0021	train-other-500	There were tears in Estralla s eyes She knew that her own brother had been sold the previous year and taken to a plantation in Florida She had heard her mother say that she Estralla might be sold any time She knew that slavery was a dreadful thing
none	none	 Where are they taking us questioned Sylvia 
6614-67847-0022	train-other-500	for she realized that the vessel was moving swiftly through the water She wondered why Captain Carleton had gone away Seeing Estralla there gave her a dreadful certainty that what the little darky said might be true
6614-67847-0023	train-other-500	Perhaps the vessel might have others on board who were being taken off to be sold as Estralla declared Yas Missy My mammy s tole me jes how white folks gets black folks fer slaves
none	none	 Takes em away from their mammies an never lets em go back 
6614-67847-0024	train-other-500	Yas And Estralla s big eyes grew round with terror But I am a white girl Estralla said Sylvia Estralla shook her head dolefully Yas Missy But I se gwine to git you safe home
6643_67857_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla shook her head 
none	none	dolefully Yas Missy But I se gwine to git you safe home 
6614-67847-0025	train-other-500	You do jes as I tell you an you ll be safe back with your mammy by ter morrow she declared You lay down and keep your eyes tight shut till I comes back she added and Sylvia tired and frightened obeyed
6614-67847-0026	train-other-500	The schooner was now coming to her landing at Fort Sumter Estralla managed to get on deck without being noticed She did not know where they were but wherever it was she resolved to get Sylvia out of the vessel and ran back to the cabin
none	none	 Now don you speak to nobuddy 
6614-67847-0027	train-other-500	Jes keep right close to me she whispered And Sylvia obeyed The two little girls crept up the cabin stairs and crouching close to the side of the cabin made their way toward the stern of the vessel
6614-67847-0028	train-other-500	The crew and the soldiers and Captain Carleton were now all toward the bow A small boat swung at the stern of the schooner Now Missy we s got to git ourselves into that boat and row back home whispered Estralla grasping the rope
6614-67847-0029	train-other-500	At that moment Sylvia turned to look back She could see a tall officer on the forward deck and without an instant s hesitation she ran toward him calling Captain Carleton Captain Carleton He turned smilingly toward her and Sylvia clasped his hand
none	none	 I didn t know where I was she said 
6614-67847-0030	train-other-500	You are at Fort Sumter And it s all my fault he answered I forgot all about you until we were nearly here But one of my men is going to sail you safely home What s this he added as Estralla appeared by Sylvia s side
6614-67847-0031	train-other-500	It s Estralla Her mammy is our cook said Sylvia The Captain looked a little puzzled He wondered how the little darky had got on board the vessel without being seen Well she will be company for you
6614-67847-0032	train-other-500	And you must ask your father and mother to forgive my carelessness in taking you so far from home said the Captain It was sunset when Sylvia and Estralla escorted by one of the soldiers from Fort Sumter came walking up East Battery
6614-67847-0033	train-other-500	missus Fulton was on the piazza and missus Waite and Grace were with her Grace was the first to see and recognize Sylvia and with a cry of delight ran to welcome her
6614-67847-0034	train-other-500	The soldier had a note for missus Fulton explaining that Sylvia apparently on her way from school had wandered down to the landing and of Captain Carleton s forgetting her presence in the cabin
6614-67847-0035	train-other-500	so that Sylvia was not questioned that night in regard to her disappearance from Miss Patten s Grace knew nothing of Sylvia s encounter with Elinor Mayhew so no one could imagine why she had started for home without a word to Miss Patten
6614-67847-0036	train-other-500	missus Fulton was too rejoiced to have her little girl safely at home to question or blame her Sylvia was not hungry The officer in charge of Fort Sumter had given the two children an excellent supper
6614-67847-0037	train-other-500	But she was tired and very glad to have a warm bath and go straight to bed Oh Mother This has been the most horrid day in all my life she said as her mother brushed out the tangled yellow hair and helped her prepare for bed
6614-67847-0038	train-other-500	It has been rather hard for your father and me missus Fulton reminded her we began to fear some dreadful thing had happened to our little girl Promise me Sylvia never to run away from school again Sylvia promised
none	none	 She wished she could tell her mother that it was not school she ran away from 
6614-67847-0039	train-other-500	that she was trying to escape the taunts and unfriendliness of her schoolmates But she remembered her promise She had declared proudly that she should not tell and hard as it was
6614-67847-0040	train-other-500	she resolved that she would keep that promise But she wished with all her heart that she need not go to school another day Do I have to go to Miss Patten s school Mother she asked in so unhappy a voice that missus Fulton realized something unpleasant had happened
none	none	 We will talk it over to morrow dear she said go to sleep now and Sylvia crept into the white bed quite ready to sleep but wondering how she could talk about going to school and still keep her promise when to morrow came CHAPTER V ESTRALLA AND ELINOR In the morning Sylvia did not refer to what had happened the day before so her mother decided not to question her Grace and Flora both arrived at an early hour to accompany Sylvia to school They were eager to hear how she had happened to be on the schooner which had carried arms to Fort Sumter from the Charleston Arsenal But Sylvia did not seem to want to talk of her adventure and both the little southern girls were too polite to question her Father says those guns don t belong to the United States they belong to South Carolina Sylvia did not reply She recalled one of her lessons however where she had learned that the United States meant each and every State in the Union and she remembered what Captain Carleton had said Mother says I may go with you on Saturday Flora interrupted Grace I wish it was Friday this minute So do I agreed Flora laughingly and we must teach Sylvia to ride on one of the ponies this time For on the previous visit Sylvia had said that she wished she could ride as Flora did Oh Truly Flora do you really mean it Sylvia asked Of course I do We will have a ride Saturday afternoon and again Sunday replied Flora With the pleasure of the plantation visit in store Sylvia for the moment forgot all about her dread of facing the girls at school Miss Patten detained her at the door of the schoolroom with a warmer greeting than usual but said My dear I want to talk with you at recess but her smile was so friendly and her words so kind that Sylvia was not troubled As she passed Elinor s seat she did not look up but the whisper Yankee made her flush and brought back all her dislike of the tall handsome Elinor At recess after the other girls had left the schoolroom Miss Patten came to Sylvia s desk and sat down beside her Sylvia dear she said gently I want you to tell me why you started off alone yesterday Had anything happened here at school to make you so unhappy that you did not want to stay Sylvia looked up in surprise Why Miss Patten seemed to know all about it she thought How easy it would be to tell her the whole story But suddenly she resolved that no matter what Miss Patten knew she Sylvia must not break her word So she looked down at her desk and made no reply I am sure none of the other pupils would mean to hurt your feelings Sylvia But if any of them have carelessly said something that sounded unkind I know they will apologize continued the friendly voice and again Sylvia looked up If she told what Elinor and May had said she was now sure that Miss Rosalie would make them both say they were sorry and Sylvia remembered that she had declared to them that they should do exactly that Would they really Miss Patten she asked in so serious a voice that the teacher believed for the moment that she would soon know the exact reason
6099_67860_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 why Sylvia 
none	none	had fled from the school and she was right she was about to hear it but not from Sylvia There was a little silence in the quiet pleasant room where the scent of jessamine and honey suckle came through the open windows and no sound disturbed the two at Sylvia s desk Sylvia was assuring herself that she really ought to tell Miss Patten but somehow she could not speak If she broke a promise even to an enemy as she felt Elinor Mayhew to be she would despise herself But Elinor would have to apologize for the way she had treated Sylvia Just at this moment of hesitation a round woolly head appeared at one of the open windows Two small black hands rested on the window sill and a moment later Estralla in her faded blue dress was standing directly in front of Miss Patten and Sylvia I begs pardon Missy Teacher But I knows my missy ain t done nuffin to be kept shut up for An I knows why she runned off yesterd y Yas m I heered dat tall dark girl an nuther girl sayin as how Missy Sylvia was a Yankee Yas m and as how they was glad they called her names Yas m I sho heered em say those very words and Estralla bobbed her head and stood trembling in every limb before Missy Teacher not knowing what would happen to her but determined that the little white girl who had protected her and given her the fine pink dress should not be punished 
6643_67857_000059_000003	train-clean-360	Oh Estralla 
none	none	whispered Sylvia her face brightening Miss Rosalie stood up and rested her hand on Sylvia s shoulder And so you would not tell or complain about your schoolmates Then without waiting for a reply she leaned over and kissed Sylvia That is right dear child I am proud to have you as a pupil Now and she turned to Estralla you run home as fast as you can go Your young mistress is not being punished and will not be But you did just right in coming to tell me But the next time you come remember to come in at the door and Miss Rosalie smiled pleasantly at the little darky whose face now was radiant with delight Yas m I sho will member and with a smile at Sylvia Estralla tiptoed toward the open door and disappeared It was a very grave teacher who watched her pupils return to their seats that morning It was a time when all the people in the southern city were anxious and troubled There had always been slaves in South Carolina and now the Government of the United States was realizing that the black people must not be kept in servitude that they had the same rights as white people and it was difficult for the Charleston people to acknowledge that this was right Miss Rosalie was a South Carolinian and she was sure that Charleston people did right to insist on keeping their slaves even if it meant war And it now seemed likely that the North and South might come to warfare The word Yankee was as hateful to Miss Rosalie as it was to Elinor Mayhew and for that very reason she determined that Elinor should make a public apology for calling one of her schoolmates a Yankee To the Carolinians the name meant the name of their enemies and it seemed to Miss Rosalie a very dreadful thing to accuse this little northern girl of being an enemy After the girls were all seated she said in a very quiet tone Elinor please come to the platform For a moment Elinor hesitated Then she walked slowly down the aisle and stood beside Miss Patten Now young ladies I do not need to explain to you the meaning of the word courtesy You all know that it means kindness and consideration of the rights and feelings of others You know as well the meaning of the word hospitality that it means that any person who is received beneath your roof is entitled to courtesy and to more than that to protection Even savages will protect any traveler who comes into their home and give the best they have to make him comfortable Miss Rosalie stopped a moment and then said If there is anyone of you who has not known the meaning of the two words to which I refer will she please to rise The girls all remained seated Elinor you will now apologize for having failed in courtesy and in hospitality to one of my pupils Elinor stood looking out across the schoolroom Her mouth was tightly closed and apparently she had no intention of obeying Do I have to apologize for speaking the truth she demanded The girls held their breath Was it possible that Elinor dared defy Miss Patten Grace and Flora were sadly puzzled They were the only pupils who did not understand the exact reason Elinor s treatment of Sylvia for Miss Patten s demand The teacher did not respond and Elinor did not speak Then after a moment Miss Patten said Take your seat Elinor I shall make this request of you again at the beginning of the afternoon session If you do not comply with it you will no longer be received as a pupil in this school CHAPTER VI SYLVIA AT THE PLANTATION When the afternoon session opened Elinor Mayhew was not in her usual place Grace and Flora had been told by the other girls what had happened on the day of Sylvia s disappearance from school May Bailey had declared that Sylvia must have run straight to the teacher and that she was a telltale as well as a Yankee Grace had defended her friend warmly I don t know how Miss Rosalie found out but I m sure Sylvia did not tell she declared Flora was unusually quiet There were many scornful looks sent in Sylvia s direction that afternoon which Miss Patten noticed and easily understood Before school was dismissed she said that she had a brief announcement to make I want to say to you that the pupil whom Elinor treated with such a lack of courtesy did not inform me of the fact Nor would she say one word against any of her schoolmates when I questioned her Someone who overheard Elinor s unfriendly remarks came and told me Flora Hayes smiled and drew a long breath She did not blame Sylvia for being a Yankee but it had troubled her to think of her new friend as a telltale whatever her provocation might have been The other girls began to look at Sylvia with more friendly eyes and as they ran down the steps several found a chance to nod and smile at her or to exchange some word So Sylvia began to feel that her troubles were over if Elinor Mayhew did not return to school Father are you sure Yankee doesn t mean anything beside American she asked in a very serious tone as she sat beside mister Fulton on the piazza that evening They were quite alone as missus Fulton had stepped to the kitchen to speak to Aunt Connie The girls at school all think it means something dreadful she added Let me see Sylvia You study history don t you responded her father slowly Of course you do and you know that George Washington and General Putnam and General Warren and many more brave men defended this country and its liberty Why yes replied Sylvia greatly puzzled The men of South Carolina were among the bravest and most loyal of the defenders of our liberties And when America s enemies called American men Yankees they meant General Washington and every other American who was ready to defend the United States of America So if any of your friends use the word Yankee scornfully they agree with the enemies of the Union No one need be ashamed of being called a Yankee It means someone who is ready to fight for what is right But Sylvia still wondered The girls don t think so she said Well that is because they don t understand They will know when they are older said mister Fulton He did not imagine that any of the companions of his little daughter had treated her in an unfriendly fashion and thought it a good opportunity to make her understand the real meaning of the word You are a Yankee girl And that means you must always try to protect other people who need protection said her father Sylvia s face brightened She could easily understand that It meant that she must not let Estralla get a whipping when she had not deserved it and she was glad she had not told the real story of the broken pitcher She resolved always to remember what her father had said The remainder of the week passed pleasantly Elinor Mayhew did not return to school and the other girls profited by her example and no longer teased or taunted the little northern girl Saturday morning proved to be perfect weather for the drive to the Hayes plantation The sun shone the clear October air was full of autumnal fragrance and when the Hayes carry all drawn by two pretty brown horses and driven by black Chris the Hayes coachman and Flora s black mammy on the seat beside him stopped in front of Sylvia s house and Flora came running up the path Sylvia and Grace were on the steps all ready to start There was plenty of room for all three girls on the back seat and Flora declared that Sylvia should sit between Grace and herself missus Fulton and Estralla stood at the gate and watched the happy little party drive off Estralla looked very sober Ever since the adventure at Fort Sumter the little colored girl had felt that she must look after Missy Sylvia carefully And she was not well pleased to see her young mistress disappear from her watchful eyes What a funny name Estralla is laughed Flora as Sylvia called back a good bye Oh that isn t her name really explained Grace You know my Uncle Robert owns her and Auntie Connie named her after Aunt Esther and Cousin Alice Her name is really Esther Alice But the colored people never speak as we do How can anybody own anybody else even if their skin is black asked Sylvia Both her companions looked at her in such evident surprise that Sylvia was sure she ought not to have asked such a question Suddenly she remembered that Flora s Mammy and Uncle Chris as Flora called him were negroes and of course must have heard She resolved not to ask another question during her visit Their way took them through pleasant streets shaded by spice trees and an occasional oak From behind high walls came the fragrance of orange blossoms ripening pomegranates and grapes Very soon they had crossed the Ashley River and now the road ran between broad fields of cotton where negroes were already at work gathering the white fluffy crop which would be packed in bags and bales and shipped to many far distant ports The three little friends talked gaily of the pleasant visit which had just begun Sylvia was hoping that Flora would again speak of the promised ride on one of the white ponies but not until Uncle Chris guided the swift horses into the driveway shaded by fine live oaks which led to the big house was her wish gratified We ll have a ride this afternoon girls if you are not too tired she said Grace and Sylvia promptly declared that they were not at all tired and that a ride was just what they would like best The plantation s big house as the negroes called the owner s home was the largest house Sylvia had ever entered Its high piazza with the tall pillars was covered by a tangle of jessamine vines and climbing roses The front hall led straight through the house to another piazza which looked out over beautiful gardens and a tiny lake Behind a thick hedge of privet were the cabins of the house servants The negroes who did the work on the plantation caring for the horses and cows and working in the cotton fields lived at some distance from the big house missus Hayes came out on the piazza to welcome the party She had come down from Charleston on the previous day It seemed to Sylvia she had never seen so many negroes before in all her life Neat colored maids were flitting about the house colored men were at work in the garden and colored children peered smilingly around the corner of the house A colored maid was told to look after Grace and Sylvia and she led the way up the beautiful spiral staircase to a pleasant chamber overlooking the garden There were two small white beds with a little mahogany light stand between them On this stand stood a tall brass candlestick There were two dressing tables and two small bureaus and a number of comfortable chintz covered chairs The floor was of dark shining wood and beside each bed was a long soft white rug Sylvia and Grace knew that this room had been arranged especially for any of Flora s young friends whom she might entertain and they both thought it was one of the nicest rooms that anyone could imagine The smiling colored maid brushed their hair helped them into the fresh muslin dresses they had each brought and when they were ready opened the door and followed them down the stairs where they found Flora awaiting them Luncheon is all ready she said and led the way into the dining room where missus Hayes and Flora s two older brothers Ralph and Philip were waiting for them The boys were tall good looking lads and as they were in the uniform of the Military School of Charleston of which they were pupils Sylvia thought they must be quite grown up although Ralph was only sixteen and his brother two years younger They had ridden out on horseback from Charleston and had just arrived Flora introduced them to Sylvia and Grace greeted them as old acquaintances I suppose you girls are looking forward to the corn shucking to night Ralph asked with his pleasant smile as he held Sylvia s chair for her to take her seat at the table while Philip performed the same service for Grace Oh my dear boy You have betrayed Flora s surprise said missus Hayes She had planned not to let the girls know about it until nightfall What is a corn shucking questioned Sylvia for she had always lived in a city and did not know much about farm or plantation affairs Shall I tell her Flora questioned Ralph laughingly No No indeed Wait Sylvia then it will be a surprise after all responded Flora Sylvia smiled happily She was sure that this visit was going to be even more delightful than when she had been Flora s guest in the early spring There seemed to be so many things to do on a plantation she thought The young people were all hungry and enjoyed the roasted duck with the sweet potatoes and the grape jelly Beside these there were hot biscuit and delicious custards Sylvia had finished her custard when two maids brought a large tray into the room and in a moment the little girls exclaimed in admiring delight for the tray contained two doves made of blanc mange resting in a nest of fine gold colored shreds of candied orange peel and an iced cake in the shape of a fort with the palmetto flag on a tiny staff At the sight of their State flag both the boys arose from their seats and saluted That s the flag to fly over Charleston s forts declared Ralph as he sat down After luncheon was over missus Hayes advised the girls to lie down for a little rest before starting for their ride But they all declared they were not tired and there were so many things to see and enjoy at the plantation that Sylvia and Grace were delighted when Flora suggested that first of all they should go out through the garden to the negro quarters stopping at the stables on their way for a look at the ponies Sylvia was ready before the other girls and stood on the piazza waiting She was leaning against one of the vine covered pillars that supported the piazza and Ralph and Philip who were sitting just around the corner did not know she was there and could not see her Sylvia could hear their voices but did not at first notice what they were saying until the word Yankee caught her ear The first thing you know those northern Yankees will take our forts she heard Philip say and heard Ralph laugh scornfully as he responed They can t do it or free our slaves either Say did you know Father was going to sell Dinkie she s making such a fuss that I reckon she ll get a lashing says she don t want to leave her children There was a little silence and then the younger boy spoke I wish they wouldn t sell Dinkie I hate to have her go It isn t fair Of course she feels bad to leave those little darkies of hers Jove and the boy s voice had an angry tone Dinkie shan t be whipped I won t have it She used to be my mammy Suddenly Sylvia realized that she was listening and ran down the steps toward the little lake which lay glimmering in the sun beneath the shade of the overhanging pepper trees She ran on past the lake down a little path which led toward the pine woods She no longer felt happy and full of anticipations of the surprise in store at the corn shucking All she could think of was Dinkie a woman who was to be sold away from her children and who was to be whipped because she rebelled against the cruelty of her master It s because she s a slave Sylvia whispered to herself I hate slavery My father said Yankees always fought for what was right Why don t they fight against slavery She quite forgot that Flora and Grace would wonder where she had gone and be alarmed at her absence I do wish I could see Dinkie she thought I wish I could do something to help set every slave free Then she remembered that Philip had declared that Dinkie should neither be sold nor whipped I like Philip she declared aloud and was surprised to hear a little chuckling laugh from somewhere behind her and turned quickly to find a smiling negro woman close behind her I likes Massa Philip myse f declared the woman an I wishes I could see him jus a minute and her smile disappeared I se shuah Massa Philip won let em sell Dinkie or lash her either and putting her apron over her face the woman began to cry He won t I heard him say he wouldn t have it Sylvia assured her eagerly Don t cry Dinkie and she patted the woman s arm Dinkie let her apron fall and looked eagerly at Sylvia You se the little Yankee missy ain t you she questioned I hear say that Yankees don t believe in selling black folks They don t I m sure they don t I ll run right back and tell Philip you want to see him replied Sylvia You stay right here by this tree she added pointing to a big live oak Yas Missy I thanks you replied the woman Sylvia ran back toward the house as fast as she could go She could see the ponies standing before the house a small negro boy holding their bridle reins The girls were on the steps waiting for her I mustn t let them know that Dinkie wants to see Philip she thought as the girls called out that they had been looking everywhere for her At that moment the two boys came along the piazza Philip is going to teach you how to mount and how to hold your reins Sylvia said Flora Grace and Sylvia were to ride the white ponies and Flora was to ride a small brown horse which her mother usually rode Philip came slowly down the steps He looked very sober and Sylvia was sure that he was thinking about Dinkie I don t believe he thinks slavery is right she thought as Philip raised his cap and asked if she was ready to mount Snap the pony which she was to ride Flora and Grace were already mounted and trotted slowly off Sylvia and Philip were alone on the driveway Dinkie wants to see you She s waiting down by the oak beyond the lake said Sylvia And don t let her be whipped she added The boy looked up at her quickly Don t tell the girls that she sent for me he replied Dinkie shan t be whipped or sold either He did not thank Sylvia for her message and she was glad that he did not With a brief word of direction as to the proper manner of holding the reins he turned toward the lake and Sylvia s pony trotted slowly down the drive to where Flora and Grace were waiting Flora led the way past the stables and down a broad path which led to the negro quarters The ponies went at a slow pace as Flora wanted to be sure that Sylvia was not afraid and that she was enjoying her first ride The corn shucking will be here she said pointing with her pretty gold mounted whip to a number of corn cribs They will bring the corn in from the fields and we will come down in good season And the moon will be full to night said Grace beginning to sing De jay bird hunt de sparrer nes All by de light of de moon De bee martin sail all roun All by de light of de moon De squirrel he holler from de top of de tree mister Mole he stay in de groun Oh yes mister Mole he stay in de groun Sylvia listened and smiled as she looked at the happy faces of her friends But she could not forget Dinkie and wondered if Philip could really protect the unhappy woman from a whipping and prevent her being sold away from her children As they passed the cabins of the negroes the children ran out bobbing and smiling to their young mistress and Flora called out a friendly greeting Father s going to sell a lot of those niggers she said carelessly They eat more than they re worth But won t their mothers feel dreadfully to let them go ventured Sylvia Of course they will declared Grace before Flora could respond And I do think it s a shame Did you know Uncle Robert is going to sell Estralla she asked turning to Sylvia Sylvia s grasp on the reins loosened and she nearly lost her seat on the broad back of the fat pony What for she questioned thinking to herself that Estralla should not be sold away from her home and mother if she Sylvia could prevent it Oh Uncle s agent says she isn t of any use and he can get a good price for her He would have sold her last month if your mother had not taken her in I expect Aunt Connie will be half crazy for all her other children are gone said Grace We mustn t ride too far this time Flora interrupted because it s Sylvia s first ride Hasn t she done well Do you suppose you can turn the pony Yes indeed answered Sylvia drawing the left rein so tightly that the little pony swung round before Flora had time to give a word of direction As they were now headed toward home Snap went off at a good pace well in advance of the others It was all Sylvia could do to keep her seat but she was not frightened and when the pony raced up the driveway and came to a standstill directly in front of the piazza steps she was laughing with delight For the moment she had quite forgotten Dinkie and Estralla CHAPTER VII SYLVIA SEES A GHOST It was splendid declared Sylvia as Grace and Flora dismounted and the three little friends entered the house Flora s black Mammy was waiting for them on the piazza Thar s some freshments fur yo in de dinin room she said and the girls were glad for the cool milk and the tiny frosted cakes which a negro girl served them Sylvia wondered if Flora ever did anything for herself for there seemed to be so many negro servants who were on the alert to wait upon all the white people at the big house 
6627-67850-0001	train-other-500	Come up to my room girls and rest until it s time to dress for supper said Flora Flora s room was just across the hall from the one where Grace and Sylvia were to sleep Instead of a small white bed like theirs there was a big bed of dark mahogany
6627-67850-0002	train-other-500	with four tall high posts The bed was so high that there was a cushioned step beside it
none	none	 The portrait of a lady hung over a beautiful inlaid desk and Flora pointed to it with evident pride 
6627-67850-0003	train-other-500	That s my great grandmother and her father built this house
none	none	 My mother says that she was Lady Caroline and that she was so beautiful that whenever she went to Charleston 
6627-67850-0004	train-other-500	people would run after her coach just to look at her and Flora looked at her companions expectantly quite forgetting that she had told them the story before Oh Flora Every time I come out here you tell me about your wonderful great grand mother said Grace
none	none	 and you used to tell me that her ghost haunted this house 
6627-67850-0005	train-other-500	Well it does declared Flora Sylvia had never heard of Lady Caroline s ghost Do tell me about it Flora she urged There was a wide cushioned seat with many pillows beneath the windows and here the girls established themselves very comfortably
6627-67850-0006	train-other-500	Yes tell Sylvia the story said Grace piling up several cushions behind her back Of course it isn t true but it s thrilling It is true persisted Flora My mother says that her own governess saw Lady Caroline s ghost
6627-67850-0007	train-other-500	And that she had on the very hat she has on in the portrait and the same blue dress and lace collar You know there s a secret stairway in this house It leads from one of the closets in your room down to a closet in my father s library and out of doors and Lady Caroline s ghost always comes in that way
6627-67850-0008	train-other-500	Sylvia looked up at the beautiful pictured face with a little shiver I guess that the governess dreamed it she said Of course she did declared Grace I think you look like that picture Flora she added
none	none	 Well whether you believe it or not everybody knows that this is a haunted house persisted Flora 
6627-67850-0009	train-other-500	Why there is an account of it in a book But Grace shook her head laughingly Flora show Sylvia your lovely lace work she said Flora nodded but Sylvia was sure that she was not pleased at Grace s refusal to believe in the ghost Mammy
none	none	 Mam m e e 
6627-67850-0010	train-other-500	called Flora and in a moment the black woman stood bobbing and smiling in the doorway Bring my lace work said Flora Yas Missy and Mammy trotted across the room to a little table in the further corner
none	none	 and brought Flora a covered basket 
6627-67850-0011	train-other-500	She opened it and set it down in front of her little mistress Do s yo want anyt ing else Missy Flora she asked If I do I ll call replied the little girl and Mammy again disappeared The basket was lined with rose colored silk and there were little pockets all around it
6627-67850-0012	train-other-500	In the centre lay a cushion on which was a lace pattern defined by delicate threads and tiny circles of pins A little strip of finished lace was rolled up in a bit of tissue paper Flora took off the paper See it is the jessamine pattern she explained
6627-67850-0013	train-other-500	My mother s governess was a Belgian lady and she taught my mother how to make lace and my mother taught me I wish I could make lace said Sylvia It would be lovely to make some for a present for my mother Of course it would I ll teach you this winter
6627-67850-0014	train-other-500	promised the good natured Flora let me see your hands You know a lace maker s hands must be as smooth as silk because any roughness would catch the delicate threads Sylvia s hands were still scratched and roughed from her fall in Miss Rosalie s garden and her scramble over the wall
6627-67850-0015	train-other-500	and Flora shook her head You ll have to wait awhile And you must wear gloves every time you go out and wash your hands in milk every night she said very seriously Now I ll show you my embroidery
none	none	 Mam m e e Mam m e e 
6627-67850-0016	train-other-500	and another basket was brought and opened This basket was also lined with rose colored silk but the silk had delicate green vines running over it On the inside of the cover held in place by tiny straps were two pairs of shining scissors with gold handles
6627-67850-0017	train-other-500	a gold mounted emery bag shaped like a strawberry an embroidery stiletto of ivory and a gold thimble Flora lifted out the embroidery frame and putting on her thimble took a few exact dainty stitches in the collar What lovely work you can do Flora
6627-67850-0018	train-other-500	exclaimed Sylvia Don t you ever play dolls
none	none	 remembering her own cherished dolls in their small chairs in the corner of her room at home 
6627-67850-0019	train-other-500	Oh I used to replied Flora but since I began school at Miss Patten s I don t seem to care about dolls
none	none	 Flora can play on the harp 
6627-67850-0020	train-other-500	announced Grace Oh only just a little responded Flora quickly I think Flora can do more things than any girl I ever knew declared Sylvia admiringly and I was just thinking that the servants did everything in the world Flora laughed
6627-67850-0021	train-other-500	You never lived on a plantation or you couldn t think that Why my mother works more than Mammy ever did She has to tell all the house darkies what to do and see that all the hands have clothes and that the fruits are preserved Why she s always busy replied Flora
6627-67850-0022	train-other-500	And of course ladies have to know how to do things she concluded When Grace and Sylvia went to their own room Flora went with them I ll show you where that secret staircase is she said and opening the closet door pressed on a broad panel which moved slowly There
none	none	 and Flora drew Sylvia near so she could look down a dark narrow stairway But that isn t seeing a ghost Grace said laughingly It was rather late when missus Hayes led the way back to the house 
6627-67850-0023	train-other-500	and Grace declared that she was almost too sleepy to walk up stairs But Sylvia was not at all sleepy After the colored girl had helped them prepare for bed blown out the candle and left the room she lay watching the shadows of the moving vines on the wall She wished she was at home
6627-67850-0024	train-other-500	for who knew but that Estralla s master might sell her before she returned Sylvia wondered what she could do to protect the little girl I might hide her she thought but what place would be secure
6627-67850-0025	train-other-500	Suddenly she remembered something that she had heard Captain Carleton say when she was eating luncheon on that unlucky trip to Fort Sumter This fort could make South Carolina give up slavery he had said Why then of course Estralla would be perfectly safe if she was only at Fort Sumter
6627-67850-0026	train-other-500	concluded the little girl with a long sigh of relief I must get her there just as soon as I get home she decided Then suddenly Sylvia sat straight up in bed The closet door had swung softly open and a figure with a big hat and trailing dress stepped out
6627-67850-0027	train-other-500	Sylvia was not frightened It s the ghost she whispered and leaning across poked Grace exclaiming
none	none	 Grace Look quick here is Lady Caroline In an instant Grace was wide awake Where she demanded in a frightened voice clutching Sylvia s hand Right there By the closet door said Sylvia Oh she s gone For as she looked toward the closet the figure had disappeared There you waked me up for nothing You dreamed it declared Grace Oh I didn t Truly I didn t I haven t been asleep Sylvia insisted It is just as Flora said There is a ghost Just then both the girls heard a startled cry and a sound as if something had fallen in the room under them What s that whispered Grace Oh Sylvia do you suppose there really is a ghost Yes I saw it declared Sylvia with such evident satisfaction in her tone that Grace forgot to be frightened Well I guess it fell downstairs she chuckled but in spite of their lack of fear both the little girls were excited over the unusual noise and Sylvia was sure now that Flora had been right in saying the house was haunted She wished it was already morning that she might tell Flora all that had happened CHAPTER VIII A TWILIGHT TEA PARTY 
6643_67851_000002_000000	train-clean-360	It was late when Grace and Sylvia awoke the following morning but they were down stairs before the boys appeared 
6643_67851_000002_000001	train-clean-360	missus Hayes greeted them smilingly but she said that Flora was not well and that Mammy would take her breakfast to her up stairs 
6643_67851_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 After breakfast you must go up and stay with her a little while said missus Hayes 
6643_67851_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Flora was never ill in her life declared Ralph what s the matter 
none	none	She is not really ill but she fell over something last night and bruised her arm and shoulder so that she feels lame and tired and I thought a few hours in bed would be the best thing for her explained missus Hayes
6643_67851_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 Mammy doesn t seem to know just how it happened she concluded 
none	none	Sylvia and Grace had talked over the ghost before coming down stairs Grace had tried best to convince Sylvia that she had really dreamed Lady Caroline but Sylvia insisted that a figure in a wide plumed hat and a trailing gown had really stepped out of the closet
6643_67851_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 The moon was shining right where she stood 
6643_67851_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I saw her just as plainly as I could see you when you sat up in bed Sylvia declared 
none	none	But both the girls agreed that it would be best not to say anything about Lady Caroline until they had told Flora After breakfast Mammy came to tell the visitors that Flora was ready to see them But jus for a little while she added as she opened the door of Flora s chamber 
6643_67851_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Flora was bolstered up in bed and had on a dainty dressing gown of pink muslin tied with white ribbons 
none	none	But there was a bandage about her right wrist and a soft strip of cotton was bound about her head
6643_67851_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh girls 
6643_67851_000011_000001	train-clean-360	It s too bad that I can t help you to have a good time to day she said and all because I was so clumsy 
6643_67851_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Both the girls assured her that it was a good time just to be at the Hayes plantation 
none	none	Flora There is a ghost Just as you said I saw it 
6643_67851_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Just about midnight said Sylvia 
none	none	Truly exclaimed Flora in rather a faint voice Yes And it was Lady Caroline 
6643_67851_000015_000002	train-clean-360	For it wore a big hat like the one in the picture and its dress trailed all about it replied Sylvia 
none	none	Then I guess Grace will believe this is a haunted house said Flora a little triumphantly
6643_67851_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t see it said Grace 
6643_67851_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 And truly I believe Sylvia just dreamed it 
6643_67851_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Flora sat up in bed suddenly 
6643_67851_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Sylvia did not dream it 
none	none	I know she saw it she declared Well perhaps so 
6643_67851_000020_000001	train-clean-360	But I didn t and Grace laughed good naturedly but Flora turned her face from them and began to cry 
6643_67851_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 After my being hurt and she sobbed but stopped quickly 
6643_67851_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia and Grace looked at each other in amazement 
6643_67851_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 It s because she is ill 
6643_67851_000023_000001	train-clean-360	And she s disappointed because you didn t see Lady Caroline Sylvia whispered 
6643_67851_000023_000002	train-clean-360	In a moment Flora looked up with a little smile 
none	none	I am so silly she said
6643_67851_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 You must forgive me 
none	none	But I m sure Sylvia did see
6643_67851_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I begin to think she did Grace owned laughingly 
6643_67851_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She had happened to look toward the open closet and had seen certain things which made her quite ready to own that Flora might be right 
none	none	But she was rather serious and silent for the rest of the visit Before they left Flora s room Flora asked Sylvia not to tell anyone that she had seen a ghost You see the boys would laugh and no one but me really believes the house is haunted she explained 
6643_67851_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Of course Sylvia promised but she was puzzled by Flora s request 
6643_67851_000027_000000	train-clean-360	It was decided that Ralph and Philip should ride back to Charleston that afternoon when Uncle Chris drove the little visitors home and that Flora should stay at the plantation with her mother for a day or two 
none	none	Sylvia had enjoyed her visit She had even enjoyed seeing the ghost but she was sorry that she could not tell her mother and father of the great adventure 
6643_67851_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Nevertheless she was glad when the carriage stopped in front of her own home and she saw Estralla smiling and happy in the pink gingham dress waiting to welcome her 
6643_67851_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Sylvia I m coming over to night 
none	none	I ve got something to tell you Grace said as the two friends stood for a moment at Sylvia s gate after they had thanked Uncle Chris and said good bye to Sylvia s brothers Grace was so serious that Sylvia wondered what it could be It isn t that Estralla is going to be sold right away is it she asked anxiously No 
6643_67851_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I ll tell you after supper Grace responded and ran on to her own home 
none	none	Sylvia s mother and father were interested to hear all that she had to tell them about the corn shucking and of the wonderful cake with its palmetto flag 
6643_67851_000032_000001	train-clean-360	She told them about poor Dinkie and what Philip had said that Dinkie should not be sold away from her children or whipped 
6643_67851_000033_000000	train-clean-360	mister Fulton seemed greatly pleased with Sylvia s account of her visit He said Philip was a fine boy and that there were many like him in South Carolina 
none	none	They had just finished supper when Grace appeared and the two little girls went up to Sylvia s room
6643_67851_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it Grace Sylvia asked eagerly 
6643_67851_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t think what you want to tell me that makes you look so sober 
6643_67851_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Grace looked all about the room and then closed the door not seeing a little figure crouching in a shadowy corner 
6643_67851_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t want anybody else to hear 
none	none	It s about the ghost she whispered
6643_67851_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 I know all about it 
6643_67851_000037_000003	train-clean-360	It was Flora herself 
6643_67851_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Yes it was she continued quickly 
none	none	When we were in her room this morning I saw a big hat with a long feather on it hanging on her closet door and a long blue skirt one of her mother s 
6643_67851_000037_000006	train-clean-360	They weren t there yesterday for the door was open just as it was to day 
6643_67851_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Well what of that asked Sylvia 
none	none	Oh Sylvia Can t you see Grace asked impatiently
6643_67851_000039_000002	train-clean-360	 Flora dressed up in her mother s things and then came up the stairs to our room 
6643_67851_000039_000003	train-clean-360	She was determined to make us think she had a truly ghost in her house Then when you called out she got frightened and stumbled on the stairs 
none	none	You know we heard someone fall and cry out 
6643_67851_000039_000005	train-clean-360	Of course it was Flora 
6643_67851_000039_000006	train-clean-360	Nobody seems to know how she got hurt 
6643_67851_000039_000007	train-clean-360	The minute I saw that plumed hat I knew just the trick she had played 
none	none	I knew there wasn t a ghost Grace concluded triumphantly Sylvia felt almost disappointed that it had not really been Lady Caroline She wondered why Flora had wanted to deceive them
6643_67851_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t think it was fair she said slowly 
6643_67851_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it wasn t fair 
6643_67851_000042_000001	train-clean-360	I wouldn t have believed that a Charleston girl would do such a mean trick declared Grace 
none	none	Of course as we were her company we can t let her know that we have found her out Perhaps she meant to tell us anyway suggested Sylvia hopefully I m sure she did 
6643_67851_000043_000001	train-clean-360	She thought it would make us laugh 
6643_67851_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then why didn t she asked Grace 
none	none	Sylvia s face clouded she could not answer this question but she was sure that Flora had not meant to frighten or really deceive them and she wanted to defend her absent friend Well Grace we know Flora wouldn t do anything mean And you see she got hurt and so she s just waiting to get well before she tells us of the joke You wait and see 
6643_67851_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Flora will tell us just as soon as we see her again 
6643_67851_000047_000000	train-clean-360	There was a little note of entreaty in Sylvia s voice as if she were pleading with Grace not to blame Flora 
6643_67851_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I know one thing Sylvia 
none	none	You wouldn t do anything mean if you are a Yankee Grace declared warmly What s that noise she added quickly The room was shadowy in the gathering twilight and the two little girls had been sitting near the window 
6643_67851_000049_000001	train-clean-360	As Grace spoke they both turned quickly for there was a sudden noise of an overturned chair in the further corner of the room and they could see a dark figure sprawling on the floor 
6643_67851_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Before Sylvia could speak she heard the little wailing cry which Estralla always gave when in trouble and then Don t be skeered Missy 
none	none	It s nobuddy I jes fell over your doll ladies Oh Estralla You haven t broken my dolls What were you up here for anyway and Sylvia quite forgot all her plans to rescue Estralla as she ran toward her The doll ladies as the little darky girl had always called Sylvia s two china dolls which sat in two small chairs in front of a doll s table in one corner of the room were both sprawling on the floor their chairs upset and the little table with its tiny tea set overturned 
6643_67851_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Grace lit the candles on Sylvia s bureau while Sylvia picked up her treasured dolls Molly and Polly which her Grandmother Fulton had sent her on her last birthday 
none	none	I wuz up here jest a sittin an a lookin at em Missy wailed Estralla I never layed hand on em An when you an Missy Grace comes in I da sent move An then when I does move I tumbles over 
6643_67851_000053_000004	train-clean-360	I spec now I ll get whipped 
6643_67851_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Keep still Estralla 
6643_67857_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Keep still Estralla 
none	none	You know you won t get whipped replied Sylvia finding that Molly and Polly had not been hurt by their fall and that none of the little dishes were broken
6643_67851_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 You ought to tell her mother to whip her 
6643_67851_000055_000001	train-clean-360	She s no business up here said Grace 
6643_67851_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t Grace Sylvia exclaimed 
6643_67851_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 We don t get whipped every time we make a mistake 
none	none	And Estralla hasn t anything of her own 
6643_67851_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Just think your Uncle Robert can sell her away from her own mother 
none	none	You said yourself that you didn t think that was fair 
6643_67851_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla had scrambled to her feet and now stood looking at the little white girls with a half frightened look in her big eyes 
none	none	Oh Missy I ain t gwine to be sold be I she whispered Sylvia put her arm around Estralla s shoulders No she said you shall not be sold Now don t look so frightened 
6643_67851_000059_000003	train-clean-360	We will have a tea party for Molly and Polly and you shall wait on them 
6643_67851_000059_000004	train-clean-360	Run down and ask your mother to give us some little cakes 
6643_67851_000060_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla was off in an instant and while she was away Sylvia and Grace spread the little table brought cushions from the window seats and advised Molly and Polly to forgive the disturbance 
6643_67851_000061_000000	train-clean-360	When missus Fulton came up stairs a little later to tell Grace that her black Mammy had come to take her home she found three very happy little girls 
6643_67851_000061_000001	train-clean-360	Sylvia and Grace were being entertained at tea by Misses Molly and Polly while Estralla with shining eyes and a wide smile carried tiny cups and little cakes to the guests and chuckled delightedly over the clever things which Sylvia and Grace declared Molly and Polly had said 
none	none	A candle light tea party exclaimed missus Fulton as she came into the room and smiled down on the happy group Perhaps Flora will own up Grace said as the two girls followed missus Fulton down the stairs Anyway you are mighty fair about it and you re good to that stupid little darky Oh Estralla isn t stupid 
6643_67851_000064_000001	train-clean-360	Not a bit replied Sylvia laughingly 
6643_67851_000065_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla who was carefully putting the little table in order heard Sylvia s defense of her and for a moment she stood very straight holding one of the tiny cups in each hand 
none	none	I jes loves Missy Sylvia I do I jes wish ez how I could do somethin so she d know how I loves her and two big tears rolled down the black cheeks of the little slave girl who had known so little of kindness or of joy CHAPTER IX TROUBLESOME WORDS It was a week after Sylvia s visit to the Hayes plantation before Flora returned to school A heavy rain had made the roads nearly impassable and a little scar on Flora s forehead reminded Sylvia and Grace of her unlucky tumble On Flora s first appearance at school Sylvia was confident that she would at once confess her part in Lady Caroline s appearance and at recess she and Grace were eager to walk with Flora It was now the first of November but the air was warm and the garden had many blossoming plants and shrubs Flora said that she was glad to be back at school She told the girls that her father had returned from a northern trip and that he had given Dinkie and her children to Philip Phil teased him so that Father was tired of hearing him He said Phil was a regular abolitionist Flora explained with her pretty smile What s an abbylitionzist asked Grace Ask Sylvia I heard my father say that Sylvia s father was one answered Flora I don t know But my father is a Congregationalist replied Sylvia Perhaps that s what your father meant No it s something about not believing in having slaves I know that much said Flora Who would do our work then questioned Grace Flora could not answer this question Sylvia resolved to ask Miss Rosalie at question time the meaning of this new word If her father and Philip Hayes were abolitionists she was quite sure the word meant something very brave and fine What about Miss Flora and her ghost now Grace found a chance to whisper as they entered the schoolroom She doesn t mean to own up Wait she will was Sylvia s response as she took her seat When question time came Sylvia was ready She stood up smiling and eager and Miss Rosalie smiled back She had grown fond of her little pupil from Boston and thought to herself that Sylvia was really becoming almost like a little southern girl in her graceful ways and pleasant smile What is your question Sylvia she asked If you please Miss Rosalie what does abolitionist mean Some of the older girls exchanged startled looks and May Bailey barely restrained a laugh Probably Grace and Sylvia were the only girls in school who had not heard the word used as a term of reproach against the people of the northern states who wished to do away with slavery Miss Rosalie s smile faded but she responded without a moment s hesitation Why an abolitionist is a person who wishes to destroy some law or custom There was a little murmur among the other pupils but Grace and Sylvia looked at each other with puzzled eyes Philip did not wish to destroy anything thought Sylvia he only wanted to protect Dinkie And she was sure that her father would not destroy anything unless it was something which would harm people So it was a puzzled Sylvia who came home from school that day She decided that her father could answer a question much better than Miss Rosalie and resolved to ask him the meaning of the word Come up stairs Estralla she said finding the little negro girl at the gate as usual waiting for her I have some things my mother said I could give you Estralla followed happily She didn t care very much what it might be that Missy Sylvia would give her it was delight enough
6643_67857_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 for Estralla 
none	none	to follow after her But when the little girl saw the things spread out on Sylvia s bed she exclaimed aloud Does you mean Missy dat I se to pick out somethin Well then I chooses the shoes I never had no shoes They are all for you said Sylvia lifting up a pretty blue cape and holding it toward Estralla My lan whispered Estralla There was a dress of blue delaine with tiny white dots two pretty white aprons the blue cape and shoes and stockings beside some of Sylvia s part worn underwear She had begged her mother to let her give the little darky these things and missus Fulton had been glad that her little daughter wished to do so Estralla has never had ANYTHING Sylvia had urged and she is always afraid of something Of being whipped or sold And I would like to see her have clothes like other girls Estralla wanted to try on the shoes at once and when she found that they fitted very comfortably she chuckled and laughed with delight Neither of the girls heard a rap at the door and both were surprised when Aunt Connie who had opened the door and stood waiting exclaimed Fo lan s sake Wat you lettin that darky dress up in you clo es fer Missy Sylvia They are her own clothes now Aunt Connie Sylvia explained My mother said I might give them to her For a moment the negro woman stood silent Then she put her hands up to her face and began to cry very quietly Estralla s laughter vanished She wondered if her mammy was going to tell her that she could not keep the things Scusie Missy muttered Aunt Connie you se an angel to my po little gal An I se bliged to you But I se feared the chile won t wear em long Massa Robert Waite s man sez he s gwine sell her off right soon He cyan t do no sech thing Missy Sylvia won t let him declared Estralla who was perfectly sure that Missy Sylvia could do whatever she wished With a pair of shoes on her feet and the blue cape over her shoulders Estralla had more courage Sylvia s kindness had given the little colored girl a hope of happier days Aunt Connie I ll do all I can for Estralla said Sylvia Will you Missy Then ask yo pa not to let Estralla be sold pleaded Aunt Connie Sylvia promised and Aunt Connie went off smilingly But Sylvia wondered if her father could prevent mister Robert Waite from selling the negro girl Estralla she said very soberly I have promised that you shall not be sold and I will ask my father But if he cannot do anything we will have to do something ourselves Will you do whatever I tell you Oh yas indeed Missy Estralla answered eagerly Well I ll ask Father to night And to morrow morning you bring up my hot water and I ll tell you what he says But don t be frightened anyway said Sylvia I ain t skeered like I used to be responded Estralla Yo see Missy I feels jes as if you was my true fr en I ll try to be Sylvia promised Estralla went off happy with her new possessions and Sylvia turned to the window and looked off across the beautiful harbor toward the forts She had heard her father say that very noon that South Carolina would fight to keep its slaves and she wondered if the soldiers in Fort Moultrie would not fight to set the black people free She remembered that her father had said that Fort Sumter was the property of the United States and for some reason which she could not explain even to herself she was sure that Estralla would be safe there If mister Robert Waite really meant to sell her Sylvia again resolved to find some way to get the little slave girl to Fort Sumter When Estralla brought the hot water the next morning she found a very sober little mistress For Sylvia s father had not only explained the meaning of the word abolitionist as being the name the southerners had given to the men who were determined that slavery of other men whatever their color should end but he had told his little daughter that he could do nothing to prevent the sale of the little colored girl and that not even at Fort Sumter would she be safe Sylvia had not gone to sleep very early She lay awake thinking of Estralla Suppose somebody could sell me away from my mother she thought ready to cry even at such a possibility Sylvia knew that Aunt Connie had been whipped because she had rebelled against parting with her older children and there was no Philip to take Aunt Connie s part Mornin Missy said Estralla coming into the room and setting down the pitcher of hot water very carefully She had on the pink gingham with one of the white aprons and as she stood smiling and neat at the foot of Sylvia s bed she looked very different from the clumsy little darky who had tumbled into the room a few weeks ago Sylvia smiled back Estralla I want you to be sure to come up stairs to night after the house is all quiet Don t tell your mother or anybody she said very soberly All right Missy agreed Estralla sure that whatever Missy Sylvia asked was right Sylvia said nothing more but dressed and went down to breakfast She heard her father say that he feared that South Carolina would secede from the United States and she repeated the word aloud Secede What does that mean She began to think the world was full of difficult words In this case it means that the State of South Carolina wishes to give up her rights as one of the States of the Union mister Fulton explained but we hope she will give up slavery instead he concluded Grace was at the gate as Sylvia came out ready for school and called out a gay greeting What are you so sober about Sylvia she asked as they walked on together CHAPTER X THE PALMETTO FLAG 
5101-67853-0000	train-other-500	When Sylvia had told Estralla to come to her room that night she had determined to find a way to get the little negro to a place of safety Sylvia did not know that a negro was in those far off days
5101-67853-0001	train-other-500	the property of his master as much as a horse or a dog and that wherever the negro might go
5101-67853-0002	train-other-500	his master could claim him and punish him for trying to escape Any person aiding a slave to escape could also be punished by law All Sylvia thought of was to have Estralla protected
5101-67853-0003	train-other-500	and she was quite sure that a United States fort could protect one little negro girl Nevertheless she was troubled and worried as to how she could carry out her plan but she resolved not to tell Grace
5101-67853-0004	train-other-500	As usual Flora was waiting at Miss Patten s gate for her friends She was wearing a pretty turban hat and pinned in front was a fine blue cockade to which Flora pointed and said Look girls
5101-67853-0005	train-other-500	This is the Secession Cockade Ralph gave it to me she explained all loyal Carolinians ought to wear it Ralph says
none	none	 What does it mean to wear one asked Sylvia 
5101-67853-0006	train-other-500	Oh it means that you believe South Carolina has a right to keep its slaves and sell them of course
5101-67853-0007	train-other-500	and if the United States interferes why Carolinians will teach them a lesson Flora explained grandly repeating the explanation her father had given her that very morning
5101-67853-0008	train-other-500	Many of the other girls wore blue cockades and a palmetto flag was hung behind Miss Rosalie s desk Young ladies said Miss Rosalie
5101-67853-0009	train-other-500	I have hung South Carolina s flag where you can all see it You all know that a flag is an emblem Our flag means the glory of our past and the hope of the future
5101-67853-0010	train-other-500	I will ask you all to rise and salute this flag The little girls all stood and each raised her right hand All but Sylvia Flushed and unhappy with downcast eyes she kept her seat
none	none	 This was not the Stars and Stripes the flag she had been taught to love and honor 
5101-67853-0011	train-other-500	She knew that the palmetto flag stood for slavery Sylvia did not know what Miss Rosalie would say to her and even worse than her teacher s disapproval she was sure that her schoolmates
5101-67853-0012	train-other-500	perhaps even Grace and Flora would dislike and blame her for not saluting their flag But she was soon to realize just how serious was her failure to salute the palmetto flag
5101-67853-0013	train-other-500	Miss Rosalie came down the aisle and laid a note on Sylvia s desk It was very brief You may go home at recess Take your books and go quietly without a word to any of the other pupils
5101-67853-0014	train-other-500	You may tell your parents that I do not care to have you as a pupil for another day As Sylvia read these words the tears sprang to her eyes It was all she could do not to sob aloud
5101-67853-0015	train-other-500	She dared not look at the other girls She held a book before her face and only hoped that she could keep back the tears until recess time
5101-67853-0016	train-other-500	But not for a moment did Sylvia wish that she had saluted a flag which stood for the protection of slavery Miss Rosalie had said that a flag was an emblem and even in her unhappiness
5101-67853-0017	train-other-500	Sylvia knew that the emblem of the United States stood for justice and liberty When the hour of recess came Sylvia had her books neatly strapped and as Miss Rosalie had directed
5101-67853-0018	train-other-500	she left the room quietly without one word to any of the other girls She had nearly reached the gate when she heard steps close behind her
none	none	 and Grace s voice calling Sylvia Sylvia dear 
5101-67853-0019	train-other-500	and Grace s arm was about her It s a mean shame declared the warm hearted little southern girl
none	none	 and flag or no flag I m your true friend 
5101-67853-0020	train-other-500	Grace Grace called Miss Rosalie and before Sylvia could respond her loyal playmate had turned obediently back to the house Sylvia stepped out on the street her eyes a little blurred by tears
5101-67853-0021	train-other-500	but greatly comforted by Grace s assuring words of friendship She did not want to go home and tell her mother what had happened and show her Miss Patten s note
none	none	 for she knew that her mother would be troubled and unhappy 
5101-67853-0022	train-other-500	Suddenly she decided to go to her father s warehouse and tell him and go home with him at noon She was sure her father would think she had done right She turned and walked quickly down King Street
5101-67853-0023	train-other-500	and in a short time she was near the wharves and could see the long building where her father stored the cotton he purchased from the planters The wharves were piled high with boxes and bales and there were small boats coming in to the wharves
5101-67853-0024	train-other-500	and others making ready to depart Sylvia could see her father s boat close to the wharf near the warehouse I wish I could take that boat and carry Estralla off to Fort Sumter she thought
5101-67853-0025	train-other-500	A good natured negro led her to mister Fulton s office and before her father could say a word Sylvia was in the midst of her story She told of the blue cockades that the other girls wore
5101-67853-0026	train-other-500	of the palmetto flag and of her failure to salute it and handed him Miss Patten s note mister Fulton looked serious and troubled as he listened to his little girl s story Then he lifted her to his knee
5101-67853-0027	train-other-500	took off her pretty hat and said Too bad dear child But you did right A little Yankee girl must be loyal to the Stars and Stripes I am glad you came and told me For a moment
5101-67853-0028	train-other-500	it seemed to Sylvia that her father had forgotten all about her He was looking straight out of the window While he had not forgotten his little girl
5101-67853-0029	train-other-500	he was thinking that Charleston people must be quite ready to take the serious step of urging their State to declare her secession from the United States and her right to buy and sell human beings as slaves He wished that the United States officers at Fort Moultrie
5101-67853-0030	train-other-500	could realize that at any time Charleston men might seize Fort Sumter where there were but few soldiers and he said aloud I ought to warn them Sylvia wondered for a moment what her father could mean but he said quickly
5101-67853-0031	train-other-500	Jump down and put on your hat I m going to sail down to Fort Moultrie and have a talk with my good friends there and you can come with me At this good news Sylvia forgot all her troubles A sail across the harbor with her father
5101-67853-0032	train-other-500	was the most delightful thing that she could imagine And she held fast to his hand smiling happily as they walked down the wharf where the boat was fastened mister Fulton was beginning to find his position as a northern man in Charleston rather uncomfortable
5101-67853-0033	train-other-500	Many of his southern friends firmly believed that the northern men had no right to tell them that slavery was wrong and must cease He wished to protect his business interests or he would have returned to Boston
5101-67853-0034	train-other-500	for it was difficult for him not to declare his own patriotic feeling that Abraham Lincoln who had just been elected President of the United States would never permit slavery to continue
5101-67853-0035	train-other-500	mister Fulton sent a darky with a message to Sylvia s mother that he was taking the little girl for a sail to the forts and in a short time they were on board the Butterfly as Sylvia had named the white sloop and were going swiftly down the harbor
none	none	 May I steer 
5101-67853-0036	train-other-500	asked Sylvia and mister Fulton smilingly agreed He was very proud of his little daughter s ability to sail a boat and although he watched her shape the boat s course and was ready to give her any needed assistance
5101-67853-0037	train-other-500	he was sure that he could trust her As they sailed past Fort Sumter Sylvia could see men at work repairing the fortifications Over both forts waved the Stars and Stripes She made a skilful landing at Fort Moultrie
5101-67853-0038	train-other-500	greatly to the admiration of the sentry on guard mister Fulton and Sylvia went directly to the officer s quarters which were in the rear of the fort and where missus Carleton gave Sylvia a warm welcome She asked the little girl about her school
5101-67853-0039	train-other-500	and Sylvia told her what had happened that morning I am not surprised said Captain Carleton
none	none	 I expect any day that Charleston men will take Fort Sumter and fly the palmetto flag instead of the Stars and Stripes 
5101-67853-0040	train-other-500	If Major Anderson had his way we would have a stronger force in Fort Sumter and that is greatly needed Major Anderson was the officer in command at Fort Moultrie
5101-67853-0041	train-other-500	He was a southern man but a true and loyal officer of the United States When Captain Carleton and mister Fulton went out missus Carleton asked Sylvia if she was sorry to leave the school and if she liked her schoolmates
5101-67853-0042	train-other-500	Sylvia was eager to tell her of all the good times she had enjoyed with Grace and Flora and declared that they were her true friends Then she told missus Carleton about Estralla
5101-67853-0043	train-other-500	and of her resolve that the little darky girl should not be separated from Aunt Connie Your best plan then will be to go and see mister Robert Waite and ask him He is a kind hearted man
5101-67853-0044	train-other-500	and perhaps he will promise you to let the child stay with her mother I hope it will not be long now before all the slaves will be set free said missus Carleton Before Sylvia could respond Captain Carleton came hurrying into the room
5101-67853-0045	train-other-500	He had a letter in his hand and asked Sylvia to excuse missus Carleton for a moment and they left the room together In a few moments missus Carleton returned alone and Sylvia heard Captain Carleton say It is worth trying
none	none	 My dear Sylvia I want you to do something for me 
5101-67853-0046	train-other-500	it is not really for me she added quickly it is for the United States Something to help keep the flag flying over these forts Oh can I do something like that Sylvia asked eagerly Yes my dear
5101-67853-0047	train-other-500	Now listen carefully Here is a letter which Major Anderson wants delivered to a gentleman who will start for Washington to morrow If anyone from this fort should be seen visiting that gentleman he would not be allowed to leave Charleston as he plans
none	none	 If your father even should call upon him it would create suspicion So I am going to ask you to carry this letter to the address written on the envelope and you must give it into his own hands to night Not even your own father will know that you have this letter so if he should be questioned or watched he will be able to deny knowing of its existence Are you willing to undertake it Yes Yes promised Sylvia I will carry it safely The gentleman shall have the letter to night and she reached out her hand to take it But missus Carleton shook her head No my dear I will pin it safely inside your dress It would not do for you to be seen leaving the fort with a letter in your hand CHAPTER XI SYLVIA CARRIES A MESSAGE missus Fulton did not seem surprised to hear of Sylvia s dismissal from Miss Patten s school because of her failure to salute the palmetto flag She did not say very much of the occurrence that afternoon when Sylvia returned from the fort for she wanted Sylvia to think as pleasantly as possible of her pretty teacher But she was surprised that Sylvia herself did not have more to say about the affair But Sylvia s own thoughts were so filled by the mysterious letter which was pinned inside her dress with wondering how she could safely deliver it without the knowledge of anyone that she hardly thought of school For the time she had even forgotten Estralla What do you say to becoming a teacher yourself Sylvia dear her mother asked as they sat together in the big sunny room which overlooked the harbor 
5101-67854-0000	train-other-500	When I grow up asked Sylvia missus Fulton smiled Sylvia grown up seemed a long way in the future
none	none	 No that is too far away she answered I was thinking that perhaps you would like to teach Estralla to read and write 
5101-67854-0001	train-other-500	You could begin to morrow if you wished
none	none	 Yes indeed Mother you think of everything declared Sylvia 
5101-67854-0002	train-other-500	Why that will be better than going to school But we must not let your own studies be neglected her mother reminded her so after you have given Estralla a morning lesson each day
5101-67854-0003	train-other-500	you and I will study together and keep up with Grace and Flora By the way
none	none	 Flora was here just before you and your father reached home 
5101-67854-0004	train-other-500	she was very sorry not to see you and I have asked Flora and Grace to come to supper to morrow night Sylvia began to think that a world without school was going to be a very pleasant world after all
5101-67854-0005	train-other-500	She was sure that it would be great fun to teach Estralla and to have lessons with her mother was even better than reciting to pretty Miss Rosalie
none	none	 and beside this her best friends were coming to supper the next night 
5101-67854-0006	train-other-500	so she had many pleasant things to think of which was exactly what her mother had planned Her father had said that she might ask Grace to go sailing with them in the Butterfly in a day or two
5101-67854-0007	train-other-500	and now Sylvia resolved to ask if she might not ask Flora as well and perhaps Estralla could go too So it was no wonder that she ran up stairs singing There s a good time coming It s almost here
5101-67854-0008	train-other-500	greatly to the satisfaction of her father and mother who had feared that she would be very unhappy over the school affair They were sorry it had happened but they could not blame Sylvia Oh Missy Sylvia
none	none	 here I is and as Sylvia set her candle on the table 
5101-67854-0009	train-other-500	Estralla stood smiling before her Oh exclaimed Sylvia with such surprise that the little darky looked at her wonderingly Yo tells me to come an here I is she repeated You tells me
none	none	 and Estralla sniffed as if ready to give her usual wails that you se gwine to stop my bein sold off from my mammy How you gwine to stop it Missy 
5101-67854-0010	train-other-500	For a moment Sylvia was tempted to tell Estralla that it couldn t be helped as long as South Carolina believed in slavery But Estralla s sad eyes and pleading look made her resolve again to protect this little slave girl against injustice
5101-67854-0011	train-other-500	So she replied quickly That is my secret But don t you worry Some day very soon I shall tell you all about it You know Estralla that you need not be afraid
none	none	 And what do you think I am not going to school any more Estralla s face had brightened 
5101-67854-0012	train-other-500	She was always quite ready to smile but she could not understand why Sylvia had wanted her to come so mysteriously to her room And I am going to teach you to read and write Sylvia added Is you Missy
5101-67854-0013	train-other-500	Estralla responded in a half frightened whisper
none	none	 Now she thought she knew all about Missy Sylvia s reasons for the secret visit 
5101-67854-0014	train-other-500	For very few slave owners allowed anyone to teach the slaves to read and write Estralla knew this and it seemed a wonderful thing that Missy Sylvia proposed I ll tell you all about it to morrow morning said Sylvia now run away
5101-67854-0015	train-other-500	and with a chuckle of delight Estralla closed the door softly behind her She had been quite ready to run away with Missy Sylvia when she had crept up the stairs earlier in the evening But to stay safely with her mammy
5101-67854-0016	train-other-500	and learn to read seemed a much happier plan to the little darky If she could read and write Why
none	none	 it would be almost as wonderful as it would to be a little white girl she thought 
5101-67854-0017	train-other-500	Now Sylvia realized as she stood alone in her safe pleasant chamber that as soon as possible she must deliver the letter entrusted to her If it was to go to Washington it must be some message that was of importance to the officers at Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter she thought
5101-67854-0018	train-other-500	Perhaps it might even be something that would help Carolinians to give up slavery and then Estralla and Aunt Connie and all the black people she knew and liked could be safe and have homes of their own Sylvia went to the window and peered out
5101-67854-0019	train-other-500	The street and garden lay dark and shadowy Now and then a dark figure went along the street The house seemed very quiet She tiptoed to the closet and took out a brown cape
none	none	 It was one which she wore on stormy days and nearly covered her 
5101-67854-0020	train-other-500	Then from one of the bureau drawers she drew out a long blue silk scarf and twisted it about her head I can pull the end over my face and they ll think I m a darky she thought resolved if anyone spoke to her not to answer
5101-67854-0021	train-other-500	She whispered over the name and address on the letter She knew that the street led from King Street and she was sure that she could find it But it was some distance from home it would be late before she could get back She blew out her candle
none	none	 opened her chamber door and stood listening 
5101-67854-0022	train-other-500	She could not hear a sound and tiptoed cautiously along the hall to the stairs What if the door of her mother s room should open she thought terrified at such a possibility What could she say She had promised not to tell of the letter
5101-67854-0023	train-other-500	and what reason could she give for creeping out of the house at that hour But she reached the lower floor safely and now came the danger of making a noise when opening the door Sylvia grasped the big key and turned it slowly
5101-67854-0024	train-other-500	Then she pulled at the heavy door and it swung back easily
none	none	 She gave a long breath of relief as she stepped out on the piazza 
5101-67854-0025	train-other-500	She left the door ajar so that she could slip in easily on her return Keeping in the shadow of the trees she reached the street and now she felt sure that nothing could prevent her from delivering the letter She ran swiftly along
5101-67854-0026	train-other-500	now and then meeting someone who glanced wonderingly at the flying little figure She had reached King Street and was nearly at the street where she was to turn when suddenly a heavy hand grasped her arm and nearly swung her from her feet
5101-67854-0027	train-other-500	Running off are you And wearing your mistress s clothes at that I ll warrant said a gruff voice
none	none	 Wall now whose darky are you 
5101-67854-0028	train-other-500	Sylvia pulled the silken scarf from her face and even in the glimmer of the dull street lamp under which the man had drawn her he could see the auburn hair and blue eyes But he still kept his grasp on her arm
none	none	 There were slaves who were not black he knew and quality white girls were not running about Charleston streets alone at night What is your name he demanded Sylvia looked at him resentfully How dare you grab me like this she demanded Let me go 
5101-67854-0029	train-other-500	The man released his grasp instantly No darky girl or slave would have spoken like that He vanished as suddenly as he had appeared more frightened now than Sylvia herself For an instant Sylvia stood quite still
5101-67854-0030	train-other-500	She felt ready to cry and now walked more slowly For the first time she realized something of what it must be to be a colored girl If I had been Estralla
none	none	 he could have dragged me off and had me whipped she thought 
5101-67854-0031	train-other-500	Oh I must get mister Robert Waite to let Estralla stay safe with us She was now near her destination which proved to be a large house right on the street She knocked at the door several times before it was opened
5101-67854-0032	train-other-500	Then she found herself looking up at a tall man whose white hair and kindly smile gave her confidence Well little girl whom do you wish to see he asked pleasantly I have a message
none	none	 I began Sylvia her voice trembling a little Are you mister 
5101-67854-0033	train-other-500	Doane Yes come in
none	none	 and he held the door open for her to enter and then closed and fastened it behind them 
5101-67854-0034	train-other-500	Sylvia drew the letter from its hiding place and handed it to him and mister Doane slipped it into his pocket Come in my child and rest a moment you are out of breath he said leading the way to a small room at the end of the narrow hall
5101-67854-0035	train-other-500	Sylvia was glad to sit down in a low chair near the table while mister Doane opened the envelope She could see that there was another letter enclosed as well as the one which the tall man was reading with such interest When he had finished reading the letter
5101-67854-0036	train-other-500	he tore it into a great many small pieces Then he put the enclosed envelope carefully in an inner pocket So you brought me this letter from the fort Well you have done what I hope may prove a great service to the Stars and Stripes
5101-67854-0037	train-other-500	I thank you he said looking with smiling eyes at the tired little figure in the brown cape Then he asked Sylvia her name and she told him that no one not even her dear mother knew that she had brought the message
5101-67854-0038	train-other-500	Before they had finished their talk he had heard all about the blue cockades that the girls had worn at Miss Patten s school and of Sylvia s refusal to salute the palmetto flag You see I couldn t do that
5101-67854-0039	train-other-500	because it would mean that I believed that Estralla ought to be a slave
none	none	 and of course I don t believe such a dreadful thing she explained So then mister Doane heard all about Estralla and Aunt Connie Sylvia decided that she liked mister Doane even better than Captain Carleton 
5101-67854-0040	train-other-500	And when he told her again that by her courage in bringing him the message from the fort and by her silence in regard to it that she had done him a great service
none	none	 as well as a service to those whose only wish for South Carolina 
5101-67854-0041	train-other-500	was that the State should free herself from slavery
none	none	 Sylvia forgot all about the long walk through the shadowy streets I wish I had someone to send with you to see you home safely mister Doane said a little anxiously as they stood together in the little hallway But I am known here and I fear everything I do is watched So I must trust that you will be safely cared for Before Sylvia could reply and say that she was not at all afraid to go alone the outer door rattled as if someone were trying to push it open You have been followed Run back to the sitting room whispered mister Doane I will open the door CHAPTER XII ESTRALLA HELPS Sylvia standing just inside the door of the small room heard the outer door swing open She heard mister Doane s sharp question and then a familiar wail Oh It s Estralla she exclaimed and ran back to the entry It s Estralla Oh I m so glad she said Don you be skeered Missy Sylvia said Estralla valiantly Dis yere man cyan t take you off n sell you All Estralla can think of is that somebody is going to be carried off and sold Sylvia said turning to mister Doane who stood by looking very serious How did you know where your little mistress was he questioned gravely For if this little darky knew of Sylvia s errand he feared that she might tell others and so Sylvia would have brought the message from the fort to little purpose The letter which was now in mister Doane s pocket was to the Secretary of War in Washington asking for permission for Major Anderson to take men to Fort Sumter before the secessionists could occupy it I follers Missy explained Bstralla An when that man grabs her on King Street I was gwine to chase right home an get Massa Fulton but Missy talks brave at him an he lets go of her Oh Missy What you doin of way off here At this question mister Doane smiled realizing that the little negro girl had no knowledge of the message which Sylvia had delivered Well Estralla suppose Miss Sylvia came to try and help give you your freedom he asked An my mammy demanded Estralla eagerly Why of course mister Doane replied For anything that helps to convince South Carolina that she is wrong will help to free the slaves he added turning to Sylvia Now Estralla if you love Miss Sylvia if you want to stay with your mammy you must never tell of her visit here to night Remember and mister Doane s voice was very stern Estralla won t tell Sylvia declared confidently and I am glad she came to go home with me Shuah I ll do jes what Missy wants me to said the little darky Try to let missus Carleton know that I received the letter and that I hope to reach Washington safely said mister Doane as he bade Sylvia good night As the door closed behind them Estralla clasped Sylvia s hand Wat dat clock say she asked for one of the city clocks was striking the hour It s twelve o clock answered Sylvia Oh My lan Missy Dat s a terrible onlucky time fer us to be out whispered Estralla Dat s de time w en witch folks comes a dancin an a prancin roun and takes off chilluns Sylvia knew that all the negroes believed in witches and all sorts of impossible tales so Estralla s words did not at all frighten her but she did wish that she was safe in her own home The streets were now dark and silent and black shadows seemed to lurk at every corner as hand in hand Estralla and Sylvia ran swiftly along I tells you Missy dat it s jes lucky I comes after you cos witch folks w at comes floatin roun bout dis hour of de night dey ain t gwine to tech us cos when dey s two folks holdin each other hands tight jes like we is dey don t dast to tech us said Estralla Where were you Estralla when I came down stairs Sylvia asked I was jes a takin a little sleep on de big rug side of your door Missy I se been a sleepin dere dis long time My mammy lets me An when you opens de door I mos calls out but didn t I jes stan s up quick so s you nebber know I was thar and Estralla chuckled happily Sylvia wondered to herself why Estralla should choose such a hard bed Then suddenly she realized all Estralla s devotion That the little negro girl had slept there to be near her fr en She remembered the first time that she had ever seen Estralla on the morning when she had tumbled in to Sylvia s room and broken the big pitcher and that even then Estralla had been ready to confess and take the whipping that she was sure would follow rather than let Sylvia be blamed She recalled Estralla s effort to rescue her at Fort Sumter on the day Sylvia had run away from Miss Patten s school and she remembered that it was Estralla who had told Miss Patten the real reason and so saved her from further trouble Estralla you have been my true friend she declared and I am going to remember it always I am going to ask my mother to put a nice little bed for you in your mammy s cabin Don yo do that Missy I likes sleepin on de rug pleaded Estralla Hush we must creep in without making any noise responded Sylvia in a whisper for they were now directly in front of Sylvia s home Noiselessly Estralla led the way Oh Missy de door is shut fas she whispered as she endeavored to push it open But it can t be shut Sylvia answered Both the little girls pushed against it but the door stood fast Oh What will we do half sobbed Sylvia who was now very tired and almost too sleepy to think of anything We cyan t get in de back door My mammy she d wake up if a rabbit run twixt her cabin an de kitchen Estralla whispered back I spec s I ll hev to climb up to de winder ober de porch and comes down and let you in Oh Can you Estralla Sylvia s voice was very near to tears She had forgotten all about the importance of the message she had safely delivered All she wanted now was to be inside this dear safe house where her mother and father were sleeping not knowing that their little girl cold and sleepy was shut out I spec s I can Estralla answered You jes stay quiet an in bout four shakes of a lamb s tail I se gwine to open de door an in yo walks There was a little scrambling noise among the stout vines which ran up the pillars of the porch as Estralla started to carry out her plan A cat or a fluttering bird would have hardly made more commotion Sylvia listened eagerly Suppose the porch window was fastened she thought fearfully It seemed a very long time before the front door opened and Estralla reached out and clutched at the brown cape Noiselessly they crept up the stairs Estralla leading the way It was she who opened the door of Sylvia s room and then with a whispered Yo se all right now Missy closed it behind her Sylvia hung up the brown cape in the closet and slipped off her dress She was soon in bed and fast asleep and it was late the next morning before she awoke so late that her father had breakfasted and gone to his warehouse Estralla had been sent on an errand and missus Fulton decided that Sylvia should have a holiday You seem tired dear child she said a little anxiously as Sylvia said that she did not want to go to walk that she had rather sit still I guess I am tired acknowledged the little girl and was quite content to sit by the window with a story book instead of giving Estralla a lesson If it had not been for Estralla I don t know what would have happened to me last night she thought She wondered who had closed and fastened the front door but dared not ask Grace and Flora were to come early that afternoon as soon after school as possible and Flora had sent Sylvia a note that she would bring her lace work and give her a lesson By noon Sylvia felt rested and was looking eagerly forward to her friends visit She began to feel that she was a very fortunate little girl to have had the chance to do something that might help as mister Doane had said to give the black people their freedom She only wished that she could tell her mother and father of the midnight journey But I will ask missus Carleton the next time I go to the fort to let me tell Mother she resolved CHAPTER XIII A HAPPY AFTERNOON Grace was the first to arrive and she declared that she wished that she was in Sylvia s place and need not go to school another day The two little friends stood at the window watching for Flora and it was not long before they saw her coming up the walk closely followed by her black Mammy who was carrying two baskets One of these seemed very heavy What can be in Mammy s basket I wonder said Grace And look Sylvia Flora isn t wearing the blue cockade That s because she is coming to visit you She had it on at school this morning Flora wore the same pretty velvet turban which she had worn on Sylvia s last day at school She had on a cape of garnet colored velvet and as she came running into the room Sylvia looked at her with admiring eyes You do look so pretty Flora And I am so glad to see you Come up stairs to my room and take off your things It isn t half the fun going to school now that you don t come Sylvia responded Flora as the three friends went up the broad staircase together Mammy with her baskets followed them and when she had helped her little mistress lay aside her cape and hat Flora said You can go home now Mammy And my mother will tell you when to come after me Yas Missy responded the old colored woman and with a curtsey to each of the little girls she left the room What makes your mammy look so sober Flora questioned Grace She is usually all smiles but to day she hasn t a word to say for herself Oh the darkies are all stirred up over all this talk about their being set free Flora answered and even Mammy who was Mother s nurse and has always been well taken care of thinks it would be a fine thing for her children and grandchildren to be jes like white folks and Flora laughed scornfully But that needn t make her look sober insisted Grace I reckon she s upset because my mother sold two or three little slaves yesterday Mammy s grandchildren Flora answered carelessly Sylvia could feel her face flushing and she said over to herself that no matter what Flora said that she Sylvia must remember that Flora was her guest Beside that had not Flora taken off the blue cockade so that Sylvia would not be reminded of the trouble at school But Grace felt no such restraints She was a southern girl as well as Flora but she was sorry for the old colored woman Well I do wish we could keep the pickaninnies until they grow up It seems a shame when they feel so bad to be sold off to strangers And some of them are abused too she said You talk as if they felt just the same as we do and that s silly Flora declared but Philip talks just the same He says he is going to give Dinkie her freedom and she turned toward the two baskets which Mammy had set down with such care near Molly and Polly I brought my lace work and Mother has fixed a cushion for you Sylvia and one for Grace too See The pattern is begun on each one and I will give you both lessons until you know as much as I do As Flora talked she had opened the smaller basket and taken out two square boxes and handed one to each of her friends Open them she said nodding smilingly The box which she handed to Sylvia was covered with plaited blue silk It had a narrow edge of gilt braid around the cover Grace s box was covered with yellow silk but the boxes were of the same size As Sylvia and Grace lifted the covers they smiled and exclaimed happily The lace cushion lay inside and in dainty little pockets on each side of the boxes were the delicate threads and materials for the lace A thimble of gold with Sylvia from Flora engraved around its rim was in Sylvia s box and one exactly like it was in Grace s box Oh Flora Hayes This is the most beautiful present that ever was declared Sylvia and Grace holding the box with both hands was hopping up and down saying over and over Flora You are just like the Golden Princess in a fairy story who gives people what they want most My mother made the boxes herself Flora explained proudly I wanted to give you girls something and I m awfully glad you like them Then Flora stood up quickly Girls I dressed up in Mother s hat and skirt that night at the plantation It wasn t Lady Caroline She spoke very rapidly as if she wished to finish as quickly as possible It was not easy to think of Flora Hayes as being ashamed but Sylvia felt quite sure that Flora felt sorry that she had attempted to deceive her friends I knew it all the time said Grace slowly and I told Sylvia it was you didn t I Sylvia Yes said Sylvia and we knew you were sure to tell us about it Flora But you did look just like the picture of Lady Caroline Flora sat down It had been so much easier to confess than she had expected Neither Grace nor Sylvia had seemed resentful or surprised You didn t tell me that you knew she said a little accusingly Oh well we couldn t do that Flora You see we were your guests Grace explained And we knew you were sure to tell us Sylvia added Flora was silent for a moment She was thinking that both her friends had been rather fine about the whole affair They had not run screaming from their room on the appearance of the ghost and alarmed the house and so brought discovery and punishment and shame upon her neither had they resented her not confessing Well I do think you two girls are the nicest girls in this town she declared and I am mighty proud that you are my friends I can tell you one thing I ll never try to make anyone believe in ghosts again I was half frightened to death myself when I crept up those stairs and my shoulder has been lame ever since Grace and Sylvia had wondered what the large basket contained but in their interest over Flora s beautiful gifts and their delight in her owning up to being the ghost they had quite forgotten about it It was Flora who now pointed at it and said laughingly I ve brought my dolls in that basket Molly and Polly will be glad enough to have company Sylvia assured her Flora opened the basket and took out a large black mammy in a purple dress white apron and a yellow handkerchief twisted turban fashion about her head Mammy Jane always goes with the young ladies she explained laughingly and took out two fine china dolls dressed in white muslin with broad crimson silk sashes Each of these fine ladies had a tiny parasol of crimson silk I m going home after my dolls exclaimed Grace and while Sylvia brought cushions for these unexpected visitors and introduced them to Molly and Polly Grace hurried home and was soon back again with her own treasured dolls which she introduced as mister and missus and Miss Delaney The lesson in lace making was quite forgotten as the three girls played with the array of dolls Sylvia ran to the door and called Estralla who appeared so quickly that Sylvia wondered where she could have been Estralla was told that she must help Mammy Jane take care of the doll visitors and the little negro s face beamed with pleasure Not one of the little girls in the pleasant room was as happy as Estralla and when supper was ready and Sylvia and her friends went down stairs leaving Estralla in charge of all the dolls she could hardly believe in her good fortune and as usual was sure it was all due to her beloved Missy Sylvia After supper the dolls were all invited downstairs to be introduced to Sylvia s father and mother and Estralla smiling and delighted was entrusted with bringing Mammy Jane The three friends often looked back on that happy afternoon for on the very next day mister Hayes decided to move his family to the plantation and it was many days before Sylvia Grace and Flora were to be together again The citizens of Charleston in December eighteen sixty were becoming anxious as to what might befall them Very soon it might be possible that South Carolina would secede from the Union and war with the northern states might follow In such a case the guns of Fort Sumter and Fort Moultrie might fire on Charleston and many planters who had homes in Charleston were sending their families to their country homes Northern men who had business in Charleston were also anxious and Sylvia did not know that her own father was seriously considering a return to Boston But the little girls bade each other good night with happy smiles and laughter and without a thought but that they would have many more pleasant times together Sylvia did not even think of the lace making until she brought down her pretty box to show to her mother and father The Charleston people have been so kind to us missus Fulton said a little sadly They are the most courteous and kindly people in the world declared mister Fulton Sylvia went up to her room wondering why her mother and father seemed so serious when everything was so lovely She had almost forgotten her adventure of the previous night and went happily to bed with Flora s pretty gift on the light stand beside her bed

6643_67857_000012_000005	train-clean-360	I ll go tell him so this very day declared Sylvia her face brightening as she remembered the twenty dollars in gold which her Grandmother Fulton had given her when she had left Boston 
6643_67857_000012_000006	train-clean-360	 You can do whatever you please with it was what Grandmother Fulton had said 
6643_67857_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia had thought that she would ask her mother to buy her a watch with the money but she did not remember that now 
none	none	She knew that more than anything she would rather keep Estralla safe 
6643_67857_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Twenty dollars was a good deal of money she reflected 
6643_67857_000013_000003	train-clean-360	If the northern soldiers would only come quickly and set the slaves free 
6643_67857_000013_000004	train-clean-360	But even if they did not come for a long time the money would surely pay mister Waite wages for Estralla so that he would not insist on selling her 
6643_67857_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla s face had brightened instantly at Sylvia s promise 
6643_67857_000014_000001	train-clean-360	And when Sylvia explained that she had money of her very own and even opened her writing desk and showed Estralla the shining gold pieces the little darky s fears vanished 
none	none	She was as sure that all would be well now as she had been frightened and despondent when she entered the room Shall I tell my mammy she asked eagerly
6643_67857_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Sylvia responded 
none	none	I know my mother will let me Because Grandma said I could do as I pleased with the money 
6643_67857_000016_000003	train-clean-360	And I please to pay it to mister Waite 
none	none	Then I ll be your maid won t I Missy Sylvia chuckled the little darky with proud delight an I ll allers go whar yo goes like Missy Flora Hayes mammy does Why yes I suppose you will agreed Sylvia Sylvia had meant to tell her mother and father of her plan about Estralla at breakfast time but her father was just leaving the dining room when she came in Are you going to ask your little friends to go out in the Butterfly this afternoon he asked
6643_67857_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 If you want to go to the forts you must be on hand early 
6643_67857_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll ask them right away after breakfast before they start for school Sylvia promised eagerly 
none	none	She was glad that she could go to the forts again and tell missus Carleton that she had given the letter to mister Doane This filled her thoughts for the moment so she quite forgot about her plan to employ Estralla especially as her mother had decided that lessons would not begin until the following week 
6643_67857_000022_000000	train-clean-360	It had seemed to missus Fulton that her little daughter was tired and not as well as usual and she was glad that the sailing expedition would take her out for a long afternoon on the water 
6643_67857_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia ate her breakfast hurriedly and ran upstairs for her cape and hat to find Estralla waiting just inside the door of her room 
none	none	Wat yo mammy say bout my bein yo maid questioned the little darky Oh it will be all right I am going to ask Grace and Flora to go sailing this afternoon and I ll keep on to mister Robert Waite s and have it all settled this morning Sylvia replied putting on her pretty new hat You may come too she added Yas Missy Wat yo reckon Massa Robert gwine to say questioned Estralla earnestly
6643_67857_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I will take the money Sylvia said not answering Estralla s question then mister Waite will be sure that I can pay him 
6643_67857_000029_000000	train-clean-360	missus Fulton saw Sylvia closely followed by Estralla running across the garden toward the house where Grace Waite lived 
6643_67857_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Poor little darky 
6643_67857_000030_000001	train-clean-360	What will she do when Sylvia goes north she thought 
none	none	For mister Fulton had told her that very morning that he was sure South Carolina would secede from the Union and then northern men would no longer be welcome in Charleston 
6643_67857_000030_000003	train-clean-360	That meant of course that the Fultons would have to return to Boston if that were possible but all communication with northern states might be prevented 
none	none	It was no wonder that mister and missus Fulton were anxious and worried Grace was ready to start for school when Sylvia and Estralla arrived and her mother gave her consent at once for her to go sailing in the afternoon
6643_67857_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 The Christmas holidays will soon be here so a half day out of school will not matter missus Waite said smilingly and gave Grace a note for Miss Patten 
6643_67857_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll walk to Flora s with you said Grace 
6643_67857_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 Now Sylvia own up that you think Charleston is nicer than Boston 
6643_67857_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Why it is all ice and snow and cold weather up there and here it is warm and pleasant 
none	none	You couldn t go sailing if you were in Boston to day she added laughingly
6643_67857_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 No but I could go sleighing responded Sylvia 
6643_67857_000035_000000	train-clean-360	As they came in sight of Flora s home they both exclaimed in surprise 
6643_67857_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why they are all going away 
none	none	Look Flora and her mother are in the carriage said Grace and there is Philip on horseback The carriage had turned on to the street and even as Grace spoke a curve in the road hid it from view 
6643_67857_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Philip evidently giving some directions to the negroes who were loading trunks and boxes into a cart rode down the driveway just as Grace and Sylvia reached the entrance 
6643_67857_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He greeted them smilingly and stopped his horse to speak with them 
none	none	It was all planned for us to go to the plantation before Flora got home last night he explained
6643_67857_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Father thought it was best for the family to be out of the city 
none	none	You see it s getting time for Carolinians to take possession of the forts and there may be trouble But the palmetto flag will soon float over Fort Sumter he added smilingly and with a touch of his cap and a smiling good bye he rode off 
6643_67857_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia was sorry that Flora was going away but that Philip should want the palmetto flag to take the place of the Stars and Stripes over Fort Sumter seemed a much greater misfortune 
6643_67857_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 When he knows it stands for slavery she thought wondering if he had entirely forgotten about Dinkie 
6643_67857_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll have to run or I ll be late for school declared Grace 
none	none	I ll be all ready when you call and with a gay good bye she was off down the street leaving Sylvia and Estralla standing alone near the high wall which enclosed the garden of the Hayes house Massa Robert Waite he live right roun de corner said Estralla and the two girls turned down the street leading to the house of Estralla s master 
6643_67857_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia went up the flight of stone steps which led to mister Waite s door a little fearfully 
none	none	A tall good natured colored man opened the door and asked her errand and then led the way across the wide hall and rapped at a door
6643_67857_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 A little white missy to see you Massa Robert he said and in a moment Sylvia found herself standing before a smiling gentleman whose red face and white whiskers made her think of the pictures of Santa Claus 
6643_67857_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t you be seated young lady he said very politely waving his hand toward a low cushioned chair and bowing as if I were really grown up thought Sylvia 
6643_67857_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I am Sylvia Fulton she said wondering why her voice sounded so faint 
none	none	Perhaps you are the daughter of mister John Fulton who does me the favor of renting my house on the East Battery responded mister Waite with another bow
6643_67857_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir said Sylvia meekly wondering whether she would ever dare tell him her errand 
6643_67857_000048_000001	train-clean-360	There was a little silence and then mister Waite took a seat near his little visitor and said 
none	none	Let me see is not your name in a song
6643_67857_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 Then to Sylvia let us sing he hummed beating time with his right hand 
6643_67857_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I was named for that song 
6643_67857_000050_000001	train-clean-360	And if you please mister Waite would you let me pay you wages for Estralla 
none	none	For Estralla 
6643_67857_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Now of course I ought to know all about Estralla 
none	none	But you see I have a man who attends to the names and all that of my negroes But perhaps you can tell me who Estralla is replied mister Waite
6643_67857_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 If you please sir she is Aunt Connie s little girl and she lives with us and I like her and I thought began Sylvia but mister Waite raised his hand and she stopped suddenly 
6643_67857_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I see 
none	none	I see You want her to wait upon you I see Quite right But if she is living in your house she is not costing me a penny for board So I am indebted to you Well Well 
6643_67857_000053_000008	train-clean-360	I must see that whatever you wish is carried out 
none	none	You need not pay me wages little Miss Sylvia but you shall have the girl for your own servant as long as you live in my house and I am delighted to have you take her off my hands Yes indeed 
6643_67857_000053_000011	train-clean-360	Yes indeed and mister Waite smiled and bowed and seemed exactly like Santa Claus 
none	none	I m ever so much obliged said Sylvia
6643_67857_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 I like Estralla 
none	none	Do you Yes Well 
6643_67857_000055_000003	train-clean-360	And I hope you will come again Miss Sylvia 
6643_67857_000055_000004	train-clean-360	I am greatly pleased to have made your acquaintance and the polite gentleman escorted her to the door where he bade her good bye with such an elegant bow that Sylvia nearly fell backward in her effort to make as low a curtsey as seemed necessary 
6643_67857_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Estralla had hidden herself behind some shrubbery and joined Sylvia at the gate 
6643_67857_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Would he hire me out Missy she asked eagerly 
none	none	My no answered Sylvia and before she could explain the generosity of Estralla s owner the little darky was wailing and sobbing I knowed I d be sold 
6643_67857_000058_000001	train-clean-360	I knowed it 
none	none	Keep still Estralla 
6643_67857_000059_000001	train-clean-360	mister Waite says I may have you without paying him 
none	none	Just as long as I live in his house he said you were to be my maid Oh Estralla He was just as kind and polite as if I had been a grown up young lady said Sylvia with enthusiasm Yas m I reckons he would hafter be cos he s a Carolinian general man I se mighty glad he gives me to you Missy I reckon my mammy s gwine to be glad and Estralla quite forgetting that there was such a thing as trouble in the world danced along beside her new mistress 
6643_67857_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia hurried home eager to tell her mother of her wonderful new friend and of Flora s departure to the plantation 
6643_67857_000062_000000	train-clean-360	missus Fulton listened in surprise 
6643_67857_000062_000001	train-clean-360	But when Sylvia finished her story of mister Waite s kindness declaring that he was just like Santa Claus she did not reprove her for going on such an errand without permission but agreed with her little daughter that mister Robert Waite was a very kind and generous gentleman 
6643_67857_000063_000000	train-clean-360	Aunt Connie was as delighted as it was possible for a mother to be who knows that her youngest child is safe under the same roof with herself She tried to thank Sylvia for protecting Estralla but Sylvia was too happy over her success to listen to her 
none	none	When Grace returned from school Sylvia ran over and told her all about her Uncle Robert s kindness Grace listened with wondering eyes
6643_67857_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s just like Uncle Robert she declared 
none	none	But I think you were brave to ask him 
6643_67858_000004_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XV
none	none	 WHERE IS SYLVIA The Butterfly was all ready and waiting for its passengers when Grace and Sylvia followed by the smiling and delighted Estralla who was carrying Sylvia s cape and trying to act as much like a rale grown up lady s maid as possible came down to the long wharf Although it was December there was little to remind anyone of winter The air was soft and clear the sun shone brightly and only a little westerly breeze ruffled the blue waters of the harbor 
6643_67858_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Negroes were at work on the wharf loading bales of cotton on a big ship 
6643_67858_000008_000001	train-clean-360	They were singing as they worked and Sylvia resolved to remember the words of the song 
none	none	De big bee flies high De little bee makes de honey De black man raise de cotton An de white man gets de money She repeated it over and then Grace sang it with an amused laugh at her friend s interest in nigger songs 
6643_67858_000011_000000	train-clean-360	mister Fulton came to meet them and helped them on board the boat 
6643_67858_000011_000001	train-clean-360	As the Butterfly made its way out into the channel the little girls looked back at the long water front where lay many vessels from far off ports 
6643_67858_000011_000002	train-clean-360	In the distance they could see the spire of saint Philip s one of the historic churches of Charleston and everywhere fluttered the palmetto flag 
6643_67858_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia sat in the stern beside her father and very soon the tiller was in her hand and she was shaping the boat s course toward the forts Grace watched her admiringly 
6643_67858_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe you could steer in the dark she declared 
6643_67858_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course she could if she had a compass and was familiar with the stars said mister Fulton and he called Grace s attention to the compass fastened securely near Sylvia s seat and explained the rules of navigation 
6643_67858_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that the way the big ships know how to find their harbors asked Grace when mister Fulton told her of the stars and how the pilots set their course 
6643_67858_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and if Sylvia understood how to steer by the compass she could steer the Butterfly as well at night as she can now 
none	none	Sylvia looked at the compass with a new interest she was sure that navigation would be a much more interesting study than grammar and resolved to ask her father to teach her how to box the compass 
6643_67858_000018_000000	train-clean-360	There had been many changes at Fort Moultrie since Sylvia s last visit A deep ditch had been dug between the fort and the sand bars and many workmen were busy in strengthening the defences and Sylvia and Grace wondered why so many soldiers were stationed along the parapet 
6643_67858_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Captain Carleton seemed very glad to welcome them and sent a soldier to escort the girls to the officers quarters while mister Fulton went in search of Major Anderson 
6643_67858_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Sylvia wondered if she would have a chance to tell missus Carleton that she had safely delivered the message 
6643_67858_000020_000000	train-clean-360	missus Carleton was in her pleasant sitting room and declared that she had been wishing for company and held up some strips of red and white bunting 
6643_67858_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 I am making a new flag for Fort Sumter she said 
none	none	Perhaps you will help me sew on the stars one for each State you know Is there one for South Carolina asked Grace as missus Carleton found two small thimbles which she said she had used when she was no older than Sylvia and showed the girls how to sew the white stars securely on the blue Yes indeed 
6643_67858_000022_000001	train-clean-360	One of the first stars on the flag was for South Carolina replied missus Carleton and this very fort was named for a defender of America s rights 
6643_67858_000023_000000	train-clean-360	While Grace and Sylvia were so pleasantly occupied Estralla had wandered out crossed the bridge which connected the officers quarters with the fort and now found herself near the landing place so that when missus Carleton made the girls a cup of hot chocolate and looked about to give Estralla her share the little colored girl was not to be seen 
6643_67858_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll call her said Sylvia and ran out on the veranda 
6643_67858_000025_000000	train-clean-360	No response came to her calls so she went down the steps and along the walk which led to the sand bars past the houses and barracks on Sullivan s island 
6643_67858_000025_000001	train-clean-360	No one was in sight whom she could ask if Estralla had passed that way 
6643_67858_000025_000002	train-clean-360	She climbed a small sand hill covered with stunted little trees and looked about but could see no trace of the little darky 
6643_67858_000025_000003	train-clean-360	It had not occurred to Sylvia that Estralla would go back to the fort 
none	none	Oh dear 
6643_67858_000026_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder where she can be thought Sylvia calling Estralla 
none	none	Estralla and sure that if she was within hearing Estralla would instantly appear As Sylvia climbed over the sandy slope she saw here and there a small green vine with glossy leaves and a tiny yellow blossom and resolved to gather a bunch to carry back to missus Carleton When I give them to her I ll have a chance to say that mister Doane has the letter she thought Wandering on in search of the flowers she went further and further from the fort up one sand slope and clown another almost forgetting her search for Estralla and finally deciding that it was time to go back to missus Carleton
6643_67858_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Probably Estralla is there before this and they will be looking for me she thought and climbed another sandy slope expecting to see the houses and barracks directly in front of her 
6643_67858_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But she found herself facing the open sea and look which way she would there was only shore sand heaps and blue water 
none	none	But Sylvia was not at all alarmed She was sure that all she had to do was to follow the line of shore and she would soon be in sight of some familiar place so she started singing to herself as she walked on De big bee flies high De little bee makes de honey and hoping that missus Carleton would not think that she had been careless in losing her way 
6643_67858_000032_000000	train-clean-360	It was rather difficult walking 
none	none	Her feet slipped in the sand and after a little Sylvia decided not to follow the shore but to climb back over the sand hills A cold wind was now blowing from the water and she was glad of the shelter of the stunted trees and decided to rest for a little while
6643_67858_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I can t be lost because I know exactly where I am 
none	none	This is Sullivan Island and the fort is right over there I mustn t rest but a minute for my father said we would start home early she thought and again started on going directly away from the fort and over sand hills and into little sloping valleys farther and farther away from familiar places The December day drew to a close and dusky shadows crept over the island Once or twice Sylvia s wanderings had brought her back to the shore but not until the darkness began to gather did she really understand that she was lost and that she was too tired to walk much longer 
6643_67858_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She thought of the little compass on board the Butterfly and wondered if a compass would help anyone find her way on land as well as on the sea 
6643_67858_000035_000003	train-clean-360	At last she began to call aloud Estralla 
none	none	Estralla feeling almost sure that like herself Estralla must be wandering about lost in the sand hills 
6643_67858_000036_000000	train-clean-360	It was nearly dark before she gave up trying to find her way to the fort and shivering and half afraid crawled under the scraggly branches of some stunted trees on a sheltered slope 
6643_67858_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 My father will come and find me I know he will she said aloud almost ready to cry I ll wait here and keep calling Estralla so he will hear me 
none	none	A few moments after Sylvia started to find Estralla missus Carleton had been called to a neighbor s house
6643_67858_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Tell Sylvia I won t be gone long she had said to Grace 
6643_67858_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Grace did not mind being alone until Sylvia returned 
6643_67858_000038_000001	train-clean-360	She helped herself to the rich creamy chocolate and the little frosted cakes and then curled up on a broad couch near the window with a book full of wonderful pictures 
6643_67858_000038_000002	train-clean-360	The pictures were of a tall man on horseback and a short fat man on a donkey 
6643_67858_000038_000003	train-clean-360	 The Adventures of Don Quixote was the title of the book and after Grace began to read she entirely forgot Sylvia Estralla and missus Carleton 
none	none	And not until mister Fulton came into the room an hour later did she lift her eyes from the book
6643_67858_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 All ready to start said mister Fulton and it will be dusk before we reach home 
none	none	Where is Sylvia
6643_67858_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh exclaimed Grace looking up in surprise 
none	none	Hasn t she come back with Estralla 
6643_67858_000040_000002	train-clean-360	missus Carleton has just gone to the next house 
6643_67858_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Well put on your things and run after them that s a good girl said mister Fulton 
6643_67858_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 Why here is Estralla now he added as the little colored girl appeared at the door 
none	none	Tell Miss Sylvia to come down to the landing I ll meet you there and he hurried away thinking his little daughter was safe with missus Carleton Whar is Missy Sylvia asked Estralla who had been asleep in a sunny corner of the veranda for the last hour
6643_67858_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is Sylvia echoed missus Carleton who came in at that moment Has she gone to the boat 
6643_67858_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I don t know 
6643_67858_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps she has 
6643_67858_000044_000002	train-clean-360	mister Fulton said for us to come right to the landing said Grace her thoughts still full of the faithful Sancho Panza of whom she had been reading 
6643_67858_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I will go to the wharf with you 
6643_67858_000045_000001	train-clean-360	It was too bad to leave you 
none	none	I must see Sylvia before she goes 
6643_67858_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps I may not be permitted to have visitors much longer said missus Carleton and she and Grace left the pleasant room and followed closely by Estralla made their way over the bridge to the landing place 
6643_67858_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Where is Sylvia asked mister Fulton looking at his watch 
6643_67858_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 We really ought to have started an hour ago For a moment the little group looked at each other in silence 
6643_67858_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Then with a sudden cry Estralla darted off 
none	none	missus Carleton hurriedly explained Sylvia s starting off to find Estralla and her own departure She blamed herself that she had permitted Sylvia to go out alone
6643_67858_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 She must be somewhere about the fort declared Captain Carleton 
6643_67858_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes agreed mister Fulton but we had best lose no time in finding her 
6643_67858_000050_000000	train-clean-360	While Captain Carleton questioned the soldiers mister Fulton and missus Carleton and Grace hastened back to the officers quarters and a thorough search for the little girl was begun at once 
none	none	No one gave a thought to Estralla who had traced her little mistress along the street and was now running along a sandy slope beyond the barracks calling Missy Sylvia Missy Sylvia But no answer came to her calls CHAPTER XVI IN DANGER Estralla did not know why she was so sure that Missy Sylvia had wandered out beyond the barracks but since her little mistress was not at missus Carleton s and had not come to the landing place the little colored girl was sure that she must be among the sand hills and she ran along calling Sylvia s name as she ran Now and then she stopped to listen for some response or to look about for some sign that might tell her that Sylvia had passed that way and near the top of one of the little slopes she found a bunch of the green vines and yellow blossoms which Sylvia had dropped She shuah am somewhar near thought Estralla and just then she heard a far off call Dat was my name she exclaimed aloud and listened more intently than ever Maybe twas jes one o them gull birds a callin she decided as no further sound came to her ears Now she went on more carefully but she too came to the shore but it was on the inner curve of the land a little cove where an old shanty stood near the water and a boat was drawn up near by Estralla looked into the rough cabin half hoping to find Sylvia there Then she went back a little way and shouted Sylvia s name again and again and this time there was a response Estralla Estralla came clearly to her ears My lan o grashus whispered the little darky and then called loudly I se a comin Missy Sylvia And now Sylvia called again Back and forth sounded the voices of the two girls each one moving toward the other for at the welcome sound of Estralla s call Sylvia had sprung up and hurried in the direction from which the voice seemed to come It was now so nearly dusk that as they came in sight of each other they were like dark shadows Oh Estralla Where is my father Sylvia cried as Estralla ran toward her and flung both arms about her little mistress He s a waitin fer yo Missy Don be skeered I se gwine to take keer of yo Do you know the way back Estralla asked Sylvia I couldn t find the fort No Missy I reckon we couldn t fin nuthin now tis too nigh dark But thar s a cabin an a boat jes over t other side o dis san heap I kin fin them responded Estralla turning back They walked very slowly for Estralla wanted to be quite sure that they were going in the right direction and not until they were in sight of the cabin and the shadowy outlines of the boat did she feel safe Then with a sigh of relief she exclaimed Wat I tell yo Missy Sylvia Ain t dar a boat like what I said An don yo know all bout a boat Course yo does Now yo can sail us right off home An when yo pa comes home mos skeered to def cos he cyan t fin yo thar yo ll be and Estralla chuckled happily as if all their troubles were over But Sylvia was not so sure Unless there was a sail or a pair of oars the boat would be of little use and even with oars and sail could she guide the boat safely to Charleston They soon discovered that there was a pair of oars in the boat but there was no sail or tiller Sylvia could row but Estralla could not be of any use But it seemed the only way in which they could reach either Fort Moultrie or their home for both the little girls realized that they might wander about the sand hills all night without finding their way back to the fort It was chilly and dark and the old cabin with its sagging roof and open doorway was not a very inviting shelter Indeed Estralla was quite sure that a lion or at the very least a family of wolves was at that moment safely hidden in one of the dark corners of the cabin The moon is out Look said Sylvia and there goes a steamer Sylvia did not know that this steamer was a guard boat which Governor Pickens of South Carolina had ordered stationed between Sullivan s Island and Fort Sumter to prevent if possible any United States troops being landed at that fort I can see the fort declared Sylvia That s it off beyond the boat and she pointed down the harbor Now we will start I know I can row the boat that far and I am sure my father will not go home without us To morrow we will send this boat back Sylvia had now forgotten all her weariness and she was no longer afraid She was sure that in a little while she would be safely at the fort and then she resolved she would at once tell missus Carleton that mister Doane had the letter and ask permission to tell her mother of her part in the secret message The boat was already half afloat and it was an easy matter to pull up the big stone attached to a strong rope which served as an anchor and then to push off from shore You watch Estralla and if any other boat comes near shout at the top of your voice said Sylvia as she dipped the oars into the dark water and pulled off from shore My lan Missy Bar s dat light agin called the half frightened darky an we s right in it dis time An instant later a call came from the guardboat Boat ahoy Where bound and before Sylvia could ship her oars or answer the call she found herself looking straight into the blinding light and felt the little boat rising on the crest of the wave made by the steamer We s gwine to be drownded Missy shouted Estralla and before Sylvia could say a word the frightened little darky had sprung up and lurched forward across Sylvia s knees The boat tipped and the water rushed over one side but Sylvia clutching the oars steadily and remembering her father s frequent warnings sat perfectly still and the little craft righted itself You nearly upset us keep still where you are Don t move said Sylvia angrily The light had flashed in another direction now and the guard boat had moved on thinking the boat contained two young darkies bound for Sullivan s Island after a visit to Charleston Sylvia could feel the water about her feet and ankles She wished that she had called for help for she realized now that they might be run into and sunk by some passing craft Beside that the wind and tide were now carrying them swiftly along toward the open sea Then suddenly Sylvia dropped her oars and screamed at the top of her voice Estralla shouted loudly Their boat had run directly against the wall of Fort Sumter In an instant there were lights flashing over the parapet There was the sound of voices a call and then the little craft was held firmly against the barricade and a gruff voice called Stop your noise and we ll have you safe in a jiffy But it seemed a long time to the frightened children before a tall soldier swung over into the boat and lifted Sylvia and then Estralla up to the outstretched hands which grasped them so firmly What on earth were you out in that boat for questioned an elderly gruff voiced officer when Sylvia and Estralla thoroughly drenched and wondering what new misfortune was in store for them followed him into a bare little cell like room where the lamplight made them blink and shield their eyes for a moment Sylvia told of their adventures as quickly as possible and the officer listened in amazement Upon my word he said as she finished It s a wonder you are alive to tell the story And so you are a little Yankee girl Well Come along to my quarters and my wife will put you both to bed or you ll be too ill to go home to morrow Can t we go to Fort Moultrie right away pleaded Sylvia My father must be worried about me No one from this fort can go to Fort Moultrie he responded gravely Those flash lights are from a guard boat which the South Carolina people have sent down the harbor so that Major Anderson won t send us reinforcements without their knowledge I wish Anderson would send some message to the President he added as if thinking aloud Sylvia wondered to herself if the letter she had carried to mister Doane might not be a message to the President She wished she could tell this big officer about it But she remembered her promise to missus Carleton not to speak of it to anyone Here s a half drowned little Yankee girl and her little darky said the officer as he led the two girls into a warm pleasant room where a pretty elderly lady with white hair sat with her needlework For pity sake Gerald she exclaimed They are shivering with cold and without asking a single question she began to take off Sylvia s wet dress Gerald send Sally right in with hot milk she directed and the officer vanished It was not long before Sylvia was sitting up in bed wrapped in a gay colored blanket and drinking milk so hot and sweet and spicy that it seemed as if she could never have enough of it Estralla was curled up in a big scarlet wrapper on a rug near the fire with a big mug of the spiced and sweetened milk And when they had finished this a plate of hot buttered biscuit and thin slices of ham was brought in Then there was more warm milk Now you must both go straight to sleep commanded missus Gerald and to morrow morning my husband will take you safely home and kissing Sylvia and with a kindly smile for Estralla the friendly woman bade them good night There was no light now in the room save the dancing firelight Sylvia lay watching the shadows on the wall Estralla was fast asleep but her little mistress lay awake thinking over the adventures of the day She was at Fort Sumter the long dark fort which she had so often seen with the Stars and Stripes waving above it from her home from Miss Patten s schoolroom and in her sails about the harbor Sylvia snuggled down in her comfortable bed with a sense of safety and comfort I wish my father and mother could know I am at Fort Sumter was her last waking thought

none	none	 A CHRISTMAS PRESENT Every nook and corner of Fort Moultrie was searched for the missing Sylvia and when no trace of her could be discovered her friends became nearly certain that the little girl must have slipped from the landing place into the sea and that it was useless to search for her But it was late in the evening before mister Fulton gave up the search and with a sad and anxious heart headed the Butterfly toward Charleston 
6099_67860_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He still hoped that his little girl might be found 
6099_67860_000004_000002	train-clean-360	A party of soldiers headed by Captain Carleton had started to search for her on Sullivan s Island but this had not been determined upon until late in the evening at about the time when Estralla and Sylvia were embarking upon their adventurous voyage to Fort Sumter 
6099_67860_000005_000000	train-clean-360	No one had given a thought to the little darky girl 
6099_67860_000005_000001	train-clean-360	She was supposed to be somewhere about the fort 
6099_67860_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Grace warmly wrapped in a thick shawl sat beside mister Fulton as the Butterfly made its swift way across the dark harbor 
6099_67860_000006_000001	train-clean-360	They could see the dark line of the guard boat but they were not molested and came into the wharf safely 
none	none	Grace held close to mister Fulton s hand as they hurried toward home with the sad news of Sylvia s disappearance 
6099_67860_000006_000003	train-clean-360	Neither of them spoke until they reached the walk leading to the door of Grace s home then Grace said 
none	none	I know Sylvia will be found Estralla will surely find her and bring her home Estralla 
6099_67860_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Why I had entirely forgotten her responded mister Fulton 
6099_67860_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 She ran off as soon as Sylvia was missed Grace continued earnestly and she will find her 
none	none	Probably she has found her before this I believe you are right 
6099_67860_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Estralla is a clever little darky and if she started in search of Sylvia perhaps she has been able to find her 
6099_67860_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I had not thought of it and mister Fulton s voice had a new note of hope 
6099_67860_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you Grace 
6099_67860_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I will start back to the fort as soon as I have talked with Sylvia s mother 
6099_67860_000012_000000	train-clean-360	But on mister Fulton s return to the wharf he found a sentry on guard who refused him permission to go to the fort 
6099_67860_000012_000001	train-clean-360	It was in vain that mister Fulton explained that his little daughter was lost that he must be permitted to return to the fort 
6099_67860_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The sentry wasted no words 
6099_67860_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Orders sir 
6099_67860_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Sorry was the only response he could get and at midnight mister Fulton was in his own house looking out over the harbor 
none	none	Mingled with his anxious fear for the safety of his little daughter was the thought of the sentries now guarding Charleston s water front of the assembling of soldiers in the city and the evident plan of the southerners to seize the forts in the harbor and force the Government into war 
6099_67860_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He realized that in that case it would not be possible for his family to remain in Charleston 
none	none	Early the next morning Sylvia was awakened and made ready for her return and when the sun shone brightly over the waters of the harbor she and Estralla with Captain Gerald and a strong negro servant were on board a boat sailing rapidly toward home 
6099_67860_000016_000000	train-clean-360	They landed at the wharf where the Butterfly was fastened and before Captain Gerald had stepped on shore Sylvia called out Father 
none	none	Father There he is 
6099_67860_000016_000002	train-clean-360	And Mother too and in another moment her mother s arms were about her and she was telling as rapidly as possible the story of her adventures and of Estralla coming to her rescue 
6099_67860_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Grace came running to meet Sylvia as they came near their home 
6099_67860_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Sylvia I wish I had been with you she exclaimed 
6099_67860_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 That is twice you have been to Fort Sumter without meaning to go isn t it 
6099_67860_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We will hope that her next visit will not be as dangerous as this one said mister Fulton soberly 
6099_67860_000020_000000	train-clean-360	For several days Sylvia could think and talk only of her wanderings among the sand hills and of her first sight of the guard boat 
6099_67860_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She began teaching Estralla on the very day of her return and the little darky made rapid progress 
6099_67860_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Father when may we go to Fort Moultrie again she asked one morning a few days later for she wanted very much to see missus Carleton and was quite sure that her father would be ready to sail down the harbor on any pleasant day and his reply made her look up in surprise 
6099_67860_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know that we shall ever go to the forts again her father had replied 
none	none	Did you not hear the bells ringing and the military music yesterday South Carolina has seceded from the Union 
6099_67860_000022_000003	train-clean-360	No one is allowed to go to the forts 
6099_67860_000022_000004	train-clean-360	And unless Major Anderson takes possession of Fort Sumter the Confederates will 
6099_67860_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 And we are to start for Boston next week dear child Sylvia s mother added 
none	none	It seemed to Sylvia that her mother was very glad at the thought of returning to her former home 
6099_67860_000024_000001	train-clean-360	But Sylvia was not glad 
6099_67860_000024_000002	train-clean-360	What would become of Estralla 
none	none	mister Waite had said that as long as Sylvia lived in his house the little colored girl could be her maid 
6099_67860_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But if they went to Boston and left Estralla behind Sylvia was sure that there would be nothing but trouble for the faithful little darky 
none	none	Why Sylvia What is the matter questioned her mother anxiously for Sylvia was leaning her head on the table
6099_67860_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t go to Boston and leave Estralla she sobbed 
6099_67860_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 She has done lots of brave things for me 
6099_67860_000027_000002	train-clean-360	She wouldn t leave me to be a slave 
6099_67860_000028_000000	train-clean-360	mister and missus Fulton looked at each other with puzzled eyes 
6099_67860_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 But Estralla would not want to leave her mammy suggested mister Fulton 
6099_67860_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Father 
none	none	Can t Aunt Connie and Estralla go with us and Sylvia lifted her head and looked hopefully at her father
6099_67860_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 Couldn t I buy Estralla and then make her free 
6099_67860_000030_000003	train-clean-360	I ve got that gold money Grandma gave me 
none	none	I am afraid it wouldn t be much use for me to even try to buy a slave s freedom now mister Fulton said a little sadly
6099_67860_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t suggest such a thing to Aunt Connie Sylvia 
6099_67860_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 When shall we go to Boston Sylvia asked 
6099_67860_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Right away after Christmas unless Fort Sumter is attacked before that time 
6099_67860_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Washington ought to send troops and provisions for the forts at once replied mister Fulton 
6099_67860_000034_000000	train-clean-360	After her father had left the house Sylvia and her mother went up to missus Fulton s pleasant sitting room 
6099_67860_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 We must begin to pack at once declared Sylvia s mother and do not go outside the gate alone Sylvia 
6099_67860_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I wish we could leave Charleston immediately 
6099_67860_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Won t I see missus Carleton again Sylvia asked anxiously 
6099_67860_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not know dear child but run away and give Estralla her lesson as usual 
6099_67860_000037_000001	train-clean-360	It will not be a very gay Christmas for any of us this year responded missus Fulton and Sylvia went slowly to her own room where Estralla was waiting for her 
6099_67860_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The little colored girl had put the room in order there was a bright fire in the grate the morning sunshine filled the room and Miss Molly and Polly smiling as usual were in the tiny chairs behind the little round table 
none	none	Dar s gwine to be war Missy Estralla declared solemnly Yas m Dar s soldiers comin in from ebery place 
6099_67860_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Won t de Yankees come and set us free Missy 
none	none	Sylvia shook her head
6099_67860_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t know Estralla 
6099_67860_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Let s not talk about it she replied 
none	none	Wal Missy lots of darkies are runnin off My mammy say we ll stay right here til Massa Fulton goes an den Estralla stopped leaned a little nearer to Sylvia and whispered an den my mammy an I we se gwine to go with Massa Fulton missus Fulton was not in her room so Sylvia went down the stairs to look for her She heard voices in the sitting room and turned in that direction
6099_67860_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she whispered as she stood in the open door 
none	none	For her mother was sitting on the big sofa near the open fire and beside her sat mister Robert Waite while her father was standing in front of them 
6099_67860_000043_000002	train-clean-360	They were all talking so earnestly that they did not notice the surprised little girl standing in the doorway and Sylvia heard mister Waite say 
none	none	I shall be glad to protect your interests here mister Fulton as far as it is possible to do so 
6099_67860_000044_000001	train-clean-360	And you had better leave Charleston immediately 
6099_67860_000044_000002	train-clean-360	The city is no longer a safe place for northern people The conflict may begin at any moment 
6099_67860_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Conflict Sylvia repeated the word to herself 
6099_67860_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Probably it meant something dreadful she thought recalling the question period at Miss Rosalie s school 
6099_67860_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Just then mister Waite glanced toward the door and saw Sylvia 
none	none	In a second he was on his feet bowing as politely as on their last meeting
6099_67860_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Sylvia I am glad to see you again and he stepped forward to meet her 
6099_67860_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia feeling quite grown up made her pretty curtsey and smiled with delight at mister Waite s greeting as he led her toward her mother and with another polite bow gave her the seat on the sofa 
6099_67860_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I was hoping to see Miss Sylvia he said 
6099_67860_000049_000001	train-clean-360	 I had meant to make her a little Christmas gift with your permission and he bowed again to missus Fulton 
6099_67860_000049_000002	train-clean-360	 She was kind enough to interest herself in behalf of one of my people the little darky Estralla 
6099_67860_000049_000003	train-clean-360	And so I thought this would please you and he smiled at Sylvia who began to be sure that mister Waite and Santa Claus must be exactly alike 
6099_67860_000049_000004	train-clean-360	As he spoke he handed Sylvia a long envelope 
6099_67860_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not open it until to morrow if you please he added 
6099_67860_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia promised and thanked him 
6099_67860_000051_000001	train-clean-360	She wondered if the envelope might not contain a picture of this kind friend 
6099_67860_000051_000002	train-clean-360	She knew that she must not ask a question questions were never polite she remembered especially about a gift 
6099_67860_000051_000003	train-clean-360	But whatever it was she was very happy to think mister Robert Waite had remembered her 
6099_67860_000052_000000	train-clean-360	They all went to the door with their friendly visitor and stood there until he had reached the gate 
none	none	Then Sylvia said speaking very slowly
6099_67860_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I think mister Robert Waite is just like the Knights in that book The Age of Chivalry They always did exactly what was right and so does he and they were polite and so is he 
6099_67860_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Then my dear perhaps you will always remember that to do brave and gentle deeds with kindness is what chivalry means responded missus Fulton 
none	none	Grace came in that afternoon greatly excited that it was a holiday The whole city was rejoicing over the fact that South Carolina had been the first of the southern states to secede from the Union 
6099_67860_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Palmetto flags floated everywhere the streets were filled with marching men 
6099_67860_000055_000003	train-clean-360	Major Anderson in Fort Moultrie watched Fort Sumter with anxious eyes hoping for a word from Washington which would give him authority to occupy it before the Charleston men could turn its guns against him 
none	none	Already mister Doane had reached Washington the message Sylvia had carried through the night had been delivered and its answer by a trusted messenger was on its way south CHAPTER XVIII GREAT NEWS Sylvia carried the long envelope which mister Robert Waite had given her to her room and put it in the drawer of her desk with the treasured gold pieces It will be splendid to have a picture of mister Waite to show Grandma Fulton she thought happily and I can tell her all about him Then her thoughts rested on Flora in the haunted house and she opened the silk covered work box and tried on the pretty gold thimble She thought of her gold pieces and a sudden resolve came into her mind I will give Flora and Grace each a gold locket with my picture in it And just then missus Fulton entered the room and Sylvia ran toward her Mother Mother I have a beautiful plan I want to give Flora and Grace each a present I want to give them each a gold locket with my picture in it On Grace s locket I want Grace from Sylvia and on Flora s Flora from Sylvia I can pay for them with my gold money I may mayn t I Mother and Sylvia looked eagerly toward her mother Of course you may but it is too late to get the pictures and lockets in time for Christmas responded missus Fulton I don t care when only if we do go back to Boston I want them to have something to remember me by said Sylvia remembering the unfailing loyalty of her two little southern friends The day after Christmas we will select the lockets and see about the pictures said missus Fulton Before Sylvia could answer there came a tap at the door and Aunt Connie evidently rather anxious and uncertain whispered Dar s a lady Mistress a lady f um de fort an she say It must be missus Carleton I ll go right down responded missus Fulton and followed by Sylvia she hurried down the stairs to find missus Carleton awaiting them Captain Carleton insisted that I should come to you she said He feels sure that the Charleston men mean to take Fort Sumter at once Major Anderson is sending the women and children away from Fort Moultrie to places of safety Of course you must stay with us and we are delighted to have you said missus Fulton We want to stay in Charleston unless it becomes necessary for us to leave missus Carleton greeted Sylvia warmly and greatly to her surprise said I have not had the opportunity to thank you dear child for delivering the message safely We have heard that mister Doane has presented the letter to the President and Major Anderson is sure that reinforcements and provisions for the forts will be sent at once Then turning to missus Fulton she continued I know this loyal child kept her secret and that even you and her father do not realize what a service your little daughter has rendered to the cause of Freedom missus Fulton was looking at her visitor in amazement Sylvia Message Secret she exclaimed in such a puzzled tone that both missus Carleton and Sylvia laughed aloud Tell her Sylvia And I want to hear how you delivered the letter said missus Carleton So Sylvia told the story of creeping out of the house at nearly midnight of the man who had declared her to be a runaway darky of Estralla following her and of their return And the door was closed and fastened although I left it open she concluded missus Fulton recalled that one night they had been slightly disturbed by some unusual noise and that mister Fulton had gone down stairs and discovered the front door open And we blamed Aunt Connie she added I did want to tell you Mother said Sylvia but it s even better to have missus Carleton tell you That evening the story was retold to mister Fulton who listened with even more surprise than Sylvia s mother had shown He said that Estralla had been as brave as Sylvia and that he wished he could do an equal service for the United States This will be a fine story to tell Grandma Fulton he whispered to Sylvia when he gave her his good night kiss She awoke early before Estralla appeared with the usual pitcher of hot water and to light the fire in the grate and in a moment was out of bed and at her desk She opened the envelope very carefully expecting to see the pictured face of her kind friend smiling at her But there was no picture There were only two documents tied with red tape and with big red seals on them and a number of printed and signed papers Oh clear It isn t anything at all except letters exclaimed Sylvia nearly ready to cry with disappointment And suddenly she did cry a cry so like Estralla s wail that the little darky just entering the room stopped short and nearly dropped the pitcher of hot water Wat s de matter Missy Wat is de matter Estralla demanded Tears were in Sylvia s eyes as she turned toward the little darky They were not tears for her own disappointment at not finding the expected picture but they were tears for what Sylvia believed to be the most bitter misfortune that could befall Estralla and Aunt Connie For she was sure that the papers in that envelope were to tell her that Aunt Connie and Estralla had both been sold But she resolved quickly that Estralla should not know of this until she had told her mother Nothing I can tell you now Estralla she said wiping away her tears Estralla looked quite ready to weep with her young mistress but she lit the fire and crept silently out of the room Sylvia dressed as quickly as possible picked up the papers and ran to her mother s room Look Mother It s dreadful It wasn t a picture of mister Robert Waite at all It s just a lot of papers about Estralla and Aunt Connie being sold and Sylvia began to cry bitterly mister Fulton took the papers and looked them over while Sylvia with her mother s arm about her sobbed out her disappointment Sold Estralla Why my dear Sylvia these papers give Aunt Connie and Estralla their freedom from yesterday And these and mister Fulton held up the smaller documents give them permission to leave Charleston for the north at any time within six months For a moment neither Sylvia nor her mother made any response to this wonderful statement Truly Father Truly exclaimed Sylvia with shining eyes Yes These papers have been recorded Estralla and her mother are no longer slaves They are free said mister Fulton as he folded the papers mister Waite has made you the finest gift in the world little daughter he added seriously And Estralla and Aunt Connie may go to Boston with us pleaded Sylvia quite sure that her father and mother would agree Won t Grandma be surprised to see them missus Carleton was as pleased and surprised as Sylvia herself over mister Waite s gift and it was decided that directly after breakfast Sylvia should tell Aunt Connie and Estralla the wonderful news It was too great to be kept a secret even until Christmas Day Dar Mammy Wat I tells yo I tells yo Missy Sylvia gwine to look out fer us Estralla declared triumphantly evidently not at all surprised But it is mister Robert Waite who has given you your freedom Sylvia reminded them and my father says that you must both go with me and thank him Yas Missy responded Aunt Connie but I reckons we wouldn t be thankin him if twan t fer yo Massa Robert HE knows dat all his niggers gwine to be free jes as soon as de Yankees come Yas indeedy he knows But we shuahly go long wid yo Missy an thanks him We knows our manners Many eyes turned to watch the smiling colored woman and the delighted little negro girl who walked down King Street that afternoon one on each side of a little white girl who looked as well pleased as her companions for Sylvia decided that no time should be lost in telling mister Robert Waite of how greatly his generosity was appreciated He welcomed Sylvia with his usual cordiality and told Aunt Connie that he wished her good fortune and sent her and Estralla home I will walk back with your young mistress he said and Sylvia felt that it was the proudest day of her life when she walked up King Street beside the friendly southerner He talks just as if I were grown up thought Sylvia gratefully when mister Waite spoke of the forts and of the possibilities of war between the northern and southern states Tell your father not to hasten his preparations to leave Charleston you are among friends and these difficulties may be adjusted mister Waite said as he bade Sylvia good bye and wished her a happy Christmas CHAPTER XIX SYLVIA MAKES A PROMISE It doesn t seem a bit like Christmas declared Sylvia as she stood at the sitting room window looking out at the falling rain Christmas day of eighteen sixty was a gloomy rainy day in Charleston and many people felt exactly as Sylvia did that it was not like Christmas Grace came over in the morning bringing a little chased gold ring for Sylvia which the little girl promised always to wear She wished that she could tell Grace about the lockets but decided it would be better to surprise Grace with the locket itself As soon as Grace returned home Sylvia ran to find her mother We will go down street and buy the lockets to morrow morning won t we Mother she asked and missus Fulton promised that they would start early Sylvia resolved that if the lockets and pictures did not take all her money she would buy a doll for Estralla She knew that nothing else would please the little colored girl as much as a truly doll But the morning of December twenty sixth found the city of Charleston angry and excited Crowds collected in the streets and mister Fulton received a message from mister Robert Waite asking him to remain at home until mister Waite arrived What is the matter Father Sylvia asked He isn t coming to take back Estralla is he No of course not child It is trouble over the forts responded her father And in a short time mister Waite arrived But he was not smiling this morning He was very grave and serious Major Anderson has evacuated Moultrie and he and his men are at Fort Sumter said mister Waite I came to assure you that whatever action Charleston takes that I will protect your household and property as far as possible Then Sylvia heard him say that Governor Pickens had seized Castle Pinckney and that troops had been sent to Sullivan s Island to occupy Fort Moultrie and the United States Arsenal situated in the midst of the city of Charleston was also in possession of the secessionists Sylvia listened to every word but without much idea of what it all meant Can t we buy the lockets to day Mother she asked No we must not go on the streets to day missus Fulton answered but mister Waite smiled at the little girl and said I will gladly accompany Miss Sylvia if she has errands to do so Sylvia told him about the pictures and lockets for Grace and Flora and mister Waite assured her mother and father that he could easily spare the time to go with her upon so pleasant an errand The friendly man realized that the little household were troubled and anxious and that it would reassure them if their little girl could safely carry out her plan So the two set forth together mister Robert Waite was too well known for any southerner to doubt his loyalty to South Carolina and his visit to mister Fulton s house was in itself a protection to the family As they walked along Sylvia told him how kind Grace and Flora had been to her If we should go away the lockets will remind them how much I think of them she said and mister Waite smiled and said Yes indeed but it seemed to Sylvia that he was not really thinking about the lockets She held close to his hand for there were crowds on every corner and loud and violent threats against Major Anderson were heard from nearly every group Sylvia heard one man declare that it was the duty of Charleston men to fire upon Fort Sumter at once and before they reached the shop where she was to purchase the lockets Sylvia began to fear that she would never see Captain Carleton again The lockets were purchased and mister Waite took Sylvia to a studio to sit for the pictures for the lockets There was enough money left to purchase a fine doll for Estralla and mister Waite gave her a box filled with candy of many kinds shapes and flavors All these things occupied her thoughts so pleasantly that for a time she quite forgot the disturbance in the streets and all the trouble that seemed so near to her and to her Charleston friends I will call to morrow said mister Waite as he left the little girl at her own door And tell your father that he had best not go on the streets unless he goes with my brother or myself This last message made Sylvia very sober She came into the sitting room holding her packages and found her mother and missus Carleton busy with their sewing while her father was at his desk writing She repeated mister Waite s message and her father nodded silently Then Sylvia told them that the lockets and pictures would be ready the following day And I have a doll for Estralla she concluded Why not make the doll a fine dress and mantle suggested missus Carleton Come up to my room and I will help you and Sylvia agreed smilingly missus Carleton had a roll of crimson silk in her work bag and before supper time the new doll was dressed and ready for Estralla This is for you Estralla Sylvia said when Estralla came up to her room as she often did in the late afternoon Fer me Missy He he I knows w en you s jokin but tis a fine lady doll responded the little girl wishing with all her heart that the beautiful doll in the gorgeous silken dress which Sylvia was holding toward her might really be hers Take it Estralla It is for you Truly it is and Sylvia s tone was so serious that Estralla came slowly forward and took the doll For a moment the two little girls stood looking at each other in silence Sylvia smiling but Estralla with a surprised half anxious expression Don t be afraid of it Can t you have a doll of your own said Sylvia Mebbe I can replied Estralla and then two big tears ran down her black cheeks I se got so much now Missy Sylvia dat I dunno as tis safe fer me to hev a doll she whispered but in a moment she was all smiles and ran off to show her new treasure to her mother The pictures and the lockets proved all that Sylvia had hoped and on New Year s day when Grace came in for her daily visit Sylvia gave her a small package Please open it Gracie she said all eagerness to see her friend s delight mister Fulton had purchased a slender chain for each locket and as Grace held up the pretty gift she exclaimed delightedly Oh Sylvia It is lovely and I ll always wear it and looked at the tiny picture of her friend with smiling satisfaction Sylvia had written a letter to Flora and Grace promised to see that the locket and letter should reach her safely Every day mister Robert Waite or his brother escorted mister Fulton upon any errand of business to which he was obliged to attend News had reached Charleston that a steamer with supplies and reinforcements for Major Anderson was on its way and mister Robert Waite declared that the Confederates would never permit it to reach the fort missus Carleton was very anxious She had not received any message from her husband If I could sail a boat I would go to Fort Sumter myself she said one morning as she and Sylvia stood at a window overlooking the harbor I can sail a boat responded Sylvia missus Carleton turned and looked at the little girl If all this trouble ends in war if the Confederates really dare fire upon the flag of the United States I do not know how I can get any word from my husband she said Sylvia thought that her friend s voice sounded as if she were about to cry and the little girl slipped her hand into missus Carleton s She wished there was something she could say to comfort her Then she thought quickly that there was something I ll sail you over to the fort to see him whenever you ask me to she said impulsively Dear child I may have to ask you but I hope not Twould be a dangerous undertaking she said leaning over to kiss Sylvia s cheek That was the sixth of January eighteen sixty one and on the ninth a steamer The Star of the West with supplies and reinforcements for Major Anderson entered Charleston harbor and was fired upon by a Confederate battery concealed in the sand hills at Sullivan Island And now for many days the Fultons heard only discouraging news Everywhere there was great activity among the Confederates missus Carleton became more and more anxious for news of Captain Carleton but she did not remind Sylvia of her promise Grace and Sylvia were together a great deal and every morning Sylvia would run out to the front porch to wave a good bye to Grace on her way to school Then there was Estralla s lesson hour her own studies and missus Carleton was teaching her to crochet a silk purse as a gift to mister Robert Waite so that Sylvia did not think very much about the soldiers at Fort Sumter What do you think about starting for Boston with us missus Carleton mister Fulton said one night just as Sylvia was going up stairs I really think the time has come for me to take Sylvia and her mother to Boston and I am sure Captain Carleton would want you to go with us And Estralla and Aunt Connie will go too won t they Father said Sylvia running back to her father s side Yes child But I thought you were upstairs responded mister Fulton Do not speak of our leaving Charleston to anyone Remember Not to Grace or Estralla until your mother or I give you permission Sylvia promised It seemed to her the best of good news that they would soon see Grandmother Fulton and she went happily off to bed thinking of all she would have to tell her grandmother and of the long letters she would write to Flora and Grace And when summer comes they must both come and make me a visit she thought little knowing that when summer came no little southern girl would be allowed to visit a Boston girl

none	none	 TWO LITTLE DARKY GIRLS
6544_67863_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 When will mister Lincoln be President Sylvia asked a few mornings after her father s announcement of his intention to return to Boston 
6544_67863_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 He was inaugurated yesterday replied her mother 
6544_67863_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Then can t Captain Carleton go north with us asked Sylvia who had convinced herself that when mister Lincoln was in charge of the Government that all the troubles over Charleston s forts would end 
6544_67863_000006_000000	train-clean-360	But missus Fulton shook her head 
6544_67863_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Captain Carleton must stay and perhaps fight to defend the flag she replied 
6544_67863_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 I wish we could leave at once but we must stay as long as we can 
6544_67863_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia listened soberly 
6544_67863_000008_000001	train-clean-360	She wondered what her mother would say if she knew of her promise to missus Carleton to take a message to Fort Sumter if missus Carleton should ask her to do so 
6544_67863_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The warm days of early March made the southern city full of fragrance and beauty 
6544_67863_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Many flowers were in bloom the hedges were green and the air soft and warm 
6544_67863_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Sylvia and Grace often spoke of Flora and wished that they could again visit the plantation 
6544_67863_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Philip had brought Sylvia a letter from Flora thanking her for the locket and hoping that they would see each other again 
6544_67863_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Philip had not come into the house 
none	none	He seemed much older to Sylvia than he did on her visit to the plantation in October 
6544_67863_000010_000003	train-clean-360	He said that Ralph was in the Confederate army 
6544_67863_000010_000004	train-clean-360	 I d be a soldier if I was only a little older he declared and Sylvia did not even ask him about Dinkie or the ponies She wished that she could tell him that very soon she was going to Boston but she knew that she must not so she said good bye and Philip walked down the path and waved his cap to her as he reached the gate 
6544_67863_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It had been many weeks since the Butterfly had sailed about Charleston harbor 
6544_67863_000011_000001	train-clean-360	But the little boat was in the charge of an old negro who took good care of it 
none	none	The negro knew Sylvia and he knew that it was through her interest in Estralla that the little negro girl and her mother had been given their freedom 
6544_67863_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Now and then he appeared at Aunt Connie s kitchen and one warm day toward the last of March when Sylvia was wandering about the garden she saw Uncle Peter going up the walk to the rear of the house 
none	none	Oh Uncle Peter 
6544_67863_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Wait she called and ran to ask him about the boat 
none	none	Uncle Peter had a great deal of news to tell 
6544_67863_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He said that unless Major Anderson and his soldiers left Fort Sumter at once that all the forts and the new batteries built by the Confederates would open fire upon Sumter and destroy it 
6544_67863_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I hears a good deal Missy deed I does he declared but I doan let on as I hears 
none	none	Massa Linkum he s gwine to send a lot o big ships down here fore long Yas indeed
6544_67863_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish I could have a sail in the Butterfly again said Sylvia a little wistfully 
6544_67863_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you Missy 
6544_67863_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Well I reckons you can 
none	none	I doan believe any body d stop me a givin yo a little sail roun de harbor said Uncle Peter I spec s Major Anderson is a waitin an a watchin fer dem ships of Massa Linkum to come a sailin in continued the old negro for it was a time when the colored people were eager and hopeful for some news that might promise them their freedom 
6544_67863_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia knew that missus Carleton was worried and unhappy 
6544_67863_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It was known in Charleston that Fort Sumter was near the end of its food supplies and that unless the Government at Washington sent reinforcements and provisions very soon by ships that the little garrison would be at the mercy of the Confederates who were daily growing in strength 
none	none	As Sylvia left Uncle Peter and walked back to the house she was thinking of her promise to missus Carleton
6544_67863_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps she won t ask me 
6544_67863_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But if I could go and see Captain Carleton and tell him that she was going to Boston with us and then bring her back a message I know she d be happier thought the little girl 
6544_67863_000019_000002	train-clean-360	And she thought too of the pleasure it would be to once more sail the Butterfly to Fort Sumter 
6544_67863_000020_000000	train-clean-360	She sat down on the porch steps and a moment later Estralla appeared bringing a plate of freshly baked sugar cookies from Aunt Connie 
none	none	Mammy says she made these special for you Missy declared Estralla smilingly
6544_67863_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll go and thank her myself said Sylvia taking the plate and offering one of the cookies to Estralla 
none	none	Uncle Pete he say as de soldiers at Fort Sumter mus be gettin hungry said the little colored girl I wish you and I could take Captain Carleton some of these cookies responded Sylvia If you was black like I is we could go a sailin right off to de fort in plain daylight said Estralla 
6544_67863_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia sprang to her feet so quickly that she nearly upset the plate of cookies 
6544_67863_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Could we 
none	none	Oh Estralla could we really she exclaimed Estralla looked at her little mistress with wondering eyes Yas course nobody d mind two leetle nigger gals But you ain t black Missy
6544_67863_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 But Estralla listen 
6544_67863_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I could be black 
6544_67863_000029_000002	train-clean-360	You could rub soot from the chimney all over my face and hands 
6544_67863_000029_000003	train-clean-360	And I could pin my hair close on top of my head and twist one of your mammy s handkerchiefs tight over it 
6544_67863_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Then nobody would know me Sylvia had quite forgotten the fine cookies 
6544_67863_000029_000005	train-clean-360	She was holding Estralla by the arm and talking very rapidly Estralla was almost frightened at Sylvia s eagerness 
none	none	Yas Missy but what for do you wanter go she asked Oh Estralla 
6544_67863_000031_000001	train-clean-360	If the men are hungry we could carry them something to eat 
6544_67863_000031_000002	train-clean-360	But most of all I want to see Captain Carleton and get some message for his wife 
6544_67863_000031_000003	train-clean-360	She is so unhappy to go away without a word 
6544_67863_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Come long down in de garden said Estralla now as interested as Sylvia herself an tells me more whar nobody ll be hearin and the two little girls hurried off to a far corner of the pleasant garden 
none	none	Uncl Peter won let us take the boat Estralla objected as Sylvia told her how easy the plan would be an how be you gwine to get all blacked up without folks knowin it But Sylvia had an answer for every objection
6544_67863_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll come to your cabin and dress up there and I will ask your mammy to give me some food for a poor man 
6544_67863_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Some cookies and a cake she said 
6544_67863_000035_000002	train-clean-360	 We will start early to morrow morning 
6544_67863_000035_000003	train-clean-360	And Estralla we will have to tell Uncle Peter or he won t let us have the boat 
none	none	Lan Missy I ll do jes w at yo says 
6544_67863_000036_000001	train-clean-360	But I reckon Uncle Pete won let us 
none	none	Wat yo mammy gwine to think w en you ain t home to your dinner responded Estralla 
6544_67863_000036_000003	train-clean-360	But she was finally convinced that Missy Sylvia could carry out the plan and agreed to have a large quantity of soot ready at her mother s cabin the next morning 
6544_67863_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia was glad that she had eaten only one of the cookies 
6544_67863_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She carried the remainder to her room and then went to the kitchen 
none	none	Will you make me a fine big cake Aunt Connie she asked Lan course I will chile But w at you wan it fer answered Aunt Connie smiling down at the little girl whom she loved so dearly
6544_67863_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a secret Aunt Connie 
6544_67863_000040_000001	train-clean-360	I want to give it away and I don t want to tell even my mother until well and Sylvia hesitated a moment and then continued until next week 
6544_67863_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Then I will tell her and you too 
6544_67863_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Dat s right Missy 
none	none	I ll make yo de finest cake I knows how Le s see I ll put citron an raisins an currants in it An butter Yas thar ll be a fine lot o things in dat cake and Aunt Connie rolled her eyes and lifted her hands as if she could already taste its richness All that afternoon Sylvia could think of nothing but the proposed trip She sat with missus Carleton a little while before supper and told her of what Uncle Peter had said that ships from the north were on the way to the aid of Fort Sumter Oh I do wish I could send the news to Sumter 
6544_67863_000043_000002	train-clean-360	It would give them all courage said missus Carleton 
6544_67863_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia was for a moment tempted to tell her friend that she would carry the message but she kept silent thinking to herself that here was another reason for her to carry out her plan 
6544_67863_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 If you could send a message to Captain Carleton what would you say questioned Sylvia and missus Carleton smiled at Sylvia s serious voice 
6544_67863_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Why if I could only let him know that I was safe and well and going to Boston with you in case Sumter really is attacked I know that is what he wants to hear 
none	none	missus Carleton s smile vanished 
6544_67863_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Sylvia realized that this kind friend was troubled and wished with all her heart that she could say To morrow I will tell you all about Captain Carleton But she knew that she must keep silent until she had carried out her plan 
6544_67863_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Sylvia was the first one at the breakfast table the next morning and was delighted when her mother said that she and missus Carleton were invited to luncheon at the house of a friend 
none	none	Aunt Connie and Estralla will take good care of you missus Fulton added and Sylvia felt her face flush 
6544_67863_000049_000001	train-clean-360	But she made no reply and soon hurried to the cabin where Estralla was waiting for her 
6544_67863_000050_000000	train-clean-360	It was still early in the forenoon when two little negro girls one carrying a large package wrapped in a newspaper appeared at the wharf where the Butterfly was moored 
6544_67863_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Uncle Peter was not to be seen 
none	none	But he had just left the boat whose sail had not even been lowered and the two girls hurried on board 
6544_67863_000050_000003	train-clean-360	In a moment Sylvia had unfastened the rope pushed the boat clear of the landing and rudder in hand was steering the boat out toward the channel 
6544_67863_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Two or three men in uniform watched the little darkies as they supposed both the girls to be with amusement 
6544_67863_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Negro children were always playing about and no attention was paid to them 
none	none	My landy whispered Estralla dat was jes as easy W at Uncle Pete do w en he fin s de boat gone 
6544_67863_000053_000000	train-clean-360	But it happened that Uncle Peter had been sent on an errand to a distant part of the town and before he returned the Butterfly was well down the harbor 
6544_67863_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Once or twice a guard boat passed them closely enough to make sure that there were only two colored children in the boat and they came up under the walls of Fort Sumter without a hindrance 
6544_67863_000054_000001	train-clean-360	The sentries at the fort had watched the little craft with anxious eyes wondering if it could be bringing any message 
none	none	But when the soldiers looked down at the two little negro girls they laughed in spite of their disappointment When Sylvia said that her name was Sylvia Fulton and that she had come to see Captain Carleton a sentry exclaimed That girl has blacked her face 
6544_67863_000054_000003	train-clean-360	She is white 
none	none	But Captain Carleton could hardly believe that it was his little friend Sylvia 
6544_67863_000055_000001	train-clean-360	And he was eager to hear all that she could tell him 
6544_67863_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Estralla held the cake and cookies which she had carefully wrapped in a newspaper and the Captain seemed as much pleased with the paper as with the cake 
6544_67863_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 You can write a letter to missus Carleton and we will take it suggested Sylvia and then she told him Uncle Peter s news that the President was sending ships to the aid of the fort 
6544_67863_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 That is great news said the Captain if it is only true we may keep the fort for the Union 
6544_67863_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Within the hour of their arrival Sylvia and Estralla were on their way home 
6544_67863_000058_000001	train-clean-360	The Captain had praised and thanked Sylvia for the loyal friendship that had prompted her visit

6544_67863_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 I am so glad I thought about it but it was really Estralla 
6544_67863_000060_000001	train-clean-360	She said if I was black we could come Sylvia had replied 
6544_67863_000061_000000	train-clean-360	Then the boat swung clear and headed toward Charleston 
6544_67863_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not going to land at the big wharves said Sylvia

6544_67863_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Missy wants a big pitcher of hot water replied Estralla dancing about just beyond Aunt Connie s reach 
none	none	Missy Sylvia say to tell you we been carryin de cake to her fr en an she gwine to tell you Mammy explained Estralla when her mammy had finally grasped her firmly by the shoulders W y didn yo say dat firs place H ar s de hot water and Estralla hurried off to help Sylvia scrub off the sticky soot which had so well disguised her and when missus Fulton and missus Carleton returned they found a very rosy faced smiling little girl on the porch all ready to tell them of her trip to Fort Sumter and to give missus Carleton the longed for news from her husband CHAPTER XXI FORT SUMTER IS FIRED UPON When Sylvia s father heard of her sailing the Butterfly to Fort Sumter he was greatly troubled If it should be discovered that my daughter had carried a message to Fort Sumter we would all be in danger even the Waites would give us up he declared What made you undertake such a thing Sylvia The little girl explained as well as she could her wish to get news of Captain Carleton for his wife and said that she was sure no one knew that she was a white girl But mister Fulton was anxious and uneasy and Sylvia began to realize that her secret adventure might bring serious results to those she loved best I told Captain Carleton what Uncle Peter said about ships coming to help Fort Sumter she said feeling almost sure that her father would think this the worst of all but determined to make a full confession She resolved that never again would she make plans without telling her mother and father for she was most unhappy at her father s troubled look and at his disapproval What exclaimed mister Fulton Did you tell Captain Carleton that reinforcements were coming to the aid of Fort Sumter Oh yes I did Father sobbed Sylvia who was now sure that she had told the very worst of her acts But to her surprise she heard her father say Thank heaven That may influence Anderson to hold the fort until help arrives and his arm was about his little daughter and she looked up through her tears to hear him say The news you carried to the fort is just what they wanted to know And it may help to save the Union It is worth while for us all to face personal danger if it proves that you were of service Sylvia did not quite understand why Uncle Peter s news should be so important but her father explained to her that Major Anderson would now feel sure of help and that his men would have courage to bear hardship and hunger if need be until the ships arrived And you forgive me for going Sylvia pleaded My dear child I am glad and proud that you could carry such a message to brave soldiers her father replied but do not mention it to anyone I must hasten my arrangements to leave Charleston General Beauregard may fire upon Fort Sumter at any day and I am of no use here Sylvia drew a long breath of relief That her father should really praise her for what she had feared might prove a very serious mistake made the little girl happy although it did not change her resolve never again to make adventurous plans without the approval of her mother or father She realized that although she had carried a valuable message she had also endangered her father s safety if her visit to the fort was discovered as every southerner would believe that mister Fulton had made the plan to be of aid to the United States The little household now began its preparations to start north as soon as possible and Sylvia was eager for the time to come that would see them safely on their way to their northern home Grace Waite and her mother had gone into the country and Sylvia did not know if she would see her friend again The morning of April eleven eighteen sixty one dawned brightly over the harbor of Charleston whose waters were covered with white sails putting hastily to sea Guard boats were plying constantly between the harbor and the islands It was rumored about the town that before sunset the Confederate batteries would open fire upon Fort Sumter mister Fulton s preparations to leave Charleston were completed and if nothing prevented they would start for Boston on April fourteenth On the eleventh however missus Carleton hardly left the window from which she could look out over the harbor toward Fort Sumter At any moment it might be attacked and she knew that such an attack meant the beginning of a terrible civil war Sylvia wandered about the house and garden with Estralla telling the little colored girl of the home in Boston which she soon hoped to see The hours passed and the streets of Charleston grew strangely quiet At sunset everything was calm and no sound of guns disturbed the peace of the April evening and Sylvia went to bed at the usual hour not thinking that she would be wakened by the roar of cannon The older members of the family sat up until after midnight The sea was calm and the night still under the bright starlight At last they decided to retire but there was little sleep for them that night At half past four the next morning the sound of guns from Fort Johnson broke upon the stillness It was the signal to the Confederate batteries to open fire Hardly had the echo of the opening gun died upon the air when every Confederate fort and battery opened fire upon Sumter until the fort was surrounded by a circle of fire The Fulton household dressed hurriedly and from the windows looked over the harbor at the flashing lights and bursts of flame Sylvia stood close beside missus Carleton and they were all silent Aunt Connie brought up hot coffee and a tray of food but none of them cared to eat mister Fulton waited anxiously for the sound of answering guns from Fort Sumter But not until seven o clock that morning did Fort Sumter open its fire War has begun said mister Fulton gravely turning away from the window Will the President s ships come soon Father asked Sylvia We must hope so he answered and now there is no time for us to lose We must start at once Bres de Lord said Aunt Connie who was standing near the door and as mister Fulton spoke she hurried off to her cabin to make her final preparations for the long journey missus Fulton hastened to pack up the few things they would take with them and Sylvia helped missus Carleton pack Early in the fore noon they were ready mister Robert Waite s carriage was at the door with mister Waite who had come to escort them on the first stage of their journey I wish I could say good bye to Grace said Sylvia as she went down the steps of the porch She was all ready to enter the carriage when she heard her name called Sylvia Sylvia and Grace came flying up the path Grace Grace responded Sylvia and for a moment the two little girls Yankee and southern girl clung closely together while the noise of the echoing guns from the forts boomed over the harbor We will always be friends won t we Sylvia said Grace and Sylvia responded Always Then with one more good bye kiss Grace turned and ran back to Mammy Esther She had persuaded her mother to bring her to Charleston that she might bid Sylvia good bye and now they would hasten back to the country for Charleston might be attacked by United States ships of war and was no longer a place of safety The Fultons now entered the carriage Aunt Connie and Estralla were the only members of the party who were smiling and happy To Estralla it was the most wonderful day of her life She was free And with her mammy and her Missy Sylvia she was starting for a world where little colored girls could go to school just as white children did and never be bought or sold She looked at Sylvia with adoring eyes What are you thinking of Estralla asked Sylvia Estralla leaned close to her true fr en and whispered I was a t inkin bout my breakin of de pitcher an a spillin de hot water Missy Sylvia You took my part den Missy an you se allers taken my part My mammy say she bress de Lord dat you came to Charleston Sylvia smiled back at the little colored girl For a moment she forgot the booming of the distant guns and remembered only her friends and the happy days she had spent in her southern home The next Volume in this Series will be A YANKEE GIRL AT BULL RUN End of Project Gutenberg s Yankee Girl at Fort
