none	none	he has his hosses beat Never borne the weight of man Why Drew I can see the saddle marks clear from here I got a mind to slip down there and pick up the easiest hundred bones that ever rolled my way He rose to make good his threat but Drew cut in with Don t be a damn fool Werther You aren t part of this show Well I will be soon Watch me There goes Ananias on his second wind The announcer was bellowing These man killing mustangs will be ridden broken beaten into submission in fair fight by the greatest set of horse breakers that ever wore spurs They can ride anything that walks on four feet and wears a skin they can Werther sprang to his feet made a funnel of his hand and shouted Yi i i ip If he had set off a great quantity of red fire he could not more effectively have drawn all eyes upon him The weird shrill yell cut the ringmaster short and a pleased murmur ran through the crowd Of course this must be part of the show but it was a pleasing variation Partner continued Werther brushing away the big hand of Drew which would have pulled him down into his seat I ve seen you bluff for two nights hand running There ain t no man can bluff all the world three times straight The ringmaster retorted in his great voice That sounds like good poker What s your game Five hundred dollars on one card cried Werther and he waved a fluttering handful of greenbacks Five hundred dollars to any man of your lot or to any man in this house that can ride a real wild horse Where s your horse Around the corner in a Twenty sixth Street stable I ll have him here in five minutes Lead him on cried the ringmaster but his voice was not quite so loud Werther muttered to Drew Here s where I hand him the lemon that ll curdle his cream and ran out of the box and straight around the edge of the arena New York murmuring and chuckling through the vast galleries of the Garden applauded the little man s flying coat tails He had not underestimated the time in a little less than his five minutes the doors at the end of the arena were thrown wide and Werther reappeared Behind him came two stalwarts leading between them a rangy monster Before the blast of lights and the murmurs of the throng the big stallion reared and flung himself back and the two who lead him bore down with all their weight on the halter ropes He literally walked down the planks into the arena a strange half comical half terrible spectacle New York burst into applause It was a trained horse of course but a horse capable of such training was worth applause At that roar of sound vague as the beat of waves along the shore the stallion lurched down on all fours and leaped ahead but the two on the halter ropes drove all their weight backward and checked the first plunge A bright coloured scarf waved from a nearby box and the monster swerved away So twisting plunging rearing he was worked down the arena As he came opposite a box in which sat a tall young man in evening clothes the latter rose and shouted Bravo The fury of the stallion searching on all sides for a vent but distracted from one torment to another centred suddenly on this slender figure He swerved and rushed for the barrier with ears flat back and bloodshot eyes There he reared and struck at the wood with his great front hoofs the boards splintered and shivered under the blows As for the youth in the box he remained quietly erect before this brute rage A fleck of red foam fell on the white front of his shirt He drew his handkerchief and wiped it calmly away but a red stain remained At the same time the two who led the stallion pulled him back from the barrier and he stood with head high searching for a more convenient victim Deep silence spread over the arena more hushed and more hushed it grew as if invisible blankets of soundlessness were dropping down over the stirring masses men glanced at each other with a vague surmise knowing that this was no part of the performance The whole audience drew forward to the edge of the seats and stared first at the monstrous horse and next at the group of men who could ride anything that walks on four feet and wears a skin Some of the women were already turning away their heads for this was to be a battle not a game but the vast majority of New York merely watched and waited and smiled a slow stiff lipped smile All the surroundings were changed the flaring electric lights the vast roof the clothes of the multitude but the throng of white faces was the same as that pale host which looked down from the sides of the Coliseum when the lions were loosed upon their victims As for the wild riders from the cattle ranges they drew into a close group with the ringmaster between them and the gaunt stallion almost as if the fearless ones were seeking for protection But the announcer himself lost his almost invincible sang froid in all his matchless vocabulary there were no sounding phrases ready for this occasion and little Werther strutted in the centre of the great arena rising to his opportunity He imitated the ringmaster s phraseology La a a dies and general l mun the price has gone up The death defyin dare devils that laugh at danger ain t none too ready to ride my hoss

none	none	the price is too low for em It s raised One thousand dollars cash for any man in hearin of me that ll ride my pet There was a stir among the cattlemen but still none of them moved forward toward the great horse and as if he sensed his victory he raised and shook his ugly head and neighed A mighty laugh answered that challenge this was a sort of horse humour that great New York could not overlook and in that mirth even the big grey man Drew joined The laughter stopped with an amazing suddenness making the following silence impressive as when a storm that has roared and howled about a house falls mute then all the dwellers in the house look to one another and wait for the voice of the thunder So all of New York that sat in the long galleries of the Garden hushed its laughter and looked askance at one another and waited The big grey man rose and cursed softly For the slender young fellow in evening dress at whom the stallion had rushed a moment before was stripping off his coat his vest and rolling up the stiff cuffs of his sleeves Then he dropped a hand on the edge of the box vaulted lightly into the arena and walked straight toward the horse CHAPTER II SPORTING CHANCE It might easily have been made melodramatic by any hesitation as he approached but with a businesslike directness he went right up to the men who held the fighting horse He said Put a saddle on him boys and I ll try my hand They could not answer at once for Werther s pet as if he recognized the newcomer made a sudden lunge and was brought to a stop only after he had dragged his sweating handlers around and around in a small circle Here Werther himself came running up puffing with surprise Son he said eagerly I m not aiming to do you no harm I was only calling the bluff of those four flushers The slender youth finished rolling up his left sleeve and smiled down at the other Put on the saddle he said Werther looked at him anxiously then his eyes brightened with a solution He stepped closer and laid a hand on the other s arm Son if you re broke and want to get the price of a few squares just say the word and I ll fix you I been busted myself in my own day but don t try your hand with my hoss He ain t just a buckin hoss he s a man killer lad I m tellin you straight And this floor ain t so soft as the sawdust makes it look he ended with a grin The younger man considered the animal seriously I m not broke I ve simply taken a fancy to your horse If you don t mind I d like to try him out Seems too bad in a way for a brute like that to put it over on ten thousand people without getting a run for his money a sporting chance eh And he laughed with great good nature What s your name asked Werther his small eyes growing round and wide Anthony Woodbury Mine s Werther They shook hands City raised Yes Didn t know they came in this style east of the Rockies Woodbury I hope I lose my thousand but if there was any betting I d stake ten to one against you In the meantime some of the range riders had thrown a coat over the head of the stallion and while he stood quivering with helpless rage they flung a saddle on and drew the cinches taut Anthony Woodbury was saying with a smile Just for the sake of the game I ll take you on for a few hundred mister Werther if you wish but I can t accept odds Werther ran a finger under his collar apparently to facilitate breathing His eyes roving wildly wandered over the white silent mass of faces and his glance picked out and lingered for a moment on the big shouldered figure of Drew erect in his box At last his glance came back with an intent frown to Woodbury Something in the keen eyes of the lad raised a responsive flicker in his own Well I ll be damned Just a game eh Lad no matter on what side of the Rockies you were born I know your breed and I won t lay a penny against your money There s the hoss saddled and there s the floor you ll land on Go to it and God help you The other shook his shoulders back and stepped toward the horse with a peculiarly unpleasant smile like a pugilist coming out of his corner toward an opponent of unknown prowess He said Take off the halter One of the men snapped viciously over his shoulder Climb on while the climbing s good Cut out the bluff partner The smile went out on the lips of Woodbury He repeated Take off the halter They stared at him but quickly began to fumble under the coat unfastening the buckle It required a moment to work off the heavy halter without giving the blinded animal a glimpse of the light then Woodbury caught the bridle reins firmly just beneath the chin of the horse With the other hand he took the stirrup strap and raised his foot but he seemed to change his mind about this matter Take off the blinder he ordered It was Werther who interposed this time with Look here lad I know this hoss The minute the blinder s off he ll up on his hind legs and bash you into the floor with his forefeet Let him go growled one of the cowboys He s goin to hell making a gallery play But taking the matter into his own hands Woodbury snatched the coat from the head of the stallion which snorted and reared up mouth agape ears flattened back There was a shout from the man not a cry of dismay but a ringing battle yell like some ancient berserker seeing the first flash of swords in the melee He leaped forward jerking down on the bridle reins with all the force of his weight and his spring The horse caught in mid air as it were came floundering down on all fours again Before he could make another move Woodbury caught the high horn of the saddle and vaulted up to his seat It was gallantly done and in response came a great rustling from the multitude there was not a spoken word but every man was on his feet Perhaps what followed took their breaths and kept them speechless The first touch of his rider s weight sent the stallion mad not blind with fear as most horses go but raging with a devilish cunning like that of an insane man a thing that made the blood run cold to watch He stood a moment shuddering as if the strange truth were slowly dawning on his brute mind then he bolted straight for the barriers Woodbury braced himself and lunged back on the reins but he might as well have tugged at the mooring cable of a great ship the bit was in the monster s teeth Then a whisper reached the rider a universal hushing of drawn breath for the thousands were tasting the first thrill and terror of the combat They saw a picture of horse and man crushed against the barrier But there was no such stupid rage in the mind of the stallion At the last moment he swerved and raced close beside the fence some projecting edge caught the trousers of Woodbury and ripped away the stout cloth from hip to heel He swung far to the other side and wrenched back the reins With stiff braced legs the stallion slid to a halt that flung his unbalanced rider forward along his neck Before he could straighten himself in the saddle the horse roared and came down on rigid forelegs yet by a miracle Woodbury clung sprawled down the side of the monster to be sure but was not quite dismounted Another pitch of the same nature would have freed the stallion from his rider beyond doubt but he elected to gallop full speed ahead the length of the arena and during that time Woodbury stunned though he was managed to drag himself back into the saddle The end of the race was a leap into the air that would have cleared a five bar fence and down pitched the fighting horse on braced legs again Woodbury s chin snapped down against his breast as though he had been struck behind the head with a heavy bar but though his brain was stunned the fighting instinct remained strong in him and when the stallion reared and toppled back the rider slipped from the saddle in the nick of time Fourteen hundred pounds of raging horseflesh crashed into the sawdust he rolled like a cat to his feet but at the same instant a flying weight leaped through the air and landed in the saddle The audience awoke to sound to a dull roar of noise a thin trickle of blood ran from Woodbury s mouth and it seemed that the mob knew it and was yelling for a death There followed a bewildering exhibition of such bucking that the disgruntled cowboys forgot their shame and shouted with joy Upon his hind legs and then down on his forefeet with a sickening heartbreaking jar the stallion rocked now he bucked from side to side now rose and whirled about like a dancer now toppled to the ground and twisted again to his feet Still the rider clung His head rocked with the ceaseless jars the red stained lips writhed back and showed the locked teeth Yet as if he scorned the struggles of the stallion he brought into play the heavy quirt which had been handed him as he mounted Over neck and shoulders and tender flanks he whirled the lash it was not intelligence fighting brute strength but one animal conquering another and rejoicing in the battle The horse responded furiously he responded but still the lash fell and the bucking grew more cunning perhaps but less violent Yet to the wildly cheering audience the fight seemed more dubious than ever Then in the very centre of the arena the stallion stopped in the midst of a twisting course of bucking and stood with widely braced legs and fallen head Strength was left in him but the cunning savage mind knew defeat Once more the quirt whirled in the air and fell with a resounding crack but the stallion merely switched his tail and started forward at a clumsy stumbling trot The thunder of the host was too hoarse for applause they saw a victory and a defeat but what they had wanted was blood and a death They had had a promise and a taste now they hungered for the reality Woodbury slipped from the saddle and gave the reins to Werther Already a crowd was growing about them of the curious who had sprung over the barriers and swarmed across the arena to see the conqueror for had he not vindicated unanswerably the strength of the East as compared with that of the West Boys shouted shrilly men shouldered each other to slap him on the back but Werther merely held forth the handful of greenbacks The conqueror braced himself against the saddle with a trembling hand and shook his head Not for me he said I ought to pay you ten times that much for the sport compared to this polo is nothing Ah muttered those who overheard polo That explains it Then take the horse said Werther because no one else could ride him And now any one can ride him so I don t want him answered Woodbury And Werther grinned You re right boy I ll give him to the iceman The big grey man William Drew loomed over the heads of the little crowd and they gave way before him as water divides under the prow of a ship it was as if he cast a shadow which they feared before him Help me through this mob said Woodbury to Werther and back to my box Devil take it my overcoat won t cover that leg Then on him also fell as it seemed the approaching shadow of the grey man and he looked up with something of a start into the keen eyes of Drew Son said the big man you look sort of familiar to me I m asking your pardon but who was your mother The eyes of young Woodbury narrowed and the two stood considering each other gravely for a long moment I never saw her he said at last and then turned with a frown to work his way through the crowd and back to his box The tall man hesitated a moment and then started in pursuit but the mob intervened He turned back to Werther Did you get his name he asked Fine bit of riding he showed eh cried the little man and turned down my thousand as cool as you please I tell you Drew there s some flint in the Easterners after all Damn the Easterners What s his name Woodbury Anthony Woodbury Woodbury What s wrong with that name Nothing Only I m a bit surprised And he frowned with a puzzled wistful expression staring straight ahead like a man striving to solve a great riddle CHAPTER III SOCIAL SUICIDE At his box Woodbury stopped only to huddle into his coat and overcoat and pull his hat down over his eyes Then he hurried on toward an exit but even this slight delay brought the reporters up with him They had scented news as the eagle sights prey far below and then swooped down on him He continued his flight shaking off their harrying questions but they kept up the running fight and at the door one of them reached his side with It s mister Woodbury of the Westfall Polo Club son of mister John Woodbury of Anson Place Anthony Woodbury groaned with dismay and clutched the grinning reporter by the arm Come with me Prospects of a scoop of a sizable nature brightened the eyes of the reporter He followed in all haste and the other news gatherers in obedience to the exacting unspoken laws of their craft stood back and followed the flight with grumbling envy On Twenty Sixth Street a little from the corner of Madison Avenue stood a big touring car with the chauffeur waiting in the front seat There were still some followers from the Garden Woodbury jumped into the back seat drew the reporter after him and called Start ahead Maclaren drive anywhere but get moving Now sir turning to the reporter as the engine commenced to hum what s your name Bantry Bantry Glad to know you He shook hands You know me Certainly I cover sports all the way from polo to golf Anthony Woodbury Westfall Polo Club then golf tennis trap shooting Enough groaned the victim Now look here Bantry you have me dead to rights got me with the goods so to speak haven t you It was a great bit of work ought to make a first page story And the other groaned again I know son of millionaire rides unbroken horse in Wild West show and all that sort of thing But good Lord man think what it will mean to me Nothing to be ashamed of is it Your father ll be proud of you Woodbury looked at him sharply How do 
1867_148436_000010_000001	train-clean-100	you know that 
none	none	Any man would be But the notoriety man It would kill me with a lot of people as thoroughly as if I d put the muzzle of a gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger H m muttered the reporter sort of social suicide all right But it s news mister Woodbury and the editor Expects you to write as much as the rest of the papers print and none of the other reporters know me One or two of them might have But my dear fellow won t you take a chance Bantry made a wry face Madison Square Garden went on Woodbury bitterly Ten thousand people looking on gad man it s awful Why d you do it then Couldn t help it Bantry By Jove when that wicked devil of a horse came at my box and I caught a glimpse of the red demon in his eyes why man I simply had to get down and try my luck Ever play football Yes quite a while ago Then you know how it is when you re in the bleachers and the whistle blows for the game to begin That s the way it was with me I wanted to climb down into the field and I did Once started I couldn t stop until I d made a complete ass of myself in the most spectacular style Now Bantry I appeal to you for the sake of your old football days don t show me up keep my name quiet I d like to damned if I wouldn t but a scoop Anthony Woodbury considered his companion with a strange yearning It might have been to take him by the throat it might have been some gentler motive but his hand stole at last toward an inner coat pocket He said I know times are a bit lean now and then in your game Bantry I wonder if you could use a bit of the long green Just now I m very flush and He produced a thickly stuffed bill fold but Bantry smiled and touched Woodbury s arm Couldn t possibly you know He considered a moment and then with a smile It s a bit awkward for both of us isn t it Suppose I keep your name under my hat and you give me a few little inside tips now and then on polo news and that sort of thing Here s my hand on it You ve no idea what a load you take off my mind We ve circled about and are pretty close to the Garden again Could you let me out here The car rolled to an easy stop and the reporter stepped out I ll forget everything you wish mister Woodbury It s an honour to have met you sir Use me whenever you can Goodnight To the chauffeur he said Home and make it fast They passed up Lexington with Maclaren making it fast so that the big car was continually nosing its way around the machines in front with much honking of the horn At Fifty Ninth Street they turned across to the bridge and hummed softly across the black shimmering waters of the East River by the time they reached Brooklyn a fine mist was beginning to fall blurring the wind shield and Maclaren slowed up perceptibly so that before they passed the heart of the city Woodbury leaned forward and said What s the matter Maclaren Wet streets no chains this wind shield is pretty hard to see through Stop her then I ll take the wheel the rest of the way Want to travel a bit to night The chauffeur as if this exchange were something he had been expecting made no demur and a moment later with Woodbury at the wheel the motor began to hum again in a gradually increasing crescendo Two or three motor police glanced after the car as it snapped about corners with an ominous skid and straightened out whining on the new street but in each case having made a comfortable number of arrests that day they had little heart for the pursuit of the grey monster through that chill mist Past Brooklyn with a country road before them Woodbury cut out the muffler and the car sprang forward with a roar A gust of increasing wind whipped back to Maclaren for the wind shield had been opened so that the driver need not look through the dripping glass and mingling with the wet gale were snatches of singing The chauffeur partly in understanding and partly from anxiety apparently caught the side of the seat in a firm grip and leaned forward to break the jar when they struck rough places Around an elbow turn they went with one warning scream of the Klaxon skidded horribly at the sharp angle of the curve and missed by inches a car from the opposite direction They swept on with the startled yell of the other party ringing after them drowned at once by the crackling of the exhaust Maclaren raised a furtive hand to wipe from his forehead a moisture which was not altogether rain but immediately grasped the side of the seat again Straight ahead the road swung up to meet a bridge and dropped sharply away from it on the further side Maclaren groaned but the sound was lost in the increasing roar of the exhaust They barely touched that bridge and shot off into space on the other side like a hurdler clearing an obstacle With a creak and a thud the big car landed reeled drunkenly and straightened out in earnest Maclaren craned his head to see the speedometer but had not the heart to look he began to curse softly steadily When the muffler went on again and the motor was reduced to a loud angry humming Woodbury caught a few phrases of those solemn imprecations He grinned into the black heart of the night streaked with lines of grey where therein entered the halo of the headlights and then swung the car through an open iron gate The motor fell to a drowsily contented murmur that blended with the cool swishing of the tires on wet gravel Maclaren said the other as he stopped in front of the garage if everyone was as good a passenger as you I d enjoy motoring but after all a car can t act up like a horse He concluded gloomily There s no fight in it And he started toward the house but Maclaren staring after the departing figure muttered There s only one sort that s worse than a damn fool and that s a young one It was through a door opening off the veranda that Anthony entered the house stealthily as a burglar and with the same nervous apprehension Before him stretched a wide hall dimly illumined by a single light which splashed on the Italian table and went glimmering across the floor Across the hall was his destination the broad balustraded staircase which swept grandly up to the second floor Toward this he tiptoed steadying himself with one hand against the wall Almost to his goal he heard a muffled footfall and shrank against the wall with a catlike agility but though the shadow fell steep and gloomy there luck was against him A middle aged servant of solemn port serene with the twofold dignity of double chin and bald head paused at the table in his progress across the room and swept the apartment with the judicial eye of one who knows that everything is as it should be but will not trust even the silence of night So that bland blue eye struck first on the faintly shining top hat of Anthony ran down his overcoat and lingered in gloomy dismay on the telltale streak of white where the trouser leg should have been What he thought not even another Oedipus could have conjectured The young master very obviously did not wish to be observed and in such times Peters at could be blinder than the bat noon day and more secret than the River Styx He turned away unhurried the fold of that double chin a little more pronounced over the severe correctness of his collar A very sibilant whisper pursued him He stopped again still without haste and turned not directly toward Anthony but at a discreet angle with his eyes fixed firmly upon the ceiling CHAPTER IV A SESSION OF CHAT The whisper grew distinct in words Peters you old numskull come here The approach of Peters was something like the sidewise waddle of a very aged crab He looked to the north but his feet carried him to the east That he was much moved was attested by the colour which had mounted even to the gleaming expanse of that nobly bald head Yes Master Anthony I mean mister Anthony He set his teeth at the faux pas Peters look at me Confound it I haven t murdered any one Are you busy It required whole seconds for the eyes to wheel round upon Anthony and they were immediately debased from the telltale white of that leg to the floor No sir Then come up with me and help me change Quick He turned and fled noiselessly up the great stairs with Peters panting behind Anthony s overcoat was off before he had fairly entered his room and his coat and vest flopped through the air as Peters shut the door Whatever the old servant lacked in agility he made up in certain knowledge as he laid out a fresh tuxedo Anthony changed with the speed of one pursued The conversation was spasmodic to a degree Where s father Waiting in the library Yes Reading sir Had a mix up bully time though damn this collar Peters I wish you d been there where s those trousers Rub some of the crease out of em they must look a little worn He stood at last completely dressed while Peters looked on with a shining eye and a smile which in a younger man would have suggested many things How is it Will I pass father this way I hope so sir But you don t think so It s hard to deceive him Confound 
1867_148436_000019_000001	train-clean-100	it Don t 
none	none	I know Well here s for a try Soft foot it down stairs I ll go after you and bang the door Then you say good evening in a loud voice and I ll go into the library How s that Very good your coat over your arm so Just ruffle your hair a bit sir now you should do very nicely At the door Go first Peters first man and hurry but watch those big feet of yours If you make a noise on the stairs I m done with you The noiselessness of the descending feet was safe enough but not so safe was the chuckling of Peters for though he fought against the threatening explosion it rumbled like the roll of approaching thunder In the hall below Anthony opened and slammed the door Good evening mister Anthony said Peters loudly too loudly Evening Peters Where s father In the library sir Shall I take your coat I ll carry it up to my room when I go That s all He opened the door to the library and entered with a hope that his father would not be facing him but he found that John Woodbury was not even reading He sat by the big fire place smoking a pipe which he now removed slowly from his teeth Hello Anthony Good evening sir He rose to shake hands with his son they might have been friends meeting after a separation so long that they were compelled to be formal and as Anthony turned to lay down his hat and coat he knew that the keen grey eyes studied him carefully from head to foot Take this chair Why sir wouldn t dream of disturbing you Not a bit I want you to try it just a trifle too narrow for me John Woodbury rose and gestured his son to the chair he had been occupying Anthony hesitated but then like one who obeys first and thinks afterward seated himself as directed Mighty comfortable sir The big man stood with his hands clasped behind him peering down under shaggy iron grey brows I thought it would be I designed it myself for you and I had a pretty bad time getting it made He stepped to one side Hits you pretty well under the knees doesn t it Yes it s deeper than most A perfect fit father and mighty thoughtful of you H m rumbled John Woodbury and looked about like one who has forgotten something What about a glass of Scotch Nothing thank you I in fact I m not very strong for the stuff The rough brows rose a trifle and fell No But isn t it usual Better have a go Once more there was that slight touch of hesitancy as if the son were not quite sure of the father and wished to make every concession Certainly if it ll make you easier There was an instant softening of the hard lines of the elder Woodbury s face as though some favour of import had been done him He touched a bell cord and lowered himself with a little grunt of relaxation into a chair The chair was stoutly built but it groaned a little under the weight of the mighty frame it received He leaned back and in his face was a light which came not altogether from the comfortable glow of the fire And when the servant appeared the big man ordered Scotch and seltzer and one glass with a pitcher of ice Aren t you taking anything sir asked Anthony Who me Yes yes of course Why let me see bring me a pitcher of beer He added as the servant disappeared Never could get a taste for Scotch and rye doesn t seem to be er good form Eh Anthony Nonsense frowned the son haven t you a right to be comfortable in your own house Come come rumbled John Woodbury A young fellow in your position can t have a boor for a father eh It was apparently an old argument between them for Anthony stared gloomily at the fire making no attempt to reply and he glanced up in relief when the servant entered with the liquor John Woodbury however returned to the charge as soon as they were left alone again saying As a matter of fact I m about to set you up in an establishment of your own in New York He made a vastly inclusive gesture Everything done up brown old house high class interior decorator to get you started with a splash Are you tired of Long Island I m not going to the city but you will And my work A gentleman of the class you ll be in can t callous his hands with work I spent my life making money you can use your life throwing it away like a gentleman But he reached out at this point and smashed a burly fist into a palm hardly less hard but I ll be damned Anthony if I ll let you stay here in Long Island wasting your time riding the wildest horses you can get and practising with an infernal revolver What the devil do you mean by it I don t know said the other musing Of course the days of revolvers are past but I love the feel of the butt against my palm I love the kick of the barrel tossing up I love the balance and when I have a six shooter in my hand sir I feel as if I had six lives Odd isn t it He grew excited as he talked his eyes gleaming with dancing points of fire And I ll tell you this sir I d rather be out in the country where men still wear guns where the sky isn t stained with filthy coal smoke where there s an horizon wide enough to breathe in where there s man talk instead of this damned chatter over tea cups Stop cried John Woodbury and leaned forward no matter what fool ideas you get into your head you re going to be a gentleman The swaying forward of that mighty body the outward thrust of the jaws the ring of the voice was like the crashing of an ax when armoured men meet in battle The flicker in the eyes of Anthony was the rapier which swerves from the ax and then leaps at the heart For a critical second their glances crossed and then the habit of obedience conquered I suppose you know sir The father stared gloomily at the floor You re sort of mad Anthony Perhaps there was nothing more typical of Anthony than that he never frowned no matter how angered he might be Now the cold light passed from his eyes He rose and passed behind the chair of the elder man dropping a hand upon those massive shoulders Angry with myself sir that I should so nearly fall out with the finest father that walks the earth The eyes of the grey man half closed and a semblance of a smile touched those stiff stern lips one of the great work broken hands went up and rested on the fingers of his son And there ll be no more of this infernal Western nonsense that you re always reverting to No more of this horse and gun and hell bent away stuff I suppose not said Anthony heavily Well Anthony sit down and tell me about tonight The son obeyed and finally said with difficulty I didn t go to the Morrison supper A sudden cloud of white rose from the bowl of Woodbury s pipe But I thought That it was a big event It was a fine thing for me to get a bid to but I went to the Wild West show instead Sir I know it was childish but I couldn t help it I saw the posters I thought of the horse breaking the guns the swing and snap and dash of galloping men the taint of sweating horses and by God sir I couldn t stay away Are you angry It was more than anger it was almost fear that widened the eye of Woodbury as he stared at his son He said at last controlling himself But I have your word you ve given up the thought of this Western life Yes answered Anthony with a touch of despair I have given it up I suppose But oh sir He stopped hopeless And what else happened Nothing to speak of After you come home you don t usually change your clothes merely for the pleasure of sitting with me here Nothing escapes you does it muttered Anthony In your set Anthony that s what they d call an improper question I could ask you any number of questions sir for that matter Well That room over there for instance which you always keep locked Am I never to have a look at it He indicated a door which opened from the library I hope not You say that with a good deal of feeling But there s one thing more that I have a right to hear about My mother Why do you never tell me of her The big man stirred and the chair groaned beneath him Because it tortures me to speak of her Anthony said the husky voice Tortures me lad I let the locked room go said Anthony firmly but my mother she is different Why sir I don t even know how she looked Dad it s my right Is it By God you have a right to know exactly what I choose to tell you no more He rose strode across the room with ponderous steps drew aside the curtains which covered the view of the garden below and stared for a time into the night When he turned he found that Anthony had risen a slender erect figure His voice was as quiet as his anger but an inward quality made it as thrilling as the hoarse boom of his father On that point I stick I must know something about her Must In spite of your anger That locked room is yours this house and everything in it is yours but my mother she was as much mine as yours and I ll hear more about her who she was what she looked like where she lived The sharply indrawn breath of John Woodbury cut him short She died in giving birth to you Anthony Dear God She died for me And in the silence which came over the two men it seemed as if another presence were in the room John Woodbury stood at the fire place with bowed head and Anthony shaded his eyes and stared at the floor until he caught a glimpse of the other and went gently to him He said I m sorrier than a lot of words could tell you Will you sit down sir and let me tell you how I came to press home the question If you want to have it that way They resumed their chairs CHAPTER V ANTHONY IS LEFT IN THE DARK It will explain why I changed my clothes after I came home You see toward the end of the show a lot of the cowboys rode in The ringmaster was announcing that they could ride anything that walked on four feet and wore a skin when up jumped an oldish fellow in a box opposite mine and shouted that he had a horse which none of them could mount He offered five hundred dollars to the man who could back him and made it good by going out of the building and coming back inside of five minutes with two men leading a great stallion the ugliest piece of horseflesh I ve ever seen As they worked the brute down the arena it caught sight of my white shirt I suppose for it made a dive at me reared up and smashed its forehoofs against the barrier By Jove a regular maneater Brought my heart into my mouth to see the big devil raging and I began to yearn to get astride him and to well just fight to see which of us would come out on top You know The big man moistened his lips he was strangely excited So you climbed into the arena and rode the horse Exactly I knew you d understand After I d ridden the horse to a standstill and climbed off a good many people gathered around me One of them was a big man about your size In fact now that I look back at it he was a good deal like you in more ways than one looked as if time had hardened him without making him brittle He came to me and said Excuse me son but you look sort of familiar to me Mind telling me who your mother was What could I answer to a A shadow fell across Anthony from the rising height of his father As he looked up he saw John Woodbury glance sharply first toward the French windows and then at the door of the secret room Was that all Anthony Yes about all I want to be alone The habit of automatic obedience made Anthony rise in spite of the questions which were storming at his lips Good night sir Good night my boy At the door the harsh voice of his father overtook him Before you leave the house again see me Anthony Yes sir He closed the door softly as one deep in thought and stood for a time without moving Because a man had asked him who his mother was he was under orders not to leave the house While he stood he heard a faint click of a snapping lock within the library and knew that John Woodbury had entered the secret room In his own bedroom he undressed slowly and afterward stood for a long time under the shower rubbing himself down with the care of an athlete thumbing the soreness of the wild ride out of the lean sinewy muscles for his was a made strength built up in the gymnasium and used on the wrestling mat the cinder path and the football field Drying himself with a rough towel that whipped the pink into his skin he looked down over his corded slender limbs remembered the thick arms and Herculean torso of John Woodbury and wondered He sat on the edge of his bed wrapped in a bathrobe and pondered Stroke by stroke he built the picture of that dead mother like a painter who jots down the first sketch of a large composition John Woodbury vast blond grey eyed had given him few of his physical traits But then he had often heard that the son usually resembled the mother She must have been dark slender a frail wife for such a giant but perhaps she had a strength of spirit which made her his mate As the picture drew out more clearly in the mind of Anthony he turned from the lighted room threw open a window and leaned out to breathe the calm damp air of night It was infinitely cool infinitely fresh To his left a row of young trees darted their slender tops at the sky like shadowy spearheads The smell of wet leaves and the wet grass beneath rose up to him To the right for his own room stood in a wing of the mansion the house shouldered its way into the gloom a solemn grey shadow netted in a black tracery of climbing vine In all the stretch of wall only two windows were lighted and those yellow squares he knew belonged to his father He had left the secret room therefore As he watched a shadow brushed slowly across one of the drawn shades swept the second and returned at once in the opposite direction Back and forth back and forth that shadow moved and as his eye grew accustomed to watching he caught quite clearly the curve of the shoulders and the forward droop of the head It was not until then that the first alarm came to Anthony for he knew that the footsteps of the big grey man were dogged by fear He could no more conceive it than he could imagine noon and midnight in conjunction and feeling as guilty as if he had played the part of an eavesdropper he turned away snapped off the lights and slipped into bed The pleasant warmth of sleep would not come In its place the images of the day filed past him like the dance of figures on a motion picture screen and always like the repeated entrance of the hero the other images grew small and dim He saw again the burly stranger wading through the crowd in the arena shaking off the packed mob as the prow of a stately ship shakes off the water to either side At length he started out of bed and glanced through the window The moving shadow still swept across the lighted shades of his father s room so he donned bathrobe and slippers and went down the long hall At the door he did not stop to knock for he was too deeply concerned by this time to pay any heed to convention He grasped the knob and threw the door wide open What happened then was so sudden that he could not be sure afterward what he had seen He was certain that the door opened on a lighted room yet before he could step in the lights were snapped out He was staring into a deep void of night and a silence came about him like a whisper Out of that silence he thought after a second that he caught the sound of a hurried breathing louder and louder as though someone were creeping upon him He glanced over his shoulder in a slight panic but down the grey hall on either side there was nothing to be seen Once more he looked back into the solemn room opened his lips to speak changed his mind and closed the door again Yet when he looked down again from his own room the lights shone once more on the shades of his father s windows Past them brushed the shadow of the pacing man up and down up and down He turned his eyes away to the jagged tops of the young trees to the glimpses of dark fields beyond them and inhaled the scent of the wet green things It seemed to Anthony as if it all were hostile as though the whole outdoors were besieging this house He caught the sway of the pacing figure whose shadow moved in regular rhythm across the yellow shades It entered his mind clung there and finally he began to pace in the same cadence up and down the room With every step he felt that he was entering deeper into the danger which threatened John Woodbury What danger For answer to himself he stepped to the windows and pulled down the shades At least he could be alone CHAPTER VI JOHN BARD There is no cleanser of the mind like a morning bath The same cold whipping spray which calls up the pink blood glowing through the marble of the skin drives the ache of sleep from the brain and washes away at once all the recorded thoughts of yesterday So in place of a crowded slate of wonders and doubts Anthony bore down to the breakfast table a willingness to take what the morning might bring and forget the night before John Woodbury was already there helping himself from the covered dishes for the meal was served in the English style There was the usual Good morning sir Good morning Anthony and then they took their places at the table A cautious survey of the craglike face of his father showed no traces of a sleepless night but then what could a single night of unrest mean to that body of iron He ventured remembering the implied command to remain within the house until further orders You asked me to speak to you sir before I left the house I d rather like to take a ride this morning And the imperturbable voice replied You ve worn your horses out lately Better give them a day of rest That was all but it brought back to Anthony the thought of the shadow which had swept ceaselessly across the yellow shades of his father s room and he settled down to a day of reading The misty rain of the night before had cleared the sky of its vapours so he chose a nook in the library where the bright spring sun shone full and the open fire supplied the warmth At lunch his father did not appear and Peters announced that the master was busy in his room with papers The afternoon repeated the morning but with less unrest on the part of Anthony He was busy with L Assommoir and lost himself in the story of downfall surrounding himself with each unbeautiful detail Lunch was repeated at dinner for still John Woodbury seemed to be busy with papers in his room A fear came to Anthony that he was to be dodged indefinitely in this manner deceived like a child and kept in the house until the silent drama was played out But when he sat in the library that evening his father came in and quietly drew up a chair by the fire The stage was ideally set for a confidence but none was forthcoming The fire shook long sleepy shadows through the room the glow of the two floor lamps picked out two circles of light and still the elder man sat over his paper and would not speak L Assommoir ended and to rid himself of the grey tragedy Anthony looked up and through the windows toward the bright night which lay over the gardens and terraces outside for a full moon silvered all with a flood of light It was a waiting time and into it the old fashioned Dutch clock in the corner sent its voice with a monotonous softly clanging toll of seconds until Anthony forgot the moonlight over the outside terraces to watch the gradual sway of the pendulum A minute spent in this manner was equal to an hour of ordinary time Fascinated by the sway of the pendulum he became conscious of the passage of existence like a river broad and wide and shining which flowed on into an eternity of chance and left him stationary on the banks The voice which sounded at length was as dim and visionary as a part of his waking dream It was like one of those imagined calls from the world of action to him who stood there watching reality run past and never stirring himself to take advantage of the thousand opportunities for action He would have discarded it for a part of his dream had not he seen John Woodbury raise his head sharply heard the paper fall with a dry crackling to the floor and watched the square jaw of his father jut out in that familiar way which meant danger Once more and this time it was unmistakably clear John Bard John Bard come out to me The big grey man rose with widely staring eyes as if the name belonged to him and strode with a thumping step into the secret room Hardly had the clang of the closing door died out when he reappeared fumbling at his throat Straight to Anthony he came and extended a key from which dangled a piece of thin silver chain It was the key to the secret room He took it in both hands like a young knight receiving the pommel of his sword from him who has just given the accolade and stared down at it until the creaking of the opened French windows startled him to his feet Wait he called I will go also The big man at the open window turned You will sit where you are now said his harsh voice but if I don t return you have the key to the room His burly shoulders disappeared down the steps toward the garden and Anthony slipped back into his chair yet for the first time in his life he was dreaming of disobeying the command of John Woodbury Woodbury yet the big man had risen automatically in answer to the name of Bard John Bard It struck on his consciousness like two hammer blows wrecking some fragile fabric it jarred home like the timed blow of a pugilist Woodbury There might be a thousand men capable of that name but there could only be one John Bard and that was he who had disappeared down the steps leading to the garden Anthony swerved in his chair and fastened his eyes on the Dutch clock He gave himself five minutes before he should move The watched pot will never boil and the minute hand of the big clock dragged forward with deadly pauses from one black mark to the next Whispers rose in the room Something fluttered the fallen newspaper as if a ghost hand grasped it but had not the strength to raise and the window rattled with a sharp gust of wind The last minute Anthony spent at the open French window with a backward eye on the clock then he raced down the steps as though in his turn he answered a call out of the night The placid coolness of the open and the touch of moist fresh air against his forehead mocked him as he reached the garden and there were reassuring whispers from the trees he passed yet he went on with a long easy stride like a runner starting a distance race First he skirted the row of poplars on the drive then doubled back across the meadow to his right and ran in a sharp angling course across an orchard of apple trees Diverging from this direction he circled at a quicker pace toward the rear of the grounds and coursed like a wild deer over a stretch of terraced lawns On one of these low crests he stopped short under the black shadow of an elm In the smooth shaven centre of the hollow before him the same ground over which he had run and played a thousand times in his childhood he saw two tall men standing back to back like fighters come to a last stand and facing a crowd of foes They separated at once striding out with a measured step and it was not until they moved that he caught the glint of metal at the side of one of them and knew that one was the man who had answered to the name of John Bard and the other was the grey man who had spoken to him at the Garden the night before He knew it not so much by the testimony of his eyes at that dim distance as by a queer inner feeling that this must be so There was also a sense of familiarity about the whole thing as if he were looking on something which he had seen rehearsed a thousand times As if they reached the end of an agreed course the two whirled at the same instant the metal in their hands glinted in an upward semicircle and two guns barked hoarsely across the lawns One of them stood with his gun still poised the other leaned gradually forward and toppled at full length on the grass The victor strode out toward the fallen but hearing the wild yell of Anthony he stopped turned his head and then fled into the grove of trees which topped the next rise of ground After him running as he had never before raced went Anthony his hand as he sprinted already tensed for the coming battle two hundred yards at the most and he would reach the lumbering figure which had plunged into the night of the trees but a call reached him as sharp as the crack of the guns a moment before Anthony His head twitched to one side and he saw John Bard rising to his elbow His racing stride shortened choppily Anthony He could not choose but halt groaning to give up the chase and then sped back to the fallen man At his coming John Bard collapsed on the grass and when Anthony knelt beside him a voice in rough dialect began as if an enforced culture were brushed away and forgotten in the crisis Anthony there ain t no use in followin him Where did the bullet strike you Quick A place where it ain t no use to look I know Let me follow him it s not too late The dying man struggled to one elbow Don t follow lad if you love me Who is he Give me his name and He s acted in the name of God You have no right to hunt him down Then the law will do that Not the law For God s sake swear I ll swear anything But now lie quiet let me Don t try This couldn t end no other way for John Bard Is that your real name Yes Now listen Anthony for my time s short He closed his eyes as if fighting silently for strength Then When I was a lad like you Anthony That was all The massive body relaxed the head fell back into the dewy grass Anthony pressed his head against the breast of John Bard and it seemed to him that there was still a faint pulse With his pocket knife he ripped away the coat from the great chest and then tore open the shirt On the expanse of the hairy chest there was one spot from which the purple blood welled a deadly place for a wound and yet the bleeding showed that there must still be life He had no chance to bind the wound for John Bard opened his eyes again and said as if in his dream he had still continued his tale to Anthony So that s all the story lad Do you forgive me For what sir In God s name for what Damnation Tell me do you forgive John Bard He did not hear the answer for he murmured Even Joan would forgive and died CHAPTER VII BLUEBEARD S ROOM As Anthony Woodbury he knelt beside the dying As Anthony Bard he rose with the dead man in his arms a mighty burden even for his supple strength yet he went staggering up the slope across a level terrace and back to the house There it was Peters who answered his call Peters with a flabby face grown grey but still the perfect servant who asked no questions together they bore the weight up the stairs and placed it on John Bard s bed While Anthony kept his steady vigil by the dead man it was Peters again who summoned the police and the useless doctor To the old uniformed sergeant Anthony told a simple lie His father had gone for a walk through the grounds because the night was fine and Anthony was to join him there later but when he arrived he found a dying man who could not even explain the manner of his death
1867_148436_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Nothin 
none	none	surprises me about a rich man s death said the sergeant not in these here days of anarchy Got a place to write I want to make out my report So Anthony led the grizzled fellow to the library and supplied him with what he wished The sergeant saying good bye shook hands with a lingering grip I knew John Woodbury he said just by sight but I m here to tell the world that you ve lost a father who was just about all man So long I ll be seein you again Left alone Anthony Bard went to the secret room The key fitted smoothly into the lock What the door opened upon was a little grey apartment with an arched ceiling a place devoid of a single article of furniture save a straight backed chair in the centre Otherwise Anthony saw three things two pictures on the wall and a little box in the corner He went about his work very calmly for here he knew was the only light upon the past of John Bard that past which had lain passive so long and overwhelmed him on this night First he took up the box as being by far the most promising of the three to give him what he wished to know the name of the slayer the place where he could be found and the cause of the slaying It held only two things a piece of dirty silk and a small oil can but the oil can and the black smears on the silk made him look closer closer until the meaning struck him in a flare as the glow of a lighted match suddenly illumines even if faintly an entire room In that box the revolver had lain and here every day through all the year John Bard retired to clean and oil his gun oil and reclean it keeping it ready for the crisis That was why he went to the secret room as soon as he heard the call from the garden and carrying that gun with him he had walked out prepared The time had come for which he had waited a quarter of a century knowing all that time that the day must arrive It was easy to understand now many an act of the big grim man but still there was no light upon the slayer As he sat pondering he began to feel as if eyes were fastened upon him watching waiting mocking him eyes from behind which stared until a chill ran up his back He jerked his head up at last and flashed a glance over his shoulder Indeed there was mockery in the smile with which she stared down to him from her frame down to him and past him as if she scorned in him all men forever It was not that which made Anthony close his eyes He was trying with all his might to conjure up his own image vividly He looked again comparing his picture with this portrait on the wall and then he knew why the grey man at the Garden had said Son who s your mother For this was she into whose eyes he now stared She had the same deep dark eyes the same black hair the same rather aquiline thin face which her woman s eyes and lovely mouth made beautiful but otherwise the same He was simply a copy of that head hewn with a rough chisel a sculptor s clay model rather than a smoothly finished re production Ah and the fine spirit of her the buoyant proud scornful spirit He stretched out his arms to her drew closer smiling as if she could meet and welcome his caress and then remembered that this was a thing of canvas and paint a bright shadow no more To the second picture he turned with a deeper hope but his heart fell at once for all he saw was an enlarged photograph two mountains snow topped in the distance and in the foreground first a mighty pine with the branches lopped smoothly from the side as though some tremendous ax had trimmed it behind this a ranch house and farther back the smooth waters of a lake He turned away sadly and had reached the door when something made him turn back and stand once more before the photograph It was quite the same but it took on a different significance as he linked it with the two other objects in the room the picture of his mother and the revolver box He found himself searching among the forest for the figures of two great grey men equal in bulk such Titans as that wild country needed West it must be but where North or South West and from the West surely that grey man at the Garden had come and from the West John Bard himself Those two mountains spearing the sky with their sharp horns they would be the pole by which he steered his course A strong purpose is to a man what an engine is to a ship Suppose a hull lies in the water stanchly built graceful in lines of strength and speed nosing at the wharf or tugging back on the mooring line it may be a fine piece of building but it cannot be much admired But place an engine in the hull and add to those fine lines the purr of a motor there is a sight which brings a smile to the lips and a light in the eyes Anthony had been like the unengined hulk moored in gentle waters with never the hope of a voyage to rough seas Now that his purpose came to him he was calmly eager almost gay in the prospect of the battle On the highest hill of Anson Place in a tomb overlooking the waters of the sound they lowered the body of John Bard Afterward Anthony Bard went back to the secret room of his father The old name of Anthony Woodbury he had abandoned in fact he felt almost like dating a new existence from the moment when he heard the voice calling out of the garden John Bard come out to me If life was a thread that voice was the shears which snapped the trend of his life and gave him a new beginning As Anthony Bard he opened once more the door of the chamber He had replaced the revolver of John Bard in the box with the oiled silk Now he took it out again and shoved it into his back trouser pocket and then stood a long moment under the picture of the woman he knew was his mother As he stared he felt himself receding to youth to boyhood to child days finally to a helpless infant which that woman perhaps had held and loved In those dark brooding eyes he strove to read the mystery of his existence but they remained as unriddled as the free stars of heaven He repeated to himself his new name his real name Anthony Bard It seemed to make him a stranger in his own eyes Woodbury had been a name of culture it suggested the air of a long descent Bard was terse short brutally abrupt alive with possibilities of action Those possibilities he would never learn from the dead lips of his father He sought them from his mother but only the painted mouth and the painted smile answered him He turned again to the picture of the house with the snow topped mountains in the distance There surely was the solution somewhere in the infinite reaches of the West Finally he cut the picture from its frame and rolled it up He felt that in so doing he would carry with him an identification tag a clue to himself With that clue in his travelling bag he started for the city bought his ticket and boarded a train for the West CHAPTER VIII MARTY WILKES The motion of the train during those first two days gave Anthony Bard a strange feeling that he was travelling from the present into the past He felt as if it was not miles that he placed behind him but days weeks months years that unrolled and carried him nearer and nearer to the beginning of himself He heard nothing about him he saw nothing of the territory which whirled past the window They were already far West before a man boarded the train and carried to Bard the whole atmosphere of the mountain desert He got on the train at a Nebraska station and Anthony sat up to watch for a man of importance does not need size in order to have a mien Napoleon struck awe through the most gallant of his hero marshals and even the porter treated this little brown man with a respect that was ludicrous at first glimpse He was so ugly that one smiled on glancing at him His face built on the plan of a wedge was extremely narrow in front with a long high bridged nose slanting forehead thin lipped mouth and a chin that jutted out to a point but going back all the lines flared out like a reversed vista A ridge of muscle crested each side of the broad jaws and the ears flaunted out behind so that he seemed to have been built for travelling through the wind The same wind perhaps had blown the hair away from the upper part of his forehead leaving him quite bald half way back on his head where a veritable forest of hair began and continued growing thicker and longer until it brushed the collar of his coat behind When he entered the car he stood eying his seat for a long moment like a dog choosing the softest place on the floor before it lies down Then he took his place and sat with his hands folded in his lap moveless speechless with the little keen eyes straight before him three hours that state continued Then he got up and Anthony followed him to the diner They sat at the same table The journey said Anthony is pretty tiresome through monotonous scenery like this The little keen eyes surveyed him a moment before the man spoke There was buffalo on them plains once If someone had said to an ignorant questioner This little knoll is called Bunker Hill he could not have been more abashed than was Anthony who glanced through the window at the dreary prospect looked back again and found that the sharp eyes once more looked straight ahead without the slightest light of triumph in his coup Silence apparently did not in the least abash this man Know a good deal about buffaloes Yes It was not the insulting curtness of one who wishes to be left in peace but simply a statement of bald fact Really queried Anthony I didn t think you were as old as that It appeared that this remark was worthy of no answer whatever The little man turned his attention to his order of ham and eggs cut off the first egg manoeuvred it carefully into position on his knife and raised it toward a mouth that stretched to astonishing proportions but at the critical moment the egg slipped and flopped back on the plate Missed said Anthony He couldn t help it the ejaculation popped out of its own accord The other regarded him with grave displeasure If you had your bead drawed an somebody jogged your arm jest as you pulled the trigger would you call it a miss Excuse me I ve no doubt you re extremely accurate I ne er miss said the other and proved it by disposing of the egg at the next imposing mouthful I should like to know you My name is Anthony Bard I m Marty Wilkes H ware ye They shook hands Westerner mister Wilkes This is my furthest East Have a pleasant time A gesture indicated the barren brown waste of prairie Too much civilization Really Even the cattle got no fight in em He added That sounds like I m a fighter I ain t Till you re stirred up mister Wilkes Heat me up an I ll burn Soil wood You re pretty familiar with the Western country I get around Perhaps you d recognize this He took a scroll from his breast pocket and unrolled the photograph of the forest and the ranchhouse with the two mountains in the distance Wilkes considered it unperturbed Them are the Little Brothers Ah Then all I have to do is to travel to the foot of the Little Brothers No about sixty miles from em Impossible Why the mountains almost overhang that house Wilkes handed back the picture and resumed his eating without reply It was not a sullen resentment it was hunger and a lack of curiosity He was not heated up Any one said Anthony to lure the other on could see that Sure any one with bad eyes But how can you tell it s sixty miles I ve been there Well at least the big tree there and the ranchhouse will not be very hard to find But I suppose I ll have to travel in a circle around the Little Brothers keeping a sixty mile radius If you want to waste a pile of time Yes I suppose you could lead me right to the spot I could How That s about fifty five miles straight north east of the Little Brothers How the devil can you tell that man That ain t hard They s a pretty steady north wind that blows in them parts It s cold and it s strong Now when you been out there long enough and get the idea that the only things that live is because God loves em Mostly it s jest plain sand and rock The trees live because they got protection from that north wind Nature puts moss on em on the north side to shelter em from that same wind Look at that picture close You see that rough place on the side of that tree jest a shadow like the whiskers of a man that ain t shaved for a week That s the moss Now if that s north the rest is easy That place is north east of the Little Brothers By Jove how did you get such eyes Used em The reason I d like to find the house is because Reasons ain t none too popular with me Well you re pretty sure that your suggestion will take me to the spot I m sure of nothing except my gun when the weather s hot Reasonably sure however The pine trees and the house if I don t find one I ll find the other The house ll be in ruins probably Why That picture was taken a long time ago Do you read the mind of a picture mister Wilkes No The tree however will be there No that s chopped down That s going a bit too far Do you mean to say you know that this particular tree is down That s first growth All that country s been cut over D you think they d pass up a tree the size of that It s going to be hard said Anthony with a frown for me to get used to the West Maybe not I can ride and shoot pretty well but I don t know the people I haven t worn their clothes and I can t talk their lingo The country s mostly rocks when it ain t ground the people is pretty generally men and women the clothes they wear is cotton and wool the lingo they talk is English It was like a paragraph out of some book of ultimate knowledge He was not entirely contented with his statement however for now he qualified it as follows Maybe some of em don t talk good book English Quite a pile ain t had much eddication in fact there ain t awful many like me But they can tell you how much you owe em an they ll understand you when you say you re hungry What s your business Excuse me I don t generally ask questions That s all right You ve probably caught the habit from me I m simply going out to look about for excitement A feller gener ly finds what he s lookin for Maybe you won t be disappointed I ve knowed places on the range where excitement growed like fruit on a tree It was like that there manna in the Bible You didn t have to work none for it You jest laid still an it sort of dropped in your mouth He added with a sigh But them times ain t no more That s hard on me eh Don t start complainin till you miss your feed Things are gettin pretty crowded but there s ways of gettin elbow room even at a bar And you really think there s nothing which distinguishes the Westerner from the Easterner Just the Western feeling partner Get that an you ll be at home If you were a little further East and said that people might be inclined to smile a bit Partner if they did they wouldn t finish their smile But I heard a feller say once that the funny thing about men east and west of the Rockies was that they was all He paused as if trying to remember Well Americans mister Bard CHAPTER IX THIS PLACE FOR REST As the white heat of midday passed and the shadows lengthened more and more rapidly to the east the sheep moved out from the shade and from the tangle of the brush to feed in the open and the dogs which had laid one on either side of the man rose and trotted out to recommence their vigil but the shepherd did not change his position where he sat cross legged under the tree Alternately he stroked the drooping moustache to the right and then to the left with a little twist each time which turned the hair to a sharp point in its furthest downward reach near his chin To the right to the left to the right to the left while his eyes sad with a perpetual mist looked over the lake and far away to the white tops of the Little Brothers now growing blue with shadow Finally with a brown forefinger he lifted the brush of moustache on his upper lip leaned a little and spat After that he leaned back with a sigh of content the brown juice had struck fairly and squarely on the centre of the little stone which for the past two hours he had been endeavouring vainly to hit The wind had been against him All was well The spindling tops of the second growth forest pointed against the pale blue of a stainless sky and through that clear air the blatting of the most distant sheep sounded close mingled with the light clangour of the bells But the perfect peace was broken rudely now by the form of a horseman looming black and large against the eastern sky He trotted his horse down the slope scattered a group of noisy sheep from side to side before him and drew rein before the shepherd Evening Evening stranger Own this land No rent it Could I camp here The shepherd lifted his moustache again and spat when he spoke his eyes held steadily and sadly on the little stone which he had missed again Can t think of nobody who d stop you That your house over there You rent that He pointed to a broken backed ruin which stood on the point of land that jutted out onto the waters of the lake a crumbling structure slowly blackening with time Nope A shadow of a frown crossed the face of the stranger and was gone again more quickly than a cloud shadow brushed over the window on a windy city in March Well he said this place looks pretty good to me Ever fish those streams Don t eat fish I ll wager you re missing some first class trout though By Jove I d like to cast a couple of times over some of the pools I ve passed in the last hour By the way who owns that house over there Same feller that owns this land That so What s his name The other lifted his shaggy eyebrows and stared at the stranger Ain t been long around here eh No William Drew he owns that house William Drew repeated the rider as though imprinting the word on his memory Is he home Maybe I ll ride over and ask him if he can put me up Wait a minute He may be home but he lives on the other side of the range Very far from here Apiece How ll I know him when I see him Big feller grey broad shoulders Ah murmured the other and smiled as though the picture pleased him I ll hunt him up and ask him if I can camp out in this house of his for a while Well that s your party Don t you think he d let me Maybe but the house ain t lucky That so Sure There s a grave in front of it A grave Whose Dunno Well it doesn t worry me I ll drop over the hill and see Drew Maybe you d better wait You ll be passin him on the road like as not How s that He comes over here on Tuesdays once a month to morrow he s about due Good In the meantime I can camp over there by that stream eh Don t know of nobody who d stop you By the way what brings Drew over here every month Never asked him I was brung up not to ask questions The stranger accepted this subtle rebuke with such an open infectious laugh that the shepherd smiled in the very act of spitting at the stone with the result that he missed it by whole inches I ll answer some of the questions you haven t asked then My name is Anthony Bard and I m out here seeing the mountains and having a bully time in general with my rod and gun The sad eyes regarded him without interest but Bard swung from his horse and advanced with outstretched hand I may be about here for a few days and we might as well get acquainted eh I ll promise to lay off the questions I m Logan Glad to know you mister Logan Same t you Don t happen to have no fine cut about you No Sorry So m I Ran out an now all I ve got is plug Kind of hard on the teeth an full of molasses I ve some pipe tobacco though which might do He produced a pouch which Logan opened taking from it a generous pinch Looks kind of like fine cut smells kind of like the real thing here he removed the quid from his mouth and introduced the great pinch of tobacco an I ll be damned if it don t taste a pile the same The misty eyes centred upon Bard and a light grew up in them Maybe you d put a price on this tobacco stranger It s yours said Bard to help you forget all the questions I ve asked The shepherd acted at once lest the other might change his mind dumping the contents of the pouch into the breast pocket of his shirt Afterward his gaze sought the dim summits of the Little Brothers and a sad great resolution grew up and hardened the lines of his sallow face You can camp with me if you want partner A cough hastily summoned covered Bard s smile Thanks awfully but I m used to camping alone and rather like it that way Which I d say the same goes here responded the shepherd with infinite relief I ain t got much use for company away from a bar But I could show you a pretty neat spot for a camp over there by the river Thanks but I ll explore for myself He swung again into the saddle and trotted whistling down the slope toward the creek which Logan had pointed out But once fairly out of sight in the second growth forest he veered sharply to the right touched his tough cattle pony with the spurs and headed at a racing pace straight for the old ruined house Even from a distance the house appeared unmistakably done for but not until he came close at hand could Bard appreciate the full extent of the ruin Every individual board appeared to be rotting and crumbling toward the ground awaiting the shake of one fierce gust of wind to disappear in a cloud of mouldy dust He left his horse with the reins hanging over its head behind the house and entered by the back door One step past the threshold brought him misadventure for his foot drove straight through the rotten flooring and his leg disappeared up to the knee After that he proceeded more cautiously following the lines of the beams on which the boards were nailed but even these shook and groaned under his weight A whimsical fancy made him think of the fabled boat of Charon which will float a thousand bodiless spirits over the Styx but which sinks to the water line with the weight of a single human being So he passed forward like one in a fabric of spider webs almost fearing to breathe lest the whole house should puff away to shreds before him Half the boards fallen from the ceiling revealed the bare rafters above below there were ragged holes in the flooring In one place a limb torn by lightning or wind from its overhanging tree had crashed through the corner of the roof and dropped straight through to the ground At last he reached a habitable room in the front of the house It was a new shell built inside the old wreck with four stout corner posts supporting cross beams which in turn held up the mouldering roof In the centre was a rude table and on either side a bunk built against the wall Perhaps this was where Drew lived on the occasions of his visits to the old ranchhouse Out of the gloom of the place Bard stepped with a shrug of the shoulders like one who shakes off the spell of a nightmare He strode through the doorway and took the slant warm sun of the afternoon full in his face He found himself in front of the only spot on the entire premises which showed the slightest care the mound of a grave under the shelter of two trees whose branches were interwoven overhead in a sort of impromptu roof From the surface of the mound all the weeds and grasses had been carefully cleared away and around its edge ran a path covered with gravel and sand It was a wellbeaten path with the mark of heels still comparatively fresh upon it The headstone itself bore not a vestige of moss but time had cracked it diagonally and the chiselled letters were weathered away He studied it with painful care poring intently over each faint impression He who cared for the grave had apparently been troubled only to keep the stone free from dirt the lettering he must have known by heart At length Bard made out this inscription HERE SLEEPS JOAN WIFE OF WILLIAM DREW SHE CHOSE THIS PLACE FOR REST CHAPTER X A BIT OF STALKING It seemed as if the peaceful afternoons of Logan were ended forever for the next day the scene of interruption was repeated under almost identical circumstances save that the tree under which the shepherd sat was a little larger Larger also was the man who rode over the brow of the hill to the east The most durable cattle pony would have staggered under the bulk of that rider and therefore he rode a great patient eyed bay with shoulders worthy of shoving against a work collar but the neck tapered down small behind a short head and the legs for all their breadth at shoulder and hip slipped away to small hoofs and ankles which sloped sharply to the rear the sure sign of the fine saddle horse Yet the strong horse was winded by the burden he bore a mighty figure deep chested amply shouldered an ideal cavalier for the days when youths rode out in armour plate to seek adventures and when men of fifty still lifted the lance to run a friendly course or two in the lists At sight of him Logan so far bestirred himself as to uncoil his long legs rise and stand with one shoulder propped against the tree Evening mister Drew he called Hello Logan How s everything with you He would have ridden on but at Logan s reply he checked his horse to a slow walk Busy Lots of company lately mister Drew Company Yes there s a young feller come along who says he wants to see you He s over there by the creek now fishin I think I told him I d holler if I seen you but I guess you wouldn t mind ridin over that way yourself Drew brought his horse to a halt What does he want of me Dunno Something about wanting to hunt and fish on your streams here Why didn t you tell him he was welcome to do what he liked Must be an Easterner Logan Wants to bunk in the old house too Seems sort of interested in it That so What sort of a fellow is he All right A bit talky Green but he rides damn well an he smokes good tobacco His hand automatically rose and touched his breast pocket I ll go over to him said Drew and swung his horse to the left but only to come again to a halt He called over his shoulder What sort of a looking fellow Pretty keen dark answered Logan slipping down into his original position Thin face black eyes Ah yes murmured Drew and started at a trot for the creek Once more he imitated the actions of Bard the day before however for no sooner had the trees screened him thoroughly from the eyes of Logan than he abandoned his direct course for the creek He swung from the saddle with an ease surprising in a man of such age and bulk and tossed the reins over the head of the horse Then he commenced a cautious stalking through the woods silent as an Indian stealthy of foot with eyes that glanced sharply in all directions Once a twig snapped under foot and after that he remained motionless through a long moment shrinking against the trunk of a tree and scanning the forest anxiously in all directions At length he ventured out again grown doubly cautious In this manner he worked his way up the course of the stream always keeping the waters just within sight but never passing out on the banks where the walking would have been tenfold easier So he came in sight of a figure far off through the trees If he had been cautious before he became now as still as night Dropping to hands and knees or crouching almost as prone he moved from the shadow of one tree to the next now and then venturing a glance to make sure that he was pursuing the right course until he manoeuvred to a point of vantage which commanded a clear view of Bard The latter was fishing with his back to Drew Again and again he cast his fly out under an overhanging limb which shadowed a deep pool The big grey man set his teeth and waited with the patience of a stalking beast of prey or a cat which will sit half the day waiting for the mouse to show above the opening of its hole Apparently there was a bite at length The pole bent almost double and the reel played back and forth rapidly as the fisher wore down his victim Finally he came close to the edge of the stream dipped his net into the water and jerked it up at once bearing a twisting shining trout enwrapped in the meshes Swinging about as he did so Drew caught his first full glimpse of Anthony s face and knew him for the man who had ridden the wild horse at Madison Square Garden those weeks before Perhaps it was astonishment that moved the big man surely it could not have been fear yet he knelt there behind the sheltering tree grey faced wide and blank of eye as a man might look who dreamed and awoke to see his vision standing before him in full sunlit life What his expression became then could not be said for he buried his face in his hands and his great body shook with a tremor If this was not fear it was something very like And very like a man in fear he stole back among the trees as cautiously as he had made his approach Resuming his horse he rode straight for Logan Couldn t find your young friend he said along the creek Why said Logan I can reach him with a holler from here I think Never mind just tell him that he s welcome to do what he pleases on the place and he can bunk down at the house if he wants to I d like to know his name though That s easy Anthony Bard Ah said Drew slowly Anthony Bard

none	none	nodded Logan and fixed a curious eye upon the big grey rider As if to escape from that inquiring scrutiny Drew wheeled his horse and spurred at a sharp gallop up the hill leaving Logan frowning behind No stay over night muttered the shepherd No fooling about that damned old shack of a house what s wrong with Drew He answered himself for all shepherds are forced by the bitter loneliness of their work to talk with themselves The old boy s worried Damned if he isn t I ll keep an eye on this Bard feller And he loosened the revolver in its holster He might have been even more concerned had he seen the redoubled speed with which Drew galloped as soon as the hilltop was between him and Logan Straight on he pushed his horse not exactly like one who fled but rather more like one too busy with consuming thoughts to pay the slightest heed to the welfare of his mount It was a spent horse on which he trotted late that night up to the big yawning door of his barn Where s Nash he asked of the man who took his horse Playing a game with the boys in the bunk house sir So past the bunk house Drew went on his way to his dwelling knocked and threw open the door Inside a dozen men seated at or standing around a table looked up Nash Here On the jump Nash I m in a hurry There rose a man of a build much prized in pugilistic circles In those same circles he would have been described as a fellow with a fighting face and a heavy weight above the hips and a light weight below a handsome fellow except that his eyes were a little too small and his lips a trifle too thin He rose now in the midst of a general groan of dismay and scooped in a considerable stack of gold as well as several bright piles of silver he was undoubtedly taking the glory of the game with him Is this square growled one of the men clenching his fist on the edge of the table The sardonic smile hardened on the lips of Nash as he answered Before you ve been here much longer Pete you ll find out that about everything I do is square Sorry to leave you boys before you re broke but orders is orders But one more hand first pleaded Pete You poor fool snarled Nash d you think I ll take a chance on keepin him waiting The last of his winnings passed with a melodious jingling into his pockets and he went hurriedly out of the bunk house and up to the main building There he found Drew in the room which the rancher used as an office and stood at the door hat in hand Come in sit down said him Been taking the money from the boys again Steve I thought I talked with you about that a month ago It s this way mister Drew explained Nash with me stayin away from the cards is like a horse stayin off its feed Besides I done the square thing by the lot of those short horns How s that I showed em my hand Told them you were a professional gambler Sure I explained they didn t have no chance against me And of course that made them throw every cent they had against you Maybe It can t go on Nash Look here mister Drew I told em that I wasn t a gambler but just a gold digger The big man could not restrain his smile though it came like a shadow of mirth rather than the sunlight After all they might as well lose it to you as to someone else Sure grinned Nash it keeps it in the family eh But one of these days Steve crooked cards will be the end of you I m still pretty fast on the draw said Steve sullenly All right That s your business Now I want you to listen to some of mine Real work Your own line That said Nash with a smile of infinite meaning sounds like the dinner bell to me Let her go sir CHAPTER XI THE QUEST BEGINS You know the old place on the other side of the range Like a book I got pet names for all the trees There s a man there I want Logan No His name is Bard H m Any relation of the old bird that was partners with you back about the year one I want Anthony Bard brought here said Drew entirely overlooking the question Easy I can make the trip in a buckboard and I ll dump him in the back of it No He s got to ride here understand A dead man said Nash calmly ain t much good on a hoss Listen to me said Drew his voice lowering to a sort of musical thunder if you harm a hair of this lad s head I ll I ll break you in two with my own hands And he made a significant gesture as if he were snapping a twig between his fingers Nash moistened his lips then his square powerful jaw jutted out Which the general idea is me doing baby talk and sort of hypnotizing this Bard feller into coming along More than that He s got to be brought here alive untouched and placed in that chair tied so that he can t move hand or foot for ten minutes while I talk Nice quiet day you got planned for me mister Drew The grey man considered thoughtfully Now and then you ve told me of a girl at Eldara I think her name is Sally Fortune Right She begins where the rest of the calico leaves off H m that sounds familiar somehow Well Steve you ve said that if you had a good start you think the girl would marry you I think she might She pretty fond of you She knows that if I can t have her I m fast enough to keep everyone else away I see A process of elimination with you as the eliminator Rather an odd courtship Steve The cowpuncher grew deadly serious You see I love her There ain t no way of bucking out of that So do nine out of ten of all the boys that ve seen her Which one will she pick That s the question we all keep askin because of all the contrary freckle faced devils with the heart of a man an the smile of a woman Sally has em all beat from the drop of the barrier One feller has money another has looks another has a funny line of talk But I ve got the fastest gun So Sally sees she s due for a complete outfit of black mournin if she marries another man while I m alive an that keeps her thinkin But if I had the price of a start in the world why maybe she d take a long look at me Would she call one thousand dollars in cash a start in the world and your job as foreman of my place with twice the salary you have now Steve Nash wiped his forehead He said huskily A joke along this line don t bring no laugh from me governor I mean it Steve Get Anthony Bard tied hand and foot into this house so that I can talk to him safely for ten minutes and you ll have everything I promise Perhaps more But that depends The blunt fingered hand of Nash stole across the table If it s a go shake mister Drew A mighty hand fell in his and under the pressure he set his teeth Afterward he covertly moved his fingers and sighed with relief to see that no permanent harm had been done Me speakin personal mister Drew I d of give a lot to seen you when you was ridin the range This Bard he ll be here before sunset to morrow Don t jump to conclusions Steve I ve an idea that before you count your thousand you ll think that you ve been underpaid That s straight This Bard is something of a man I can say that without stopping to think Texas No He s a tenderfoot but he can ride a horse as if he was sewed to the skin and I ve an idea that he can do other things up to the same standard If you can find two or three men who have silent tongues and strong hands you d better take them along I ll pay their wages and big ones You can name your price But Nash was frowning Now and then I talk to the cards a bit mister Drew and you ll hear fellers say some pretty rough things about me but I ve never asked for no odds against any man I m not going to start now You re a hard man Steve but so am I and hard men are the kind I take to I know that you re the best foreman who ever rode this range and I know that when you start things you generally finish them All that I ask is that you bring Bard to me in this house The way you do it is your own problem Drunk or drugged I don t care how but get him here unharmed Understand mister Drew you can start figurin what you want to say to him now I ll get him here safe And then Sally If money will buy her you ll have me behind you when you bid When shall I start Now So long then He rose and passed hastily from the room leaning forward from the hips like a man who is making a start in a foot race Straight up the stairs he went to his room for the foreman lived in the big house of the rancher There he took a quantity of equipment from a closet and flung it on the bed Over three selections he lingered long The first was the cartridge belt and he tried over several with conscientious care until he found the one which received the cartridges with the greatest ease He could flip them out in the night automatically as a pianist fingers the scale in the dark Next he examined lariats painfully inch by inch as though he were going out to rope the stanchest steer that ever roamed the range Already he knew that those ropes were sound and true throughout but he took no chances now One of the ropes he discarded because one or two strands in it were or might be a trifle frayed The others he took alternately and whirled with a broad loop standing in the centre of the room Of the set one was a little more supple a little more durable it seemed This he selected and coiled swiftly Last of all he lingered and longest over his revolvers Six in all he set them in a row along the bed and without delay threw out two to begin with Then he fingered the others tried their weight and balance slipped cartridges into the cylinders and extracted them again whirled the cylinders examined the minutest parts of the actions They were all such guns as an expert would have turned over with shining eyes but finally he threw one aside into the discard the cylinder revolved just a little too hard Another was abandoned after much handling of the remaining three because to the delicate touch of Nash it seemed that the weight of the barrel was a gram more than in the other two but after this selection it seemed that there was no possible choice between the final two So he stood in the centre of the room and went through a series of odd gymnastics Each gun in turn he placed in the holster and then jerked it out spinning it on the trigger guard around his second finger while his left hand shot diagonally across his body and fanned the hammer Still he could not make his choice but he would not abandon the effort It was an old maxim with him that there is in all the world one gun which is the best of all and with which even a novice can become a killer He tried walking away whirling as he made his draw and levelling the gun on the door knob Then without moving his hand he lowered his head and squinted down the sights In each case the bead was drawn to a centre shot Last of all he weighed each gun one seemed a trifle lighter the merest shade lighter than the other This he slipped into the holster and carried the rest of his apparatus back to the closet from which he had taken it Still the preparation had not ended Filling his cartridge belt every cartridge was subject to a rigid inspection A full half hour was wasted in this manner Wasted because he rejected not one of the many he examined Yet he seemed happier after having made his selection and went down the stairs humming softly Out to the barn he went lantern in hand This time he made no comparison of horses but went directly to an ugly headed roan long of leg vicious of eye thin shouldered and with hips that slanted sharply down No one with a knowledge of fine horse flesh could have looked on this brute without aversion It did not have even size in its favour A wild free spirit perhaps might be the reason but the animal stood with hanging head and pendant lower lip One eye was closed and the other only half opened A blind affection then made him go to this horse first of all No his greeting was to jerk his knee sharply into the ribs of the roan which answered with a grunt and swung its head around with bared teeth like an angry dog Damn your eyes roared the hoarse voice of Steve Nash stand still or I ll knock you for a goal The ears of the mustang flattened close to its neck and a devil of hate came up in its eyes but it stood quiet while Nash went about at a judicious distance and examined all the vital points The hoofs were sound the backbone prominent but not a high ridge from famine or much hard riding and the indomitable hate in the eyes of the mustang seemed to please the cowpuncher It was a struggle to bridle the beast which was accomplished only by grinding the points of his knuckles into a tender part of the jowl to make the locked teeth open In saddling the knee came into play again rapping the ribs of the brute repeatedly before the wind which swelled out the chest to false proportions was expelled in a sudden grunt and the cinch whipped up taut After that Nash dodged the flying heels chose his time and vaulted into the saddle The mustang trotted quietly out of the barn Perhaps he had had his fill of bucking on that treacherous slippery wooden floor but once outside he turned loose the full assortment of the cattle pony s tricks It was only ten minutes but while it lasted the cursing of Nash was loud and steady mixed with the crack of his murderous quirt against the roan s flanks The bucking ended as quickly as it had begun and they started at a long canter over the trail CHAPTER XII THE FIRST DAY 
1867_148436_000002_000000	train-clean-100	Mile after mile of the rough trail fell behind him and still the pony shambled along at a loose trot or a swinging canter the steep upgrades it took at a steady jog and where the slopes pitched sharply down it wound among the rocks with a faultless sureness of foot 
1867_148436_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Certainly the choice of Nash was well made 
none	none	An Eastern horse of blood over a level course could have covered the same distance in half the time but it would have broken down after ten miles of that hard trail Dawn came while they wound over the crest of the range and with the sun in their faces they took the downgrade It was well into the morning before Nash reached Logan He forced from his eye the contempt which all cattlemen feel for sheepherders I s pose you re here askin after Bard began Logan without the slightest prelude Bard 
1867_148436_000006_000001	train-clean-100	Who s he 
1867_148436_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Logan considered the other with a sardonic smile 
none	none	Maybe you been ridin all night jest for fun If you start usin your tongue on me Logan you ll wear out the snapper on it 
1867_148436_000009_000001	train-clean-100	I m on my way to the A Circle Y 
1867_148436_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 Listen I m all for old man Drew 
none	none	You know that 
1867_148436_000010_000002	train-clean-100	Tell me what Bard has on him 
1867_148436_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Never heard the name before 
1867_148436_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Did he rustle a couple of your sheep 
1867_148436_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Logan went on patiently I knew something was wrong when Drew was here yesterday but I didn t think it was as bad as this 
none	none	What did Drew do yesterday Came up as usual to potter around the old house I guess but when he heard about Bard bein here he changed his mind sudden and went home
1867_148436_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 That s damn queer 
none	none	What sort of a lookin feller is this Bard
1867_148436_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t suppose you know eh queried Logan ironically 
1867_148436_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t suppose the old man described him before you started maybe 
none	none	Logan you poor old hornless maverick d you think I m on somebody s trail Don t you know I ve been through with that sort of game for a hell of a while
1867_148436_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 When rocks turn into ham and eggs I ll trust you Steve 
1867_148436_000018_000001	train-clean-100	I ll tell you what I done to Bard anyway 
none	none	Yesterday after he found that Drew had been here and gone he seemed sort of upset tried to keep it from me but I m too much used to judgin changes of weather to be fooled by any tenderfoot that ever used school English Then he hinted around about learnin the way to Eldara because he knows that town is pretty close to Drew s place I guess 
1867_148436_000018_000004	train-clean-100	I told him sure I did 
none	none	He should of gone due west but I sent him south 
1867_148436_000018_000006	train-clean-100	There is a south trail only it takes about three days to get to Eldara 
1867_148436_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Maybe you think that interests me 
none	none	It don t Logan overlooked this rejoinder saying Is it his scalp you re after Your ideas are like nest eggs Logan an you set over em like a hen They look like eggs they feel like eggs but they don t never hatch That s the way with your ideas 
1867_148436_000021_000001	train-clean-100	They look all right they sound all right but they don t mean nothin 
none	none	So long But Logan merely chuckled wisely He had been long on the range As Nash turned his pony and trotted off in the direction of the A Circle Y ranch the sheepherder called after him What you say cuts both ways Steve This feller Bard looks like a tenderfoot he sounds like a tenderfoot but he ain t a tenderfoot Feeling that this parting shot gave him the honours of the meeting he turned away whistling with such spirit that one of his dogs overhearing stood still and gazed at his master with his head cocked wisely to one side His eastern course Nash pursued for a mile or more and then swung sharp to the south He was weary like his horse and he made no attempt to start a sudden burst of speed He let the pony go on at the same tireless jog clinging like a bulldog to the trail About midday he sighted a small house cuddled into a hollow of the hills and made toward it As he dismounted a tow headed spindling boy lounged out of the doorway and stood with his hands shoved carelessly into his little overall pockets
1867_148436_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Hello young feller 
1867_148436_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Lo stranger

none	none	Yep He led the pony to the shed unsaddled him and gave him a small feed The horse first rolled on the dirt floor and then started methodically on his fodder 
1867_148436_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Having made sure that his mount was not off his feed Nash rolled a cigarette and strolled back to the house with the boy 
1867_148436_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Where s the folks he asked 
1867_148436_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Ma s sick a little and didn t get up to day

1867_148436_000040_000000	train-clean-100	The boy flushed so red that by contrast his straw coloured hair seemed positively white 
1867_148436_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Maybe you want to pay me he suggested fiercely 
1867_148436_000041_000001	train-clean-100	 Maybe you think we re squatters that run a hotel 
none	none	Recognizing the true Western breed even in this small edition Nash grinned
1867_148436_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Speakin man to man son I didn t think that but I thought I d sort of feel my way 
none	none	Which I ll say you re lucky you didn t try to feel your way with pa not the way he s feelin now In the shack of the house he placed the best chair for Nash and set about frying ham and making coffee 
1867_148436_000045_000001	train-clean-100	This with crackers formed the meal He watched Nash eat for a moment of solemn silence and then the foreman looked up to catch a meditative chuckle from the youngster 
1867_148436_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Let me in on the joke son 
none	none	Nothin I was just thinkin of pa
1867_148436_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 What s he sore about 
1867_148436_000048_000001	train-clean-100	Come out short at poker lately 
1867_148436_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 No he lost a hoss 
none	none	Ha ha ha He explained He s lost his only standin joke and now the laugh s on pa 
1867_148436_000051_000000	train-clean-100	Nash sipped his coffee and waited 
1867_148436_000051_000001	train-clean-100	On the mountain desert one does not draw out a narrator with questions 
none	none	There was a feller come along early this mornin on a lame hoss the story began He was a sure enough tenderfoot leastways he looked it an he talked it but he wasn t The familiarity of this description made Steve sit up a trifle straighter Was he a ringer Maybe I dunno Pa meets him at the door and asks him in What d you think this feller comes back with 
1867_148436_000056_000000	train-clean-100	The boy paused to remember and then with twinkling eyes he mimicked That s very good of you sir but I ll only stop to make a trade with you this horse and some cash to boot for a durable mount out of your corral 
none	none	The brute has gone lame you see Pa waited and scratched his head while these here words sort of sunk in Then says very smooth I ll let you take the best hoss I ve got an I won t ask much cash to boot I begin wonderin what pa was drivin at but I didn t say nothin jest held myself together and waited Look over there to the corral says pa and pointed They s a hoss that ought to take you wherever you want to go 
1867_148436_000059_000002	train-clean-100	It s the best hoss I ve ever had 
1867_148436_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 It was the best horse pa ever had too 
none	none	It was a piebald pinto called Jo after my cousin Josiah who s jest a plain bad un and raises hell when there s any excuse The piebald he didn t even need an excuse You see he s one of them hosses that likes company When he leaves the corral he likes to have another hoss for a runnin mate and he was jest as tame as anything 
1867_148436_000060_000005	train-clean-100	I could ride him anybody could ride him 
none	none	But if you took him outside the bars of the corral without company first thing he done was to see if one of the other hosses was comin out to join him When he seen that he was all laid out to make a trip by himself he jest nacherally started in to raise hell Which Jo can raise more hell for his size than any hoss I ever seen
1867_148436_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 He s what you call an eddicated bucker 
1867_148436_000061_000001	train-clean-100	He don t fool around with no pauses 
none	none	He jest starts in and figgers out a situation and then he gets busy slidin the gent that s on him off n the saddle An he always used to win out 
1867_148436_000061_000004	train-clean-100	In fact he was known for it all around these parts 
none	none	He begun nice and easy but he worked up like a fiddler playin a favourite piece and the end was the rider lyin on the ground Whenever the boys around here wanted any excitement they used to come over and try their hands with Jo We used to keep a pile of arnica and stuff like that around to rub them up with and tame down the bruises after Jo laid em cold on the ground There wasn t never anybody could ride that hoss when he was started out alone Well this tenderfoot he looks over the hoss in the corral and says That s a pretty fine mount it seems to me 
1867_148436_000063_000001	train-clean-100	What do you want to boot 
none	none	Aw twenty five dollars is enough says pa
1867_148436_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 All right says the tenderfoot here s the money 
1867_148436_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 And he counts it out in pa s hand 
1867_148436_000067_000000	train-clean-100	 He says What a little beauty 
none	none	It would be a treat to see him work on a polo field Pa says It d be a treat to see this hoss work anywhere Then he steps on my foot to make me wipe the grin off n my face Down goes the tenderfoot and takes his saddle and flops it on the piebald pinto and the piebald was jest as nice as milk Then he leads him out n the corral and gets on First the pinto takes a look over his shoulder like he was waiting for one of his pals among the hosses to come along but he didn t see none Then the circus started An b lieve me it was some circus Jo hadn t had much action for some time an he must have used the wait thinkin up new ways of raisin hell There ain t enough words in the Bible to describe what he done 
1867_148436_000072_000001	train-clean-100	Which maybe you sort of gather that he had to keep on performin because the tenderfoot was still in the saddle 
none	none	He was An he never pulled leather No sir he never touched the buckin strap but jest sat there with his teeth set and his lips twistin back the same smile he had when he got into the saddle But pretty soon I s pose Jo had a chance to figure out that it didn t do him no particular harm to be alone
1867_148436_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 The minute he seen that he stopped fightin and started off at a gallop the way the tenderfoot wanted him to go which was over there 
none	none	Damn my eyes says pa an couldn t do nuthin but just stand there repeatin that with variations because with Jo gone there wouldn t be no drawin card to get the boys around the house no more 
1867_148436_000074_000001	train-clean-100	But you re lookin sort of sleepy stranger 
none	none	I am answered Nash Well if you d seen that show you wouldn t be thinkin of sleep Not for some time
1867_148436_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Maybe not but the point is I didn t see it 
1867_148436_000077_000001	train-clean-100	D you mind if I turn in on that bunk over there 
none	none	Help yourself said the boy
1867_148436_000078_000001	train-clean-100	 What time d you want me to wake you up 
1867_148436_000079_000000	train-clean-100	 Never mind I wake up automatic 
none	none	S long Bud 
1867_148436_000080_000000	train-clean-100	He stretched out on the blankets and was instantly asleep 
none	none	CHAPTER XIII A TOUCH OF CRIMSON At the end of three hours he awoke as sharply as though an alarm were clamouring at his ear There was no elaborate preparation for renewed activities A single yawn and stretch and he was again on his feet Since the boy was not in sight he cooked himself an enormous meal devoured it and went out to the mustang The roan greeted him with a volley from both heels that narrowly missed the head of Nash but the cowpuncher merely smiled tolerantly Feelin fit agin eh damn your soul he said genially and picking up a bit of board fallen from the side of the shed he smote the mustang mightily along the ribs The mustang as if it recognized the touch of the master pricked up one ear and side stepped The brief rest had filled it with all the old vicious energy For once more as soon as they rode clear of the door there ensued a furious struggle between man and beast The man won as always and the roan dropping both ears flat against its neck trotted sullenly out across the hills In that monotony of landscape one mile exactly like the other no landmarks to guide him no trail to follow however faintly worn it was strange to see the cowpuncher strike out through the vast distances of the mountain desert with as much confidence as if he were travelling on a paved street in a city He had not even a compass to direct him but he seemed to know his way as surely as the birds know the untracked paths of the air in the seasons of migration Straight on through the afternoon and during the long evening he kept his course at the same unvarying dog trot until the flush of the sunset faded to a stern grey and the purple hills in the distance turned blue with shadows Then catching the glimmer of a light on a hillside he turned toward it to put up for the night In answer to his call a big man with a lantern came to the door and raised his light until it shone on a red bald head and a portly figure His welcome was neither hearty nor cold hospitality is expected in the mountain desert So Nash put up his horse in the shed and came back to the house The meal was half over but two girls immediately set a plate heaped with fried potatoes and bacon and flanked by a mighty cup of jetblack coffee on one side and a pile of yellow biscuits on the other He nodded to them grunted by way of expressing thanks and sat down to eat Beside the tall father and the rosy faced mother the family consisted of the two girls one of them with her hair twisted severely close to her head wearing a man s blue cotton shirt with the sleeves rolled up to a pair of brown elbows Evidently she was the boy of the family and to her fell the duty of performing the innumerable chores of the ranch for her hands were thick with work and the tips of the fingers blunted Also she had that calm self satisfied eye which belongs to the workingman who knows that he has earned his meal Her sister monopolized all the beauty and the grace not that she was either very pretty or extremely graceful but she was instinct with the challenge of femininity like a rare scent It lingered about her it enveloped her ways it gave a light to her eyes and made her smile exquisite Her clothes were not of much finer material than her sister s but they were cut to fit and a bow of crimson ribbon at her throat was as effective in that environment as the most costly orchids on an evening gown She was armed in pride this night talking only to her mother and then in monosyllables alone At first it occurred to Steve that his coming had made her self conscious but he soon discovered that her pride was directed at the third man at the table She at least maintained a pretence of eating but he made not even a sham sitting miserably his mouth hard set his eyes shadowed by a tremendous frown At length he shoved back his chair with such violence that the table trembled Well he rumbled I guess this lets me out S long And he strode heavily from the room a moment later his cursing came back to them as he rode into the night Takes it kind of hard don t he said the father And the mother murmured Poor Ralph So you went an done it said the mannish girl to her sister What of it snapped the other He s too good for you that s what of it Girls exclaimed the mother anxiously Remember we got a guest Oh said she of the strong brown arms I guess we can t tell him nothin I guess he had eyes to be seein what s happened She turned calmly to Steve Lizzie turned down Ralph Boardman poor feller Sue cried the other girl Well after you done it are you ashamed to have it talked about You make me sore I ll tell a man That s enough Sue growled the father What s enough We ain t goin to have no more show about this I ve had my supper spoiled by it already I say it s a rotten shame broke out Sue and she repeated Ralph s too good for her All because of a city dude a tenderfoot In the extremity of her scorn her voice drawled in a harsh murmur Then take him yourself if you can get him cried Lizzie I m sure I don t want him Their eyes blazed at each other across the table and Lizzie having scored an unexpected point struck again I think you ve always had a sort of hankerin after Ralph oh I ve seen your eyes rollin at him The other girl coloured hotly through her tan If I was fond of him I wouldn t be ashamed to let him know you can tell the world that And I wouldn t keep him trottin about like a little pet dog till I got tired of him and give him up for the sake of a greenhorn who her voice lowered to a spiteful hiss kissed you the first time he even seen you In vain Lizzie fought for her control her lip trembled and her voice shook I hate you Sue Sue ain t you ashamed of yourself pleaded the mother No I ain t Think of it here s Ralph been sweet on Liz for two years an now she gives him the go by for a skinny affected dude like that feller that was here And he s forgot you already Liz the minute he stopped laughing at you for bein so easy Ma are you goin to let Sue talk like this right before a stranger Sue you shut up commanded the father I don t see nobody that can make me she said surly as a grown boy I can t make any more of a fool out of Liz than that tenderfoot made her Did he asked Steve ride a piebald mustang D you know him breathed Lizzie forgetting the tears of shame which had been gathering in her eyes Nope Jest heard a little about him along the road What s his name Then she coloured even before Sue could say spitefully Didn t he even have to tell you his name before he kissed you He did His name is Tony Tony in deep disgust Well he s dark enough to be a dago Maybe he s a foreign count or something Liz and he ll take you back to live in some castle or other But the girl queried in spite of this badinage Do you know his name His name said Nash thinking that it could do no harm to betray as much as this is Anthony Bard I think And you don t know him All I know is that the feller who used to own that piebald mustang is pretty mad and cusses every time he thinks of him He didn t steal the hoss This with more bated breath than if the question had been He didn t kill a man for indeed horse stealing was the greater crime Even Nash would not make such an accusation directly and therefore he fell back on an innuendo almost as deadly I dunno he said non committally and shrugged his shoulders With all his soul he was concentrating on the picture of the man who conquered a fighting horse and flirted successfully with a pretty girl the same day each time riding on swiftly from his conquest The clues on this trail were surely thick enough but they were of such a nature that the pleasant mind of Steve grew more and more thoughtful CHAPTER XIV LEMONADE In fact so thoughtful had Nash become that he slept with extraordinary lightness that night and was up at the first hint of day Sue appeared on the scene just in time to witness the last act of the usual drama of bucking on the part of the roan before it settled down to the mechanical dog trot with which it would wear out the ceaseless miles of the mountain desert all day and far into the night if need be Nash now swung more to the right cutting across the hills for he presumed that by this time the tenderfoot must have gotten his bearings and would head straight for Eldara It was a stiff two day journey now the whole first day s riding having been a worse than useless detour so the bulldog jaw set harder and harder and the keen eyes squinted as if to look into the dim future Once each day about noon when the heat made even the desert and the men of the desert drowsy he allowed his imagination to roam freely counting the thousand dollars over and over again and tasting again the joys of a double salary Yet even his hardy imagination rarely rose to the height of Sally Fortune That hour of dreaming however made the day of labour almost pleasant This time in the very middle of his dream he reached the cross roads saloon and general merchandise store of Flanders so he banished his visions with a compelling shrug of the shoulders and rode for it at a gallop a hot dryness growing in his throat at every stride Quick service he was sure to get for there were not more than half a dozen cattle ponies standing in front of the little building with its rickety walls guiltless of paint save for the one great sign inscribed with uncertain letters He swung from the saddle tossed the reins over the head of the mustang made a stride forward and then checked himself with a soft curse and reached for his gun For the door of the bar dashed open and down the steps rushed a tall man with light yellow moustache so long that it literally blew on either side over his shoulders as he ran in either hand he carried a revolver a two gun man fleeing perhaps from another murder For Nash recognized in him a character notorious through a thousand miles of the range Sandy Ferguson nicknamed by the colour of that famous moustache which was envied and dreaded so far and so wide It was not fear that made Nash halt for otherwise he would have finished the motion and whipped out his gun but at least it was something closely akin to fear For that matter there were unmistakable signs in Sandy himself of what would have been called arrant terror in any other man His face was so bloodless that the pallor showed even through the leathery tan one eye stared wildly the other being sheltered under a clumsy patch which could not quite conceal the ugly bruise beneath Under his great moustache his lips were as puffed and swollen as the lips of a negro Staggering in his haste he whirled a few paces from the house and turned his guns levelled At the same moment the door opened and the perspiring figure of little fat Flanders appeared Scorn and anger rather than hate or any bloodlust appeared in his face His right arm hanging loosely at his side held a revolver and he seemed to have the greatest unconcern for the levelled weapons of the gunman He made a gesture with that armed hand and Sandy winced as though a whiplash had flicked him Steady up damn your eyes bellowed Flanders and put them guns away Put em up hear me To the mortal astonishment of Nash Sandy obeyed keeping the while a fascinated eye upon the little Dutchman Now climb your hoss and beat it and if I ever find you in reach again I ll send my kid out to rope you and give you a hoss whippin The gun fighter lost no time A single leap carried him into his saddle and he was off over the sand with a sharp rattle of the beating hoofs Well breathed Nash I ll be hanged Sure you will suggested Flanders at once changing his frown for a smile of somewhat professional good nature as one who greeted an old customer sure you will unless you come in an have a drink on the house I want something myself to forget what I been doin I feel like the dog catcher Steve deeply meditative strode into the room Partner he said gravely to Flanders I ve always prided myself on having eyes a little better than the next one but just now I guess I must of been seein double Seemed to me that that was Sandy Ferguson that you hot footed out of that door or has Sandy got a double Nope said the bartender wiping the last of the perspiration from his forehead that s Sandy all right Then gimme a big drink I need it The bottle spun expertly across the bar and the glasses tinkled after Funny about him all right nodded Flanders but then it s happened the same way with others I could tell about As long as he was winnin Sandy was the king of any roost The minute he lost a fight he wasn t worth so many pounds of salt pork Take a hoss a fine hoss is often jest the same Long as it wins nothin can touch some of them blooded boys But let em go under the wire second maybe jest because they s packing twenty pounds too much weight and they re never any good any more Any second rater can lick em I lost five hundred iron boys on a hoss that laid down like that All of which means suggested Nash that Sandy has been licked Licked No he ain t been licked but he s been plumb annihilated washed off the map cleaned out faded rubbed into the dirt if there was some stronger way of puttin it I would Only last night at that but now look at him A girl that never seen a man before could tell that he wasn t any more dangerous now than if he was made of putty but if the fool keeps packin them guns he s sure to get into trouble He raised his glass So here s to the man that Sandy was and ain t no more They drank solemnly Maybe you took the fall out of him yourself Flanders Nope I ain t no fighter Steve You know that The feller that downed Sandy was a tenderfoot Yep a greenhorn Ah h h drawled Nash softly I thought so You did Anyway let s hear the story Another drink on me Flanders It was like this Along about evening of yesterday Sandy was in here with a couple of other boys He was pretty well lighted the glow was circulatin promiscuous in fact when in comes a feller about your height Steve but lighter Goodlookin thin face big dark eyes like a girl He carried the signs of a long ride on him Well sir he walks up to the bar and says Can you make me a very sour lemonade mister Bartender I grabbed the edge of the bar and hung tight A which says I Lemonade if you please I rolled an eye at Sandy who was standin there with his jaw falling and then I got busy with lemons and the squeezer but pretty soon Ferguson walks up to the stranger Are you English he asks I knew by his tone what was comin so I slid the gun I keep behind the bar closer and got prepared for a lot of damaged crockery I says the tenderfoot Why no What makes you ask Your damned funny way of talkin says Sandy Oh says the greenhorn nodding as if he was thinkin this over and discovering a little truth in it I suppose the way I talk is a little unusual A little rotten says Sandy Did I hear you askin for a lemonade You did Would I seem to be askin too many questions says Sandy terrible polite if I inquires if bar whisky ain t good enough for you The tenderfoot he stands there jest as easy as you an me stand here now and he laughed He says The bar whisky I ve tasted around this country is not very good for any one unless perhaps after a snake has bitten you Then it works on the principle of poison fight poison eh Sandy says after a minute I m the most quietest gentle innercent cowpuncher that ever rode the range but I d tell a man that it riles me to hear good bar whisky insulted like this Look at me Do I look as if whisky ain t good for a man Why says the tenderfoot you look sort of funny to me He said it as easy as if he was passin the morning with Ferguson but I seen that it was the last straw with Sandy He hefted out both guns and trained em on the greenhorn I yelled Sandy for God s sake don t be killin a tenderfoot If whisky will kill him he s goin to die says Sandy Flanders pour out a drink of rye for this gent I did it though my hand was shaking a lot and the chap takes the glass and raises it polite and looks at the colour of it I thought he was goin to drink and starts wipin the sweat off n my forehead But this chap he sets down the glass and smiles over to Sandy Listen he says still grinnin in the old days I suppose this would have been a pretty bluff but it won t work with me now You want me to drink this glass of very bad whisky but I m sure that you don t want it badly enough to shoot me There are many reasons In the old days a man shot down another and then rode off on his horse and was forgotten but in these days the telegraph is faster than any horse that was ever foaled They d be sure to get you sir though you might dodge them for a while And I believe that for a crime such as you threaten they have recently installed a little electric chair which is a perfectly good inducer of sleep in fact it is better than a cradle Taking these things all into consideration I take it for granted that you are bluffing my friend and one of my favourite occupations is calling a bluff You look dangerous but I ve an idea that you are as yellow as your moustache Sandy he sort of swelled up all over like a poisoned dog He says I begin to see your style You want a clean man handlin which suits me uncommon well With that he lays down his guns soft and careful and puts up his fists and goes for the other gent He makes his pass which should have sent the other gent into kingdom come But it didn t No sir the tenderfoot he seemed to evaporate He wasn t there when the fist of Ferguson come along Ferguson he checked up short and wheeled around and charged again like a bull And he missed again And so they kept on playin a sort of a game of tag over the place the stranger jest side steppin like a prize fighter the prettiest you ever seen and not developin when Sandy started on one of his swings At last one of Sandy s fists grazed him on the shoulder and sort of peeved him it looked like He ducks under Sandy s next punch steps in and wallops Sandy over the eye that punch didn t travel more n six inches But it slammed Sandy down in a corner like he s been shot He was too surprised to be much hurt though and drags himself up to his feet makin a pass at his pocket at the same time Then he came again silent and thinkin of blood I s pose with a knife in his hand This time the tenderfoot didn t wait He went in with a sort of hitch step like a dancer Ferguson s knife carved the air beside the tenderfoot s head and then the skinny boy jerked up his right and his left one two into Sandy s mouth Down he goes again slumps down as if all the bones in his body was busted right down on his face The other feller grabs his shoulder and jerks him over on his back He stands lookin down at him for a moment and then he says sort of thoughtful He isn t badly hurt but I suppose I shouldn t have hit him twice Can you beat that Steve You can t When Sandy come to he got up to his feet wobbling seen his guns went over and scooped em up with the eye of the tenderfoot on him all the time scooped em up stood with em all poised and so he backed out through the door It wasn t any pretty thing to see The tenderfoot he turned to the bar again If you don t mind he says I think I ll switch my order and take that whisky instead I seem to need it Son says I there ain t nothin in the house you can t have for the askin Try some of this And I pulled out a bottle of my private stock you know the stuff I ve had it twenty five years and it was ten years old when I got it That ain t as much of a lie as it sounds He takes a glass of it and sips it sort of suspicious like a wolf scentin the wind for an elk in winter Then his face lighted up like a lantern had been flashed on it You d of thought that he was lookin his long lost brother in the eye from the way he smiled at me He holds the glass up and lets the light come through it showin the little traces and bubbles of oil May I know your name he says It made me feel like Rockerbilt hearin him say that in that special voice Me says I I m Flanders It s an honour to know you mister Flanders he says My name is Anthony Bard We shook hands and his grip was three fourths man I ll tell the world Good liquor says he is like a fine lady Only a gentleman can appreciate it I drink to you sir So that s how Sandy Ferguson went under the sod To day Well I couldn t let Ferguson stand in a barroom where a gentleman had been could I CHAPTER XV THE DARKNESS IN ELDARA Even the stout roan grew weary during the third day and when they topped the last rise of hills and looked down to darker shadows in Eldara in the black heart of the hollow the mustang stood with hanging head and one ear flopped forward Cruel indeed had been the pace which Nash maintained yet they had never been able to overhaul the flying piebald of Anthony Bard As they trotted down the slope Nash looked to his equipment handled his revolver felt the strands of the lariat and resting only his toes in the stirrups eased all his muscles to make sure that they were uncramped from the long journey He was fit there was no doubt of that Coming down the main street for Eldara boasted no fewer than three thoroughfares the first houses which Nash passed showed no lights As far as he could see the blinds were all drawn not even the glimmer of a candle showed and the voices which he heard were muffled and low He thought of plague or some other disaster which might have overtaken the little village and wiped out nine tenths of the populace in a day Only such a thing could account for silence in Eldara There should have been bursts and roars of laughter here and there and now and then a harsh stream of cursing There should have been clatter of kitchen tins there should have been neighing of horses there should have been the quiver and tingle of children s voices at play in the dusty streets But there was none of this The silence was as thick and oppressive as the unbroken dark of the night Even Butler s saloon was closed This however was something which he would not believe no matter what testimony his eyes gave him He rode up to a shuttered window and kicked it with his heel Only the echoes of that racket replied to him from the interior of the place He swore somewhat touched with awe and kicked again A faint voice called Who s there Steve Nash What the devil s happened to Eldara The boards of the shutter stirred opened so that the man within could look out Is it Steve honest Damn it Butler don t you know my voice What s turned Eldara into a cemetery Cemetery s right Butch Conklin and his gang are going to raid the place to night Butch Conklin And Nash whistled long and low But why the devil don t the boys get together if they know Butch is coming with his gunmen That s what they ve done Every able bodied man in town is out in the hills trying to surprise Conklin s gang before they hit town with their guns going Butler was a one legged man so Nash kept back the question which naturally formed in his mind How do they know Conklin is coming Who gave the tip Conklin himself What Has he been in town Right Came in roaring drunk Why d they let him get away again Because the sheriff s a bonehead and because our marshal is solid ivory That s why What happened Butch came in drunk as I was saying which he generally is but he wasn t giving no trouble at all and nobody felt particular called on to cross him and ask questions He was real sociable in fact and that s how the mess was started Go on I don t get your drift Everybody was treatin Butch like he was the king of the earth and not passin out any backtalk all except one tenderfoot But here a stream of tremendous profanity burst from Nash It rose it rushed on it seemed an exhaustless vocabulary built up by long practice on mustangs and cattle At length Is that damned fool in Eldara D you know him No Anyway go on What happened I was sayin that Butch was feelin pretty sociable It went all right in the bars He was in here and didn t do nothin wrong Even paid for all the drinks for everybody in the house which nobody could ask more even from a white man But then Butch got hungry and went up the street to Sally Fortune s place A snarl came from Nash Did they let that swine go in there Who d stop him Would you I d try my damnedest Anyway in he went and got the centre table and called for ten dollars worth of bacon and eggs which there hasn t been an egg in Eldara this week Sally she told him not being afraid even of Butch He got pretty sore at that and said that it was a frame up and everyone was ag in him But finally he allowed that if she d sit down to the table and keep him company he d manage to make out on whatever her cook had ready to eat And Sally done it groaned Nash Sure it was like a dare and you know Sally She d risk her whole place any time for the sake of a bet I know it but don t rub it in She fetched out a steak and served Butch as if he d been a king and then sat down beside him and started kiddin him along with all the gang of us sittin or standin around and laughin fit to bust but not loud for fear Butch would get annoyed Then two things come in together and spoiled the prettiest little party that was ever started in Eldara First was that player piano which Sally got shipped in and paid God knows how much for the second was this greenhorn I was tellin you about Go on said Nash the little snarl coming back in his voice Tell me how the tenderfoot walked up and kicked Butch out of the place Somebody been tellin you No I just been readin the mind of Eldara It was a nice play though This Bard we found out later that was his name walks in takes a table and not being served none too quick he walks over and slips a nickel in the slot of the piano Out she starts with a piece of rippin ragtime you know how loud it plays Butch he kept on talkin for a minute but couldn t hear himself think Finally he bellers Who turned that damned tin pan loose This Bard walks up and bows He says Sir I came here to find food and since I can t get service I ll take music as a substitute Them was the words he used Steve honest to God Used them to Butch Well Conklin was too flabbergasted to budge and Bard he leaned over and says to Sally This floor is fairly smooth Suppose you and I dance till I get a chance to eat We didn t know whether to laugh or to cheer but most of us compromised by keeping an eye on Butch s gun Sally says Sure I ll dance and gets up Wait hollers Butch are you leavin me for this wall eyed galoot There ain t nothin Sally loves more n a fight we all know that But this time I guess she took pity on the poor tenderfoot or maybe she jest didn t want to get her floor all messed up Keep your hat on Butch she says all I want to do is to give him some motherly advice If you re acting that part says Bard calm as you please I ve got to tell mother that she s been keeping some pretty bad company Some what bellers Butch not believin his ears And young Bard he steps around the girl and stands over Butch Bad company is what I said he repeats but maybe I can be convinced Easy says Butch and reaches for his gun We all dived for the door but me being held up on account of my missing leg I was slow an couldn t help seein what happened Butch was fast but the young feller was faster He had Butch by the wrist before the gun came clear just gave a little twist and there he stood with the gun in his hand pointin into Butch s face and Butch sittin there like a feller in a trance or wakin up out of a bad dream Then he gets up slow and dignified though he had enough liquor in him to float a ship I been mobbed he says it s easy to see that I come here peaceful and quiet and here I been mobbed But I m comin back boys and I ain t comin alone There was our chance to get him while he was walking out of that place without a gun but somehow nobody moved for him He didn t look none too easy even without his shootin irons Out he goes into the night and we stood around starin at each other Everybody was upset except Sally and Bard He says Miss Fortune this is our dance I think Excuse me says Sally I almost forgot about it And they started to dance to the piano waltzin around among the tables the rest of us lit out for home because we knew that Butch would be on his way with his gang before we got very far under cover But hey Steve where you goin I m going to get in on that dance called Nash and was gone at a racing gallop down the street CHAPTER XVI BLUFF He found no dance in progress however but in the otherwise empty eating place which Sally owned and ran with her two capable hands and the assistance of a cook sat Sally herself dining at the same table with the tenderfoot the flirt the horse breaker the tamer of gun fighters Nash stood in the shadow of the doorway watching that lean handsome face with the suggestion of mockery in the eyes and the trace of sternness around the thin lips Not a formidable figure by any means but since his experiences of the past few days Nash was grown extremely thoughtful What he finally thought he caught in this most unusual tenderfoot was a certain alertness of a more or less hair trigger variety Even now as he sat at ease at the table one elbow resting lightly upon it apparently enwrapped in the converse of Sally Fortune Nash had a consciousness that the other might be on his feet and in the most distant part of the room within a second What he noted in the second instant of his observation was that Sally was not at all loath to waste her time on the stranger She was eating with a truly formidable conventionality of manner and a certain grace with which she raised the ponderous coffee cup made of crockery guaranteed to resist all falls struck awe through the heart of the cowpuncher She was bent on another conquest beyond all doubt and that she would not make it never entered the thoughts of Nash He set his face to banish a natural scowl and advanced with a good natured smile into the room Hello he called It s old Steve sang out Sally and whirling from her chair she advanced almost at a run to meet him caught him by both hands and led him to a table next to that at which she had been sitting It was as gracefully done as if she had been welcoming a brother but Nash knowing Sally understood perfectly that it was only a play to impress the eye of Bard Nevertheless he was forced to accept it in good part My old pal Steve Nash said Sally and this is mister Anthony Bard Just the faintest accent fell on the mister but it made Steve wince He rose and shook hands gravely with the tenderfoot I stopped at Butler s place down the street he said and been hearin a pile about a little play you made a while ago It was about time for somebody to call old Butch s bluff Bluff cried Sally indignantly Bluff queried Bard with a slight raising of the eyebrows Sure bluff Butch wasn t any more dangerous than a cat with trimmed claws But I guess you seen that He settled down easily in his chair just as Sally resumed her place opposite Bard Steve she said with a quiet venom that bluff of his has been as good as four of a kind with you for a long time I never seen you make any play at Butch He returned amiably Like to sit here and have a nice social chat Sally but I got to be gettin back to the ranch and in the meantime I m sure hungry At the reminder of business a green light came in the fine blue eyes of Sally They were her only really fine features for the nose tilted an engaging trifle the mouth was a little too generous the chin so strong that it gave in moments of passivity an air of sternness to her face That sternness was exaggerated as she rose keeping her glare fixed upon Nash a thing impossible for him to bear so he lowered his eyes and engaged in rolling a cigarette She turned back toward Bard Sorry I got to go before I finished eating but business is business And sometimes suggested Bard a bore It was an excellent opening for a quarrel but Nash was remembering religiously a certain thousand dollars and also a gesture of William Drew when he seemed to be breaking an imaginary twig So he merely lighted his cigarette and seemed to have heard nothing The whole town he remarked casually seems scared stiff by this Butch but of course he ain t comin back to night I suppose said the tenderfoot after a cold pause that he will not But the coldness reacted like the most genial warmth upon Nash He had chosen a part detestable to him but necessary to his business He must be a gabber for the nonce a free talker a chatterer who would cover up all pauses Kind of strange to ride into a dark town like this he began but I could tell you a story about Oh Steve called the voice of Sally from the kitchen He rose and nodded to Bard Scuse me I ll be back in a minute Thanks answered the other with a somewhat grim emphasis In the kitchen Sally spoke without prelude What deviltry are you up to now Steve Me he repeated with eyes widened by innocence What d you mean Sally Don t four flush me Steve Is eating in your place deviltry Am I blind she answered hotly Have I got spring halt maybe You re too polite Steve I can always tell when you re on the way to a little bell of your own making by the way you get sort of kind and warmed up What is it now Kiss me Sally and I ll tell you why I came to town She said with a touch of colour I ll see you and then changing quickly she slipped inside his ready arms with a smile and tilted up her face Now what is it Steve This he answered What d you mean You know me Sally I ve worn out the other ways of raising hell so I thought I d start a little by coming to Eldara to kiss you Her open hand cracked sharply twice on his lean face and she was out of his arms He followed laughing but she armed herself with a red hot frying pan and defied him You ain t even a good sport Steve I m done with you Kiss you He said calmly I see the hell is startin all right But she changed at once and smiled up to him I can t stay mad at you Steve I s pose it s because of your nerve I want you to do something for me What Is that a way to take it I ve asked you a favour Steve He said suspiciously It s got something to do with the tenderfoot in the room out there It was a palpable hit for she coloured sharply Then she took the bull by the horns What if it is Sally d you mean to say you ve fallen for that cheap line of lingo he passes out Steve don t try to kid me Why you know who he is don t you Sure Anthony Bard And do you know who Anthony Bard is Well she asked with some anxiety Well if you don t know you can find out That s what the last girl done She wavered and then blinked her eyes as if she were resolved to shut out the truth I asked you to do me a favour Steve And I will You know that I want you to see that Bard gets safe out of this town Sure Nothing I d rather do She tilted her head a little to one side and regarded him wistfully Are you double crossin me Steve Why d you suspect me Haven t I said I d do it But you said it too easy The gentleness died in her face She said sternly If you do double cross me you ll find I m about as hard as any man on the range Get me Shake Their hands met After all he did not guarantee what would happen to the tenderfoot after they were clear of the town But perhaps this was a distinction a little too fine for the downright mind of the girl A sea of troubles besieged the mind of Nash And to let that sea subside he wandered back to the eating room and found the tenderfoot finishing his coffee The latter kept an eye of frank suspicion upon him So the silence held for a brooding moment until Bard asked D you know the way to the ranch of William Drew It was a puzzler to Nash Was not that his job to go out and bring the man to Drew s place Here he was already on the way He remembered just in time that the manner of bringing was decidedly qualified He said aloud The way Sure I work on Drew s place Really Yep foreman You don t happen to be going back that way to night Not all the way part of it Mind if I went along Nobody to keep you from it said the cowpuncher without enthusiasm By the way what sort of a man is Drew Don t you know him No The reason I want to see him is because I want to get the right to do some er fishing and hunting on a place of his on the other side of the range The place with the old house on it the place Logan is Exactly Also I wish to see Logan again I ve got several little things I d like to have him explain H m grunted Nash without apparent interest And Drew He s a big feller big and grey Ah h h said the other and drew in his breath as though he were drinking It seemed to Nash that he had never seen such an unpleasant smile You ll get what you want out of Drew He s generous I hope so nodded the other with far off eyes I ve got a lot to ask of him CHAPTER XVII BUTCH RETURNS He reminded Nash of some big puma cub warming itself at a hearth like a common tabby cat a tame puma thrusting out its claws and turning its yellow eyes up to its owner tame but with infinite possibilities of danger For the information which Nash had given seemed to remove all his distrust of the moment before and he became instantly genial pleasant In fact he voiced this sentiment with a disarming frankness immediately Perhaps I ve seemed to be carrying a chip on my shoulder mister Nash You see I m not long in the West and the people I ve met seem to be ready to fight first and ask questions afterward So I ve caught the habit I suppose Which a habit like that ain t uncommon The graveyards are full of fellers that had that habit and they re going to be fuller still of the same kind Here Sally entered carrying the meal of the cowpuncher arranged it and then sat on the edge of Bard s table turning from one to the other as a bird on a spray of leaves turns from sunlight to shadow and cannot make a choice Bard stated Nash is going out to the ranch with me to night Long ride for to night isn t it Yes but we ll bunk on the way and finish up early in the morning Then you ll have a chance to teach him Western manners on the way Steve Manners queried the Easterner smiling up to the girl She turned caught him beneath the chin with one hand tilting his face and raised the lessoning forefinger of the other while she stared down at him with a half frown and a half smile like a schoolteacher about to discipline a recalcitrant boy Western manners she said mean first not to doubt a man till he tries to double cross you and not to trust him till he saves your life to keep your gun inside the leather till you re backed up against the wall and then to start shootin as soon as the muzzle is past the holster Then the thing to remember is that the fast shootin is fine but sure shootin is a lot better D you get me That s a fine sermon smiled Bard but you re too young to make a convincing preacher Miss Fortune Misfortune said the girl quickly don t have to be old to do a lot of teachin She sat back and regarded him with something of a frown and with folded arms He said with a sudden earnestness You seem to take it for granted that I m due for a lot of trouble But she shook her head gloomily I know what you re due for I can see it in your eyes I can hear it in your way of talkin If you was to ride the range with a sheriff on one side of you and a marshal on the other you couldn t help fallin into trouble As a fortune teller remarked Nash you d make a good undertaker Sally Shut up Steve I ve seen this bird in action and I know what I m talking about When you coming back this way Bard He said thoughtfully Perhaps to morrow night perhaps It ought to be to morrow night she said pointedly her eyes on Nash The latter had pushed his chair back a trifle and sat now with downward head and his right hand resting lightly on his thigh Only the place in which they sat was illumined by the two lamps and the forward part of the room nearer the street was a sea of shadows wavering when the wind stirred the flame in one of the lamps or sent it smoking up the chimney Sally and Bard sat with their backs to the door and Nash half facing it Steve she said with a sudden low tenseness of voice that sent a chill up Bard s spinal cord Steve what s wrong This answered the cowboy calmly and whirling in his chair his gun flashed and exploded They sprang up in time to see the bulky form of Butch Conklin rise out of the shadows in the front part of the room with outstretched arms from one of which a revolver dropped clattering to the floor Backward he reeled as though a hand were pulling him from behind and then measured his length with a crash on the floor Bard standing erect quite forgot to touch his weapon but Sally had produced a ponderous forty five with mysterious speed and now crouched behind a table with the gun poised Nash bending low ran forward to the fallen man Nicked but not done for he called Thank God cried Sally and the two joined Nash about the prostrate body That bullet had had very certain intentions but by a freak of chance it had been deflected on the angle of the skull and merely ploughed a bloody furrow through the mat of hair from forehead to the back of the skull He was stunned but hardly more seriously hurt than if he had been knocked down by a club I ve an idea said the Easterner calmly that I owe my life to you mister Nash Let that drop answered the other A quarter of an inch lower said the girl who was examining the wound and Butch would have kissed the world good bye Not till then did the full horror of the thing dawn on Bard The girl was no more excited than one of her Eastern cousins would have been over a game of bridge and the man in the most matter of fact manner was slipping another cartridge into the cylinder of the revolver which he then restored to the holster It still seemed incredible that the man could have drawn his gun and fired it in that flash of time He recalled his adventure with Butch earlier that evening and with Sandy Ferguson before for the first time he realized what he had done and a cold horror possessed him like the man who has nerves to walk the tight rope across the chasm and faints when he looks back on the gorge from the safety of the other side The girl took command Steve run down to the marshal s office Deputy Glendin is there She took the wet cloth and made a deft bandage for the head of Conklin With his shaggy hair covered and all his face sagging with lines of weariness the gun fighter seemed no more than a middle aged man asleep worn out by trouble Is there a doctor asked Bard anxiously That ain t a case for a doctor look here you re in a blue faint What is the matter I don t know I m thinking of that quarter of an inch which would have meant the difference to poor Conklin Poor Conklin Why you fish he was sneakin in here to try his hand on you He found out he couldn t get his gang into town so he slipped in by himself He ll get ten years for this and a thousand if they hold him up for the other things he s done I know and this fellow Nash was as quiet as the strike of a snake If he d been a fraction of a second slower I might be where Conklin is now I ll never forget Nash for this She said pointedly No he s a bad one to forget keep an eye on him You spoke of a snake that s how smooth Steve is Remember your own motto Miss Fortune He saved my life therefore I must trust him She answered sullenly You re your own boss What s wrong with Nash Find out for yourself Are all these fellows something other than they seem What about yourself How do you mean that What trail are you on Bard Don t look so innocent Oh I seen you was after something a long time ago I am After excitement you know Ain t you finding enough I ve got two things ahead of me Well This trip and when I come back I think making love to you would be more exciting than gun plays They regarded each other with bantering smiles A tenderfoot like you make love to me That would be exciting all right if it wasn t so funny As for the competition he said serenely that would be simply a good background Hate yourself don t you Bard she grinned The rest of these boys are all very well but they don t see that what you want is the velvet touch What s that She was as frankly curious as some boy hearing a new game described You ve only been loved in one way These rough handed fellows come in and throw an arm around you and ask you to marry them isn t that it What you really need is an old simple but very effective method Though her eyes were shining she yawned It don t interest me Bard On the contrary you re getting quite excited So does a horse before it gets ready to buck Exactly If I thought it would be easy I wouldn t be tempted Well if you like fighting you ve sure mapped out a nice sizeable quarrel with me Bud Good I m certainly coming back to Eldara Now about this method of mine Throwing your cards on the table eh What you got Bard a royal flush Right again It s a very simple method but you couldn t beat it Bud you ain t half old enough to kid me What you need he persisted calmly is someone who would sit down and simply talk good plain English to you Let er go In the first place I will call attention to your method of dressing Anything wrong with it I knew you d be interested She slipped into a chair and sat cross legged in it her elbows on her knees and her chin cupped in both her hands Sure I m interested If there s a new way fixin ham and serve it out I would begin he went on judiciously by saying that you dressed in five minutes in the dark It s generally dark at five a m she admitted You look on the whole as if you d fallen into your clothes The wounded man stirred and groaned faintly She called Lie down Butch I m busy Go on Bard If you keep a mirror it s a wall decoration not for personal use Maybe this is an old method Bard but around this place it d be a quick way of gettin shot Angry You d peeve a mule This was only an introduction The next thing is to sit close beside you and shift the lamp so that the light would shine on your face then take your hand He suited his action to his word Let go my hand Bard It s like the rest of me not a decoration but for use Afraid of me Sally Not of a regiment like you Then of my method Go on I m game But this is all there is to it What d you mean Just what I say Having observed that you haven t set off any of your advantages I will sit here and look into your face in silence which is as much as to say that no matter how you dress you can t spoil a very excellent figure Sally I suppose you ve heard that before Lots of times she muttered But you wouldn t hear it from me All I would do would be to sit and stare and let you imagine what I m thinking And you d begin to see that in spite of the way you do your hair you can t spoil its colour nor its texture He raised his other hand and touched it Like silk Sally He studied her closely noting the flush which began to touch her cheeks Part of the game is for you to keep looking me in the eye Well I ll be Go on I m game Is it hard to sit like this silently Do I do it badly No you show lots of practice How many have you tried this method on Bard He made a vague gesture and then smiling Millions Sally and they all liked it So do I And they laughed together and grew serious at the same instant All silence like this she queried No after a while I would say You are beautiful You don t get a blue ribbon for that Bard Not for the words but the way they re said which shows I mean them She blinked as though to clear her eyes and then met his stare again You know you are beautiful Sally With a pug nose freckles and all that Just a tip tilt in the nose Sally Why it s charming And you have everything else young strong graceful clear What d you mean by that Clear Fresh and colourful like the sunset over the desert Do you understand Her eyes went down to consider I s pose I do With a touch of awe in it because the silence and the night are coming and the stars walk down one by one one by one And the wind is low soft musical whispering as you do now What if this were not a game of suppose Sally She wrenched herself suddenly away rising I m tired of supposing she cried Then we ll call it all real What of that That colour was unmistakably high now it ran down from her cheeks and even stained the pure white of the throat where the flap of the shirt was open He was excited as a hunter who has tracked some new and dangerous animal and at last driven it to bay holding his gun poised and not knowing whether or not it will prove vulnerable He stepped close eager prepared for any wild burst of temper but she let him take her hands let him draw her close bend back her head hold her closer still till the warmth and softness of her body reached him but when his lips came close she said quietly Are you a rotter Bard He stiffened and the smile went out on his lips He stepped back She repeated Are you a rotter He raised the one hand which he still retained and touched it to his lips I am very sorry said Anthony will you forgive me And with her eyes large and grave upon him she answered I wonder if I can Butch Conklin looked up raising his bandaged head slowly like a white flag of truce with a stain of red growing through the cloth He stared at the two raised a hand to his head as though to rub away the dream found a pain too real for a dream and then like a crab which has grown almost too old to walk waddled on hands and knees slowly from the room and melted silently into the dark beyond CHAPTER XVIII FOOLISH HABITS A sharp noise of running feet leaped from the dust of the street and clattered through the doorway the two turned A swarthy man broad of shoulder was the first and afterward appeared Nash Conklin called Deputy Glendin and swept the room with his startled glance Where s Conklin He was not there only a red stain remained on the floor to show where he had lain Where s Conklin called Nash I m afraid whispered Bard quickly to the girl that it was more than a game of suppose He said easily to the other two He had enough His share of trouble came to night I let him go Young feller growled Glendin you ain t been in town a long while but I ve heard a pile too much about you already What you mean by takin the law into your own hands Wait said Nash his keen eyes on the two I guess I understand Let s have it then Still the steady eyes of Nash passed from Sally Fortune to Bard and back again This feller bein a tenderfoot he don t understand our ways maybe he thinks the range is a bit freer than it is That s the trouble answered Glendin he thinks too damned much And does quite a pile besides thinkin murmured Nash but too low for the others to hear it He hesitated and then as if making up his mind by a great effort There ain t no use blamin him better let it drop Glendin Nothin else to do Steve but it s funny Sally let him do it It is said Nash with emphasis but then women is pretty funny in lots of ways Ready to start Bard All ready S long Sally Good night Miss Fortune Evenin boys We ll be lookin for you back in Eldara to morrow night Bard And her eyes fixed with meaning on Nash Certainly answered the other my business ought not to take longer than that I ll take him by the shortest cut said Nash and the two went out to their horses They had difficulty in riding the trail side by side for though the roan was somewhat rested by the delay at Eldara it was impossible to keep him up with Bard s prancing piebald which sidestepped at every shadow Yet the tenderfoot never allowed his mount to pass entirely ahead of the roan but kept checking him back hard turning toward Nash with an apology each time he surged ahead It might have been merely that he did not wish to precede the cowpuncher on a trail which he did not know It might have been something quite other than this which made him consistently keep to the rear Nash felt certain that the second possibility was the truth In that case his work would be doubly hard From all that he had seen the man was dangerous the image of the tame puma returned to him again and again He could not see him plainly through the dark of the night but he caught the sway of the body and recognized a perfect horsemanship not a Western style of riding but a good one no matter where it was learned He rode as if he were sewed to the back of the horse and as old William Drew had suggested he probably did other things up to the same standard It would have been hard to fulfil his promise to Drew under any circumstances with such a man as this but with Bard apparently forewarned and suspicious the thing became almost impossible Almost but not entirely so He set himself calmly to the problem on the horn of his saddle the lariat hung loose if the Easterner should turn his back for a single instant during all the time they were together old Drew should not be disappointed and one thousand cash would be deposited for the mutual interest of Sally Fortune and himself That is to say if Sally would consent to become interested To the silent persuasion of money however Nash trusted many things The roan jogged sullenly ahead giving all the strength of his gallant ugly body to the work the piebald mustang pranced like a dancing master beside and behind with a continual jingling of the tossed bridle The masters were to a degree like the horses they rode for Nash kept steadily leaning to the front his bulldog jaw thrusting out and Bard was forever shifting in the saddle settling his hat humming a tune whistling talking to the piebald or asking idle questions of the things they passed like a boy starting out for a vacation So they reached the old house of which Nash had spoken a mere shapeless black heap huddling through the night In the shed to the rear they tied the horses and unsaddled In the single room of the shanty afterward Nash lighted a candle which he produced from his pack placed it in the centre of the floor and they unrolled their blankets on the two bunks which were built against the wall on either side of the narrow apartment Truly it was a crazy shack such a building as two men having the materials at hand might put together in a single day It was hardly based on a foundation but rather set on the slope side of the hill and accordingly had settled down on the lower side toward the door Not an old place but the wind had pried and the rain warped generous cracks between the boards through which the rising storm whistled and sang and through which the chill mist of the coming rain cut at them Now and then a feeling came to Anthony that the gale might lift the tottering old shack and roll it on down the hillside to the floor of the valley for it rocked and swayed under the breath of the storm In a way it was as if the night was giving a loud voice to the silent struggle of the two men who continued pleasant careless with each other But when Nash stepped across the room behind Bard the latter turned and was busy with the folding of his blankets at the foot of his bunk his face toward the cowpuncher and when Bard slipping off his belt fumbled at his holster Nash was instantly busy with the cleaning of his own gun The cattleman having removed his boots his hat and his belt was ready for bed and slipped his legs under the blankets He stooped and picked up his lariat which lay coiled on the floor beside him People gets into foolish habits on the range he said thumbing the strong rope curiously and so doing spreading out the noose Yes smiled Bard and he also sat up in his bunk It s like a kid Give him a new toy and he wants to take it to bed with him Ever notice Surely That s the way with me When I go to bed nothin matters with me except that I have my lariat around I generally like to have it hangin on a nail at the head of my bunk The fellers always laugh at me but I can t help it makes me feel more at home And with that still smiling at his own folly in a rather shamefaced way he turned in the blankets and dropped the big coil of the lariat over a nail which projected from the boards just over the head of his bunk The noose was outermost and could be disengaged from the nail by a single twist of the cowpuncher s hand as he lay passive in the bunk On this noose Bard cast a curious eye To cityfolk a piece of rope is a harmless thing with which one may make a trunk secure or on occasion construct a clothes line on the roof of the apartment building or in the kitchen on rainy Mondays To a sailor the rope is nothing and everything at once Give a seaman even a piece of string and he will amuse himself all evening making lashings and knots A piece of rope calls up in his mind the stout lines which hold the masts steady and the yards true in the gale the comfortable cable which moors the ship at the end of the dreary voyage and a thousand things between To the Westerner a rope is a different thing It is not so much a useful material as a weapon An Italian fighting man to man would choose a knife a Westerner would take in preference that same harmless piece of rope In his hands it takes on life it gains a strange and sinister quality One instant it lies passive or slowly whirled in a careless circle the next its noose darts out like the head of a striking cobra the coil falls and fastens and then it draws tighter and tighter remorselessly as a boa constrictor paralyzing life Something of all this went through the mind of Bard as he lay watching the limp noose of the cowboy s lariat and then he nodded smiling I suppose that seems an odd habit to some men but I sympathize with it I have it myself in fact And whenever I m out in the wilds and carry a gun I like to have it under my head when I sleep That s even queerer than your fancy isn t it And he slipped his revolver under the blankets at the head of his bunk CHAPTER XIX THE CANDLE Yes said Nash that s a queer stunt because when you re lyin like that with your head right over the gun and the blankets in between it d take you a couple of seconds to get it out Not when you re used to it You d be surprised to see how quickly a man can get the gun out from under That so Yes and shooting while you re lying on your back is pretty easy too when you ve had practice Sure with a rifle but not with a revolver Well do you see that bit of paper in the corner there up on the rafter Yes The hand of Bard whipped under his head there was a gleam and whirl of steel an explosion and the bit of paper came fluttering slowly down from the rafter like a wounded bird struggling to keep upon the air A draft caught the paper just before it landed and whirled it through the doorless entrance and out into the night He was yawning as he restored the gun beneath the blanket but from the corner of his eye he saw the hardening of Nash s face a brief change which came and went like the passing of a shadow That s something I ll remember drawled the cowpuncher You ought to answered the other quickly it comes in handy now and then Feel sleepy The candle guttered and flickered on the floor midway between the two bunks and Bard glancing to it was about to move from his bed and snuff it but at the thought of so doing it seemed to him as if he could almost sense with prophetic mind the upward dart of the noose about his shoulders He edged a little lower in the blankets Not a bit How about you Me I most generally lie awake a while and gab after I hit the hay Makes me sleep better afterward I do the same thing when I ve any one who listens to me or talks to me Queer how many habits we got the same eh It is But after all most of us are more alike than we care to imagine Yes there ain t much difference sometimes the difference ain t as much as a split second watch would catch but it may mean that one feller passes out and the other goes on They lay half facing each other each with his head pillowed on an arm By Jove lucky we reached this shelter before the rain came Yep A couple of hours of this and the rivers will be up may take up all day to get back to the ranch if we have to ride up to the ford on the Saverack Then we ll swim em The other smiled drily Swim the Saverack when she s up No lad we won t do that Then I ll have to work it alone I suppose You see I have that date in Eldara for tomorrow night Nash set his teeth to choke back the cough He produced papers and tobacco rolled a cigarette with lightning speed lighted it and inhaled a long puff Sure you ought to keep that date but maybe Sally would wait till the night after She impressed me on the whole as not being of the waiting kind H m A little delay does em good gives em a chance to think Why every man has his own way with women I suppose but my idea is keep them busy never give them a chance to think If you do they generally waste the chance and forget you altogether Another coughing spell overtook Nash and left him frowning down at the glowing end of his butt She ain t like the rest I wonder mused the Easterner He had an infinite advantage in this duel of words for he could watch from under the shadow of his long dark lashes the effect of his speeches on the cowboy yet never seem to be looking For he was wondering whether the enmity of Nash which he felt as one feels an unknown eye upon him in the dark came from their rivalry about the girl or from some deeper cause He was inclined to think that the girl was the bottom of everything but he left his mind open on the subject And Nash pondering darkly and silently measured the strength of the slender stranger and felt that if he were the club the other was the knife which made less sound but might prove more deadly Above all he was conscious of the Easterner s superiority of language which might turn the balance against him in the ear of Sally Fortune He dropped the subject of the girl You was huntin over on the old place on the other side of the range Yes Pretty fair run of game Rather I think you said something about Logan Did I I ve been thinking a good deal about him He gave me the wrong tip about the way to Eldara When I get back to the old place Well The other smiled unpleasantly and made a gesture as if he were snapping a twig between his hands I ll break him in two The eyes of Nash grew wide with astonishment he was remembering that same phrase on the lips of the big grey man Drew He murmured That may give you a little trouble Logan s a peaceable chap but he has his record before he got down as low as sheepherdin I like trouble now and then A pause Odd old shack over there Drew s old house Yes There s a grave in front of it And there s quite a yarn inside the grave The cowpuncher was aware that the other stirred not much but as if he winced from a drop of cold water he felt that he was close on the trail of the real reason why the Easterner wished to see Drew A story about Drew s wife You read the writing on the headstone eh Joan she chose this place for rest quoted Bard That was all before my time it was before the time of any others in these parts but a few of the grey beards know a bit about the story and I ve gathered a little of it from Drew though he ain t much of a talker I d like to hear it Sensitively aware of Bard as a photographic plate is aware of light on exposures the cowpuncher went on with the tale And Bard his glance probing among the shadowy rafters of the room seemed to be searching there for the secret on whose trail he rode Through the interims the rain crashed and volleyed on the roof above them the cold spray whipped down on them through the cracks the wind shook and rattled the crazy house and the drawling voice of Nash went on and on CHAPTER XX JOAN Them were the days when this was a man s country which a man could climb on his hoss with a gun and a rope and touch heaven and hell in one day s ridin Them good old days ain t no more I ve heard the old man tell about em Now they ve got everybody stamped and branded with law an order herded together like cattle ticketed done for That s the way the range is now The marshals have us by the throat In the old days a sheriff that outlived his term was probably crooked and runnin hand in hand with the long riders Long riders queried Bard Fellers that got tired of workin and took to ridin for their livin Mostly they worked in little gangs of five and six They was called long riders I guess partly because they was in the saddle all the time and partly because they done their jobs so far apart They d ride into Eldara and blow up the safe in the bank one day for instance and five days later they d be two hundred and fifty miles away stoppin a train at Lewis Station They never hung around no one part of the country and that made it hard as hell to run em down that and because they had the best hosses that money could buy They had friends too strung out all over squatters and the like of that They d drop in on these little fellers and pass em a couple of twenties and make themselves solid for life Afterward they used em for stoppin places They d pull off a couple of hold ups then they d ride off to one of these squatter places and lay up for ten days maybe drinkin and feedin up themselves and their hosses That was the only way they was ever caught They was killed off by each other fighting about the split up or something like that But now and then a gang held together long enough to raise so much hell that they got known from one end of the range to the other Mostly they held together because they had a leader who knew how to handle em and who kept em under his thumb That was the way with old Piotto He had five men under him They was all hell benders who had ridden the range alone and had their share of fights and killings which there wasn t one of em that wouldn t have been good enough to go leader in any other crew but they had to knuckle under to old Piotto He was a great gunman and he was pretty good in scheming up ways of dodging the law and picking the best booty He had these five men and then he had his daughter Joan She was better n two ordinary men herself Three years that gang held together and got rich fair rich They made it so fast they couldn t even gamble the stuff away About a thousand times I guess posses went out after Piotto but they never came back with a trace of em they never got within shootin distance Finally Piotto got so confident that he started raidin ranches and carryin off members of well off ranchers to hold for ransom That was the easiest way of makin money it was also pretty damned dangerous One time they held up a stage and picked off of it two kids who was comin out from the East to try their hands in the cattle business They was young they looked like gentlemen they was dressed nifty and they packed big rolls So wise old Piotto took em off into the hills and held em till their folks back East could wire out the money to save em That was easy money for Piotto but that was the beginnin of the end for him because while they was waitin them two kids seen Joan and seen her good I been telling you she was better n two common men She was Which means she was equal to about ten ordinary girls There s still a legend about how beautiful Joan Piotto was tall and straight and big black eyes and terrible handy with her gun She could ride anything that walked and she didn t know what fear meant These two kids seen her One of em was William Drew one of em was John Bard He turned to Anthony and saw that the latter was stern of face He had surely scored his point Same name as yours eh he asked to explain his turning It s a common enough name murmured Bard Well them two had come out to be partners and there they was fallin in love with the same girl So when they got free they put their heads together bein uncommon wise kids and figured it out this way Neither of em had a chance workin alone to get Joan way from her father s gang but workin together they might have a ghost of a show So they decided to stay on the trail of Piotto till they got Joan Then they d give her a choice between the two of em and the one that lost would simply back off the boards They done what they agreed For six months they stuck on the trail of old Piotto and never got in hailin distance of him Then they come on the gang while they were restin up in the house of a squatter That was a pretty night Drew and Bard went through that gang It sounds like a nice fairy story all right but I know old fellers who ll swear it s true They killed three of the men with their guns they knifed another one an they killed Riley with their bare hands It wasn t no pretty sight to see the inside of that house And last of all they got Piotto fightin like an old wildcat into a corner with his daughter and William Drew he took Piotto into his arms and busted his back That don t sound possible but when you see Drew you ll know how it was done The girl she d been knocked cold before this happened So while Bard and Drew sat together bindin up each other s wounds because they was shot pretty near to pieces they talked it over and they seen pretty clear that the girl would never marry the man that had killed her father Of course old Bill Drew he d done the killing but that wasn t any reason why he had to take the blame They made up their minds that right there and then with the dead men lyin all around em they d match coins to see which one would take the blame of havin killed Piotto meanin that the other one would get the girl if he could And Bard lost So he had to take the credit of havin killed old Piotto I d of give something to have seen the two of em sittin there oozin blood after that marchin was decided Because they tell me that Bard was as big as Drew and looked pretty much the same Then Bard he asked Drew to let him have one chance at the girl lettin her know first what he d done but jest trustin to his power of talk Which of course didn t give him no show While he was makin love to the girl she outs with a knife and tries to stick him nice pleasant sort she must have been and Drew he had to pry the two of em apart That made the girl look sort of kind on Drew and she swore that sooner or later she d have the blood of Bard for what he d done either have it herself or else send someone after him to the end of the world She was a wild one all right She was so wild that Drew after they got married took her over on the far side of the range and built that old house that s rottin there now Bard he left the range and wasn t never seen again far as I know It was clear to Anthony bitterly clear His father had had a grim scene in parting with Drew and had placed the continent between them And in the Eastern states he had met that black eyed girl his mother and loved her because she was so much like the wild daughter of Piotto The girl Joan in dying had probably extracted from Drew a promise that he would kill Bard and that promise he had lived to fulfil So Joan died he queried Yep and was buried under them two trees in front of the house I don t think she lived long after they was married but about that nobody knows They was clear off by themselves and there isn t any one can tell about their life after they was married All we know is that Drew didn t get over her dyin He ain t over it yet and goes out to the old place every month or so to potter around the grave and keep the grass and the weeds off of it and clean the head stone The candle guttered wildly on the floor It had burnt almost to the wood and now the remnant of the wick stood in a little sprawling pool of grease white at the outer edges Bard yawned and patted idly the blanket where it touched on the shape of the revolver beneath In another moment that candle would gutter out and they would be left in darkness He said That s the best yarn I ve heard in a good many days it s enough to make any one sleepy so here goes And he turned deliberately on his side Nash his eyes staring with incredulity sat up slowly among his blankets and his hand stole up toward the noose of the lariat A light snore reached him hardly a snore so much as the heavy intake of breath of a very weary sleeping man yet the hand of Nash froze on the lariat By God he whispered faintly to himself he ain t asleep And the candle flared wildly leaped and shook out CHAPTER XXI THE SWIMMING OF THE SAVERACK Over the face of Nash the darkness passed like a cold hand and a colder sense of failure touched his heart but men who have ridden the range have one great power surpassing all others the power of patience As soundlessly as he had pushed himself up the moment before he now slipped down in the blankets and resigned himself to sleep He knew that he would wake at the first hint of grey light and trusted that after the long ride of the day before his companion would still be fast asleep That half light would be enough for his work but when he roused while the room was still scarcely more visible than if it were filled with a grey fog he found Bard already up and pulling on his boots How d you sleep he growled following the example of the tenderfoot Not very well said the other cheerily You see that story of yours was so vivid in my mind that I stayed awake about all night I guess thinking it over I knew it murmured Nash to himself He was awake all the time And still If that thrown noose of the lariat had settled over the head and shoulders of the sham sleeper it would have made no difference whether he waked or slept in the end he would have sat before William Drew tied hand and foot If that noose had not settled The picture of the little piece of paper fluttering to the floor came back with a strange vividness to the mind of Nash and he had to shrug his shoulders to shake the thought away They were in the saddle a very few moments after they awoke and started out breakfastless The rain long ago had ceased and there was only the solemn silence of the brown hills around them silence and a faint crinkling sound as if the thirsty soil still drank It had been a heavy fall of rain they could see for whenever they passed a bare spot where no grass grew it was crossed by a thick tracery of the rivulets which had washed down the slopes during the night Soon they reached a little creek whose current barely knee deep foamed up around the shoulders of the horses and set them staggering The Saverack will be hell said Nash and we d better cut straight for the ford How long will it take Add about three hours to the trip Can t do it remember that little date back in Eldara to night Then look for yourself and make up your mind for yourself said Nash drily for they topped a hill and below them saw a mighty yellow flood pouring down the valley It went leaping and shouting as if it rejoiced in some destruction it had worked and was still working and the muddy torrent was threaded with many a ridge of white and swirling with bubbles The Saverack said Nash Now what d you think about fording it If we can t ford it we can swim it declared Bard Look at that tree trunk If that will float I will float and if I can float I can swim and if I can swim I ll reach the other bank of that little creek Won t we boy And he slapped the proud neck of the mustang Swim it said Nash incredulously Does that date mean as much as that to you It isn t the date it s the promise I gave answered the other watching the current with a cool eye besides when I was a youngster I used to do things like this for the sport of it They rode down to the edge of the stream How about it Nash will you take the chance with me And the other looking down Try the current I ll stay here on the shore and if it gets too strong for you I ll throw out a rope eh But if you can make it I ll follow suit The other cast a somewhat wistful eye of doubt upon the cowpuncher How far is it to the ford he asked About eight miles answered Nash doubling the distance on the spot Eight miles repeated the other ruefully Too far Then here goes Nash Still never turning his back on the cowpuncher who was now uncoiling his lariat and preparing it for a cast Bard edged the piebald into the current He felt the mustang stagger as the water came knee deep and he checked the horse casting his eye from shore to shore and summing up the chances If it had been simply water against which he had to contend he would not have hesitated but here and there along the course sharp pointed rocks and broad backed boulders loomed and now and then with a mighty splashing and crashing one of these was overbalanced by the force of the current and rolled another step toward the far off sea That rush of water would carry him far downstream and the chances were hardly more than even that he would not strike against one of these murderous obstructions about which the current foamed An impulse made him turn and wave a hand to Nash He shouted Give me luck Luck roared the cowboy and his voice came as if faint with distance over the thunder of the stream He touched the piebald with the spurs and the gallant little horse floundered forward lost footing and struck into water beyond its depth At the same instant Bard swung clear of the saddle and let his body trail out behind holding with his left hand to the tail of the struggling horse and kicking to aid the progress Immersed to the chin and sometimes covered by a more violent wave the sound of the river grew at once strangely dim but he felt the force of the current tugging at him like a thousand invisible hands He began to wish that he had taken off his boots before entering for they weighted his feet so that it made him leg weary to kick Nevertheless he trusted in the brave heart of the mustang There was no wavering in the wild horse Only his head showed over the water but the ears were pricking straight and high and it never once swerved back toward the nearer shore Their progress at first was good but as they neared the central portion of the water they were swept many yards downstream for one that they made in a transverse direction Twice they missed projecting rocks by the narrowest margin and then something like an exceedingly thin and exceedingly strong arm caught Anthony around the shoulders It tugged back stopped all their forward progress and let them sweep rapidly down the stream and back toward the shore Turning his head he caught a glimpse of Nash sitting calmly in his saddle holding the rope in both hands and laughing The next instant he saw no more for the current placed a taller rock between him and the bank On that rock the line of the lariat caught hooking the swimmers sharply in toward the bank He would have cut the rope but it would be almost impossible to get out a knife and open a blade with his teeth still clinging to the tail of the swimming horse with one hand He reached down through the water pulled out the colt and with an effort swung himself about Close at hand he could not reach the rope and therefore he fired not directly at the rope itself but at the edge of the rock around which the lariat bent at a sharp angle The splash of that bullet from the strong face of the rock sliced the rope like a knife It snapped free and the brave little mustang straightened out again for the far shore An instant more Bard swam with the revolver poised above the water but he caught no glimpse of Nash so he restored it with some difficulty to the holster and gave all his attention and strength to helping the horse through the water swimming with one hand and kicking vigorously with his feet Perhaps they would not have made it for now through exhaustion the ears of the mustang were drooping back He shouted and at the faint sound of his cheer the piebald pricked a single weary ear He shouted again and this time not for encouragement but from exultation a swerving current had caught them and was bearing them swiftly toward the desired bank It failed them when they were almost touching bottom and swung sharply out toward the centre again but the mustang as though it realized that this was the last chance fought furiously Anthony gave the rest of his strength and they edged through inch by inch and horse and man staggered up the bank and stood trembling with fatigue Glancing back he saw Nash in the act of throwing his lariat to the ground wild with anger and before he could understand the meaning of this burst of temper over a mere spoiled lariat the gun whipped from the side of the cowboy exploded and the little piebald with ears pricked sharply forward as though in vague curiosity crumpled to the ground The suddenness of it took all power of action from Bard for the instant He stood staring stupidly down at the dying horse and then whirled gun in hand frantic with anger and grief Nash was galloping furiously up the far bank of the Saverack already safely out of range and speeding toward the ford CHAPTER XXII DREW SMILES When the cattleman felt the rope snap back to his hand he could not realize at first just what had happened The crack of the gun had been no louder than the snapping of a twig in that storming of the river and the only explanation he could find was that the rope had struck some superlatively sharp edge of the rock and been sawed in two But examining the cut end he found it severed as cleanly as if a knife had slashed across it and then it was he knew and threw the lariat to the ground When he saw Bard scramble up the opposite bank he knew that his game was lost and all the tables reversed for the Easterner was a full two hours closer to the home of Drew than he was with the necessary detour up to the ford The Easterner might be delayed by the unknown country for a time but not very long He was sure to meet someone who would point the way It was then that Nash drew his gun and shot down the piebald mustang The next instant he was racing straight up the river toward the ford The roan was not spared this day for there were many chances that Bard might secure a fresh mount to speed him on the way to the Drew ranch and now it was all important that the big grey man be warned for there was a danger in that meeting as Nash was beginning to feel By noon he reached the house and went straight to the owner a desperate figure spattered with mud to the eyes a three days growth of whiskers blackening his face and that face gaunt with the long hard riding He found the imperturbable Drew deep in a book in his office While he was drawing breath the rancher examined him with a faint smile I thought this would be the end of it he announced The devil and all hell plays on the side of Bard answered the foreman I had him safe almost tied hand and foot He got away Got away Shot the rope in two The other placed a book mark closed the volume and looked up with the utmost serenity Try again he said quietly Take half a dozen men with you surprise him in the night Surprise a wolf growled Nash It s just the same The shaggy eyebrows stirred How far is he away Two or three miles maybe half a dozen I don t know He ll be here before night The big man changed colour and gripped the edge of the desk Nash had never dreamed that it would be possible to so stir him Coming here Yes Nash you infernal fool Did you let him know where you were taking him No He was already on the way here Once more Drew winced He rose now and strode across the room and back from the wall the heavy echo of his footfall came sharply back And he paused in front of Nash looming above his foreman like some primitive monster or as the Grecian heroes loomed above the rank and file at the siege of Troy He was like a relic of some earlier period when bigger men were needed for a greater physical labour What does he want I don t know Says he wants to ask for the right of hunting on your old place on the other side of the range Which I d tell a man it s jest a lie He knows he can hunt there if he wants to Does he know me Just your name Did he ask many questions about me Wanted to know what you looked like And you told him A lot of things Said you were big and grey And I told him that story about you and John Bard Drew slumped into a chair and ground the knuckles of his right hand across his forehead The white marks remained as he looked up again What was that Why how you happened to marry Joan Piotto and how Bard left the country That was all Is there any more sir The other stared into the distance overlooking the question Tell me what you ve found out about him I been after him these three days Logan tipped him wrong and he started the south trail for Eldara I got on his trail three times and couldn t catch him till we hit Eldara I thought your roan was the most durable horse on the range Steve You ve often told me so He is But you couldn t catch Bard He was on a faster horse than mine for a while Well Isn t he now I killed the horse You showed your hand then He knows you were sent after him No he thinks it s because of a woman Is he tangling himself up with some girl frowned the rancher He s cutting in on me with Sally Fortune damn his heart And Nash paled visibly even through whiskers and mud The other almost smiled So soon Nash With hosses and women he don t lose no time What s he done The first trace I caught of him was at a shack of an old ranchhouse where he d traded his lame hoss in They gave him the wildest mustang they had a hoss that was saddle shy and that hadn t never been ridden He busted that hoss in a little piebald mustang tougher n iron and that was why I didn t catch him till we hit Eldara The smile was growing more palpable on the face of Drew and he nodded for the story to continue Then I come to a house which was all busted up because Bard had come along and flirted with the girl and she s got too proud for the feller she was engaged to begun thinkin of millionaires right away I s pose Next I tracked him to Flanders s saloon where he d showed up Sandy Ferguson the day before and licked him bad I seen Ferguson It was sure some lickin Ferguson The gun fighter The two gun man Him Ah h h drawled the big man The colour was back in his face He seemed to be enjoying the recountal hugely Then I hit Eldara and found all the lights out Because of Bard H m He d had a run in with Butch Conklin and Butch threatened to come back with all his gang and wipe Eldara off the map He stuck around and while he was waitin for Butch and his gang he started flirtin with Sally Fortune The name seemed to stick in his throat and he had to bring it out with a grimace So now you want his blood Nash I ll have it said the cowpuncher quietly I ve got gambler s luck In the end I m sure to win You re not going to win here Nash No queried the younger man with a dangerous intonation No I know the blood behind that chap You won t win here Blood will out He smote his great fist on the desk top and his laugh was a thunder which reverberated through the room Blood will out The blood of John Bard asked Nash Drew started Who said John Bard He grew grey again the flush dying swiftly He started to his feet and repeated in a great voice sweeping the room with a wild glance Who said John Bard I thought maybe this was his son answered Nash You re a fool Does he look like John Bard No there s only one person in the world he looks like He strode again up and down the room repeating in a deep monotone John Bard Coming to a sharp halt he said I don t want the rest of your story The point is that the boy will be here within an hour two hours We ve got work to do before that time Listen to me answered the foreman don t let him get inside this house I d rather take part of hell into a house of mine Besides if he sees me He s coming here but he s not going to see either of us my mind is made up neither of us until I have him helpless CHAPTER XXIII THE COMEDY SETTING Dead you mean broke in Nash because otherwise he ll never be helpless I tell you Nash said the other solemnly I can make him helpless with one minute of talk My problem is to keep that wild devil harmless while he listens to me talk Another thing if he ever sees me nothing but death will stop him from coming at my throat Speakin personal said the other coldly I never take no chances on fellers that might come at my throat I know you re for the quick draw and the quick finish But I d rather die myself than have a hair of his head hurt I mean that Nash his thoughts spinning stood staring blankly I give up tryin to figure it out but if he s comin here and you want to keep him safe I d better take a fresh hoss and get twenty miles away before night You ll do nothing of the kind you ll stay here with me And face him without a gun asked the other incredulously Leave gun talk out of this I think one of the boys looks a little like me Lawlor isn t that his name Him Yes a little bit like you but he s got his thickness through the stomach and not through the chest Never mind He s big and he s grey Send for him and get the rest of the boys in here They re around now for noon Get every one Understand And make it fast In ten minutes they came to the office in a troop rough men smooth men little and big fat and thin but good cattlemen every one Boys said Drew a tenderfoot is coming to the ranch to day I m going to play a few jokes on him First of all I want you to know that until the stranger leaves the house Lawlor is going to take my place He is going to be Drew Understand Lawlor broke out several of them and turned in surprise to a big cheerful man grey plump with monstrous white whiskers Because he looks a bit like me First you ll have to crop those whiskers Lawlor He clutched at the threatened whiskers with both hands Crop em Chief you ain t maybe runnin me a bit Not a bit said Drew smiling faintly I ll make it worth your while It took me thirty years to raise them whiskers said the cattleman stern with rebuke D you think I could be hired to give em up It s like givin up some of myself Let them go then You can play the part whiskers and all The rest of you remember that Lawlor is the boss And brand that deep growled Lawlor looking about with a frown He had already stepped into his part the others laughed loudly Steady there called Drew Lawlor starts as boss right now Cut out the laughing I ll tell the rest of you what you re to do later on In the meantime just step out and I ll have a talk with Lawlor on his part We haven t much time to get ready But remember if one of you grins when Lawlor gives an order I m done with that man that s all They filed out of the room looking serious and Drew concentrated on Lawlor This sounds like a joke he began but there s something serious about it If you carry it through safely there s a hundred in it for you If you fall down why you fall out of an easy place on this ranch The big cattleman wiped a growing perspiration from his forehead and considered his boss with plaintive eyes This tenderfoot who s coming is green to the range but he s a hard man a fine horseman a sure shot and a natural fighter More than that he s coming here looking for trouble and he ll expect to get the trouble from you Lawlor brushed his moustache anxiously Let someone else take the job that s all A hundred ain t to be picked up every week but I ll do without it In my day I ve done my share of brawlin around but I m too stiff in the joints to make a fast draw and getaway now Let Nash take this job He s gun fighter enough to handle this bad man for you No said Drew not even Nash can handle this one Then with a mighty and explosive emphasis there ain t no possible use of me lingering around the job S long Wait This young chap isn t going to murder you I ll tell you this much The man he wants is I but he knows my face not my name He s been on the trail of that face for some time and now he s tracking it to the right house but when he sees you and hears you called Drew he ll be thrown off again The other nodded gloomily I m by way of a lightning rod This tenderfoot with the hard hand he strikes and I sort of conduct the shock away from anything that ll burn eh Drew overlooked the comment There are certain things about me you will have to know And he explained carefully the story which Nash had told to Bard This Bard asked the cautious Lawlor is he any relation of old John Bard Even if he were it wouldn t make your position dangerous The man he wants is I He knows my face not my name Until he sees me he ll be perfectly reasonable unless he s crossed You must seem frank and above board If you tell more lies than are necessary he may get suspicious and if he grows suspicious the game is up and will have to be finished with a gun play Remember that He ll want to know about Nash Tell him that Nash is a bad one and that you ve fixed him he mustn t expect to find Nash here Lawlor rubbed his hands like one coming from the cold outdoors to a warm fire I m beginning to see light Lemme at this Bard I m going to get enough fun out of this to keep me laughin the rest of my life Good but keep that laugh up your sleeve If he asks questions you ll have some solemn things to say Chief when the time comes there s going to be about a gallon of tears in my eyes So Drew left him to complete the other arrangements If Bard reached the house he must be requested to stay and if he stayed he must be fed and entertained The difficulty in the way of this was that the servants in the big ranchhouse were two Chinese boys They could never be trusted to help in the deception so Drew summoned two of his men Shorty Kilrain and Calamity Ben Calamity had no other name than Ben as far as any one on the range had ever been able to learn His nickname was derived from the most dolorous face between Eldara and Twin Rivers Two pale blue eyes set close together stared out with an endless and wistful pathos a long nose dropped below them and his mouth curled down at the sides He was hopelessly round shouldered from much and careless riding and in attempting to straighten he only succeeded in throwing back his head so that his lean neck generally was in a V shape with the Adam s apple as the apex of the wedge Shorty Kilrain received his early education at sea and learned there a general handiness which stood him in stead when he came to the mountain desert There was nothing which Shorty could not do with his hands from making a knot to throwing a knife and he was equally ready to oblige with either accomplishment Drew proposed that he take charge of the kitchen with Calamity Ben as an assistant Shorty glowered on the rancher Me he said Me go into the galley to wait on a blasted tenderfoot After he leaves you ll have a month off with full pay and some over Shorty Don t want the month off Drew considered him thoughtfully following the precept of Walpole that every man has his price What do you want Shorty The ex sailor scratched his head and then rolled his eyes up with a dawning smile as one who sees a vision of ultimate bliss Let one of the other boys catch my hoss out of the corral every morning and saddle him for me for a month It s a bargain What ll you do with that time Sit on the fence and roll a cigarette like a blasted gentleman and damn the eyes of the feller that s catchin my hoss And me said Calamity Ben what do I get You get orders answered Kilrain from me Calamity regarded him uncertain whether or not to fight out the point but apparently decided that the effort was not worth while There ain t going to be no luck come out of this he said darkly Before this tenderfoot gets out of the house we re all going to wish he was in hell CHAPTER XXIV SAM L HALL But with the stage set and the curtain ready to rise on the farce the audience did not arrive until the shadow of the evening blotted the windows of the office where big Lawlor waited impatiently rehearsing his part but when the lamp had been lighted as though that were a signal for which the tenderfoot had waited came a knock at the door of the room and then it was jerked open and the head of one of the cowpunchers was inserted He s coming The head disappeared the door slammed Lawlor stretched both arms wide shifted his belt loosened his gun in the holster for the fiftieth time and exhaled a long breath Once more the door jerked open and this time it was the head and sullen face of Nash enlivened now by a peculiarly unpleasant smile He s here As the door closed the grim realization came to Lawlor that he could not face the tenderfoot his staring eyes and his pallor would betray him even if the jerking of his hands did not He swung about in the comfortable chair seized a book and whisking it open bowed his head to read All that he saw was a dance of irregular black lines voices sounded through the hall outside Sure he ll see you Calamity Ben was saying And if you want to put up for the night there ain t nobody more hospital than the Chief Right in here son The door yawned He could not see for his back was resolutely toward it and he was gripping the cover of the book hard to steady his hands but he felt a breath of colder air from the outer hall he felt above all a new presence peering in upon him like a winter starved lynx that might flatten its round face against the window and peer in at the lazy warmth and comfort of the humans around the hearth inside Some such feeling sent a chill through Lawlor s blood Hello called Calamity Ben Humph grunted Lawlor Got a visitor mister Drew Bring him in And Lawlor cleared his throat All right here he is The door closed and Lawlor snapped the book shut Drew said a low voice The cowpuncher turned in his chair He had intended to rise but at the sound of that controlled menace he knew that his legs were too weak to answer that purpose What he saw was a slender fellow who stood with his head somewhat lowered while his eyes peered down from under contracted brows as though the light were hurting them His feet were braced apart and his hands dropped lightly on his hips the very picture of a man ready to spring into action Under the great brush of his moustache Lawlor set his teeth but he was instantly at ease for if the sight of the stranger shook him to the very centre the other was even more obviously shocked by what he saw The hands dropped limp from his hips and dangled idly at his sides his body straightened almost with a jerk as though he had been struck violently and now instead of that searching look he was blinking down at his host Lawlor rose and extended a broad hand and an even broader smile he was proud of the strength which had suddenly returned to his legs H ware ye stranger Sure glad to see you The other accepted the proffered hand automatically like one moving in a dream Are you Drew Sure am William Drew He still held the hand as if he were fearful of the vision escaping without that sensible bondage William Drew is right Sit down Make yourself to home Thanks breathed the other and as if that breath expelled with it all his strength he slumped into a chair and sat with a fascinated eye glued to his host Lawlor had time to mark now the signs of long and severe travelling which the other bore streaks of mud that disfigured him from heel to shoulder and his face was somewhat drawn like a man who has gone to work fasting William Drew he repeated more to himself than to Lawlor and the latter formed a silent prayer of gratitude that he was not William Drew I m forgetting myself went on the tenderfoot with a ghost of a smile My name is Bard Anthony Bard His glance narrowed again and this time Lawlor remembering his part pretended to start with surprise Bard Yes Anthony Bard Glad to know you You ain t by any chance related to a John Bard Why Had a partner once by that name Good old John Bard He shook his head as though overcome by recollections I ve heard something about you and your partner mister Drew Yes In fact it seems to be a rather unusual story Well it ain t common John Bard I ll tell the world there was a man Yes he was What s that He must have been answered Anthony from all that I ve heard of him I m interested in what I scrape together about him You see he carries the same name That s nacheral How long since you ate Last night The hell Starved Rather It s near chow time Will you eat now or wait for the reg lar spread I think I can wait thank you A little drink right now to help you along eh He strode over and opened the door Hey Shorty For answer there came only the wail of an old pirate song Oh my name s Sam l Hall Sam l Hall My name s Sam l Hall Sam l Hall My name is Sam l Hall And I hate you one an all You re a gang of muckers all Damn your eyes Listen said Lawlor turning to his guest with a deprecating wave of the hand A cook what sings Which in the old days I wouldn t have had a bum like that around my place but there ain t no choosin now The voice from the kitchen rolled out louder I killed a man they said so they said I killed a man they said so they said I killed a man they said For I hit im on the head And I left him there for dead Damn your eyes Hey Shorty Kilrain bellowed the aggravated host He turned to Bard What d you do with a bum like that for a cook Pay him wages and keep him around to sing songs I like this one Listen They put me in the quad in the quad They put me in the quad in the quad They put me in the quad They chained me to a rod And they left me there by God Damn your eyes Kilrain come here and make it fast or I ll damn your eyes He explained to Bard Got to be hard with these fellers or you never get nowhere with em Yo ho answered the voice of the singer and approached booming The parson he did come he did come The parson he did come did come The parson he did come He looked almighty glum He talked of kingdom come Damn your eyes Shorty loomed in the doorway and caught his hand to his forehead in a nautical salute He had one bad eye and now it squinted as villainously as if he were the real Sam l Hall Righto sir What ll you have mate Don t mate me you igner nt sweepin of the South Sea but trot up some red eye and gallop The ex sailor shifted his quid so that it stuck far out in the opposite cheek with such violence of pressure that a little spot of white appeared through the tan of the skin He regarded Lawlor for a silent moment with bodeful eyes What the hell are you lookin at roared the other On your way The features of Kilrain twitched spasmodically Righto sir Another salute and he was off his voice coming back less and less distinctly So up the rope I ll go I will go So up the rope I ll go I ll go So up the rope I ll go With the crowd all down below Yelling Sam I told you so Damn their eyes CHAPTER XXV HAIR LIKE THE SUNSHINE Well grumbled Lawlor settling back comfortably into his chair one of these days I m goin to clean out my whole gang and put in a new one They maybe won t be any better but they can t be any wuss Nevertheless he did not seem in the least downhearted but apparently had some difficulty in restraining his broad grin The voice of the grim cook returned I ll see Nelly in the crowd in the crowd I ll see Nelly in the crowd in the crowd I ll see Nelly in the crowd And I ll holler to her loud Hey Nelly ain t you proud Damn your eyes I ask you cried Lawlor with freshly risen wrath is that any way to go around talkin about women Not talking He s singing answered Bard Let him alone The thunder of their burly Ganymede s singing rose and echoed about them And this shall be my knell be my knell And this shall be my knell my knell And this shall be my knell Sam I hope you go to hell Sam I hope you sizzle well Damn your eyes Shorty Kilrain appeared in the doorway his mouth wide on the last long wailing note Shorty said Lawlor with a sort of hopeless sadness ain t you never been educated to sing no better songs than that Why you old grey headed began Shorty and then stopped short and hitched his trousers violently Lawlor pushed the bottle of whisky and glass toward Bard Help yourself And to Kilrain who was leaving the room Come back here Well snarled the sailor half turning at the door While I m runnin this here ranch you re goin to have manners see If manners was like your whiskers said the unabashed Shorty it d take me nigh onto thirty years to get em And he winked at Bard for sympathy Lawlor smashed his fist on the table What I say is are you running this ranch or am I Well growled Kilrain If you was a kid you d have your mouth washed out with soap The eyes of Shorty bulged It ought to be done now but there ain t no one I d give such dirty work to What you re going to do is stand right here and show us you know how to sing a decent song in a decent way That there song of yours didn t leave nothin sacred untouched from parsons and jails to women and the gallows Stand over there and sing The eyes of the sailor filmed over with cold hate Was I hired to punch cattle he said or make a blasted roarin fool out of myself You was hired answered Lawlor softly as he filled his glass to the brim with the old rye whisky to be a cook and you re the rottenest hash slinger that ever served cold dough for biscuits a blasted roarin fool you ve already made out of yourself by singin that song I want another one to get the sound of that out of my ears Tune up Thoughts of murder ill concealed whitened the face of the sailor Some day he began hoarsely and then stopped For a vision came to him of blithe mornings when he should sit on the top of the corral fence rolling a cigarette while some other puncher went into the herd and roped and saddled his horse D you mean this Drew he asked with an odd emphasis D you think I m talking for fun What ll I sing he asked in a voice which was reduced to a faint whisper by rage I dunno mused Lawlor but maybe it ought to lie between Alice Ben Bolt and Annie Laurie What d you choose partner He turned to Bard Alice Ben Bolt by all means I don t think he could manage the Scotch Start commanded Lawlor The sailor closed his eyes tilted back his head twisted his face to a hideous grimace and then opening his shapeless mouth emitted a tremendous wail which took shape in the following words Oh don t you remember sweet Alice Ben Bolt Sweet Alice with hair like the sunshine Shut up roared Lawlor It required a moment for Shorty to unkink the congested muscles of his face What the hell s the matter now he inquired Whoever heard of hair like the sunshine There ain t no such thing possible Hair so brown that s what the song says Shorty we got more feelin for our ears than to let you go on singin an showin your ignerance G wan back to the kitchen Kilrain drew a long breath regarded Lawlor again with that considerate expectant eye and then turned on his heel and strode from the room Back to Bard came fragments of tremendous cursing of an epic breadth and a world wide inclusiveness Got to do things like this once in a while to keep em under my thumb Lawlor explained genially With all his might Bard was struggling to reconcile this big handed vulgarian with his mental picture of the man who could write for an epitaph Here sleeps Joan the wife of William Drew She chose this place for rest But the two ideas were not inclusive He said aloud Aren t you afraid that that black eyed fellow will run a knife between your ribs one of these dark nights Who My ribs exclaimed Lawlor nevertheless stirring somewhat uneasily in his chair Nope they know that I m William Drew They may be hard but they know I m harder Oh drawled the other and his eyes held with uncomfortable steadiness on the rosy face of Lawlor I understand To cover his confusion Lawlor seized his glass Here s to you drinkin deep And he tossed off the mighty potion Bard had poured only a few drops into his glass he had too much sympathy for his empty stomach to do more His host leaned back coughing with tears of pleasure in his eyes Damn me he breathed reverently I ain t touched stuff like this in ten years Is this a new stock inquired Bard apparently puzzled This said Lawlor recalling his position with a start Sure it is brand new Yep stuff ain t been in more n five days Smooth ain t it Medicine that s what I call it a gentleman s drink goes down like water Observing a rather quizzical light in the eyes of Bard he felt that he had probably been making a few missteps and being warmed greatly at the heart by the whisky he launched forth in a new phase of the conversation CHAPTER XXVI THE CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON Speakin of hard cattlemen he said I could maybe tell you a few things son No doubt of it smiled Anthony I presume it would take a very hard man to handle this crowd Fairly hard nodded the redoubtable Lawlor but they ain t nothin to the men that used to ride the range in the old days No Nope One of them men why he d eat a dozen like Kilrain and think nothin of it Them was the sort I learned to ride the range with I ve heard something about a fight which you and John Bard had against the Piotto gang Care to tell me anything of it Lawlor lolled easily back in his chair and balanced a second large drink between thumb and forefinger There ain t no harm in talk son sure I ll tell you about it What d you want to know The way Bard fought the way you both fought Lemme see He closed his eyes like one who strives to recollect he was in fact carefully recalling the skeleton of facts which Drew had told him earlier in the day Six months me and Bard had been trailin Piotto damn his old soul Bard he d of quit cold a couple of times but I kept him at it John Bard would have quit asked Anthony softly Sure He was a big man was Bard but he didn t have none too much endurance Go on nodded Anthony Six months I say we was ridin day and night and wearin out a hoss about every week of that time Then we got jest a hint from a bartender that maybe the Piottos was nearby in that section It didn t need no more than a hint for us to get busy on the trail We hit a circle through the mountains it was over near Twin Rivers where the ground ain t got a level stretch of a hundred yards in a whole day s ridin And along about evenin of the second day we come to the house of Tom Shaw a squatter Bard would of passed the house up because he knew Shaw and said there wasn t nothin crooked about him but I didn t trust nobody in them days and I ain t changed a pile since That remarked Anthony is an example I think I shall follow Eh said Lawlor somewhat blankly Well we rode up on the blind side of the house from the north see got off and sneaked around to the east end of the shack The windows was covered with cloths on the inside which didn t make me none too sure about Shaw havin no dealin s with crooks It ain t ordinary for a feller to be so savin on light Pretty soon we found a tear in one of the cloths and lookin through that we seen old Piotto sittin beside Tom Shaw with his daughter on the other side We went back to the north side of the house and figured out different ways of tacklin the job There was only the two of us see and the fellers inside that house was all cut out for man killers How would you have gone after em son Opened the door I suppose and started shooting said Bard if I had the courage The other stared at him You heard this story before Not this part Well that was jest what we done First off it sounds like a fool way of tacklin them but when you think twice it was the best of all They never was expectin anybody fool enough to walk right into that room and start fightin We went back and had a look at the door It wasn t none too husky John Bard he tried the latch soft but the thing was locked and when he pulled there was a snap Who s there hollers someone inside We froze ag in the side of the house lookin at each other pretty sick Nobody s there sings out the voice of old Piotto We can trust Tom Shaw jest because he knows that if he double crossed us he d be the first man to die And we heard Tom say sort of quaverin God s sake boys what d you think I am Now says Bard and we put our shoulders to the door and takes our guns in our hands we each had two The door went down like nothin because we was both husky fellers in them days and as she smashed in the fall upset two of the boys sittin closest and gave em no chance on a quick draw The rest of em was too paralyzed at first except old Piotto He pulled his gun but what he shot was Tom Shaw who jest leaned forward in his chair and crumpled up dead We went at em pumpin lead It wasn t no fight at first and half of em was down before they had their guns workin But when the real hell started it wasn t no fireside story I ll tell a man We had the jump on em but they meant business I dropped to the floor and lay on my side shootin Bard he followered suit They went down like tenpins till our guns were empty Then we up and rushed what was left of em Piotto and his daughter Bard makes a pass to knock the gun out of the hand of Joan and wallops her on the head instead Down she goes I finished Piotto with my bare hands Broke his back eh Me Whoever heard of breakin a man s back Ha ha ha You been hearin fairy tales son Nope I choked the old rat Were you badly hurt Lawlor searched his memory hastily there was no information on this important point Couple of grazes he said dismissing the subject with a tolerant wave of the hand Nothin worth talkin of I see nodded Bard It occurred to Lawlor that his guest was taking the narrative in a remarkably philosophic spirit He reviewed his telling of the story hastily and could find nothing that jarred He concluded That was the way of livin in them days They ain t no more they ain t no more And now said Anthony the only excitement you get is out of books and running the labourers He had picked up the book which Lawlor had just laid down Oh I read a bit now and then said the cowpuncher easily but I ain t much on booklearnin Bard was turning the pages slowly The title whose meaning dawned slowly on his astonished mind as a sunset comes in winter over a grey landscape was The Critique of Pure Reason He turned the book over and over in his hands It was well thumbed He asked controlling his voice Are you fond of Kant Eh queried the other Fond of this book Yep that s one of my favourites But I ain t much on any books However said Bard the story of this is interesting It is There s some great stuff in it mumbled Lawlor trying to squint at the title which he had quite overlooked during the daze in which he first picked it up Bard laid the book aside and out of sight And I like the characters don t you Some very close work done with them Yep there s a lot of narrow escapes Exactly I m glad that we agree about books So m I Feller can kill a lot of time chinning about books Yes I suppose a good many people have killed time over this book And as he smiled genially upon the cowpuncher Bard felt a great relief sweep over him a mighty gladness that this was not Drew that this looselipped gabbler was not the man who had written the epitaph over the tomb of Joan Piotto He lied about the book he had lied about it all And knowing that this was not Drew he felt suddenly as if someone were watching him from behind someone large and grey and stern of eye like the giant who had spoken to him so long before in the arena at Madison Square Garden A game was being played with him and behind that game must be Drew himself all Bard could do was to wait for developments The familiar booming voice of Shorty Kilrain echoed through the house Supper And the loud clangour of a bell supported the invitation Chow time breathed Lawlor heavily like one relieved at the end of a hard shift of work I figure you ain t sorry son No answered Bard but it s too bad to break off this talk I ve learned a lot CHAPTER XXVII THE STAGE You first said Lawlor at the door I ve been taught to let an older man go first said Bard smiling pleasantly After you sir Any way you want it Bard answered Lawlor but as he led the way down the hall he was saying to himself through his stiffly mumbling lips He knows Calamity was right there s going to be hell poppin before long He lengthened his stride going down the long hall to the dining room and entering he found the cowpunchers about to take their places around the big table Straight toward the head to the big chair he stalked and paused an instant beside little Duffy Their interchange of whispers was like a muffled rapid fire for they had to finish before young Bard now just entering the room could reach them and take his designated chair at the right of Lawlor He knows muttered Lawlor Hell Then it s all up No keep bluffin wait How s everything Gregory ain t come in but Drew may put him wise before he gets inside the house You done all I could expect said Lawlor aloud as Bard came up but to morrow go back on the same job and try to get something definite To Bard Here s your place partner Just been tellin Duffy there on your right about some work Some of the doggies have been rustled lately and we re on their trail They took their places and Bard surveyed the room carefully as an actor who stands in the wings and surveys the stage on which he is soon to step and play a great part for in Anthony there was a gathering sense of impending disaster and action What he saw was a long low apartment the bare rafters overhead browned by the kitchen smoke which even now was rolling in from the wide door at the end of the room the thick oily smoke of burnt meat mingled with steam and the nameless vapours of a great oven There was no semblance of a decoration on the walls the boards were not even painted It was strictly a place for use not pleasure The food itself which Shorty Kilrain and Calamity Ben now brought on was distinctly utilitarian rather than appetizing The piece de resistance was a monstrous platter heaped high with beefsteak not the inviting meat of a restaurant in a civilized city but thin brown slabs fried dry throughout The real nourishment was in the gravy in which the steak swam In a dish of even more amazing proportions was a vast heap of potatoes boiled with their jackets on Lawlor commenced loading the stack of plates before him each with a slab and a potato or two Meantime from a number of big coffee pots a stream of a liquid bitter as lye and black as night was poured into the tin cups Yet the cattlemen about the table settled themselves for the meal with a pleasant expectation fully equal to that of the most seasoned gourmand in a Manhattan restaurant The peculiar cowboy s squint a frowning of the brow and a compression of the thin lips relaxed That frown came from the steady effort to shade the eyes from the white hot sunlight the compression of the lips was due to a determination to admit none of the air laden with alkali dust except through the nostrils It grew in time into a perpetual grimace so that the expression of an old range rider is that of a man steeling himself to pass through some grim ordeal Now as they relaxed Anthony perceived first of all that most of the grimness passed away from the narrowed eyes and they lighted instead with good humoured banter though of a weary nature One by one they cast off ten years of age the lines rubbed out the jaws which had thrust out grew normal the leaning heads straightened and went back They paid not the slightest attention to the newcomer talking easily among themselves but Anthony was certain that at least some of them were thinking of him If they said nothing their thoughts were the more In fact in the meantime little Duffy had passed on to the next man in a side mutter the significant phrase He knows It went from lip to lip like a watchword passing along a line of sentinels Each man heard it imperturbably completed the sentence he was speaking before or maintained his original silence through a pause and then repeated it to his right hand neighbour Their demeanour did not alter perceptibly except that the laughter perhaps became a little more uproarious and they were sitting straighter in their chairs their eyes brighter All they knew was that Drew had impressed on them that Bard must not leave that room in command of his six shooter or even of his hands He must be bound securely The working out of the details of execution he had left to their own ingenuity It might have seemed a little thing to do to greener fellows but every one of these men was an experienced cowpuncher and like all old hands on the range they were perfectly familiar with the amount of damage which a single armed man can do The thing could be done of course but the point was to do it with the minimum of danger So they waited and talked and ate and always from the corners of their eyes were conscious of the slightly built inoffensive man who sat beside Lawlor near the head of the table In appearance he was surely most innocuous but Nash had spoken and in such matters they were all willing to take his word with a childlike faith So the meal went on and the only sign to the most experienced eye was that the chairs were placed a little far back from the edge of the table a most necessary condition when men may have to rise rapidly or get at their holsters for a quick draw Calamity Ben bearing a mighty dish of bread pudding passed directly behind the chair of the stranger The whole table watched with a sudden keenness and they saw Bard turn ever so slightly just as Calamity passed behind the chair I say he said may I have a bit of hot water to put in this coffee Sure said Calamity and went on but the whole table knew that the stranger was on his guard The mutual suspicion gave a tenseness to the atmosphere as if it were charged with the electricity of a coming storm a tingling waiting which made the men prone to become silent and then talk again in fitful outbursts Or it might be said that it was like a glass full of precipitate which only waits for the injection of a single unusual substance before it settles to the bottom and leaves the remaining liquid clear It was for the unusual then that the entire assembly waited feeling momentarily that it must be coming for the strain could not endure As for Bard he stuck by his original apparent indifference For he still felt sure that the real William Drew was behind this elaborate deception and the thing for which he waited was some revelation of the hand of the master The trumps which he felt he held was in being forewarned he could not see that the others knew his hand He said to Lawlor I think a man named Nash works on this ranch I expected to see him at supper here Nash answered Lawlor Sure he used to be foreman here Ain t no more Nope I couldn t stand for his lip Didn t mind him getting fresh till he tried to ride me Then I turned him loose Where did you meet him While I was riding in this direction Want to see him bad The other moistened his lips Rather He killed my horse A silence fell on these who were within hearing They would not have given equal attention to the story of the killing of a man How d he get away with it The Saverack was between us Before I could get my gun out he was riding out of range I ll meet him and have another talk some day Well the range ain t very small But my dear fellow it s not nearly as big as my certainty of meeting this cur There is something in a low slow voice more thrilling than the thunder of actual rage Those who heard glanced to one another with thoughtful eyes They were thinking of Nash and thinking of him with sympathy Little Duffy squat and thick set felt inspiration descend on him He turned to Bard on his left That ain t a full size forty five is it that one you re packin Doesn t it look it answered Bard Nope Holster seems pretty small to me It s the usual gun I m sure said Bard and pulled the weapon from the leather Holding the butt loosely his trigger finger hooked clear around the far side of the guard he showed the gun I was wrong nodded Duffy unabashed that s the regular kind Let s have a look at it And he stretched out his hand No one would ever have guessed how closely the table followed what now happened for each man began talking in a voice even louder than before It was as if they sought to cover the stratagem of Duffy with their noise There s nothing unusual about the gun said Bard but I d be glad to let you have it except that I ve formed a habit of never letting a six shooter get away from me It s a foolish habit I know but I can t lose it If there s any part you d like to see just name it Thanks answered Duffy I guess I ve seen all I want of it Calamity had failed Duffy had failed It began to look as if force of downright numbers must settle the affair CHAPTER XXVIII SALLY BREAKS A MIRROR As Sally had remarked the night before one does not pay much attention to a toilet when one rises at five a m At least that is the rule but Sally turning out with a groan in the chill dark room shut off the alarm lighted her lamp and set about the serious task of dressing A woman after all is much like a diplomatic statesman a hint along certain lines is more to her than a sworn statement She had secured a large mirror and in front of this she laboured patiently for a full ten minutes twisting her hair this way and that and using the comb and brush vigorously Now and then as she worked she became aware that a fluff of hair rolling down low over her forehead did amazing things to her face and brought her from Sally Fortune into the strange dignity of a lady But she could not complete any of the manoeuvres no matter how promisingly they started In the end she dashed a handful of hairpins on the floor and wound the hair about her head with a few swift turns She studied the sullen boyish visage which looked back at her After all she would be unmercifully joked if she were to appear with her hair grown suddenly fluffy and womanly it would become impossible for her to run the eating place without the assistance of a man and a fighting man at that So what was the use She threw the mirror crashing on the floor it splintered in a thousand pieces After all she murmured aloud do I want to be a woman The sullen mouth undoubtedly answered No the wistful eyes undoubtedly replied in another key She shrugged the question away and stepped out of her room toward the kitchen whistling a tune to raise her spirits Late Sally said the cook tossing another hot cake on the growing pile which surmounted the warmer Sure I busted my mirror said Sally The cook stared at her in such astonishment that he allowed a quantity of dough to fall from the dish cupped in the hollow of his arm it overflowed the griddle iron Blockhead shouted Sally Watch your step She resumed when the dough had been rescued by somewhat questionable means D you think a girl can dress in the dark But the cook had had too much experience with his employer to press what seemed a tender point He confined his attention to the pancakes There ain t no fool worse than a he fool continued Sally bitterly Which maybe you think a girl can dress without a mirror Since this taunt brought no response from her victim she went on into the eating room It was already filling and the duties of her strenuous day began They continued without interruption hour after hour for the popularity of her restaurant had driven all competition out of Eldara a result which filled the pocket book and fattened the bank account of Sally Fortune but loaded unnumbered burdens onto her strong shoulders For she could not hire a waiter to take her place every man who came into the eating room expected to be served by the slim hands of Sally herself and he expected also some trifling repartee which would make him pay his bill with a grin The repartee dragged with Sally to day almost to sullenness and when she began to grow weary in the early afternoon there was no reserve strength on which she could fall back She suddenly became aware that she wanted support aid comfort Finally she spilled a great armful of empties down on the long drain board of the sink turned to the wall and buried her face in her hands The cook Bert though he cast a startled glance at her would not have dared to speak after that encounter of the morning but a rather explosive sniff was too eloquent an appeal to his manliness His left sleeve having fallen he rolled it back tied the strings of the apron tighter about his plump middle and advanced to the battle His hand touched the shoulder of the girl Sally Shut your face moaned a stifled voice But he took his courage between his teeth and persisted Sally somethin is wrong Nothin you can right Fatty said the same woe stricken voice Sally if somebody s been gettin fresh with you Her arms jerked down she whirled and faced him with clenched fists her eyes shining more brightly for the mist which was in them Fresh with me Why you poor one horned yearling d you think there s anybody in Eldara man enough to get fresh with me Bert retreated a step caution was a moving element in his nature From a vantage point behind a table however he ventured Then what is wrong Her woe apparently was greater than her wrath She said sadly I dunno Bert I ain t the man I used to be I mean the woman He waited his small eyes gentle What woman can altogether resist sympathy even from a fat man and a cook Not even the redoubtable soul of a Sally She confessed I feel sort of hollow and gone around the stomach Fatty Eat suggested the cook I just took out a pie that would But it ain t the stomach It s like bein hungry and wantin no food Fatty d you think I m sick You look kind of whitish Fatty I feel She hesitated as though too great a confession were at her lips but she stumbled on I feel as if I was afraid of somethin or someone That said Bert confidently ain t possible It s the stomach Sally Something ain t agreed with you She turned from him with a vague gesture of despair If this here feelin is goin to keep up why I wisht I was dead I wisht I was dead She went on to the swinging door paused there to dab her eyes swiftly started to whistle a tune and in this fashion marched back to the eating room Fatty turning back to the stove shook his head he was more than ever convinced in his secret theory that all women are crazy Sally found that a new man had entered one whom she could not remember having seen before She went to him at once for it seemed to her that she would die indeed if she had to look much longer on the familiar unshaven faces of the other men in the room Anything you got said the stranger who was broad of hands and thick of neck and he cast an anxious eye on her I hear you seen something of a thinnish dark feller named Bard What d you want with him asked Sally with dangerous calm I was aimin to meet up with him That s all Partner if you want to stand in solid around here don t let out that you re a friend of his He ain t none too popular that s straight and puttin it nice and easy Which who said I was his friend said the other with heat She turned away to the kitchen and reappeared shortly bearing his meal The frown with which she departed had disappeared and she was smiling as brightly as ever while she arranged the dishes in front of him He paid no attention to the food Now she said resting both hands on the table and leaning so that she could look him directly in the eye What s Bard done now Horse gun fighter woman which The other loosened the bandanna which circled his bull neck Woman he said hoarsely and the blood swelled his throat and face with veins of purple Ah h h drawled the girl and straightening she dropped both hands on her hips It was a struggle but she managed to summon another smile Wife sister sweetheart The man stared dubiously on her and Sally mother to five hundred wild rangers knew the symptoms of a man eager for a confidant She slipped into the opposite chair It might be any of the three she went on gently and I know because I ve seen him work Damn his soul growled the other by way of a prefix to his story It ain t any of the three with me This Bard maybe he tried his hand with you Whether it was rage or scorn that made her start and redden he could not tell Me she repeated A tenderfoot get fresh with me Stranger you ain t been long in Eldara or you wouldn t pull a bonehead like that Scuse me I was hopin that maybe you took a fall out of him that s all He studied the blue eyes They had been tinted with ugly green a moment before but now they were clear deep dark guileless blue He could not resist The very nearness of the woman was like a gentle cool hand caressing his forehead and rubbing away the troubles It was like this he began Me and Lizzie had been thick for a couple of years and was jest waitin till I d corralled enough cash for a start Then the other day along comes this feller Bard with a queer way of talkin school language Made you feel like you was readin a bit out of a dictionary jest to listen to him for a minute Liz she never heard nothin like it I figure She got all eyes and sat still and listened Bein like that he plumb made a fool out of Liz Kidded her along and wound up by kissing her good bye I didn t see none of this I jest heard about it later When I come up and started talkin jest friendly with Liz she got sore and passed me the frosty stare I didn t think she could be doin more than kiddin me a bit so I kept right on and it ended up with Liz sayin that all was over between us He paused on his tragedy set his teeth over a sigh and went on The feller ain t no good I know that from a chap that come to the house a few hours after Bard left Nash was his name What Nash Feller built husky around the shoulders looks like a fighter Know him Pretty well D you say he come to your house right after Bard left it Yep Why How long ago was this About three days Three days What s wrong Nothin You look like you was goin to murder some one lady Her laughter ended with a jerk and jar Maybe I am G wan Tell me some more about what Nash said Why he didn t say much Hinted around that maybe Bard had walked off with the piebald hoss he was ridin That s a lie Lady said the other a little coldly you say that like you was a friend of Bard s Me There ain t nobody around these parts man enough to say to my face that I m a friend of that tenderfoot I m glad of that My name s Ralph Boardman I m Sally Fortune Sure I ve heard of you a lot Say you couldn t tip me off where I could hit the trail of Bard Dunno Wait lemme see She studied with closed eyes What she was thinking was that if Nash had been so close to Bard three days before he was surely on the trail of the tenderfoot and certainly that meeting in her place had not been a casual one She set her teeth thinking of the promise Nash had given to her Undoubtedly he had laughed at it afterward And now Bard probably lay stretched on his back somewhere among the silent hills looking up to the pitiless brightness of the sky with eyes which could never shut The hollow feeling of which Sally had complained to Bert grew to a positive ache and the tears stood up closer to her eyes Wait around town she said in a changed voice I think I heard him say something of riding out but he ll be back before long That s the only tip I can give you partner So she rose and hurried back to the kitchen Bert she said I m off for the rest of the day You got to handle the place He panted But the heavy rush it ain t started yet It s started for me What d you mean Nothin I m on my way S long Bert Back in the mornin bright and early If she could not find Bard at least she could find Nash at the ranch of Drew and in that direction she headed her racing horse CHAPTER XXIX THE SHOW Jansen the big Swede was the first to finish his meal in Drew s dining room For that matter he was always first He ate with astonishing expedition lowering his head till that tremendous shapeless mouth was close to the plate and then working knife and fork alternately with an unfaltering industry To night spurred on by a desire to pass through this mechanical effort and be prepared for the coming action his speed was something truly marvellous He did not appear to eat the food simply vanished from the plate it was absorbed like a mist before the wind While the others were barely growing settled in their places Jansen was already through He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand produced Durham and papers and proceeded to light up Lawlor struggling still to re establish himself in the eyes of Bard as the real William Drew seized the opportunity to exert a show of authority He smashed his big fist on the table Jansen he roared Eh grunted the Swede Where was you raised Me You square head Elvaruheimarstadhaven Are you sneezin or talkin English Jansen irritated bellowed Elvaruheimarstadhaven That s where I was born That s where you was born Elvaru damn such a language No wonder you Swedes don t know nothin It takes all your time learnin how to talk your lingo But if you ain t never had no special trainin in manners I m goin to make a late start with you now Put out that cigarette The pale eyes of Jansen stared fascinated the vast mouth fell agape Maybe he began and then finished weakly I be damned There ain t no reasonable way of doubtin that unless you put out that smoke Hear me Shorty Kilrain coming from the kitchen grinned broadly Having felt the lash of discipline himself he was glad to see it fall in another place He continued his gleeful course around that side of the table And big Jansen slowly imperturbably raised the cigarette and inhaled a mighty cloud of smoke which issued at once in a rushing fine blue mist impelled by a snort Maybe he rumbled completing his thought maybe you re one damn fool I m going to learn you who s boss in these parts boomed Lawlor Put out that cigarette Don t you know no better than to smoke at the table Jansen pushed back his chair and started to rise There was no doubt as to his intentions they were advertised in the dull and growing red which flamed in his face But Kilrain as though he had known such a moment would come caught the Swede by the shoulders and forced him back into the chair As he did so he whispered something in the ear of Jansen Let him go bellowed Lawlor Let him come on Don t hold him I ain t had work for my hands for five years I need exercise I do The mouth of Jansen stirred but no words came A hopeless yearning was in his eyes But he dropped the cigarette and ground it under his heel I thought growled Lawlor that you knew your master but don t make no mistake again Speakin personal I don t think no more of knockin down a Swede than I do of flickin the ashes off n a cigar He indulged in a side glance at Bard to see if the latter were properly impressed but Anthony was staring blankly straight before him unable to all appearances to see anything of what was happening Kilrain went on Lawlor trot out some cigars You know where they re kept Kilrain falling to the temptation asked Where s the key to the cabinet For Drew kept his tobacco in a small cabinet locked because of long experience with tobacco loving employees Lawlor started to speak checked himself fumbled through his pockets and then roared Smash the door open I misplaced the key No semblance of a smile altered the faces of the cowpunchers around the table but glances of vague meaning were interchanged Kilrain reappeared almost at once bearing a large box of cigars under each arm The eats bein over announced Lawlor we can now light up Open them boxes Shorty Am I goin to work on you the rest of my life teachin you how to serve cigars Kilrain sighed deeply but obeyed presenting the open boxes in turn to Bard who thanked him and to Lawlor who bit off the end of his smoke continued A match Kilrain And he waited swelling with pleasure his eyes fixed upon space Kilrain lighted a match and held it for the two in turn Two rows of waiting expectant eyes were turned from the whole length of the table toward the cigars Shall I pass on the cigars suggested Bard These smokes breathed Lawlor Waste em on common hands Partner you ain t serious are you A breath like the faint sighing of wind reached them the cowpunchers were resigned and started now to roll their Durham But it seemed as if a chuckle came from above it was only some sound in the gasoline lamp a big fixture which hung suspended by a slender chain from the centre of the ceiling and immediately above the table Civilizin cowpunchers went on Lawlor tilting back in his chair and bracing his feet against the edge of the table civilizin cowpunchers is worse n breakin mustangs They s some that say it can t be done But look at this crew Do they look like rough uns A stir had passed among the cowpunchers and solemn stares of hate transfixed Lawlor but he went on I m askin you do these look rough I should say answered Bard courteously that you have a pretty experienced lot of cattle men Experienced Well they ll pass They ve had experience with bar whisky and talkin to their cards at poker but aside from bein pretty much drunks and crookin the cards they ain t anything uncommon But when I got em they was wild they was Why if I d talked like this in front of em they d of been guns pulled But look at em now I ask you Look at em now Ain t they tame They hear me call em what they are but they don t even bat an eye Yes sir I ve tamed em They took a lot of lickin but now they re tamed Hello For through the door stalked a newcomer He paused and cast a curious eye up the table to Lawlor What the hell he remarked naively Where s the chief Fired bellowed Lawlor without a moment of hesitation Who fired him asked the new man with an expectant smile like one who waits for the point of a joke but he caught a series of strange signals from men at the table and many a broad wink I fired him Gregory answered Lawlor I fired Nash He turned to Bard You see he said rather weakly the boys is used to callin Nash the chief Ah yes said Bard I understand And Lawlor felt that he did understand and too well Gregory in the meantime silenced by the mysterious signs from his fellow cowpunchers took his place and began eating without another word No one spoke to him but as if he caught the tenseness of the situation his eyes finally turned and glanced up the table to Bard It was easy for Anthony to understand that glance It is the sort of look which the curious turn on the man accused of a great crime and sitting in the court room guilty His trial in silence had continued until he was found guilty Apparently he was now to be both judged and executed at the same time There could not be long delay The entrance of Gregory had almost been the precipitant of action and though it had been smoothed over to an extent still the air was each moment more charged with suspense The men were lighting their second cigarette With each second it grew clearer that they were waiting for something And as if thoughtful of the work before them they no longer talked so fluently Finally there was no talk at all save for sporadic outbursts and the blue smoke and the brown curled up slowly in undisturbed drifts toward the ceiling until a bright halo formed around the gasoline lamp A childish thought came to Bard that where the smoke was so thick the fire could not be long delayed A second form appeared in the doorway lithe graceful and the light made her hair almost golden Ev nin fellers called Sally jauntily Hello Lawlor what you doin at the head of the table CHAPTER XXX THE LAMP The bluff was ended It was as if the wind blew a cloud suddenly from the face of the sun and let the yellow sunlight pour brightly over the world so everyone in the room at the voice of Sally knew that the time had come for action There was no vocal answer to her but each man rose slowly in his place his gun naked in his hand and every face was turned to Bard Gentlemen he said in his soft voice I see that my friend Lawlor has not wasted his lessons in manners At least you know enough to rise when a lady enters the room His gun held at the hip pointed straight down the table to the burly form of Jansen but his eyes like those of a pugilist seemed to be taking in every face at the table and each man felt in some subtle manner that the danger would fall first on him They did not answer but hands were tightening around revolver butts Lawlor moved back pace by pace his revolver shaking in his hand But went on Bard you are all facing me Is it possible He laughed I knew that mister Drew was very anxious to receive me with courtesy I did not dream that he would be able to induce so many men to take care of me And Sally Fortune bracing herself against the wall with one hand and in the capable grasp of the other a six gun balanced stared in growing amazement on the scene and shuddered at the silences Bard she called what have I done You ve started a game he answered which I presume we ve all been waiting to play What about it boys I hope you re well paid I d hate to die a cheap death A voice deep and ringing sounded close at hand almost within the room and from a direction which Bard could not locate Don t harm him if you can help it But keep him in that room Bard stepped back a pace till his shoulders touched the wall Sirs he said if you keep me here you will most certainly have to harm me A figure ran around the edge of the crowd and stood beside him Stand clear of me Sally he muttered much moved Stand away This is a man s work The work of a pack of coyotes she cried shrilly What d ye mean She turned on them fiercely Are you goin to murder a tenderfoot among you One that ain t done no real harm I don t believe my eyes You there Shorty Kilrain I ve waited on you with my own hands You ve played the man with me Are you goin to play the dog now Jansen you was tellin me about a blue eyed girl in Sweden have you forgot about her now And Calamity Ben My God ain t there a man among you to step over here and join the two of us They were shaken but the memory of Drew quelled them They s no harm intended him on my honour Sally said Lawlor All he s got to do is give up his gun and and he finished weakly let his hands be tied Is that all said Sally scornfully Don t follow me Sally said Bard Stay out of this Boys you may have been paid high but I don t think you ve been paid high enough to risk taking a chance with me If you put me out with the first shot that ends it of course but the chances are that I ll be alive when I hit the floor and if I am I ll have my gun working and I won t miss One or two of you are going to drop He surveyed them with a quick glance which seemed to linger on each face I don t know who ll go first But now I m going to walk straight for that door and I m going out of it He moved slowly deliberately toward the door around the table Still they did not shoot Bard commanded the voice which had spoken from nowhere before Stop where you are Are you fool enough to think that I ll let you go Are you William Drew I am and you are The son of John Bard Are you in this house I am Bard listen to me for thirty seconds Not for three Sally go out of this room and through that door There was a grim command in his voice It started her moving against her will She paused and looked back with an imploring gesture Go on he repeated And she passed out of the door and stood there a glimmering figure against the night Still there was not a shot fired though all those guns were trained on Bard You ve got me Drew he called but I ve got you and your hirelings all of you and I m going to take you to hell with me to hell He jerked his gun up and fired not at a man for the bullet struck the thin chain which held the gasoline lamp suspended struck it with a clang and it rushed down to the table It struck but not with the loud explosion which Bard had expected There was a dull report as of a shot fired at a great distance the scream of Sally from the door and then liquid fire spurted from the lamp across the table whipped in a flare to the ceiling and licked against the walls It shot to all sides but it shot high and every man was down on his face Anthony scarcely believing that he was still alive rushed for the door with a cry of agony ringing in his ears from the voice beyond the room One man in all that crowd was near enough or had the courage to obey the master even to the uttermost The gaunt form of Calamity Ben blocked the doorway in front of Bard blocked it with poised revolver Halt he yelled But the other rushed on Calamity whipped down the gun and fired but even before the trigger was pulled he was sagging toward the floor for Bard had shot to kill Over the prostrate form of the cowpuncher he leaped and into the night where the white face of Sally greeted him Outside the red inferno of that room as if the taste of blood had maddened him he raised his arms and shouted like one crying a wild prayer William Drew William Drew Come out to me Small strong hands gripped his wrists and turned him away from the house You fool cried Sally Ride for it You ve raised your hell at last I knew you would Red light flared in all the windows of the dining room shouts and groans and cursing poured out of them Bard turned and followed her out toward the stable on the run and he heard her moaning as she ran I knew I knew She mounted her horse which was tethered near the barn He chose at random the first horse he reached a grey threw on his back the saddle which hung from the peg behind mounted and they were off through the night No thought no direction but only in blind speed there seemed to be the hope of a salvation A mile two miles dropped behind them and then in an open stretch for he had outridden her somewhat Anthony reined back caught the bridle of her horse and pulled it down to a sharp trot Why have you come Their faces were so close that even through the night he could see the grim set of her lips Ain t you raised your hell the hell you was hungry to raise Don t you need help What I ve done is my own doing I ll take the burden of it You ll take a halter for it that s what you ll take The whole range ll rise for this You re marked already Everywhere you ve gone you ve made an enemy They ll be out to get you Nash Boardman the whole gang Let em come I d do this all over again Born gunman eh Bard you ain t got a week to live It was fierceness it was a reproach rather than sorrow Then let me go my own way Why do you follow Sally D you know these mountains No but Then they d run you down in twelve hours Where ll you head for He said as the first thought entered his mind I ll go for the old house that Drew has on the other side of the range That ain t bad Know the short cut What cut You can make it in five hours over one trail But of course you don t know Nobody but old Dan and me ever knowed it Let go my bridle and ride like hell She jerked the reins away from him and galloped off at full speed He followed Sally he called But she kept straight ahead and he followed shouting imploring her to go back Finally he settled to the chase resolved on overtaking her It was no easy task for she rode like a centaur and she knew the way CHAPTER XXXI NASH STARTS THE FINISH Through the windows and the door the cowpunchers fled from the red spurt of the flames each man for himself except Shorty Kilrain who stooped gathered the lanky frame of Calamity Ben into his arms and staggered out with his burden The great form of William Drew loomed through the night His hand on the shoulder of Shorty he cried Is he badly burned Shot said Kilrain bitterly by the tenderfoot done for It was strange to hear the big voice go shrill with pain Shot By Anthony Give him to me Kilrain lowered his burden to the ground You ve got him murdered Ain t you through with him Calamity he was my pal But the big man thrust him aside and knelt by the stricken cowpuncher He commanded Gather the boys form a line of buckets from the pump fight that fire It hasn t a hold on the house yet The habit of obedience persisted in Kilrain Under the glow of the fire excited by the red light the other man stood irresolute eager for action but not knowing what to do A picture came back to him of a ship labouring in a storm the huddling men on the deck the mate on the bridge shrieking his orders through a megaphone He cupped his hands at his mouth and began to bark orders They obeyed on the run Some rushed for the kitchen and secured buckets two manned the big pump and started a great gush of water in a moment a steady stream was being flung by the foremost men of the line against the smoking walls and even the ceiling of the dining room So far it was the oil itself which had made most of the flame and smoke and now although the big table was on fire the main structure of the house was hardly touched They caught it in time and worked with a cheer swinging the buckets from hand to hand shouting as the flames fell little by little until the floor of the room was awash the walls gave back clouds of steam and the only fire was that which smouldered along the ruined table Even this went out hissing at last and they came back with blackened singed faces to Calamity and Drew The rancher had torn away the coat and shirt of the wounded man and now with much labour was twisting a tight bandage around his chest At every turn Calamity groaned feebly Kilrain dropped beside his partner taking the head between his hands Calamity pal he said how d you let a tenderfoot a damned tenderfoot do this The other sighed I dunno I had him covered I should have sent him to hell But sure shootin is better n fast shootin He nailed me fair and square while I was blockin him at the door How d you feel Done for Shorty but damned glad that His voice died away in a horrible whisper and bubbles of red foam rose to his lips God groaned Shorty and then called loudly as if the strength of his voice might recall the other Calamity The eyes of Calamity rolled up the wide lips twisted over formless words there was no sound from his mouth Someone was holding a lantern whose light fell full on the silent struggle It was Nash his habitual sneer grown more malevolent than ever What of the feller that done it Shorty he suggested So help me God said the cattleman with surprising softness the range ain t big enough to keep him away from me Drew completing his bandage said That s enough of such talk Nash Let it drop there Here Kilrain take his feet Help me into the house with him They moved in the rest trailing behind like sheep after a bell weather and it was astonishing to see the care with which big Drew handled his burden placing it at last on his own four poster bed The old man s all busted up said little Duffy to Nash I d never of guessed he was so fond of Calamity You re a fool answered Nash It ain t Calamity he cares about Then what the devil is it I dunno We re goin to see some queer things around here Drew having disposed of the wounded man carefully raising his head on a pillow turned to the others Who saw Ben shot I did said Kilrain who was making his way to the door Come back here Are you sure you saw the shot fired I seen the tenderfoot damn his eyes whip up his gun and take a snap shot while he was runnin for the door where Calamity stood Nash raised his lantern high so that the light fell full on the face of Drew The rancher was more grey than ever He said with almost an appeal in his voice Mightn t it have been one of the other boys shooting at random The tone of Kilrain raised and grew ugly Are you tryin to cover the tenderfoot Drew The big man made a fierce gesture Why should I cover him Because you been actin damned queer answered Nash Ah you re here again Nash I know you hate Bard because he was too much for you He got the start of me but I ll do a lot of finishing Kilrain called Drew you re Calamity s best friend Ride for Eldara and bring back doctor Young Quick We re going to pull Ben through Jest a waste of time said Nash coolly He s got one foot in hell already You ve said too much Nash Kilrain are you going I ll stop for the doctor at Eldara but then I ll keep on riding What do you mean Nothin I ll go with you said Nash and turned with the other Stop called Drew Boys I know what you have planned but let the law take care of this Remember that we were the aggressors against young Bard He came peaceably into this house and I tried to hold him here What would you have done in his place They s a dozen men know how peaceable he is said Nash drily Wherever he s gone on the range he s raised hell He s cut out for a killer and Glendin in Eldara knows it I ll talk to Glendin In the meantime you fellows keep your hands off Bard In the first place because if you take the law into your own hands you ll have me against you understand Kilrain and Nash glowered at him a moment and then backed through the door As they hurried for the barn Kilrain asked What makes the chief act soft to that hell raiser If you have a feller cut out for your own meat answered Nash d you want to have any one else step in and take your meal away But you and me Steve we ll get this bird We ll get Glendin behind us first Why him Play safe Glendin can swear us in as deputies to apprehend as he calls it this Bard Apprehendin a feller like Bard simply means to shoot him down and ask him to come along afterward see Nash you got a great head You ought to be one of these lawyers There ain t nothin you can t find a way out of But will Glendin do it He ll do what I ask him to do Friend of yours Better n a friend Got something on him These here questions they ain t polite Shorty grinned Nash All right You do the leadin in this game and I ll jest follow suit But lay your course with nothin but the tops ls flyin because I ve got an idea we re goin to hit a hell of a storm before we get back to port Steve For my part answered Nash I m gettin used to rough weather They saddled their horses and cut across the hills straight for Eldara Kilrain spurred viciously and the roan had hard work keeping up Hold in called Nash after a time Save your hoss Shorty This ain t no short trail D you notice the hosses when we was in the barn Nope Bard took Duffy s grey and the grey can go like the devil Hoss liftin That s another little mark on Bard s score CHAPTER XXXII TO APPREHEND A MAN As if to make up for its silence of the blast when the two reached it late the night before Eldara was going full that evening Kilrain went straight for Doc Young to bring him later to join Nash at the house of Deputy Glendin The front of the deputy s house was utterly dark but Nash unabashed knocked loudly on the door and went immediately to the rear of the place He was in time to see a light wink out at an upper window of the two story shack He slipped back chuckling among the trees and waited until the back door slammed and a dark figure ran noiselessly down the steps and out into the night Then he returned still chuckling to the front of the house and banged again on the door A window above him raised at length and a drawling voice apparently overcome with sleep called down What s up in Eldara Nash answered Everything s wrong Deputy Glendin he sits up in a back room playin poker and hittin the redeye No wonder Eldara s goin to hell A muffled cursing rolled down to the cowpuncher and then a sharp challenge Who s there Nash you blockhead Nash cried a relieved voice come in confound you I thought no matter what I thought Come in Nash opened the door and went up the stairs The deputy met him clad in a bathrobe and carrying a lamp Under the bathrobe he was fully dressed Thought your game was called eh grinned the cattleman Sure I had a tidy little thing in black jack running and was pulling in the iron boys one after another Why didn t you tip me off You could have sat in with us Nope I m here on business Let s have it He led the way into a back room and placed the lamp on a table littered with cards and a black bottle looming in the centre Drink Nope I said I came on business What kind Bard I thought so I want a posse What s he done Killed Calamity Ben at Drew s place started a fire that near burned the house and lifted Duffy s hoss Glendin whistled softly Nice little start Sure and it s just a beginnin for this Bard I ll go out to Drew s place and see what he s done And then start after him with a gang Sure By that time he ll be a thousand miles away Well I m running this little party Let me get a gang together You can swear em in and put me in charge I ll guarantee to get him before morning Glendin shook his head It ain t legal Steve You know that The hell with legality That s what you say but I got to hold my job You ll do your part by goin to Drew s place with Doc Young He ll be here with Shorty Kilrain in a minute And let you go after Bard Right Far s I know you may jest shoot him down and then come back and say you done it because he resisted arrest Well You admit that s what you want Steve Absolute Well partner it can t be done That ain t apprehendin a man It s jest plain murder D you think you could ever catch that bird alive Dunno I d try Never in a thousand years He don t know the country He ll travel in a circle and I ll ride him down He s got somebody with him that knows the country better n you or me Who The face of Nash twisted into an ugly grimace Sally Fortune The hell It is but it s true It ain t possible Sally ain t the kind to make a fool of herself about any man let alone a gun fighter That s what I thought but I seen her back up this Bard ag in a roomful of men And she ll keep on backin him till he s got his toes turned up That s another reason for you to get Bard eh Well I can t send you after him Nash That s final Not a bit I know too much about you Glendin The glance of the other raised slowly fixed on Nash and then lowered to the floor He produced papers and Durham rolled and lighted his cigarette and inhaled a long puff So that s the game Steve I hate to do it Let that go You ll run the limit on this Listen Glendin I ve got to get this Bard He s out ridden me out shot me out gamed me out lucked me out guessed me and taken Sally He s mine He b longs all to me D you see that I m only seein one thing just now I know You think I m double crossin you Maybe I am but I m desperate Glendin After all mused the deputy you d be simply doin work I d have to do later You re right about this Bard He ll never be taken alive Good ol Glendin I knew you d see light I ll go out and get the boys I want in ten minutes Wait here Shorty and Doc Young will come in a minute One thing more when you get to Drew s place you ll find him actin queer What about I dunno why It s a bad mess You see he s after this Bard himself the way I figure it and he wants him left alone He d raise hell if he knew a posse was after the tenderfoot Drew s a bad one to get against me I know You think I m double crossin I ll do it But this squares all scores between us Steve Right It leaves the debt on my side and you know I ve never dodged an I O U Drew may talk queer He ll tell you that Bard done all that work in self defence Did he The point is he killed a man and stole a hoss No matter what comes of it he s got to be arrested don t he And shot down while resistin arrest Steve I d hate to have you out for me like this But you won t listen to Drew Not this one time But Lord man I hate to face him if he s on the warpath Who ll you take with you Shorty of course He was Calamity Ben s pal The rest will be don t laugh Butch Conklin and his gang Butch Hold yourself together That s what I mean Butch Conklin After you dropped him the other night Self defence and he knows it I can find Butch and I can make him go with me Besides he s out for Bard himself The deputy said with much meaning You can do a lot of queer things Nash Forget it Glendin I will for a while D you really think I can let you take out Butch and his gunmen ag in Bard Why they re ten times worse n the tenderfoot Maybe but there s nothin proved ag in em nothin but a bit of cattle liftin maybe and things like that The point is they re all hard men and with em along I can t help but get Bard Murder ain t proved on Butch and his men but it will be before long Wait till it s proved In the meantime use em all You ve a long head Nash Glendin I m makin the biggest play of my life I m off to find Butch You ll stand firm with Drew I won t hear a word he says S long Be back in ten minutes Wait for me He was as good as his word Even before the ten minutes had elapsed he was back and behind followed a crew of heavy thumping boots up the stairs of Glendin s house and into the room where he sat with doctor Young and Shorty Kilrain They rose but not from respect when Nash entered with Conklin and his four ill famed followers behind The soiled bandage on the head of Butch was far too thick to allow his hat to sit in its normal position It was perched high on top and secured in place by a bit of string which passed from side to side under the chin Behind him came Lovel an almost albino type with straw coloured hair and eyes bleached and passionless the vacuous smile was never gone from his lips More feared and more hated than Conklin himself was Isaacs The latter always fastidious wore a blue striped vest without a coat to obscure it and about his throat was knotted a flaming vermilion necktie fastened in place with a diamond stickpin obviously the spoil of some recent robbery Glendin watching ground his teeth McNamara followed He had been a squatter but his family had died of a fever and McNamara s mind had been unsettled ever since whisky had finished the work of sending him on the downward path with Conklin s little crew of desperadoes Men shrank from facing those too bright wandering eyes yet it was from pity almost as much as horror Finally came Ufert He was merely a round faced boy of nineteen proud of the distinguished bad company he kept He was that weak minded type which is only strong when it becomes wholly evil With a different leadership he would have become simply a tobacco chewing hanger on at cross roads saloons and general merchandise stores As it was feeling dignified by the brotherhood of crime into which he had been admitted as a full member and eager to prove his qualifications he was as dangerous as any member of the crew The three men who were already in the room had been prepared by Glendin for this new arrival but the fact was almost too much for their credence Consequently they rose and doctor Young muttered at the ear of Glendin Is it possible Deputy Glendin that you re going to use these fellows A thief to catch a thief whispered Glendin in reply He said aloud Butch I ve been looking for you for a long time but I really never expected to see you quite as close as this You ve said it grinned Butch I ain t been watchin for you real close but now that I see you you look more or less like a man should look H ware ye Glendin He held out his hand but the deputy shifting his position seemed to overlook the grimy proffered palm You fellows know that you re wanted by the law he said frowning on them A grim meaning rose in the vacuous eye of Lovel Isaacs caressed his diamond pin smiling in a sickly fashion McNamara s wandering stare fixed and grew unhumanly bright Ufert openly dropped his hand on his gun butt and stood sullenly defiant You know that you re wanted and you know why went on Glendin but I ve decided to give you a chance to prove that you re white men and useful citizens Nash has already told you what we want It s work for seven men against one but that one man is apt to give you all plenty to do If you are successful he stammered a little over the right word what you have done in the past will be forgotten Hold up your right hands and repeat after me And they repeated the oath after him in a broken drawling chorus stumbling over the formal legal phraseology He ended and then Nash you re in charge of the gang Do what you want to with them and remember that you re to get Bard back in town unharmed if possible Butch Conklin smiled and the same smile spread grimly from face to face among the gang Evidently this point had already been elucidated to them by Nash who now mustered them out of the house and assembled them on their horses in the street below Which way do we travel asked Shorty Kilrain reining close beside the leader as though he were anxious to disestablish any relationship with the rest of the party Two ways answered Nash Of course I don t know what way Bard headed because he s got the girl with him but I figure it this way if a tenderfoot knows any part of the range at all he ll go in that direction after he s in trouble I ve seen it work out before So I think that Bard may have ridden straight for the old Drew place on the other side of the range I know a short cut over the hills we can reach there by morning Kilrain you ll go there with me It may be that Bard will go near the old place but not right to it Chances may be good that he ll put up at some place near the old ranchhouse but not right on the spot Jerry Wood he s got a house about four or five miles to the north of Drew s old ranch Butch you take your men and ride for Wood s place Then switch south and ride for Partridge s store if we miss him at Drew s old house we ll go on and join you at Partridge s store and then double back He ll be somewhere inside that circle and Eldara you can lay to that Now boys are your hosses fresh They were Then ride and don t spare the spurs Hoss flesh is cheaper n your own hides The cavalcade separated and galloped in two directions through the town of Eldara CHAPTER XXXIII NOTHING NEW Glendin and doctor Young struck out for the ranch of William Drew but they held a moderate pace and it was already grey dawn before they arrived yet even at that hour several windows of the house were lighted They were led directly to Drew s room The big man welcomed them at the door with a hand raised for silence He seemed to have aged greatly during the night but between the black shadows beneath and the shaggy brows above his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever About his mouth the lines of resolution were worn deep by his vigil He seems to be sleeping rather well though you hear his breathing It was a soft but ominously rattling sound Through the lungs said the doctor instantly The cowpuncher was completely covered except for his head and feet On the latter oddly enough were still his grimy boots blackening the white sheets on which they rested I tried to work them off you see the laces are untied explained Drew but the poor fellow recovered consciousness at once and struggled to get his feet free He said that he wants to die with his boots on You tried his pulse and his temperature whispered the doctor Yes The temperature is not much above normal the pulse is extremely rapid and very faint Is that a bad sign Very bad Drew winced and caught his breath so sharply that the others stared at him It might have been thought that he had just heard his own death sentence pronounced He explained Ben has been with me a number of years It breaks me up to think of losing him like this The doctor took the pulse of Calamity with lightly touching fingers that did not waken the sleeper then he felt with equal caution the forehead of Ben Well asked Drew eagerly The chances are about one out of ten It drew a groan from the rancher But there is still some hope The doctor shook his head and carefully unwound the bandages He examined the wound with care and then made a dressing and recovered the little purple spot so small that a five cent piece would have covered it Tell me demanded Drew as Young turned at length The bullet passed right through the body eh Yes He ought to have been dead hours ago I can t understand it But since he s still alive we ll go on hoping Hope whispered Drew It was as if he had received the promise of heaven such brightness fell across his haggard face There s no use attempting to explain answered Young An ordinary man would have died almost instantly but the lungs of some of these rangers seem to be lined with leather I suppose they are fairly embalmed with excessive cigarette smoking The constant work in the open air toughens them wonderfully As I said the chances are about one out of ten but I m only astonished that there is any chance at all Doctor I ll make you rich for this My dear sir I ve done nothing it has been your instant care that saved him as far as he is saved I ll tell you what to continue doing for him in half an hour I must leave Drew smiled faintly Not till he s well or dead doctor I didn t quite catch that You won t leave the room Young till this man is dead or on the way to recovery Come come mister Drew I have patients who I tell you there is no one else Until a decision comes in this case your world is bounded by the four walls of this room That s final Is it possible that you would attempt Anything is possible with me Make up your mind You shall not leave this man till you ve done all that s humanly possible for him mister Drew I appreciate your anxiety but this is stepping too far I have an officer of the law with me Better do what he wants Doc said Glendin uneasily Don t mouth words ordered Drew sternly There lies your sick man Get to work In this I m as unalterable as the rocks The bill will be large said Young sullenly for he began to see that it was as futile to resist the grey giant as it would have been to attempt to stop the progress of a landslide I ll pay you double what you wish to charge Does this man s life mean so much to you A priceless thing If you save him you take the burden of murder off the soul of another I ll do what I can I know you will He laid the broad hand on Young s shoulder Doctor you must do more than you can you must accomplish the impossible I tell you it is impossible for this man to die he must live He turned to Glendin I suppose you want the details of what happened here Right Follow me Doctor I ll be gone only a moment He led the way into an adjoining room and lighted a lamp The sudden flare cast deep shadows on the face leaning above and Glendin started For the moment it seemed to him that he was seeing a face which had looked on hell and lived to speak of it mister Drew he said you d better hit the hay yourself you look pretty badly done up The other looked up with a singular smile clenching and unclenching his fingers as if he strove to relax muscles which had been tense for hours Glendin the surface of my strength has not been scratched I could keep going every hour for ten days if it would save the life of the poor fellow who lies in there He took a long breath Now then let s get after this business I ll tell you the naked facts Anthony Bard was approaching my house yesterday and word of his coming was brought to me For reasons of my own it was necessary that I should detain him here for an uncertain length of time For other reasons it was necessary that I go to any length to accomplish my ends I had another man Lawlor who looks something like me take my place in the eyes of Bard But Bard grew suspicious of the deception Finally a girl entered and called Lawlor by name as they were sitting at the table with all the men around them Bard rose at once with a gun in his hand Put yourself in his place He found that he had been deceived he knew that he was surrounded by armed men he must have felt like a cornered rat He drew his gun and started for the door warning the others that he meant to go the limit in order to get free Mind you it was no sudden gun play Then I ordered the men to keep him at all costs within the room He saw that they were prepared to obey me and then he took a desperate chance and shot down the gasoline lamp which hung over the table In the explosion and fire which resulted he made for the door One man blocked the way levelled a revolver at him and then Bard shot in self defence and downed Calamity Ben I ask you Glendin is that self defence The other drummed his finger tips nervously against his chin he was thinking hard and every thought was of Steve Nash So far all right I ain t askin your reasons for doin some pretty queer things mister Drew I ll stand every penalty of the law sir I only ask that you see that punishment falls where it is deserved only The case is clear Bard acted in self defence Glendin was desperate He said at length When a man s tried in court they bring up his past career This feller Bard has gone along the range raisin a different brand of hell everywhere he went He had a run in with two gunmen Ferguson and Conklin He had Eldara within an ace of a riot the first night he hit the town mister Drew that chap looks the part of a killer he acts the part of a killer and by God he is a killer You seem to have come with your mind already made up Glendin said the rancher coldly Not a bit But go through the whole town or Eldara and ask the boys what they think of this tenderfoot They feel so strong that if he was jailed they d lynch him Drew raised a clenched fist and then let his arm fall suddenly limp at his side Then surely he must not be jailed Want me to let him wander around loose and kill another man in self defence I want you to use reason and mercy Glendin From what I ve heard you ain t the man to talk of mercy mister Drew The other as if he had received a stunning blow slipped into a chair and buried his face in his hands It was a long moment before he could speak and when his hands were lowered Glendin winced at what he saw in the other s face God knows I m not said Drew Suppose we let the shootin of Calamity go What of hoss liftin sir Horse stealing Impossible Anthony he could not be guilty of it Ask your man Duffy Bard s ridin Duffy s grey right now But Duffy will press no claim said the rancher eagerly I ll see to that I ll pay him ten times the value of his horse Glendin you can t punish a man for a theft of which Duffy will not complain Drew you know what the boys on the range think of a hoss thief It ain t the price of what they steal it s the low down soul of the dog that would steal it It ain t the money But what s a man without a hoss on the range Suppose his hoss is stole while he s hundred miles from nowhere What does it mean You know it means dyin of thirst and goin through a hundred hells before the finish I say shootin a man is nothin compared with stealin a hoss A man that ll steal a hoss will shoot his own brother that s what he ll do But I don t need to tell you You know it better n me What was it you done with your own hands to Louis Borgen the hoss rustler back ten years ago A dead voice answered Glendin What has set you on the trail of Bard His own wrong doin The rancher waved a hand of careless dismissal I know you Glendin he said The deputy stirred in his chair and then cleared his throat He said in a rising tone What d you know I don t think you really care to hear it To put it lightly Glendin you ve done many things for money I don t accuse you of them But if you want to do one thing more you can make more money at a stroke than you ve made in all the rest With all his soul the deputy was cursing Nash but now the thing was done and he must see it through He rose glowering on Drew I ve stood a pile already from you this is one beyond the limit Bribery ain t my way Drew no matter what I ve done before Is it war then And Glendin answered forcing his tone into fierceness Anything you want any way you want it Glendin said the other with a sudden lowering of his voice has some other man been talking to you Who Me Certainly not Don t lie Drew rein up They s one thing no man can say to me and get away with it I tell you man I m holding myself in harder than I ve ever done before Answer me He did not even rise but Glendin his hand twitching close to the butt of his gun moved step by step away from those keen eyes Answer me Nash he s been to Eldara I might have known He told you about this Yes And you re going the full limit of your power against Bard I ll do nothin that ain t been done by others before me Glendin there have been cowardly legal murders before Tell me at least that you will not send a posse to apprehend Bard until it s learned whether or not Ben will die and whether or not Duffy will press the charge of horse stealing Glendin was at the door He fumbled behind him found the knob and swung it open If you double cross me said Drew all that I ve ever done to any man before will be nothing to what I ll do to you Glendin And the deputy cried his voice gone shrill and high I ain t done nothin that ain t been done before And he vanished through the doorway Drew followed and looked after the deputy who galloped like a fugitive over the hills Shall I follow him he muttered to himself but a faint groan reached him from the bedroom He turned on his heel and went back to Calamity Ben and the doctor CHAPTER XXXIV CRITICISM After the first burst of speed Bard resigned himself to following Sally knowing that he could never catch her first because her horse carried a burden so much lighter than his own but above all because the girl seemed to know every rock and twist in the trail and rode as courageously through the night as if it had been broad day She was following a course as straight as a crow s flight between the ranch of Drew and his old place a desperate trail that veered and twisted up the side of the mountain and then lurched headlong down on the farther side of the crest Half a dozen times Anthony checked his horse and shook his head at the trail but always the figure of the girl glimmering through the dusk ahead challenged and drove him on Out of the sharp descent of the downward trail they broke suddenly onto the comparatively smooth floor of the valley and he followed her at a gallop which ended in front of the old house of Drew They had been far less than five hours on the way yet his long detour to the south had given him three days of hard riding to cover the same points His desire to meet Logan again became almost a passion He swung to the ground and advanced to Sally with his hands outstretched You ve shown me the short cut all right he said and I thank you a thousand times Sally So long and good luck to you She disregarded his extended hand Want me to leave you here Bard You certainly can t stay She slipped from her horse and jerked the reins over its head In another moment she had untied the cinch and drawn off the saddle She held its weight easily on one forearm Actions after all are more eloquent than words I suppose he said gloomily that if I d asked you to stay you d have ridden off at once She did not answer for a moment and he strained his eyes to read her expression through the dark At length she laughed with a new note in her voice that drew her strangely close to him During the long ride he had come to feel toward her as toward another man as strong as himself almost as fine a horseman and much surer of herself on that wild trail but now the laughter in an instant rubbed all this away It was rather low and with a throaty quality of richness The pulse of the sound was like a light finger tapping some marvellously sensitive chord within him D you think that she said and went directly through the door of the house He heard the crazy floor creak beneath her weight the saddle dropped with a thump a match scratched and a flight of shadows shook across the doorway The light did not serve to make the room visible it fell wholly upon his own mind and troubled him like the waves which spread from the dropping of the smallest pebble and lap against the last shores of a pool Dumfounded by her casual surety he remained another moment with the rein in the hollow of his arm Finally he decided to mount as silently as possible and ride off through the night away from her The consequences to her reputation if they spent the night so closely together was one reason a more selfish and more moving one was the trouble which she gave him The finding and disposing of Drew should be the one thing to occupy his thoughts but the laughter of the girl the moment before had suddenly obsessed him wiped out the rest of the world enmeshed them hopelessly together in the solemn net of the night the silence He resented it in a vague way he was angry with Sally Fortune His foot was in the stirrup when it occurred to him that no matter how softly he withdrew she would know and follow him It seemed to Anthony that for the first time in his life he was not alone In other days social bonds had fallen very lightly on him the men he knew were acquaintances not friends the women had been merely border decorations variations of light and shadow which never shone really deep into the stream of his existence even his father had not been near him but by the irresistible force of circumstances which he could not control this girl was forced bodily upon his consciousness Now he heard a cheery faint crackling from the house and a rosy glow pervaded the gloom beyond the doorway It brought home to Anthony the fact that he was tired weariness went through all his limbs like the sound of music Music in fact for the girl was singing softly to herself He took his foot from the stirrup unsaddled and carried the saddle into the room He found Sally crouched at the fire and piling bits of wood on the rising flame Her face was squinted to avoid the smoke and she sheltered her eyes with one hand At his coming she smiled briefly up at him and turned immediately back to the fire The silence of that smile brought their comradeship sharply home to him It was as if she understood his weariness and knew that the fire was infinitely comforting Anthony frowned he did not wish to be understood It was irritating indelicate He sat on one of the bunks and when she took her place on the other he studied her covertly with side glances for he was beginning to feel strangely self conscious It was the situation rather than the girl that gained upon him but he felt shamed that he should be so uncertain of himself and so liable to expose some weakness before the girl That in turn raised a blindly selfish desire to make her feel and acknowledge his mastery He did not define the emotion exactly nor see clearly what he wished to do but in a general way he wanted to be necessary to her and to let her know at the same time that she was nothing to him He was quite sure that the opposite was the truth just now At this point he shrugged his shoulders angry that he should have slipped so easily into the character of a sullen boy hating a benefactor for no reason other than his benefactions but the same vicious impulse made him study the face of Sally Fortune with an impersonal coldly critical eye It was not easy to do for she sat with her head tilted back a little as though to take the warmth of the fire more fully The faint smile on her lips showed her comfort mingled with retrospection Here he lost the trend of his thoughts by beginning to wonder of what she could be thinking but he called himself back sharply to the analysis of her features It was a game with which he had often amused himself among the girls of his eastern acquaintance Their beauty after all was their only weapon and when he discovered that that weapon was not of pure steel they became nothing it was like pushing them away with an arm of infinite length There was food for criticism in Sally s features The nose of course was tipped up a bit and the mouth too large but Anthony discovered that it was almost impossible to centre his criticism on either feature The tip tilt of the nose suggested a quaint and infinitely buoyant spirit the mouth if generously wide was exquisitely made She was certainly not pretty but he began to feel with equal certainty that she was beautiful A waiting mood came on him while he watched as one waits through a great symphony and endures the monotonous passages for the sake of the singing bursts of harmony to which the commoner parts are a necessary background He began to wish that she would turn her head so that he could see her eyes They were like the inspired part of that same symphony a beauty which could not be remembered and was always new satisfying He could make her turn by speaking and knowing that this was so he postponed the pleasure like a miser who will only count his gold once a day From the side view he dwelt on the short delicately carved upper lip and the astonishingly pleasant curve of the cheek Look at me he said abruptly She turned observed him calmly and then glanced back to the fire She asked no question Her chin rested on her hands now so that when she spoke her head nodded a little and gave a significance to what she said The grey doesn t belong to you So she was thinking of horses Well she repeated No Hoss lifting she mused Why shouldn t I take a horse when they had shot down mine She turned to him again and this time her gaze went over him slowly curiously but without speaking she looked back to the fire as though explanation of what hoss lifting meant were something far beyond the grasp of his mentality His anger rose again childishly sullenly and he had to arm himself with indifference Who d you drop Bard The one they call Calamity Ben Is he done for Yes The turmoil of the scene of his escape came back to him so vividly that he wondered why it had ever been blurred to obscurity She said In a couple of hours we d better ride on CHAPTER XXXV ABANDON That was all no comment no exclamation she continued to gaze with that faint retrospective smile toward the fire He knew now why she angered him it was because she had held the upper hand from the minute that ride over the short pass began he had never once been able to assert himself impressively He decided to try now I don t intend to ride on Too tired He felt the clash of her will on his even like flint against steel whenever they spoke and he began to wonder what spark would start a fire It made him think of a game of poker in a way for he never knew what the next instant would place in his hands while the cards of chance were shuffled and dealt Tired There was a subtle scoffing challenge hidden somewhere in that word No but I don t intend to go any farther from Drew Her smile grew more pronounced she even looked to him with a frank amusement for apparently she would not take him seriously If I were you he d be the last man I d want to be near I suppose you would As if she picked up the gauntlet she turned squarely on the bunk and faced him You re going to hit the trail in an hour understand It delighted him set him thrilling with excitement to feel her open anger and the grip of her will against his he had to force a frown in order to conceal a smile If I do it will be to ride back toward Drew Her lips parted to make an angry retort and then he watched her steel herself with patience like a mother teaching an old lesson to a child D you know what you d be like wanderin around these mountains without a guide Well Like a kid in a dark lonesome room You d travel in a circle and fall into their hands in a day Possibly She was still patient Follow me close Bard I mean that if you don t do what I say I ll cut loose and leave you alone here He was silent enjoying her sternness glad to have roused her no matter what the consequences knowing that each second heightened the climax Apparently she interpreted his speechlessness in a different way She said after a moment That sounds like quittin cold on you I won t do it unless you try some fool thing like riding back toward Drew He waited again as long as he dared then Don t you see that the last thing I want is to keep you with me There was no pleasure in that climax She sat with parted lips her hands clasped tightly in her lap staring at him He became as vividly conscious of her femininity as he had been when she laughed in the dark There was the same sustained pulsing vital emotion in this silence He explained hastily A girl s reputation is a fragile thing Sally And she recovered herself with a start but not before he saw and understood It was as if in the midst of an exciting hand with the wagers running high he had seen her cards and knew that his own hand was higher The pleasant sense of mastery made a warmth through him Meaning that they d talk about me Bard they ve already said enough things about me to fill a book notes and all with a bunch of pictures thrown in What I can t live down I fight down and no man never says the same thing twice about me It ain t healthy If that s all that bothers you close your eyes and let me lead you out of this mess He hunted about for some other way to draw her out After all it was an old old game He had played it before many a time though the setting and the lights had been different the play was always the same a man and a woman She was explaining And it is a mess Maybe you could get out after droppin Calamity because it was partly self defence but there ain t nothin between here and God that can get you off from liftin a hoss No sir not even returning the hoss won t do no good I know The only thing is speed and a thousand miles east of here you can stop ridin He found the thing to say and he made his voice earnest and low to give the words wing and sharpness it was like the hum of the bow string after the arrow is launched so tense was the tremor of his tone There are two reasons why I can t leave The first is Drew I must get back to him Why d you want Drew Let me tell you Bard he s a bigger job than ten tenderfeet like you could handle Why mothers scare their babies asleep by tellin of the things that William Drew has done I can t tell you why In fact I don t altogether know the complete why and wherefore It s enough that I have to meet him and finish him Her fingers interlaced and gripped he wondered at their slenderness and leaning back so that his face fell under a slant black shadow he enjoyed the flame of the firelight turning her brown hair to amber and gold White and round and smooth and perfect was the column of her throat and it trembled with the stir of her voice The most fool idea I ever heard Sounds like something in a dream a nightmare What d you want to do Anthony make yourself famous You will be all right they ll put up your tombstone by a public subscription He would not answer sure of himself waiting tingling with enjoyment As he expected she said Go on is the other reason as good as that one Making his expression grim he leaned suddenly forward and though the width of the room separated them she drew back a little as though the shadow of his coming cast a forewarning shade across her He heard her breath catch and as if some impalpable and joyous spirit rushed to meet and mingle with his something from her a spirit as warm as the fire as faintly keenly sweet as an air from a night dark unseen garden blowing in his face The other reason is you Sally Fortune You can t go with me as far as I must go and I can t leave you behind Ah there it was He had fumbled at the keys of the organ in the dark he had spread his fingers amply and pressed down behold back from the cathedral lofts echoed a rising music of surpassing beauty Like the organist he sank back again in the shadow and wondered at the phrase of melody Surely he had not created it Then what God perhaps For her lips parted to a smile that was suggested rather than seen a tender womanly sweetness that played about her mouth and a light came in her eyes that would never wholly die from them Afterward he would feel shame for what he had done but now he was wholly wrapped in the new thing that had been born in her like a bird striving to fly in the teeth of a great storm and giving back with reeling drumming wings a beautiful and touching sight Her lips framed words that made no sound Truly she was making a gallant struggle Then she said Anthony She was pale with the struggle now but she rose bravely to her part She even laughed though it fell short like an arrow dropping in front of the target Listen Bard you make a pretty good imitation of Samson but I ain t cut out for any Delilah If I m holding you here why cut and run and forget it She drew a long breath and went on more confidently It ain t any use I m not cut out for any man I d so much rather be free I ve tried to get interested in others but it never works She laughed again more surely and with a certain hardness like the ringing of metal against metal or the after rhythm from the peal of a bell With deft flying fingers she rolled a cigarette lighted it and sat down cross legged Through the first outward puff of smoke went these words The only thing that s a woman about me is skirts That s straight Yet he knew that his power was besieging her on every side Her power seemed gone and she was like a rare flower in the hollow of his hand all that he had to do was to close his fingers and He despised himself for it but he could not resist Moreover he half counted on her pride to make her break away Then if it s hopeless Sally Fortune go now She answered with an upward tilt of her chin Don t be a fool Anthony If I can t be a woman to you at least I can be a pal the best you ve had in these parts Nope I ll see you through Better saddle now And start back for Drew There was the thrust that made her start as if the knife went through tender flesh Are you such a plumb fool as that Go now Sally I tell you it s no use I won t leave the trail of Drew It was only the outward stretch of her arm only the extension of her hand palm up but it was as if her whole nature expanded toward him in tenderness Oh Anthony if you care for me don t stay in reach of Drew You re breaking She stopped and closed her eyes Breakin all the rules like any tenderfoot would be expected to do She glanced at him wistful to see whether or not she had smoothed it over his face was a blank You won t go Nope He insisted cruelly Why Because because well can I leave a baby alone near a fire Not me Her voice changed The light and the life was gone from it but not all the music It was low a little hoarse I guess we can stay here tonight without no danger And in the morning well the morning can take care of itself I m going to turn in He rose obediently and stood at the door facing the night From behind came the rustle of clothes and the sense of her followed and surrounded and stood at his shoulder calling to him to turn He had won but he began to wonder if it had not been a Pyrrhic victory At length All right Anthony It s your turn She was lying on her side facing the wall a little heap of clothes on the foot of her bunk and the lithe lines of her body something to be guessed at sensed beneath the heavy blanket He slipped into his own bunk and lay a moment watching the heavy drift of shadows across the ceiling He strove to think but the waves of light and dark blotted from his mind all except the feeling of her nearness that indefinable power keen as the fragrance of a garden which had never quite become disentangled from his spirit She was there so close If he called she would answer if she answered He turned to the wall shut his eyes and closed his mind with a Spartan effort His breathing came heavily regularly like one who slept or one who is running Over that sound he caught at length another light rustling and then the faint creak as she crossed the crazy floor He made his face calm forced his breath to grow more soft and regular Then as if a shadow in which there is warmth had crossed him he knew that she was leaning above him close closer he could hear her breath In a rush of tenderness he forgot her beauty of eyes and round strong throat and supple body he forgot and was immersed like an eagle winging into a radiant sunset cloud in a sense only of her being quite divorced from the flesh the mysterious rare power which made her Sally Fortune and would not change no matter what body might contain it It was blindingly intense and when his senses cleared he knew that she was gone He felt as if he had awakened from a night full of dreams more vivid than life dreams which left him too weak to cope with reality For a time he dared not move He was feeling for himself like a man who fumbles his way down a dark passage dangerous with obstructions At last it was as if his hand touched the knob of a door he swung it open entered a room full of dazzling light himself He shrank back from it closed his eyes against what he might see All he knew then was an overpowering will to see her He turned inch by inch little degree by degree knowing that if when he turned he looked into her eyes the end would rush upon them overwhelm them carry them along like straws on the flooding river At last his head was turned he looked She lay on her back smiling as she slept One arm hung down from the bunk and the graceful fingers trailed palm up on the floor curling a little as if she had just relaxed her grasp on something And down past her shoulder half covering the whiteness of her arm fled the torrent of brown hair with the firelight playing through it like a sunlit mist He rose and dressed with a deadly caution for he knew that he must go at once partly for her sake that he must be seen apart from her this night partly because he knew that he must leave and never come back He had hit upon the distinctive feature of the girl a purity as thin and clear as the air of the uplands in which she drew breath He stooped and smoothed down the blankets of his bunk for no trace of him must be seen if any other man should come during this night He would go far away see and be seen apart from Sally Fortune He picked up his saddle Before he departed he leaned low above her as she must have done above him until the dark shadow of lashes was tremulous against her cheek Then he straightened and stole step by step across the floor to the door to the night all the myriad small white eyes of the heavens looked down to him in hushed surprise CHAPTER XXXVI JERRY WOOD When he was at the old Drew place before Logan had told him of Jerry Wood s place five miles to the north among the hills and to this he now directed his horse riding at a merciless speed as if he strove to gain from the swift succession of rocks and trees that whirled past him new thoughts to supplant the ones which already occupied him He reached in a short time a little rise of ground below which stretched a darkly wooded hollow and in the midst the trees gave back from a small house a two storied affair with not a light showing He wished to announce himself and his name at this place under the pretence of asking harbourage for the brief remainder of the night The news of what he had done at Drew s place could not have travelled before him to Wood s house but the next day it would be sure to come and Wood could say that he had seen Bard alone the previous night It would be a sufficient shield for the name of Sally Fortune in that incurious region So he banged loudly at the door Eventually a light showed in an upper window and a voice cried Who s there Anthony Bard Who the devil is Anthony Bard Lost in the hills Can you give me a place to sleep for the rest of the night I m about done up Wait a minute Voices stirred in the upper part of the house the lantern disappeared steps sounded descending the stairs and then the door was unbarred and held a cautious inch ajar The ray of light jumped out at Bard like an accusing arm Evidently a brief survey convinced Jerry Wood that the stranger was no more than what he pretended He opened the door wide and stepped back Come in Bard moved inside taking off his hat How d you happen to be lost in the hills I m a bit of a stranger around here you see The other surveyed him with a growing grin I guess maybe you are Sure we ll put you up for the night Where s your hoss He went out and raised the lantern above his head to look The light shone back from the lustrous wide eyes of the grey Wood turned to Bard Seems to me I ve seen that hoss Yes I bought it from Duffy out at Drew s place Oh Friend of mister Drew Half a life spent on the mountain desert had not been enough to remove from Drew that distinguishing title of respect The range has more great men than it has misters Not exactly a friend answered Bard Sail right Long s you know him you re as good as gold with me Come on along to the barn and we ll knock down a feed for the hoss He chuckled as he led the way For that matter there ain t any I know that can say they re friends to William Drew though there s plenty that would like to if they thought they could get away with it How s he lookin Why big and grey Sure He never changes none Time and years don t mean nothin to Drew He started bein a man when most of us is in short pants he ll keep on bein a man till he goes out He ain t got many friends real ones but I don t know of any enemies neither All the time he s been on the range Drew has never done a crooked piece of work Every decent man on the range would take his word ag in well ag in the Bible for that matter They reached the barn at the end of this encomium and Bard unsaddled his horse The other watched him critically Know somethin about hosses eh A little When I seen you I put you down for a tenderfoot Don t mind do you The way you talked put me out For that matter I suppose I am a tenderfoot Speakin of tenderfoots I heard of one over to Eldara the other night that raised considerable hell You ain t him are you He lifted the lantern again and fixed his keen eyes on Bard However he went on lowering the lantern with an apologetic laugh I m standin here askin questions and chatterin like a woman and what you re thinkin of is bed eh Come on with me Upstairs in the house he found Bard a corner room with a pile of straw in the corner by way of a mattress There he spread out some blankets wished his guest a good sleep and departed Left to himself Anthony stretched out flat on his back It had been a wild hard day but he felt not the slightest touch of weariness all he wished was to relax his muscles for a few moments Moreover he must be away from the house with the dawn first because Sally Fortune might waken guess where he had gone and follow him secondly because the news of what had happened at Drew s place might reach Wood at any hour So he lay trying to fight the thought of Sally from his mind and concentrate on some way of getting back to Drew without riding the gauntlet of the law The sleep which stole upon him came by slow degrees or rather he was not fully asleep when a sound outside the house roused him to sharp consciousness compared with which his drowsiness had been a sleep It was a knocking at the door not loud but repeated At the same time he heard Jerry Wood cursing softly in a neighbouring room and then the telltale creak of bedsprings The host was rousing himself a second time that night Or rather it was morning now for when Anthony sat up he saw that the hills were stepping out of the shadows of the night black ugly shapes revealed by a grey background of the sky A window went up noisily Am I runnin a hotel roared Jerry Wood Ain t I to have no sleep no more Who are ye A lowered muttering voice answered All right said Jerry changing his tone at once I ll come down His steps descended the noisy stairs rapidly the door creaked Then voices began again outside the house an indistinct mumble rising to one sharp height in an exclamation Almost at once steps again sounded on the stairs but softly now Bard went quietly to the door locked it and stole back to the window Below it extended the roof of a shed joining the main body of the house only a few feet under his window and sloping to what could not have been a dangerous distance from the ground He raised the window sash Yet he waited something as he had waited for Sally Fortune to speak earlier in the night with a sense of danger but a danger which thrilled and delighted him No game of polo could match suspense like this Besides he would be foolish to go before he was sure The walls were gaping with cracks that carried the sounds and now he heard a sibilant whisper with a perfect clearness This is the room There was a click as the lock was tried Locked damn it Shut up Butch Jerry have you got a bar or anything We ll pry it down and break in on him before he can get in action You re a fool McNamara That feller don t take a wink to get into action Sure he didn t hear you when you hollered out the window That was a fool move Wood I don t think he heard There wasn t any sound from his room when I passed it goin downstairs Think of the nerve of this bird comin here to roost after what he done He didn t think we d follow him so fast But Anthony waited for no more He slipped out on the roof of the shed lowered himself hand below hand to the edge and dropped lightly to the ground The grey at his coming flattened back its ears as though it knew that more hard work was coming but he saddled rapidly led it outside and rode a short distance into the forest There he stopped His course lay due north and then a swerve to the side and a straight course west for the ranch of William Drew If the hounds of the law were so close on his trace they certainly would never suspect him of doubling back in this manner and he would have the rancher to himself when he arrived Yet still he did not start the grey forward to the north For to the south lay Sally Fortune and at the thought of her a singular hollowness came about his heart a loneliness not for himself but for her Yes in a strange way all self was blotted from his emotion It would be a surrender to turn back now And like a defeated man who rides in a lost cause he swung the grey to the south and rode back over the trail his head bowed CHAPTER XXXVII TODO ES PERDO It was not long after the departure of Bard that Sally Fortune awoke For a step had creaked on the floor and she looked up to find Steve Nash standing in the centre of the room with the firelight gloomily about him behind blocking the door with his squat figure stood Shorty Kilrain Where s your side kicker asked Nash Where s Bard And looking across the room she saw that the other bunk was empty She raised her arms quickly as if to stifle a yawn and sat up in the bunk holding the blanket close about her shoulders The face she showed to Nash was calmly contemptuous The bird seems to be flown eh she queried Where is he he repeated and made a step nearer She knew at last that her power over him as a woman was gone she caught the danger of his tone saw it in the steadiness of the eyes he fixed upon her Behind was a great vague feeling of loss the old hollowness about the heart It made her reckless of consequences and when Nash asked Is he hangin around behind the corner maybe she cried If he was that close you d have sense enough to run Steve The snarl of Nash showed his teeth Out with it The tenderfoot ain t left his woman fur away Where s he gone Who s he gone to shoot in the back Where s the hoss he started out to rustle Kind of peeved Nash eh One step more he made towering above her I ve done bein polite Sally I ve asked you a question And I ve answered you I don t know Sally I m patient I don t mean no wrong to you What you ve been to me I m goin to bust myself tryin to forget but don t lie to me now Such a far greater woe kept up a throbbing ache in the hollow of her throat that now she laughed laughed slowly deliberately He leaned caught her wrist in a crushing pressure You demon you she devil She whirled out of the bunk the blanket caught about her like the toga of some ancient Roman girl and as she moved she had swept up something heavy and bright from the floor All this and still his grip was on her left arm Drop your hand Nash With a falling of the heart she knew that he did not fear her gun instead a light of pleasure gleamed in his eyes and his lower jaw thrust out She would never forget his face as he looked that moment Will you tell me I ll see you in hell first By that wrist he drew her resistlessly toward him and his other arm went about her and crushed her close hate shame rage love were in the contorted face above her She pressed the muzzle of her revolver against his side You re in beckoning distance of that hell Steve You she wolf shoot and be damned I d live long enough to strangle you You know me Steve don t be a fool Know you Nobody knows you And God Almighty Sally I love you worse n ever love the very way you hate me Come here He jerked her closer still leaned and she remembered then that Anthony had never kissed her She said You re safe you know he can t see you He threw her from him and stood snarling like a dog growling for the bone it fears to touch because there may be poison in the taste a starving dog and a bone full of toothsome marrow which has only to be crushed in order that it may be enjoyed I m wishin nothin more than that he could see me Then you re a worse fool than I took you for Steve You know he d go through ten like you There ain t no man has gone through me yet But he would You know it He s not stronger maybe not so strong But he was born to win Steve he s like he s like Drew in a way He can t fail If I wrung that throat of yours he said I know I couldn t get out of you where he s gone Because I don t know you see Don t know He s given me the slip You Funny ain t it But he has Thought I couldn t ride fast enough to keep up with him maybe He s gone on east of course That s another lie Well you know I do His voice changed Has he really beat it away from you Sally She watched him with a strange sneering smile Then she stepped close Lean your ear down to me Steve He obeyed I ll tell you what ought to make you happy He don t care for me no more than I care for you Steve He straightened again wondering And you I threw myself at him I dunno why I m tellin you except it s right that you should know But he don t want me he s gone on without me An you like him still She merely stared with a sick smile My God he murmured shaken deep with wonder What s he made of Steel and fire that s all Listen Sally forget what I ve done and Would you drop his trail Steve He cursed through his set teeth If that s it no It s him or me and I m sure to beat him out Afterwards you ll forget him Try me Girls have said that before I ll wait There ain t no one but you for me damn you I know that I ll get him first and then I ll wait Ten like you couldn t get him I ve six men behind me She was still defiant but her colour changed Six Sally and he s out here among the hills not knowing his right from his left I ask you has he got a chance She answered No not one He turned on his heel beckoned to Kilrain who had stood moveless through the strange dialogue and went out into the night As they mounted he said We re going straight for the place where I told Butch Conklin I d meet him Then the bunch of us will come back Why waste time Because he s sure to come back Shorty after a feller has seen Sally smile the way she can smile he couldn t keep away I know They rode off at a slow trot like men who have resigned themselves to a long journey and Sally watched them from the door She sat down crosslegged before the fire and stirred the embers and strove to think But she was not equipped for thinking all her life had been merely action action action and now as she strove to build out some logical sequence and find her destiny in it she failed miserably and fell back upon herself She was one of those single minded people who give themselves up to emotion rarely but when they do their whole body their whole soul burns in the flame Into her mind came a phrase she had heard in her childhood On the outskirts of Eldara there was a little shack owned by a Mexican Jose he was called and nothing else Greaser Jose One night an alarm of fire was given in Eldara and the whole populace turned out to enjoy the sight it was a festival occasion in a way It was the house of Greaser Jose The cowpunchers manned a bucket line but the source of water was far away the line too long and the flames gained faster than they could be quenched All through the work of fire fighting Greaser Jose was everywhere about the house flinging buckets of water through the windows into the red furnace within his wife and the two children stood stupidly staring dumb But in the end when the fire was towering above the roof of the house roaring and crackling the Mexican suddenly raised a long arm and called to the bucket line It is done Senors I thank you Then he had folded his arms and repeated in a monotone over and over again Todo es perdo todo es perdo His wife came to him frantic wailing and threw her arms around his neck He merely repeated with heavy monotony Todo es perdo todo es perdo The phrase clung in the mind of the girl and she rose at last and went back to her bunk repeating Todo es perdo todo es perdo All is lost all is lost No tears were in her eyes they were wide and solemn looking up to the shadows of the ceiling and so she went to sleep with the solemn Spanish phrase echoing through her whole being Todo es perdo She woke with the smell of frying bacon pungent in her nostrils CHAPTER XXXVIII BACON The savour of roasting chicken that first delicious burst of aroma when the oven door is opened would tempt an angel from heaven down to the lowly earth A Southerner declares that his nostrils can detect at a prodigious distance the cooking of possum and taters A Kanaka has a cosmopolitan appetite but the fragrance which moves him most nearly is the scent of fish baking in Ti leaves A Frenchman waits unmoved until the perfume of some rich lamb ragout an air laden with spices is wafted toward him Every man and every nation has a special dish in general there is only one whose appeal is universal It is not for any class or nation it is primarily for the hungry man no matter what has given him an appetite It may be that he has pushed a pen all day or reckoned up vast columns or wielded a sledge hammer or ridden a wild horse from morning to night but the savour of peculiar excellence to the nostrils of this universal hungry man is the smell of frying bacon A keen appetite is even stronger than sorrow and when Sally Fortune awoke with that strong perfume in her nostrils she sat straight up among the blankets startled as the cavalry horse by the sound of the trumpet What she saw was Anthony Bard kneeling by the coals of the fire over which steamed a coffee pot on one side and a pan of crisping bacon on the other The vision shook her so that she rubbed her eyes and stared again to make sure It did not seem possible that she had actually wakened during the night and found him gone and with this reality before her she was strongly tempted to believe that the coming of Nash was only a vivid dream Morning Anthony He turned his head quickly and smiled to her Hello Sally He was back at once turning the bacon which was done on the first side Seeing that his back was turned she dressed quickly How d you sleep Well Where He turned more slowly this time You woke up in the middle of the night Yes What wakened you Nash and Kilrain He sighed I wish I d been here She answered I ll wash up we ll eat and then off on the trail I ve an idea that the two will be back and they ll have more men behind them After a little her voice called from the outside Anthony have you had a look at the morning He came obediently to the doorway The sun had not yet risen but the fresh rose coloured light already swept around the horizon throwing the hills in sharp relief and flushing faraway the pure snows of the Little Brothers And so blinding was the sheen of the lake that it seemed at first as though the sun were about to break from the waters for there all the radiance of the sunrise was reflected concentrated Looking in this manner from the doorway with the water on either side and straight ahead and the dark narrow point of land cutting that colour like a prow it seemed to Anthony almost as if he stood on the bridge of a ship which in another moment would gather head and sail out toward the sea of fresh beauty beyond the peaks for the old house of William Drew stood on a small peninsula thrusting out into the lake a low shelving shore scattered with trees Where the little tongue of land joined the main shore the ground rose abruptly into a shoulder of rocks inaccessible to a horse the entrance and exit to the house must be on either side of this shoulder hugging closely the edge of the water Feeling that halo of the morning about them for a moment Anthony forgot all things in the lift and exhilaration of the keen air and he accepted the girl as a full and equal partner in his happiness looking to her for sympathy She knelt by the edge of the water face and throat shining and wet her head bending back her lips parted and smiling It thrilled him as if she were singing a silent song which made the brightness of the morning and the colour beyond the peaks He almost waited to see her throat quiver hear the high sweet tone But a scent of telltale sharpness drew him a thousand leagues down and made him whirl with a cry of dismay The bacon Sally It was hopelessly burned some of it was even charred on the bottom of the pan Sally returning on the run took charge of the cookery and went about it with a speed and ability that kept him silent which being the ideal mood for a spectator he watched and found himself learning much Whatever that scene of the night before meant in the small and definite in the large and vague it meant that he had a claim of some sort on Sally Fortune and it is only when a man feels that he has this claim this proprietorship as it were that he begins to see a woman clearly Before this his observance has been half blind through prejudice either for or against he either sees her magnified with adulation or else the large end of the glass is placed against his eye and she is merely a speck in the distance But let a woman step past that mysterious wall which separates the formal from the intimate only one step at once she is surrounded by the eyes of a man as if by a thousand spies So it was with Anthony It moved him for instance to see the supple strength of her fingers when she was scraping the charred bacon from the bottom of the pan and he was particularly fascinated by the undulations of the small round wrist He glanced down to his own hand broad and bony in comparison It was his absorption in this criticism that served to keep him aloof from her while they ate and the girl felt it like an arm pushing her away She had been very close to him not many hours before now she was far away She could understand nothing but the pain of it As he finished his coffee he said staring into a corner I don t know why I came back to you Sally You didn t mean to come back when you started Of course not She flushed and her heart beat loudly to hear his weakness He was keeping nothing from her he was thinking aloud she felt that the bars between them were down again In the first place I went because I had to be seen and known by name in some place far away from you That was for your sake In the second place I had to be alone for the work that lay ahead Drew Yes It all worked like a charm I went to the house of Jerry Wood told him my name stayed there until Conklin and several others arrived hunting for me and then gave them the slip She did not look up from her occupation which was the skilful cleaning of her gun It was perfect the way clear before me I had dodged through their lines so to speak when I gave Conklin the slip and I could ride straight for Drew and catch him unprepared Isn t that clear But you didn t She was so calm about it that he grew a little angry she would not look up from the cleaning of the gun That s the devil of it I couldn t stay away I had to come back to you She restored the gun to her holster and looked steadily at him he felt a certain shock in countering her glance Because I thought you might be lonely Sally I was It was strange to see how little fencing there was between them They were like men long tried in friendship and working together on a great problem full of significance to both Do you know what I kept sayin to myself when I found you was gone Well Todo es perdo todo es perdo She had said it so often to herself that now some of the original emotion crept into her voice His arm went out they shook hands across their breakfast pans She went on The next thing is Drew Yes There s no changing you She did not wait for his answer I know that I won t ask questions If it has to be done we ll do it quickly and afterward I can find a way out for us both Something like a foreknowledge came to him telling him that the thing would never be done that he had surrendered his last chance of Drew when he turned back to go to Sally It was as if he took a choice between the killing of the man and the love of the woman But he said nothing of his forebodings and helped her quietly to rearrange the small pack They saddled and took the trail which pointed up over the mountains the same trail which they had ridden in an opposite direction the night before He rode with his head turned taking his last look at the old house of Drew with its blackened crumbling sides when the girl cried softly What s that Look He stared in the direction of her pointing arm They were almost directly under the shoulder of rocks which loomed above the trail along the edge of the lake Anthony saw nothing What was it He checked his horse beside hers I thought I saw something move I m not sure And there back Anthony And she whirled her horse He caught it this time clearly the unmistakable glint of the morning light on steel and he turned the grey sharply At the same time a rattling blast of revolver shots crackled above them the grey reared and pitched back By inches he escaped the fall of the horse slipping from the saddle in the nick of time A bullet whipped his hat from his head Then the hand of the girl clutched his shoulder Stirrup and saddle Anthony He seized the pommel of the saddle hooked his foot into the stirrup which she abandoned to him and she spurred back toward the old house A shout followed them a roar that ended in a harsh rattle of curses they heard the spat of bullets several times on the trees past which they whirled But it was only a second before they were once more in the shelter of the house He stood in the centre of the room stunned staring stupidly around him It was not fear of death that benumbed him but a rising horror that he should be so trapped like a wild beast cornered and about to be worried to death by dogs As for escape there was simply no chance it was impossible On three sides the lake still beautiful though the colour was fading from it effectively blocked their way On the fourth and narrowest side there was the shoulder of rocks not only blocking them but affording a perfect shelter for Nash and his men for they did not doubt that it was he They think they ve got us said a fiercely exultant voice beside him but we ain t started to make all the trouble we re goin to make Life came back to him as he looked at her She was trembling with excitement but it was the tremor of eagerness not the unmistakable sick palsy of fear He drew out a large handkerchief of fine white linen and tied it to a long splinter of wood which he tore away from one of the rotten boards Go out with this he said They aren t after you Sally This is west of the Rockies thank God and a woman is safe with the worst man that ever committed murder She said D you mean this Anthony I m trying to mean it She snatched the stick and snapped it into small pieces Does that look final Anthony He could not answer for a moment At last he said What a woman you would have made for a wife Sally Fortune what a fine pal But she laughed a mirth not forced and harsh but clear and ringing Anthony ain t this better n marriage By God he answered I almost think you re right For answer a bullet ripped through the right hand wall and buried itself in a beam on the opposite side of the room Listen she said There was a fresh crackle of guns the reports louder and longer drawn Rifles said Sally Fortune I knew no bullet from a six gun could carry like that one The little sharp sounds of splintering and crunching began everywhere A cloud of soot spilled down the chimney and across the hearth A furrow ploughed across the floor lifting a splinter as long and even as if it had been grooved out by a machine Look said Sally they re firin breast high to catch us standing and on the level of the floor to get us if we lie down That s Nash I know his trademark From the back of the house we can answer them said Bard Let s try it Pepper for their salt eh answered Sally and they ran back through the old shack to the last room CHAPTER XXXIX LEGAL MURDER As Drew entered his bedroom he found the doctor in the act of restoring the thermometer to its case His coat was off and his sleeves rolled up to the elbow he looked more like a man preparing to chop wood than a physician engaging in a struggle with death but doctor Young had the fighting strain Otherwise he would never have persisted in Eldara Already the subtle atmosphere of sickness had come upon the room The shades of the windows were drawn evenly and low down so that the increasing brightness of the morning could only temper not wholly dismiss the shadows Night is the only reality of the sick bed the day is only a long evening a waiting for the utter dark The doctor s little square satchel of instruments vials and bandages lay open on the table he had changed the apartment as utterly as he had changed his face by putting on great horn rimmed spectacles They gave an owl like look to him an air of omniscience It seemed as if no mortal ailment could persist in the face of such wisdom Well whispered Drew You can speak out but not loudly said the doctor calmly He s delirious the fever is getting its hold What do you think Nothing The time hasn t come for thinking He bent his emotionless eye closer on the big rancher You he said ought to be in bed this moment Drew waved the suggestion aside Let me give you a sedative added Young Nonsense I m going to stay here The doctor gave up the effort dismissed Drew from his mind and focused his glance on the patient once more Calamity Ben was moving his head restlessly from side to side keeping up a gibbering mutter It rose now to words Joe a mule is to a hoss what a woman is to a man Ever notice The difference ain t so much in what they do as what they don t do Me speakin personal I ll take a lot from any hoss and lay it to jest plain spirit but a mule can make me mad by standin still and doin nothing but wablin them long ears as if it understood things it wasn t goin to speak about Y always feel around a mule as if it knew somethin about you had somethin on you and was laughin soft and deep inside Damn a mule I remember But here he sank into the steady voiceless whisper again the shadow of a sound rather than the reality It was ghostly to hear even by daylight Will it keep up long asked Drew Maybe until he dies I ve told you before it s impossible for him to die The doctor made a gesture of resignation He explained As long as this fever grows our man will steadily weaken it shows that he s on the downward path If it breaks why that means that he will have a chance more than a chance to get well It will mean that he has enough reserve strength to fight off the shock of the wound and survive the loss of the blood It will mean said Drew apparently thinking aloud that the guilt of murder does not fall on Anthony Who is Anthony The wounded man broke in his voice rose high and sharp Halt He went on in a sighing mumble Shorty help I m done for The shooting said the doctor who had kept his fingers on the wrist of his patient I could feel his pulse leap and stop when he said that He said halt first a very clear sign that he tried to stop Bard before Bard shot Doctor you re witness to that He had grown deeply excited I m witness to nothing I never dreamed that you could be so interested in any human being He nodded to himself Do you know how I explained your greyness to myself As that of a man ennuied with life tired of living because he had nothing in the world to occupy his affections And here I find you so far from being ennuied that you are using your whole strength to keep the guilt of murder away from another man It s amazing The boys will never believe it He continued A man who raised a riot in your own house almost burned down your place shot your man stole a horse gad Drew you are sublime But if he expected an explanatory answer from the rancher he was disappointed The latter pulled up a chair beside the bed and bent his stern eyes on the patient as if he were concentrating all of a great will on bringing Calamity Ben back to health He worked with the doctor Every half hour a temperature was taken and it was going up steadily Drew heard the report each time with a tightening of the muscles about his jaws He helped pack the wounded man with wet cloths He ran out and stopped a wrangling noise of the cowpunchers several times But mostly he sat without motion beside the bed trying to will the sufferer back to life And in the middle of the morning after taking a temperature the doctor looked to the rancher with a sort of dull wonder It s dropping whispered Drew It s lower I don t think it s dropping It can t be going down so soon Wait till the next time I register it If it s still lower then he ll get well The grey man sagged forward from his chair to his knees and took the hands of Calamity long fingered bony cold hands they were There he remained moveless his keen eyes close to the wandering stare of the delirious man Out of the exhaustless reservoir of his will he seemed to be injecting an electric strength into the other a steadying and even flow of power that passed from his hands and into the body of Calamity When the time came and Young stood looking down at the thermometer Drew lifted haggard eyes waiting It s lower The great arms of the rancher were thrown above his head he rose changed triumphant as if he had torn his happiness from the heart of the heavens and went hastily from the room silent At the stable he took his great bay saddled him and swung out on the trail for Eldara a short rough trail which led across the Saverack the same course which Nash and Bard had taken the day before But the river had greatly fallen the water hardly washed above the knees of the horse except in the centre of the stream by noon he reached the town and went straight for the office of Glendin The deputy was not there and the rancher was referred to Murphy s saloon There he found Glendin seated at a corner table with a glass of beer in front of him and considering the sun whitened landscape lazily through the window At the sound of the heavy footfall of Drew he turned rose his shoulders flattened against the wall behind him like a cornered man prepared for a desperate stand It s all right cried Drew It s all over Glendin Duffy won t press any charges against Bard he says that he s given the horse away And Calamity Ben is going to live Who says he will I ve just ridden in from his bedside doctor Young says the crisis is past And so thank God there s no danger to Bard he s free from the law Too late said the deputy It did not seem that Drew heard him He stepped closer and turned his head What s that Too late I ve sent out men to to apprehend Bard Apprehend him repeated Drew Is it possible To murder him you mean He had not made a threatening move but the deputy had his grip on the butt of his gun It was that devil Nash He persuaded me to send out a posse with him in charge And you sent him What could I do Ain t it legal Murder is legal sometimes It has been in the past I ve an idea that it s going to be again What d you mean by that You ll learn later Where did they go for Bard He did not seem disappointed He was rather like a man who had already heard bad news and now only finds it confirmed He knew before Now the fact was simply clinched They went out to your old place on the other side of the range Drew listen to me How many went after him Nash Butch Conklin and five more Butch s gang Conklin I was in a hole I needed men How long have they been gone Since last night Then said Drew he s already dead He doesn t know the mountains I give Nash strict orders not to do nothin but apprehend Bard Don t talk Glendin It disgusts me makes my flesh crawl He s alone with seven cutthroats against him Not alone Sally Fortune s better n two common men The girl God bless her She s with him she knows the country There may be a hope Glendin if you re wise start praying now that I find Bard alive If I don t The swinging doors closed behind him as he rushed through toward his horse Glendin stood dazed his face mottled with a sick pallor Then he moved automatically toward the bar Murphy hobbled down the length of the room on his wooden leg and placed bottle and glass before the deputy Well he queried Glendin poured his drink with a shaking hand spilling much liquor across the varnished wood He drained his glass at a gulp I dunno what d you think Murphy You heard him talk Glendin You ought to know what s best Let s hear you say it I d climb the best hoss I owned and start west and when I come to the sea I d take a ship and keep right on goin till I got halfway around the world And then I d climb a mountain and hire a couple of dead shots for guards and have my first night s sleep After that I d begin thinkin of what I could do to get away from Drew Murphy said the other maybe that line of talk would sound sort of exaggerated to some but I ain t one of them You ve got a wooden leg but your brain s sound But tell me what in God s name makes him so thick with the tenderfoot He waited for no answer but started for the door CHAPTER XL PARTNERS If Drew had done hard things in his life few were more remorseless than the ride on the great bay horse that day Starting out he reckoned coldly the total strength of the gallant animal the distance to his old house and figured that it was just within possibilities that he might reach the place before evening From that moment it was certain that the horse would not survive the ride It was merely a question as to whether or not the master had so gaged his strength that the bay would not collapse before even the summit of the range had been reached As the miles went by the horse loosened and extended finely to his work sweat darkened and polished his flanks flecks of foam whirled back and spattered his chest and the legs of his rider he kept on almost to the last the rein had to be drawn taut to the very last his heart was even greater than his body Up the steep slopes Drew let the horse walk every other inch of the way it was either the fast trot or a swinging gallop not the mechanical easy pace of the cattle pony but a driving lunging speed The big hoofs literally smashed at the rocks and the ringing of it echoed hollowly along the rock face of the ravine At the summit for a single moment like a bird of prey pausing in mid circle to note the position of the field mouse before it closes wings and bolts down out of the blue Drew sat his horse motionless and stared down into the valleys below until he noted the exact location of his house the lake glittered back and up to him in the slant light of the late afternoon The bay such was the violence of its panting literally rocked beneath him Then he started the last downward course sweeping along the treacherous trail with reckless speed the rocks scattering before him When they straightened out on the level going beneath the bay was staggering there was no longer any of the lilt and ease of the strong horse running it was a succession of jerks and jars and the panting was a sharper sound than the thunder of the hoofs His shoulders his flanks his neck all was foam now and little by little the proud head fell reached out still he drove against the bit still the rider had to keep up the restraining pressure Until at last he knew that the horse was dying on his feet dying with each heavy stride it made Then he let the reins hang limp It was sad to see the answer of the bay a snort as if of happiness a pricking of the ears a sudden lengthening of stride and quickening a nobler lift to the head Past the margin of the lake they swept crashed through the woods to the right and now very distinctly Drew heard the heavy drum of firing He groaned and drove home the spurs And still by some miracle there was something left in the horse which responded not strength certainly that was gone long ago but there was an indomitable spirit bred into it with its fine blood by gentle care for generations The going was heavier among the trees and yet the bay increased its pace The crackle of the rifles grew more and more distinct A fallen trunk blocked the way With a snort the bay gathered speed rose cleared the trunk with a last glorious effort and fell dead on the other side Drew disentangled his feet from the stirrup raised the head of the horse stared an instant into the glazing eyes and then turned and ran on among the trees Panting dripping with sweat his face contorted terribly by his effort he came at last behind that rocky shoulder which commanded the approach to the old house He found seven men sheltered there keeping up a steady dropping fire on the house McNamara sat propped against a rock a clumsy dirty bandage around his thigh Isaacs lay prone a stained rag twisted tightly around his shoulder Lovel sat with his legs crossed staring stupidly down to the steady drip of blood from his left forearm But Ufert Kilrain Conklin and Nash maintained the fight and Drew wondered what casualties lay on the other side At his rush at the sound of his heavy footfall over the rocks the four turned with a single movement Ufert covered him with a rifle but Nash knocked down the boy s arm We ve done talkin it s our time to listen understand Ufert gone sullen obeyed He was at that age between youth and manhood when the blood despite the songs of the poets runs slow cold before the heart has been called out in love or even in friendship before fear or hate or anything saving a deep egoism has possessed the brain He looked about to the others for his cue What he saw disturbed him Shorty Kilrain like a boy caught playing truant edged little by little back against the rock Butch Conklin his eyes staring had grown waxy pale Steve Nash himself was sullen and gloomy rather than defiant And all this because of a grey man far past the prime of life who ran stumbling panting toward them At his nearer approach a flash of understanding touched Ufert Perhaps it was the sheer bulk of the newcomer perhaps more than this it was something of stern dignity that oppressed the boy with awe He fought against the feeling but he was uneasy he wanted to be far away from that place Straight upon them the big grey man strode and halted in front of Nash He said his voice harsh and broken by his running I ordered you to bring him to me unharmed What does this mean Nash The cowpuncher answered sulkily Glendin sent us out Don t lie You sent yourself and took these men I ve seen Glendin His wrath was tempered with a sneer But here you are four against one Go down and bring him out to me alive There was no answer You said you wanted no odds against any one man When a man and a woman stand together answered Nash they re worse than a hundred That devil Sally Fortune is down there with him A gun cracked from the house the bullet chipped the rock with an evil clang and the flake of stone whirled through the air and landed at the feet of Drew There s your answer said Nash But we ve got the rat cornered Wrong again Calamity Ben is going to live A cry of joy came from Shorty Kilrain Duffy says that he gave his horse away to Bard Glendin has called back your posse Ride Nash Or else go down there unarmed and bring Bard up to me The shadow of a smile crossed the lips of Nash If the law s done with him I m not I won t ride and I won t go down to him I ve got the upper hand and I m going to hold it If you re afraid to go down I will Drew unbuckled his cartridge belt and tossed it with his gun against the rocks He drew out a white handkerchief and holding it above him at a full arm s length he stepped out from the shelter The others gathering at their places of vantage watched his progress toward the house Steve Nash described it to the wounded men who had dragged themselves half erect He s walkin right toward the house wavin the white rag They ain t goin to shoot He s goin around the side of the house He s stopped there under the trees Where At that grave of his wife under the two trees He waits there like he expected Bard to come out to him And by God there goes Bard to meet him right out into the open Steady Steve Drop that gun If you shoot now you ll have Drew on your head afterward Don t I know it But God wouldn t it be easy I got him square inside the sights Jest press the trigger and Anthony Bard is done for He walks up to Drew He s got no gun on He s empty handed jest like Drew He s said something short and quick and starts to step across the grave Drew points down to it and makes an answer Bard steps back like he d been hit across the face and stands there lookin at the mound What did Drew say I d give ten years of life to hear that talk Bard looks sort of stunned he stands there with a hand shadin his eyes but the sun ain t that bright Well I knew nobody could ever stand up to Drew The chief is talkin fast and hard The young feller shakes his head Drew begins talkin again You d think he was pleadin for his life in front of a jury that meant him wrong His hands go out like he was makin an election speech He holds one hand down like he was measurin the height of a kid He throws up his arms again like he d lost everything in the world And now Bard has dropped the hand from his face He looks sort of interested He steps closer to the grave again Drew holds out both his arms By God boys he s pleadin with Bard And the head of Bard is dropped How s it goin to turn out Drew wins of course There goes Bard s hand out as if it was pulled ag in his will Drew catches it in both his own Boys here s where we grab our hosses and beat it He turned from the rocks in haste What d you mean cried Conklin Steve are you goin to leave us here to finish the job you started Finish it You fools Don t you see that Drew and Bard is pals now If we couldn t finish Bard alone how d we make out ag in the two of them The game s up boys the thing that s left is for us to save our hides if we can before them two start after us If they do start then God help us all He was already in the saddle Wait called Conklin One of em s a tenderfoot The other has left his gun here What we got to fear from em And Nash snarled in return If there was a chance don t you think I d take it Don t you see I m givin up everythin that amounts to a damn with me Tenderfoot He may act Eastern and he may talk Eastern but he s got Western blood There ain t no other way of explainin it And Drew He didn t have no gun when he busted the back of old Piotto I say there s two men armed or not and between em they can do more n all of us could dream of Boys are you comin They went The wounded were dragged to their feet and hoisted to their horses groaning At a slow walk they started down through the trees Evening fell the shadows slanted about them They moved faster at a trot at a gallop They were like men flying from a certain ruin Beyond the margin of the bright lake they fled and lost themselves in the vast secret heart of the mountain desert CHAPTER XLI SALLY WEEPS All that day in a silence broken only by murmurs and side glances Anthony and Sally Fortune moved about the old house from window to window and from crack to crack keeping a steady eye on the commanding rocks above In one of those murmurs they made their resolution When night came they would rush the rocks storm them from the front and take their chance with what might follow But the night promised to give but little shelter to their stalking For in the late afternoon a broad moon was already climbing up from the east the sky was cloudless there was a threat of keen revealing moonshine for the night Only desperation could make them attempt to storm the rock but by the next morning at the latest reinforcements were sure to come and then their fight would be utterly hopeless So when the light of the sun mellowed grew yellow and slant and the shadows sloped from tree to tree the two became more silent still drawn and pale of face waiting Anthony at a window Sally at a crack which made an excellent loophole they remained moveless It was she who noted a niche which might serve as a loophole for one of the posse and she fired at it aiming low The clang of the bullet against rock echoes clearly back to her like the soft chime of a sheep bell from the peaceful distance Then as if in answer to her shot around the edge of the rocks appeared a moving rag of white which grew into William Drew bearing above his head the white sign of the truce In her astonishment she looked to Bard He was quivering all over like a hound held on a tight leash with the game in sight hungry to be slipped upon it The edge of his tongue passed across his colourless lips He was like a man who long has ridden the white hot desert and is now about to drink There was the same wild gleam in his eyes his hand shook with nervous eagerness as he shifted and balanced his revolver Listening in her awe she heard the sound of his increasing panting a sound like the breath of a running man approaching her swiftly She slipped to his side Anthony He did not answer his gun steadied the barrel began to incline down his left eye was squinting She dropped to her knees and seized his wrist Anthony what are you going to do It s Drew he whispered and she did not recognize his voice It s the grey man I ve waited for It s he In such a tone a dying man might speak of his hope of heaven seeing it unroll before him in his delirium But he s carrying the flag of truce Anthony You see that I see nothing except his face It blots out the rest of the world I ll plant my shot there there in the middle of those lips Anthony that s William Drew the squarest man on the range Sally Fortune that s William Drew who murdered my father Ah she said with sharply indrawn breath It isn t possible I saw the shot fired But not this way Anthony not from behind a wall His emotion changed him made him almost a stranger to her He was shaking and palsied with eagerness I could do nothing as bad as the crime he has done For twenty years the dread of his coming haunted my father broke him aged him prematurely Every day he went to a secret room and cared for his revolver this gun here in my hand you see He and I we were more than father and son we were pals Sally And then this devil called my father out into the night and shot him Damn him You ve got to listen to me Anthony I ll listen to nothing for there he is and She said with a sharp rising ring in her voice If you shoot at him while he carries that white flag I ll I ll send a bullet through your head that s straight We got only one law in the mountains and that s the law of honour If you bust that I m done with you Anthony Take my gun take it quickly Sally I can t trust myself looking at him I can see the place where the bullet should strike home He forced the butt of his revolver into her hands rose and stepped to the door his hands clasped behind his back Tell me what he does He s comin straight toward us as if he didn t fear nothin grey William Drew He s not packin a gun he trusts us The better way answered Bard Bare hands the better way He has killed men with those bare hands of his I can see em clear great blunt fingered hands Anthony He s coming around the side of the house I ll go into the front room She ran past Anthony and paused in the habitable room spying through a crack in the wall And Anthony stood with his eyes tightly closed his head bowed The image of the leashed hound came more vividly to her when she glanced back at him He s walkin right up the path There he stops Where Right beside the old grave Anthony called a deep voice Anthony come out to me He started and then groaned and stopped himself Is the sign of the truce still over his head Sally Yes I daren t go out to him I d jump at his throat She came beside him It means something besides war I can see it in his face Pain sorrow Anthony but not a wish for fightin From the left side of his cartridge belt a stout handled long bladed hunting knife was suspended He disengaged the belt and tossed it to the floor Still he paused If I go I ll break the truce Sally You won t you re a man Anthony and remember that you re on the range and the law of the range holds you Anthony called the deep voice without He shuddered violently What is it It sounds like the voice of my father calling me I must go She clung to him Not till you re calmer My father died in my arms he answered let me go He thrust her aside and strode out through the door On the farther side of the grave stood Drew his grey head bare and looking past him Anthony saw the snow clad tops of the Little Brother grey also in the light of the evening And the trees whose branches interwove above the grave grey also with moss The trees the mountain the old headstone the man they blended into a whole Anthony said the man I have waited half my life for this And I said Bard have waited a few weeks that seem longer than all my life for this His own eager panting stopped him but he stumbled on I have you here in reach at last Drew and I m going to tear your heart out as you tore the heart out of John Bard Ah Anthony said the other my heart was torn out when you were born it was torn out and buried here And to the wild eyes of Anthony it seemed as if the great body of Drew so feared through the mountain desert was now enveloped with weakness humbled by some incredible burden After that a mist obscured his eyes he could not see more than an outline of the great shape before him his throat contracted as if a hand gripped him there and an odd tingling came at the tips of his fingers He moved forward It is more than I dreamed he said hoarsely as his foot planted firmly on the top of the grave and he poised himself an instant before flinging himself on the grey giant It is more than I dreamed for to face you alone And a solemn even voice answered him We are not alone Not alone but the others are too far off to stop me Not alone Anthony for your mother is here between us Like a fog under a wind the mist swept from the eyes of Anthony he looked out and saw that the face of the grey man was infinitely sad and there was a hungry tenderness that reached out enveloped weakened him He glanced down saw that his heel was on the mount of the grave saw again the headstone and the time blurred inscription Here sleeps Joan the wife of William Drew She chose this place for rest A mortal weakness and trembling seized him The wind puffed against his face and he went staggering back his hand caught up to his eyes He closed his mind against the words which he had heard But the deep organ voice spoke again Oh boy your mother In the stupor which came over him he saw two faces the stern eyes of John Bard and the dark mocking beauty of the face which had looked down to him in John Bard s secret room He lowered his hand from his eyes he stared at William Drew and it seemed to him that it was John Bard he looked upon Their names differed but long pain had touched them with a common greyness And it seemed to Anthony that it was only a moment ago that the key turned in the lock of John Bard s secret room the hidden chamber which he kept like Bluebeard for himself where he went like Bluebeard to see his past only an instant before he had turned the key in that lock the door opened and this was the scene which met his eyes the grave the blurred tombstone and the stern figure beyond Joan he repeated your wife my mother He heard a sob not of pain but of happiness and knew that the blue eyes of Sally Fortune looked out to him from the doorway of the house The low voice hurried now broke in on him When I married Joan John Bard fled from the range he could not bear to look on our happiness You see I had won her by chance and he hated me for it If you had ever seen her Anthony you would understand I crossed the mountains and came here and built this house for your mother was like a wild bird Anthony and I did not dare to let men near her then a son was born and she died giving him birth Afterward I lived on here close to the place which she had chosen herself for rest And I was happy because the boy grew every day into a more perfect picture of his dead mother One day when he was almost three I rode off through the hills and when I came back the boy was gone I rode with a posse everywhere hunting him aye Anthony the trail which I started then I have kept at ever since year after year and here it ends where it began at the grave of Joan Finally I came on news that a man much like John Bard in appearance had been seen near my house that day Then I knew it was Bard in fact He had seen the image of the woman we both loved in the boy He was all that was left of her on earth After these years I can read his heart clearly I know why he took the boy Then I left this place I could not bear the sight of the grave for she slept in peace and I lived in hell waiting for the return of my son At last I went east I was at Madison Square Garden and saw you ride It was the face of Joan that looked back at me and I knew that I was close to the end of the trail The next night I called out John Bard He had been in hell all those years like me for he had waited for my coming He begged me to let him have you said you loved him as a father I only laughed So we fought and he fell and then I saw you running over the lawn toward us I remembered Joan her pride and her fierceness and I knew that if I waited a son would kill his father that night So I turned and fled through the trees Anthony do you believe me do you forgive me The memory of the clumsy hungered tenderness of John Bard swept about Anthony He cried How can I believe My father has killed my father what is left The solemn voice replied Anthony my son He saw the great blunt fingered hands which had killed men which were feared through the length and breadth of the mountain desert stretched out to him Anthony Drew said the voice His hand went out feebly by slow degrees and was caught in a mighty double clasp Warmth flowed through him from that grasp and a great emotion troubled him and a voice from deep to deep echoed within him the call of blood to blood He knew the truth for the hate burned out in him and left only an infinite sadness He said What of the man who loved me Whom I love I have done penance for that death answered William Drew and I shall do more penance before I die For I am only your father in name but he is the father in your thoughts and in your love Is it true It is true said Anthony And the other bitterly In his life he was as strong as I in his death he is still stronger It is his victory his shadow falls between us But Anthony answered Let us go together and bring his body and bury it at the left side of my mother Lad it is the one thing we can do together and after that A plaintive sound came to the ear of Anthony and he looked down to see Sally Fortune weeping at the grave of Joan Better than both the men she understood perhaps In the deep tenderness which swelled through him he caught a sense of the drift of life through many generations of the past and projecting into the future men and women strong and fair and each with a high and passionate love The men died and the women changed but the love persisted with the will to live It came from a thousand springs but it rolled in one river to one sea The past stood there in the form of William Drew he and Sally made the present and through his love of her sprang the hope of the future It was all very clear to him The love of Bard and Drew for Joan Piotto had not died but passed through the flame and the torment of the three ruined lives and returned again with gathering power as the force which swept him and Sally Fortune out into that river and toward that far off sea The last mist was brushed from his eyes He saw with a piercing vision the world himself life He looked to William Drew and saw that he was gazing on an old and broken man He said to the old man Father she is wiser than us both And he pointed to Sally Fortune still weeping softly on the grave of Joan But William Drew had no eye for her he was fallen into a deep muse over the blurred inscription on the headstone He did not even raise his head when Anthony touched Sally Fortune on the shoulder She rose and they stole back together toward the house There as they stood close together Sally murmured It is cruel to leave him alone He needs us now close to him His hand wandered slowly across her hair and he said Sally how close can we ever be to him We can only watch and wait and try to understand murmured Sally Fortune They were so close to the door of the ruined house now that a taint of burnt powder crept out to them a small keen odour and with a sudden desire to protect her he drew her close to him There was no tensing of her body when his arm went around her and he knew with a rush of tenderness how completely how perfectly she accepted him Over the hand which held her he felt soft fingers settle to keep it in its place and when he looked down he found that her face was raised and the eyes which brooded on him were misty bright like the eyes of a child when joy overflows in it but awe keeps it
