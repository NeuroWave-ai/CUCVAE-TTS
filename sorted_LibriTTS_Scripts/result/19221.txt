none	none	Clear Type Press DEDICATION To ALFRED TENNYSON POET LAUREATE This book in its progress has recalled often to my memory a man with whose friendship we were once honoured to whom no region of English literature was unfamiliar and who whilst rich in all the noble gifts of nature was most eminently distinguished by the noblest and the rarest just judgment and high hearted patriotism It would have been hence a peculiar pleasure and pride to dedicate what I have endeavoured to make a true national Anthology of three centuries to Henry Hallam But he is beyond the reach of any human tokens of love and reverence and I desire therefore to place before it a name united with his by associations which whilst Poetry retains her hold on the minds of Englishmen are not likely to be forgotten Your encouragement given while traversing the wild scenery of Treryn Dinas led me to begin the work and it has been completed under your advice and assistance For the favour now asked I have thus a second reason and to this I may add the homage which is your right as Poet and the gratitude due to a Friend whose regard I rate at no common value Permit me then to inscribe to yourself a book which I hope may be found by many a lifelong fountain of innocent and exalted pleasure a source of animation to friends when they meet and able to sweeten solitude itself with best society with the companionship of the wise and the good with the beauty which the eye cannot see and the music only heard in silence If this Collection proves a store house of delight to Labour and to Poverty if it teaches those indifferent to the Poets to love them and those who love them to love them more the aim and the desire entertained in framing it will be fully accomplished F T P May eighteen sixty one PREFACE 
1367-291931-0000	train-other-500	This little Collection differs it is believed from others in the attempt made to include in it all the best original Lyrical pieces and Songs in our language by writers not living and none beside the best
1367-291931-0001	train-other-500	Many familiar verses will hence be met with many also which should be familiar the Editor will regard as his fittest readers those who love Poetry so well that he can offer them nothing not already known and valued
1367-291931-0002	train-other-500	For those who take up the book in a serious and scholarly spirit the following remarks on the plan and the execution are added The Editor is acquainted with no strict and exhaustive definition of Lyrical Poetry
1367-291931-0003	train-other-500	but he has found the task of practical decision increase in clearness and in facility as he advanced with the work whilst keeping in view a few simple principles Lyrical has been here held essentially to imply
1367-291931-0004	train-other-500	that each Poem shall turn on some single thought feeling or situation In accordance with this narrative descriptive and didactic poems unless accompanied by rapidity of movement
1367-291931-0005	train-other-500	brevity and the colouring of human passion have been excluded Humorous poetry except in the very unfrequent instances where a truly poetical tone pervades the whole
1367-291931-0006	train-other-500	with what is strictly personal occasional and religious has been considered foreign to the idea of the book Blank verse and the ten syllable couplet with all pieces markedly dramatic
1367-291931-0007	train-other-500	have been rejected as alien from what is commonly understood by Song and rarely conforming to Lyrical conditions in treatment But it is not anticipated nor is it possible that all readers shall think the line accurately drawn
1367-291931-0008	train-other-500	Some poems as Gray s Elegy the Allegro and Penseroso Wordsworth s Ruth
none	none	 or Campbell s Lord Ullin 
1367-291931-0009	train-other-500	might be claimed with perhaps equal justice for a narrative or descriptive selection whilst with reference especially to Ballads and Sonnets the Editor can only state that he has taken his utmost pains to decide without caprice
1367-291931-0010	train-other-500	or partiality This also is all he can plead in regard to a point even more liable to question what degree of merit should give rank among the Best That a Poem shall be worthy of the writer s genius
1367-291931-0011	train-other-500	that it shall reach a perfection commensurate with its aim that we should require finish in proportion to brevity
none	none	 that passion colour and originality cannot atone for serious imperfections in clearness 
1367-291931-0012	train-other-500	unity or truth that a few good lines do not make a good poem that popular estimate is serviceable as a guidepost more than as a compass above all that Excellence should be looked for
1367-291931-0013	train-other-500	rather in the Whole than in the Parts such and other such canons have been always steadily regarded He may however add that the pieces chosen and a far larger number rejected
1367-291931-0014	train-other-500	have been carefully and repeatedly considered and that he has been aided throughout by two friends of independent and exercised judgment besides the distinguished person addressed in the Dedication It is hoped that by this procedure
1367-291931-0015	train-other-500	the volume has been freed from that one sidedness which must beset individual decisions but for the final choice the Editor is alone responsible Chalmers vast collection with the whole works of all accessible poets
1367-291931-0016	train-other-500	not contained in it and the best Anthologies of different periods have been twice systematically read through and it is hence improbable that any omissions which may be regretted are due to oversight
1367-291931-0017	train-other-500	The poems are printed entire except in a very few instances specified in the notes where a stanza has been omitted The omissions have been risked only when the piece could be thus brought to a closer lyrical unity
1367-291931-0018	train-other-500	and as essentially opposed to this unity extracts obviously such are excluded In regard to the text the purpose of the book has appeared to justify the choice of the most poetical version
1367-291931-0019	train-other-500	wherever more than one exists and much labour has been given to present each poem in disposition spelling and punctuation to the greatest advantage In the arrangement the most poetically effective order has been attempted
1367-291931-0020	train-other-500	The English mind has passed through phases of thought and cultivation so various and so opposed during these three centuries of Poetry that a rapid passage between Old and New
1367-291931-0021	train-other-500	like rapid alteration of the eye s focus in looking at the landscape will always be wearisome and hurtful to the sense of Beauty The poems have been therefore distributed into Books corresponding
none	none	 I to the ninety years closing about sixteen sixteen II thence to seventeen hundred III to eighteen hundred IV to the half century just ended 
1367-291931-0023	train-other-500	Or looking at the Poets who more or less give each portion its distinctive character they might be called the Books of Shakespeare Milton Gray and Wordsworth The volume in this respect
1367-291931-0024	train-other-500	so far as the limitations of its range allow accurately reflects the natural growth and evolution of our Poetry A rigidly chronological sequence however rather fits a collection aiming at instruction than at pleasure
1367-291931-0025	train-other-500	and the Wisdom which comes through Pleasure within each book the pieces have therefore been arranged in gradations of feeling or subject The development of the symphonies of Mozart and Beethoven
1367-291931-0026	train-other-500	has been here thought of as a model and nothing placed without careful consideration And it is hoped that the contents of this Anthology will thus be found to present a certain unity as episodes in the noble language of Shelley
1367-291931-0027	train-other-500	to that great Poem which all poets like the company operating thoughts of one great mind have built up since the beginning of the world As he closes his long survey the Editor trusts he may add without egotism
1367-291931-0028	train-other-500	that he has found the vague general verdict of popular Fame more just than those have thought who with too severe a criticism would confine judgments on Poetry to the selected few of many generations
1367-291931-0029	train-other-500	Not many appear to have gained reputation without some gift or performance that in due degree deserved it and if no verses by certain writers who show less strength than sweetness
1367-291931-0030	train-other-500	or more thought than mastery in expression are printed in this volume it should not be imagined that they have been excluded without much hesitation and regret far less that they have been slighted
1367-291931-0031	train-other-500	Throughout this vast and pathetic array of Singers now silent few have been honoured with the name Poet
none	none	 and have not possessed a skill in words 
1367-291931-0032	train-other-500	a sympathy with beauty a tenderness of feeling or seriousness in reflection which render their works although never perhaps attaining that loftier and finer excellence here required better worth reading than
1367-291931-0033	train-other-500	much of what fills the scanty hours that most men spare for self improvement or for pleasure in any of its more elevated and permanent forms And if this be true of even mediocre poetry for how much more are we indebted to the best
none	none	 Like the fabled fountain of the Azores but with a more various power 
1367-291931-0034	train-other-500	the magic of this Art can confer on each period of life its appropriate blessing on early years Experience on maturity Calm on age Youthfulness Poetry gives treasures more golden than gold
1367-291931-0035	train-other-500	leading us in higher and healthier ways than those of the world and interpreting to us the lessons of Nature
none	none	 But she speaks best for herself Her true accents if the plan has been executed with success may be heard throughout the following pages wherever the Poets of England are honoured wherever the dominant language of the world is spoken it is hoped that they will find fit audience F T PALGRAVE THE GOLDEN TREASURY FIRST BOOK SUMMARY The Elizabethan Poetry as it is rather vaguely termed forms the substance of this Book which contains pieces from Wyat under Henry VIII to Shakespeare midway through the reign of James I and Drummond who carried on the early manner to a still later period There is here a wide range of style from simplicity expressed in a language hardly yet broken in to verse through the pastoral fancies and Italian conceits of the strictly Elizabethan time to the passionate reality of Shakespeare yet a general uniformity of tone prevails Few readers can fail to observe the natural sweetness of the verse the single hearted straightforwardness of the thoughts nor less the limitation of subject to the many phases of one passion which then characterised our lyrical poetry unless when as with Drummond and Shakespeare the purple light of Love is tempered by a spirit of sterner reflection It should be observed that this and the following Summaries apply in the main to the Collection here presented in which besides its restriction to Lyrical Poetry a strictly representative or historical Anthology has not been aimed at Great Excellence in human art as in human character has from the beginning of things been even more uniform than Mediocrity by virtue of the closeness of its approach to Nature and so far as the standard of Excellence kept in view has been attained in this volume a comparative absence of extreme or temporary phases in style a similarity of tone and manner will be found throughout something neither modern nor ancient but true in all ages and like the works of Creation perfect as on the first day one SPRING

her Where none can watch her In some close corner of my brain There I embrace and kiss her And so I both enjoy and miss her ANON ten ABSENCE Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require Nor dare I chide the world without end hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your affairs suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those So true a fool is love that in your will Though you do any thing he thinks no ill W SHAKESPEARE eleven How like a winter hath my absence been From Thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt what dark days seen What old December s bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summer s time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widow d wombs after their lords decease Yet this abundant issue seem d to me But hope of orphans and unfather d fruit For summer and his pleasures wait on thee And thou away the very birds are mute Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale dreading the winter s near W SHAKESPEARE twelve A CONSOLATION When in disgrace with Fortune and men s eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries And look upon myself and curse my fate Wishing me like to one more rich in hope Featured like him like him with friends possest Desiring this man s art and that man s scope With what I most enjoy contented least Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising Haply I think on Thee and then my state Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth sings hymns at heaven s gate For thy sweet love remember d such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings W SHAKESPEARE thirteen THE UNCHANGEABLE O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seem d my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that myself bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reign d All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stain d To leave for nothing all thy sum of good For nothing this wide universe I call Save thou my rose in it thou art my all W SHAKESPEARE fourteen To me fair Friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still Three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn d In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn d Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived For fear of which hear this thou age unbred Ere you were born was beauty s summer dead W SHAKESPEARE fifteen DIAPHENIA Diaphenia like the daffadowndilly White as the sun fair as the lily Heigh ho how do I love thee I do love thee as my lambs Are beloved of their dams How blest were I if thou would saint prove me Diaphenia like the spreading roses That in thy sweets all sweets encloses Fair sweet how do I love thee I do love thee as each flower Loves the sun s life giving power For dead thy breath to life might move me Diaphenia like to all things blessed When all thy praises are expressed Dear joy how do I love thee As the birds do love the spring Or the bees their careful king Then in requite sweet virgin love me H CONSTABLE sixteen ROSALINE Like to the clear in highest sphere Where all imperial glory shines Of selfsame colour is her hair Whether unfolded or in twines Heigh ho fair Rosaline Her eyes are sapphires set in snow Resembling heaven by every wink The Gods do fear whenas they glow And I do tremble when I think Heigh ho would she were mine Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud That beautifies Aurora s face Or like the silver crimson shroud That Phoebus smiling looks doth grace Heigh ho fair Rosaline Her lips are like two budded roses Whom ranks of lilies neighbour nigh Within which bounds she balm encloses Apt to entice a deity Heigh ho would she were mine Her neck like to a stately tower Where Love himself imprison d lies To watch for glances every hour From her divine and sacred eyes Heigh ho fair Rosaline Her paps are centres of delight Her breasts are orbs of heavenly frame Where Nature moulds the dew of light To feed perfection with the same Heigh ho would she were mine With orient pearl with ruby red With marble white with sapphire blue Her body every way is fed Yet soft in touch and sweet in view Heigh ho fair Rosaline Nature herself her shape admires The Gods are wounded in her sight And Love forsakes his heavenly fires And at her eyes his brand doth light Heigh ho would she were mine Then muse not Nymphs though I bemoan The absence of fair Rosaline Since for a fair there s fairer none Nor for her virtues so divine Heigh ho fair Rosaline Heigh ho my heart would God that she were mine T LODGE seventeen COLIN Beauty sat bathing by a spring Where fairest shades did hide her The winds blew calm the birds did sing The cool streams ran beside her My wanton thoughts enticed mine eye To see what was forbidden But better memory said fie So vain desire was chidden Hey nonny nonny O Hey nonny nonny Into a slumber then I fell When fond imagination Seemed to see but could not tell Her feature or her fashion But ev n as babes in dreams do smile And sometimes fall a weeping So I awaked as wise this while As when I fell a sleeping Hey nonny nonny O Hey nonny nonny THE SHEPHERD TONIE eighteen TO HIS LOVE Shall I compare thee to a summer s day Thou art more lovely and more temperate Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May And summer s lease hath all too short a date Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines And often is his gold complexion dimm d And every fair from fair sometime declines By chance or nature s changing course untrimm d But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou growest So long as men can breathe or eyes can see So long lives this and this gives life to thee W SHAKESPEARE nineteen TO HIS LOVE When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beauty s best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have exprest Ev n such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they look d but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing For we

And dost prejudge thy bliss and spoil thy rest Then thou would saint melt the ice out of thy breast And thy relenting heart would kindly warm O if thy pride did not our joys controul What world of loving wonders should saint thou see For if I saw thee once transform d in me Then in thy bosom I would pour my soul Then all my thoughts should in thy visage shine And if that aught mischanced thou should saint not moan Nor bear the burthen of thy griefs alone No I would have my share in what were thine And whilst we thus should make our sorrows one This happy harmony would make them none W ALEXANDER EARL OF STERLINE twenty three TRUE LOVE Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an ever fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandering bark Whose worth s unknown although his height be taken Love s not Time s fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle s compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out ev n to the edge of doom If this be error and upon me proved I never writ nor

Tuwhit Tuwhoo A merry note While greasy Joan doth keel the pot When all around the wind doth blow And coughing drowns the parson s saw And birds sit brooding in the snow And Marian s nose looks red and raw When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl Then nightly sings the staring owl Tuwhoo Tuwhit Tuwhoo A merry note While greasy Joan doth keel the pot W SHAKESPEARE twenty eight That time of year thou may saint in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruin d choirs where late the sweet birds sang In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west Which by and by black night doth take away Death s second self that seals up all in rest In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourish d by This thou perceiv saint which makes thy love more strong To love that well which thou must leave ere long W SHAKESPEARE twenty nine REMEMBRANCE When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought And with old woes new wail my dear time s waste Then can I drown an eye unused to flow For precious friends hid in death s dateless night And weep afresh love s long since cancell d woe And moan the expense of many a vanish d sight Then can I grieve at grievances foregone And heavily from woe to woe tell o er The sad account of fore bemoaned moan Which I new pay as if not paid before But if the while I think on thee dear friend All losses are restored and sorrows end W SHAKESPEARE thirty REVOLUTIONS Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end Each changing place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do contend Nativity once in the main of light Crawls to maturity wherewith being crown d Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight And Time that gave doth now his gift confound Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beauty s brow Feeds on the rarities of nature s truth And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand Praising Thy worth despite his cruel hand W SHAKESPEARE thirty one Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou know saint thy estimate The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy granting And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is swerving Thyself thou gav saint thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou gav saint it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growing Comes home again on better judgement making Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter In sleep a king but waking no such matter W SHAKESPEARE thirty two THE LIFE WITHOUT PASSION They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit Heaven s graces And husband nature s riches from expense They are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summer s flower is to the summer sweet Though to itself it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds W SHAKESPEARE thirty three THE LOVER S APPEAL And wilt thou leave me thus Say nay say nay for shame To save thee from the blame Of all my grief and grame And wilt thou leave me thus Say nay say nay And wilt thou leave me thus

commencement of the Modern In Dryden we see the first master of the new in Milton whose genius dominates here as Shakespeare s in the former book the crown and consummation of the early period Their splendid Odes are far in advance of any prior attempts Spenser s excepted they exhibit the wider and grander range which years and experience and the struggles of the time conferred on Poetry Poetry now gave expression to political feeling to religious thought to a high philosophic statesmanship in writers such as Marvell Herbert and Wotton whilst in Marvell and Milton again we find the first noble attempts at pure description of nature destined in our own ages to be continued and equalled Meanwhile the poetry of simple passion although before sixteen sixty often deformed by verbal fancies and conceits of thought and afterward by levity and an artificial tone produced in Herrick and Waller some charming pieces of more finished art than the Elizabethan until in the courtly compliments of Sedley it seems to exhaust itself and lie almost dormant for the hundred years between the days of Wither and Suckling and the days of Burns and Cowper That the change from our early style to the modern brought with it at first a loss of nature and simplicity is undeniable yet the far bolder and wider scope which Poetry took between sixteen twenty and seventeen hundred and the successful efforts then made to gain greater clearness in expression in their results have been no slight compensation sixty two ODE ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST S NATIVITY This is the month and this the happy morn Wherein the Son of Heaven s Eternal King Of wedded maid and virgin mother born Our great redemption from above did bring For so the holy sages once did sing That He our deadly forfeit should release And with His Father work us a perpetual peace That glorious Form that Light unsufferable And that far beaming blaze of Majesty Wherewith He wont at Heaven s high council table To sit the midst of Trinal Unity He laid aside and here with us to be Forsook the courts of everlasting day And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay Say heavenly Muse shall not thy sacred vein Afford a present to the Infant God Hast thou no verse no hymn or solemn strain To welcome Him to this His new abode Now while the heaven by the sun s team untrod Hath took no print of the approaching light And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright See how from far upon the eastern road The star led wizards haste with odours sweet O run prevent them with thy humble ode And lay it lowly at his blessed feet Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet And join thy voice unto the angel quire From out His secret altar touch d with hallow d fire THE HYMN It was the Winter wild While the heaven born Child All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies Nature in awe to Him Had doff d her gaudy trim With her great Master so to sympathise It was no season then for her To wanton with the sun her lusty paramour Only with speeches fair She woos the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow And on her naked shame Pollute with sinful blame The saintly veil of maiden white to throw Confounded that her Maker s eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities But He her fears to cease Sent down the meek eyed Peace She crown d with olive green came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere His ready harbinger With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing And waving wide her myrtle wand She strikes a universal peace through sea and land No war or battle s sound Was heard the world around The idle spear and shield were high up hung The hooked Chariot stood Unstain d with hostile blood The trumpet spake not to the armed throng And kings sat still with awful eye As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by But peaceful was the night Wherin the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began The winds with wonder whist Smoothly the waters kist Whispering new joys to the mild ocean Who now hath quite forgot to rave While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave The stars with deep amaze Stand fix d in steadfast gaze Bending one way their precious influence And will not take their flight For all the morning light Or Lucifer that often warn d them thence But in their glimmering orbs did glow Until their Lord Himself bespake and bid them go And though the shady gloom Had given day her room The sun himself withheld his wonted speed And hid his head for shame As his inferior flame The new enlightn d world no more should need He saw a greater Sun appear Then his bright throne or burning axletree could bear The shepherds on the lawn Or ere the point of dawn Sate simply chatting in a rustic row Full little thought they then That the mighty Pan Was kindly come to live with them below Perhaps their loves or else their sheep Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep When such music sweet Their hearts and ears did greet As never was by mortal finger strook Divinely warbled voice Answering the stringed noise As all their souls in blissful rapture took The air such pleasure loth to lose With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close Nature that heard such sound Beneath the hollow round Of Cynthia s seat the airy region thrilling Now was almost won To think her part was done And that her reign had here its last fulfilling She knew such harmony alone Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union At last surrounds their sight A globe of circular light That with long beams the shamefaced night array d The helmed Cherubim And sworded Seraphim Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display d Harping in loud and solemn quire With unexpressive notes to Heaven s new born Heir Such music as tis said Before was never made But when of old the sons of morning sung While the Creator great His constellations set And the well balanced world on hinges hung And cast the dark foundations deep And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep Ring out ye crystal spheres Once bless our human ears If ye have power to touch our senses so And let your silver chime Move in melodious time And let the bass of heaven s deep organ blow And with your ninefold harmony Make up full concert to the angelic symphony For if such holy Song Enwrap our fancy long Time will run back and fetch the age of gold And speckled vanity Will sicken soon and die And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould And Hell itself will pass away And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day Yea Truth and Justice then Will down return to men Orb d in a rainbow and like glories wearing Mercy will sit between Throned in celestial sheen With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering And Heaven as at some festival Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall But wisest Fate says No This must not yet be so The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy That on the bitter cross Must redeem our loss So both Himself and us to glorify Yet first to those ychain d in sleep The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep With such a horrid clang As on mount Sinai rang While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake The aged Earth agast With terrour of that blast Shall from the surface to the centre shake When at the worlds last session The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is But now begins for from this happy day The old Dragon under ground In straiter limits bound Not half so far casts his usurped sway And wroth to see his Kingdom fail Swinges the scaly horrour of his folded tail The oracles are dumb No voice or hideous hum Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving Apollo from his shrine Can no more divine With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving No nightly trance or breathed spell Inspires the pale eyed priest from the prophetic cell The lonely mountains o er And the resounding shore A voice of weeping heard and loud lament From haunted spring and dale Edged with poplar pale The parting Genius is with sighing sent With flower inwoven tresses torn The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn In consecrated earth And on the holy hearth The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint In urns and altars round A drear and dying sound Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint And the chill marble seems to sweat While each peculiar Power forgoes his wonted seat Peor and Baalim Forsake their temples dim With that twice batter d god of Palestine And mooned Ashtaroth Heaven s queen and mother both Now sits not girt with tapers holy shine The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn And sullen Moloch fled Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol all of blackest hue In vain with cymbals ring They call the grisly king In dismal dance about the furnace blue The brutish gods of Nile as fast Isis and Orus and the dog Anubis haste Nor is Osiris seen In Memphian grove or green Trampling the unshower d grass with lowings loud Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest Naught but profoundest hell can be his shroud In vain with timbrell d anthems dark The sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshipt ark He feels from Juda s land The dreaded infant s hand The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine Our Babe to shew his Godhead true Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew So when the sun in bed Curtain d with cloudy red Pillows his chin upon an orient wave The flocking shadows pale Troop to the infernal jail Each fetter d ghost slips to his several grave And the yellow skirted fays Fly after the night steeds leaving their moon loved maze But see the Virgin blest Hath laid her Babe to rest Time is our tedious song should here have ending Heavens youngest teemed star Hath fixed her polish d car Her sleeping Lord with hand maid lamp attending And all about the courtly stable Bright harness d angels sit in order serviceable J MILTON sixty three SONG FOR saint CECILIA S DAY sixteen eighty seven From Harmony from heavenly Harmony This universal frame began When nature underneath a heap Of jarring atoms lay And could not heave her head The tuneful voice was heard from high Arise ye more than dead Then cold and hot and moist and dry In order to their stations leap And Music s power obey From harmony from heavenly harmony This universal frame began From harmony to harmony Through all the compass of the notes it ran The diapason closing full in Man What passion cannot Music raise and quell When Jubal struck the chorded shell His listening brethren stood around And wondering on their faces fell To worship that celestial sound Less than a God they thought there could not dwell Within the hollow of that shell That spoke so sweetly and so well What passion cannot Music raise and quell The trumpet s loud clangor Excites us to arms With shrill notes of anger And mortal alarms The double double double beat Of the thundering drum Cries Hark the foes come Charge charge tis too late to retreat The soft complaining flute In dying notes discovers The woes of hopeless lovers Whose dirge is whisper d by the warbling lute Sharp violins proclaim Their jealous pangs and desperation Fury frantic indignation Depth of pains and height of passion For the fair disdainful dame But oh what art can teach What human voice can reach The sacred organ s praise Notes inspiring holy love Notes that wing their heavenly ways To mend the choirs above Orpheus could lead the savage race And trees uprooted left their place Sequacious of the lyre But bright Cecilia raised the wonder higher When to her Organ vocal breath was given An angel heard and straight appear d Mistaking Earth for Heaven Grand Chorus As from the power of sacred lays The spheres began to move And sung the great Creator s praise To all the blest above So when the last and dreadful hour This crumbling pageant shall devour The trumpet shall be heard on high The dead shall live the living die And Music shall untune the sky J DRYDEN sixty four ON THE LATE MASSACRE IN PIEMONT Avenge O Lord Thy slaughter d Saints whose bones Lie scatter d on the Alpine mountains cold Even them who kept Thy truth so pure of old When all our fathers worshipt stocks and stones Forget not In Thy book record their groans Who were Thy sheep and in their ancient fold Slain by the bloody Piemontese that roll d Mother with infant down the rocks Their moans The vales redoubled to the hills and they To Heaven Their martyr d blood and ashes sow O er all the Italian field where still doth sway The triple tyrant that from these may grow A hundred fold who having learnt Thy way Early may fly the Babylonian woe J MILTON sixty five HORATIAN ODE UPON CROMWELL S RETURN FROM IRELAND The forward youth that would appear Must now forsake his Muses dear Nor in the shadows sing His numbers languishing Tis time to leave the books in dust And oil the unused armour s rust Removing from the wall The corslet of the hall So restless Cromwell could not cease In the inglorious arts of peace But through adventurous war Urged his active star And like the three fork d lightning first Breaking the clouds where it was nurst Did thorough his own side His fiery way divide For tis all one to courage high The emulous or enemy And with such to enclose Is more than to oppose Then burning through the air he went And palaces and temples rent And Caesar s head at last Did through his laurels blast Tis madness to resist or blame The face of angry heaven s flame And if we would speak true Much to the Man is due Who from his private gardens where He lived reserved and austere As if he his highest plot To plant the bergamot Could by industrious valour climb To ruin the great work of time And cast the Kingdoms old Into another mould Though Justice against Fate complain And plead the ancient Rights in vain But those do hold or break As men are strong or weak Nature that hateth emptiness Allows of penetration less And therefore must make room Where greater spirits come What field of all the civil war Where his were not the deepest scar And Hampton shows what part He had of wiser art Where twining subtle fears with hope He wove a net of such a scope That Charles himself might chase To Carisbrook s narrow case That thence the Royal actor borne The tragic scaffold might adorn While round the armed bands Did clap their bloody hands He nothing common did or mean Upon that memorable scene But with his keener eye The axe s edge did try Nor call d the Gods with vulgar spite To vindicate his helpless right But bow d his comely head Down as upon a bed This was that memorable hour Which first assured the forced power So when they did design The Capitol s first line A Bleeding Head where they begun Did fright the architects to run And yet in that the State Foresaw its happy fate And now the Irish are ashamed To see themselves in one year tamed So much one man can do That does both act and know They can affirm his praises best And have though overcome confest How good he is how just And fit for highest trust Nor yet grown stiffer with command But still in the Republic s hand How fit he is to sway That can so well obey He to the Commons feet presents A Kingdom for his first year s rents And what he may forbears His fame to make it theirs And has his sword and spoils ungirt To lay them at the Public s skirt So when the falcon high Falls heavy from the sky She having kill d no more doth search But on the next green bough to perch Where when he first does lure The falconer has her sure What may not then our Isle presume While victory his crest does plume What may not others fear If thus he crowns each year As Caesar he ere long to Gaul To Italy an Hannibal And to all states not free Shall climacteric be The Pict no shelter now shall find Within his parti colour d mind But from this valour sad Shrink underneath the plaid Happy if in the tufted brake The English hunter him mistake Nor lay his hounds in near The Caledonian deer But Thou the War s and Fortune s son March indefatigably on And for the last effect Still keep the sword erect Besides the force it has to fright The spirits of the shady night The same arts that did gain A power must it

themselves amaze To win the palm the oak or bays And their incessant labours see Crown d from some single herb or tree Whose short and narrow verged shade Does prudently their toils upbraid While all the flowers and trees do close To weave the garlands of Repose Fair Quiet have I found thee here And Innocence thy sister dear Mistaken long I sought you then In busy companies of men Your sacred plants if here below Only among the plants will grow Society is all but rude To this delicious solitude No white nor red was ever seen So amorous as this lovely green Fond lovers cruel as their flame Cut in these trees their mistress name Little alas they know or heed How far these beauties hers exceed Fair trees where er your barks I wound No name shall but your own be found When we have run our passions heat Love hither makes his best retreat The gods who mortal beauty chase Still in a tree did end their race Apollo hunted Daphne so Only that she might laurel grow And Pan did after Syrinx speed Not as a nymph but for a reed What wondrous life in this I lead Ripe apples drop about my head The luscious clusters of the vine Upon my mouth do crush their wine The nectarine and curious peach Into my hands themselves do reach Stumbling on melons as I pass Ensnared with flowers I fall on grass Meanwhile the mind from pleasure less Withdraws into its happiness The mind that ocean where each kind Does straight its own resemblance find Yet it creates transcending these Far other worlds and other seas Annihilating all that s made To a green thought in a green shade Here at the fountain s sliding foot Or at some fruit tree s mossy root Casting the body s vest aside My soul into the boughs does glide There like a bird it sits and sings Then whets and claps its silver wings And till prepared for longer flight Waves in its plumes the various light Such was that happy Garden state While man there walk d without a mate After a place so pure and sweet What other help could yet be meet But twas beyond a mortal s share To wander solitary there Two paradises are in one To live in Paradise alone How well the skilful gardener drew Of flowers and herbs this dial new Where from above

sweet Liberty And if I give thee honour due Mirth admit me of thy crew To live with her and live with thee In unreproved pleasures free To hear the lark begin his flight And singing startle the dull night From his watch tower in the skies Till the dappled dawn doth rise Then to come in spite of sorrow And at my window bid good morrow Through the sweetbriar or the vine Or the twisted eglantine While the cock with lively din Scatters the rear of darkness thin And to the stack or the barn door Stoutly struts his dames before Oft listening how the hounds and horn Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn From the side of some hoar hill Through the high wood echoing shrill Sometime walking not unseen By hedgerow elms on hillocks green Right against the eastern gate Where the great Sun begins his state Robed in flames and amber light The clouds in thousand liveries dight While the ploughman near at hand Whistles o er the furrow d land And the milkmaid singeth blithe And the mower whets his scythe And every shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures Whilst the landscape round it measures Russet lawns and fallows gray Where the nibbling flocks do stray Mountains on whose barren breast The labouring clouds do often rest Meadows trim with daisies pied Shallow brooks and rivers wide Towers and battlements it sees Bosom d high in tufted trees Where perhaps some Beauty lies The Cynosure of neighbouring eyes Hard by a cottage chimney smokes From betwixt two aged oaks Where Corydon and Thyrsis met Are at their savoury dinner set Of herbs and other country messes Which the neat handed Phyllis dresses And then in haste her bower she leaves With Thestylis to bind the sheaves Or if the earlier season lead To the tann d haycock in the mead Sometimes with secure delight The upland hamlets will invite When the merry bells ring round And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth and many a maid Dancing in the chequer d

without father bred How little you bestead Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys Dwell in some idle brain And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess As thick and numberless As the gay motes that

of human sight And therefore to our weaker view O erlaid with black staid Wisdom s hue Black but such as in esteem Prince Memnon s sister might beseem Or that starr d Ethiop queen that strove To set

earth as fast And join with thee calm Peace and Quiet Spare Fast that oft with gods doth diet And hears the Muses in a ring Aye round about Jove s altar sing And add to these retired Leisure That in

near her highest noon Like one that had been led astray Through the heaven s wide pathless way And oft as if her head she bow d Stooping through a fleecy cloud Oft on a plat of rising ground I hear the far off curfeu sound Over some wide water d shore Swinging slow with sullen roar Or if the air will not permit Some still removed place will fit Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom Far from all resort of mirth Save the cricket on the hearth Or the bellman s drowsy charm To bless the doors from nightly harm Or let my lamp at midnight hour Be seen in some high lonely tower Where I may oft out watch the Bear With thrice great Hermes or unsphere The spirit of Plato to unfold What worlds or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her

still When the gust hath blown his fill Ending on the rustling leaves With minute drops from off the eaves And when the sun begins to fling His flaring beams me goddess bring To arched walks of twilight groves And shadows brown that Sylvan loves Of pine or monumental oak Where the rude axe with heaved stroke Was never heard the nymphs to daunt Or fright them from their hallow d haunt There in close covert by some brook Where no profaner eye may look Hide me from day s garish eye While the bee with honey d thigh That at her flowery work doth sing And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep Entice the dewy feather d Sleep And let some strange mysterious dream Wave at his wings in aery stream Of lively portraiture display d Softly on my eyelids laid And as I wake sweet music breathe Above about or underneath Sent by some spirit to mortals good Or the unseen Genius of the wood But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister s pale And love the high embowed roof With antique pillars massy proof And storied windows richly dight Casting a dim religious light There let the pealing organ blow To the full voiced quire below In service high and anthems clear As may with sweetness through mine ear Dissolve me into ecstasies And bring all Heaven before mine eyes And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage The hairy gown and mossy cell Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that heaven doth show And every herb that sips the dew Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain These pleasures Melancholy give And I with thee will choose to live J MILTON one hundred fourteen SONG OF THE EMIGRANTS IN BERMUDA Where the remote Bermudas ride In the ocean s bosom unespied From a small boat that row d along The listening woods received this song What should we do but sing His praise That led us through the watery maze Where He the huge sea monsters wracks That lift the deep upon their backs Unto an isle so long unknown And yet far kinder than our own He lands us on a grassy stage Safe from the storms and prelate s rage He gave us this eternal spring Which here enamels everything And sends the fowls to us in care On daily visits through the air He hangs in shades the orange bright Like golden lamps in a green night And does in the pomegranates close Jewels more rich than Ormus shows He makes the figs our mouths to meet And throws the melons at our feet But apples plants of such a price No tree could ever bear them twice With cedars chosen by His hand From Lebanon He stores the land And makes the hollow seas that roar Proclaim the ambergris on shore He cast of which we rather boast The Gospel s pearl upon our coast And in these rocks for us did frame A temple where to sound His name O let our voice His praise exalt Till it arrive at Heaven s vault Which then perhaps rebounding may Echo beyond the Mexique bay Thus sung they in the English boat A holy and a cheerful note And all the way to guide their chime With falling oars they kept the time A MARVELL one hundred fifteen AT A SOLEMN MUSIC Blest pair of Sirens pledges of Heaven s joy Sphere born harmonious Sisters Voice and Verse

Aloft in awful state The godlike hero sate On his imperial throne His valiant peers were placed around Their brows with roses and with myrtles bound So should desert in arms be crown d The lovely Thais by his side Sate like a blooming eastern bride In flower of youth and beauty s pride Happy happy happy pair None but the brave None but the brave None but the brave deserves the fair Timotheus placed on high Amid the tuneful quire With flying fingers touch d the lyre The trembling notes ascend the sky And heavenly joys inspire The song began from Jove Who left his blissful seats above Such is the power of mighty love A dragon s fiery form belied the god Sublime on radiant spires he rode When he to fair Olympia prest And while he sought her snowy breast Then round her slender waist he curl d And stamp d an image of himself a sovereign of the world The listening crowd admire the lofty sound A present deity they shout around A present deity the vaulted roofs rebound With ravish d ears The monarch hears Assumes the god Affects to nod And seems to shake the spheres The praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young The jolly god in triumph comes Sound the trumpets beat the drums Flush d with a purple grace He shows his honest face Now give the hautboys breath he comes he comes Bacchus ever fair and young Drinking joys did first ordain Bacchus blessings are a treasure Drinking is the soldier s pleasure Rich the treasure Sweet the pleasure Sweet is pleasure after pain Soothed with the sound the king grew vain Fought all his battles o er again And thrice he routed all his foes and thrice he slew the slain The master saw the madness rise His glowing cheeks his ardent eyes And while he Heaven and Earth defied Changed his hand and check d his pride He chose a mournful Muse Soft pity to infuse He sung Darius great and good By too severe a fate Fallen fallen fallen fallen Fallen from his high estate And weltering in his blood Deserted at his utmost need By those his former bounty fed On the bare earth exposed he lies With not a friend to close his eyes With downcast looks the joyless victor sate Revolving in his alter d soul The various turns of Chance below And now and then a sigh he stole And tears began to flow The mighty master smiled to see That love was in the next degree Twas but a kindred sound to move For pity melts the mind to love Softly sweet in Lydian measures Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures War he sung is toil and trouble Honour but an empty bubble Never ending still beginning Fighting still and still destroying If the world be worth thy winning Think O think it worth enjoying Lovely Thais sits beside thee Take the good the gods provide thee The many rend the skies with loud applause So Love was crown d but Music won the cause The prince unable to conceal his pain Gazed on the fair Who caused his care And sigh d and look d sigh d and look d Sigh d and look d and sigh d again At length with love and wine at once opprest The vanquish d victor sunk upon her breast Now strike the golden lyre again A louder yet and yet a louder strain Break his bands of sleep asunder And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder Hark hark the horrid sound Has raised up his head As awaked from the dead And amazed he stares around Revenge revenge Timotheus cries See the Furies arise See the snakes that they rear How they hiss in their hair And the sparkles that flash from their eyes Behold a ghastly band Each a torch in his hand Those are Grecian ghosts that in battle were slain And unburied remain Inglorious on the plain Give the vengeance due To the valiant crew Behold how they toss their torches on high How they point to the Persian abodes And glittering temples of their hostile gods The princes applaud with a furious joy And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy Thais led the way To light him to his prey And like another Helen fired another Troy Thus long ago Ere heaving bellows learn d to blow While organs yet were mute Timotheus to his breathing flute And sounding lyre Could swell the soul to rage or kindle soft desire At last divine Cecilia came Inventress of the vocal frame The sweet enthusiast from her sacred store Enlarged the former narrow bounds And added length to solemn sounds With Nature s mother wit and arts unknown before Let old Timotheus yield the prize Or both divide the crown He raised a mortal to the skies She drew an angel down J DRYDEN THIRD BOOK SUMMARY It is more difficult to characterise the English Poetry of the eighteenth century than that of any other For it was an age not only of spontaneous transition but of bold experiment it includes not only such divergences of thought as distinguished the Rape of the Lock from the Parish Register but such vast contemporaneous differences as lie between Pope and Collins Burns and Cowper Yet we may clearly trace three leading moods or tendencies the aspects of courtly or educated life represented by Pope and carried to exhaustion by his followers the poetry of Nature and of Man viewed through a cultivated and at the same time an impassioned frame of mind by Collins and Gray lastly the study of vivid and simple narrative including natural description begun by Gay and Thomson pursued by Burns and others in the north and established in England by Goldsmith Percy Crabbe and Cowper Great varieties in style accompanied these diversities in aim poets could not always distinguish the manner suitable for subjects so far apart and the union of the language of courtly and of common life exhibited most conspicuously by Burns has given a tone to the poetry of that century which is better explained by reference to its historical origin than by naming it in the common criticism of our day artificial There is again a nobleness of thought a courageous aim at high and in a strict sense manly excellence in many of the writers nor can that period be justly termed tame and wanting in originality which produced poems such as Pope s Satires Gray s Odes and Elegy the ballads of Gay and Carey the songs of Burns and Cowper In truth Poetry at this as at all times was a more or less unconscious mirror of the genius of the age and the brave and admirable spirit of Enquiry which made the eighteenth century the turning time in European civilisation is reflected faithfully in its verse An intelligent reader will find the influence of Newton as markedly in the poems of Pope as of Elizabeth in the plays of Shakespeare On this great subject however these indications must here be sufficient one hundred seventeen ODE ON THE PLEASURE ARISING FROM VICISSITUDE Now the golden Morn aloft Waves her dew bespangled wing With vermeil cheek and whisper soft She woos the tardy Spring Till April starts and calls around The sleeping fragrance from the ground And lightly o er the living scene Scatters his freshest tenderest green New born flocks in rustic dance Frisking ply their feeble feet Forgetful of their wintry trance The birds his presence greet But chief the sky lark warbles high His trembling thrilling ecstasy And lessening from the dazzled sight Melts into air and liquid light Yesterday the sullen year Saw the snowy whirlwind fly Mute was the music of the air The herd stood drooping by Their raptures now that wildly flow No yesterday nor morrow know Tis Man alone that joy descries With forward and reverted eyes Smiles on past Misfortune s brow Soft Reflection s hand can trace And o er the cheek of Sorrow throw A melancholy grace While Hope prolongs our happier hour Or deepest shades that dimly lour And blacken round our weary way Gilds with a gleam of distant day Still where rosy Pleasure leads See a kindred Grief pursue Behind the steps that Misery treads Approaching Comfort view The hues of bliss more brightly glow Chastised by sabler tints of woe And blended form with artful strife The strength and harmony of life See the wretch that long has tost On the thorny bed of pain At length repair his vigour lost And breathe and walk again The meanest floweret of the vale The simplest note that swells the gale The common sun the air the skies To him are opening Paradise

tinklings lull the distant folds Save that from yonder ivy mantled tower The moping owl does to the moon complain Of such as wandering near her secret bower Molest her ancient solitary reign Beneath those rugged elms that yew tree s shade Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap Each in his narrow cell for ever laid The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep The breezy call of incense breathing morn The swallow twittering from the straw built shed The cock s shrill clarion or the echoing horn No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn Or busy housewife ply her evening care No children run to lisp their sire s return Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke How jocund did they drive their team afield How bow d the woods beneath their sturdy stroke Let not Ambition mock their useful toil Their homely joys and destiny obscure Nor

inglorious Milton here may rest Some Cromwell guiltless of his country s blood Th applause of listening senates to command The threats of pain and ruin to despise To scatter plenty o er a smiling land And read their history in a nation s eyes Their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone Their growing virtues but their crimes confined Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne And shut the gates of

Morning A L BARBAULD FOURTH BOOK SUMMARY It proves sufficiently the lavish wealth of our own age in Poetry that the pieces which without conscious departure from the standard of Excellence render this Book by far the longest were with very few exceptions composed during the first thirty years the nineteenth century Exhaustive reasons can hardly be given for the strangely sudden appearance of individual genius but none in the Editor s judgment can be less adequate than that which assigns the splendid national achievements of our recent poetry to an impulse from the frantic follies and criminal wars that at the time disgraced the least essentially civilised of our foreign neighbours The first French Revolution was rather in his opinion one result and in itself by no means the most important of that far wider and greater spirit which through enquiry and doubt through pain and triumph sweeps mankind round the circles of its gradual development and it is to this that we must trace the literature of modern Europe But without more detailed discussion on the motive causes of Scott Wordsworth Campbell Keats and Shelley we may observe that these Poets with others carried to further perfection the later tendencies of the Century preceding in simplicity of narrative reverence for human Passion and Character in every sphere and impassioned love of Nature that whilst maintaining on the whole the advances in art made since the Restoration they renewed the half forgotten melody and depth of tone which marked the best Elizabethan writers that lastly to what was thus inherited they added a richness in language and a variety in metre a force and fire in narrative a tenderness and bloom in feeling an insight into the finer passages of the Soul and the inner meanings of the landscape a larger and wiser Humanity hitherto hardly attained and perhaps unattainable even by predecessors of not inferior individual genius In a word the Nation which after the Greeks in their glory has been the most gifted of all nations for Poetry expressed in these men the highest strength and prodigality of its nature They interpreted the age to itself hence the many phases of thought and style they present to sympathise with each fervently and impartially without fear and without fancifulness is no doubtful step in the higher education of the Soul For as with the Affections and the Conscience Purity in Taste is absolutely proportionate to Strength and when once the mind has raised itself to grasp and to delight in Excellence those who love most will be found to love most

bards in fealty to Apollo hold Oft of one wide expanse had I been told That deep brow d Homer ruled as his demesne Yet did I never breathe its pure serene Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold

on her face But when I told the cruel scorn That crazed that bold and lovely Knight And that he cross d the mountain woods Nor rested day nor night That sometimes from the savage den And sometimes from the darksome shade And sometimes starting up at once In green and sunny glade There came and look d him in the face An angel beautiful and bright And that he knew it was a Fiend This miserable Knight And that unknowing what he did He leap d amid a murderous band And saved from outrage worse than death The Lady of the Land And how she wept and clasp d his knees And how she tended him in vain

My thoughts are with the Dead with them I live in long past years Their virtues love their faults condemn Partake their hopes and fears And from their lessons seek and find Instruction with an humble

art we know not What is most like thee From rainbow clouds there flow not Drops so bright to see As from thy presence showers a rain of melody Like a poet hidden In the light of thought Singing hymns unbidden Till the world is wrought To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not Like a high born maiden In a palace tower Soothing her love laden Soul in secret hour With music sweet as love which

of hemlock I had drunk Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains One minute past and Lethe wards had sunk Tis not through envy of thy happy lot But being too happy in thine happiness That thou light winged Dryad of the trees In some melodious plot Of beechen green and shadows numberless Singest of summer in full throated ease O for a draught of vintage that hath been Cool d a long age in the deep delved earth Tasting of Flora and the country green Dance and Provencal song and sunburnt mirth O for a beaker full of the warm South Full of the true the blushful Hippocrene With beaded bubbles winking at the brim And purple stained mouth That I might drink and leave the world unseen And with thee fade away into the forest dim Fade far away dissolve and quite forget What thou among the leaves hast never known The weariness the fever and the fret Here where men sit and hear each other groan Where palsy shakes a few sad last gray hairs Where youth grows pale and spectre thin and dies Where but to think is to be full of sorrow And leaden eyed despairs Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes Or new Love pine at them beyond to morrow Away away for I will fly to thee Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards But on the viewless wings of Poesy Though the dull brain perplexes and retards Already with thee tender is the night And haply the Queen Moon is on her throne Cluster d around by all her starry Fays But here there is no light Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways I cannot see what flowers are at my feet Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs But in embalmed darkness guess each sweet Wherewith the seasonable month endows The grass the thicket and the fruit tree wild White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine Fast fading violets cover d up in leaves And mid May s eldest child The coming musk rose full of dewy wine The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves Darkling I listen and for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death Call d him soft names in many a mused rhyme To take into the air my quiet breath Now more than ever seems it rich to die To cease upon the midnight with no pain While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstasy Still wouldst thou sing and I have ears in vain To thy high requiem become a sod Thou wast not born for death immortal Bird No hungry generations tread thee down The voice I hear this passing night was heard In ancient days by emperor and clown Perhaps the self same song that found a path Through the sad heart of Ruth when sick for home She stood in tears amid the alien corn The same that oft times hath Charm d magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn Forlorn the very word is like a bell To

As is the humour of the game While I am gazing A nun demure of lowly port Or sprightly maiden of Love s court In thy simplicity the sport Of all temptations A queen in crown of rubies drest A

rosy hue Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies And full grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn Hedge crickets

Where the Rhine s broad billow freezes Or the dark brown Danube roars O winds of Winter list ye there To many a deep and dying groan Or start ye demons of the midnight air At shrieks and thunders

my true love s forehead plant A crest of blooming heather And what if I enwreathed my own Twere no offence to reason The sober hills thus deck their brows To meet the wintry season I see but not by sight alone Loved Yarrow have I won thee A ray of Fancy still survives Her sunshine plays upon thee Thy ever youthful waters keep A course of lively pleasure And gladsome notes my lips can breathe

garland weaves Of sapless green and ivy dun Round stems that never kiss the sun Where the lawns and pastures be And the sandhills of the sea Where the melting hoar frost wets The daisy star that never sets And wind flowers and violets Which yet join not scent to hue Crown the pale year weak and new When the night is left behind In the deep east dim and blind And the blue noon is over us And the

amid the pines that stood The giants of the waste Tortured by storms to shapes as rude As serpents interlaced And soothed by every azure breath That under heaven is blown To harmonies and hues beneath As tender as its own Now all the tree tops lay asleep Like green waves on the sea As still as in the silent deep The ocean woods may be How calm it was the silence there By such a chain was bound That even the busy woodpecker Made stiller by her sound The inviolable quietness The breath of peace we drew With its soft motion made not less The calm that round us grew There seem d from the remotest seat Of the wide mountain waste To the soft flower beneath our feet A magic circle traced A spirit interfused around A thrilling silent life To momentary peace it bound Our mortal nature s strife And

little sky Gulf d in a world below A firmament of purple light Which in the dark earth lay More boundless than the depth of night And purer than the day In which the lovely forests grew As in the upper air More perfect both in shape and hue Than any spreading there There lay the glade and neighbouring lawn And through the dark green wood The white sun twinkling like the dawn Out of a speckled cloud Sweet views which in our world above Can never well be seen Were imaged by the water s love Of that fair forest green And all was interfused beneath With an Elysian glow An atmosphere without a breath A softer day below Like one beloved the scene had lent To the dark water s breast Its very leaf and lineament With more than truth exprest Until an envious wind crept by Like an unwelcome

floating water lilies broad and bright Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge With moonlight beams of their own watery light And bulrushes and reeds of such deep green As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen Methought that of these visionary flowers I made a nosegay bound in such a way That the same hues which in their natural bowers Were mingled or opposed the like array Kept these

rooks with busy caw Foraging for sticks and straw Thou shalt at one glance behold The daisy and the marigold White plumed lilies and the first Hedge grown primrose that hath burst Shaded hyacinth alway Sapphire queen of the mid May And every leaf and every flower Pearled with the self same shower Thou shalt see the field mouse peep Meagre from its celled sleep And the snake all winter thin

its swarm Acorns ripe down pattering While the autumn breezes sing O sweet Fancy let her loose Everything is spoilt by use Where s the cheek that doth not fade Too much gazed at Where s the maid Whose lip mature is ever new Where s the eye however blue Doth not weary Where s the face One would meet in every place Where s the voice however soft One would hear so very oft At a touch sweet Pleasure

thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind To her fair works did Nature link The human soul that through me ran And much it grieved my heart to think What Man has made of Man Through primrose tufts in that sweet bower The periwinkle trail d its wreaths And tis my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes The birds around me hopp d and play d Their thoughts I cannot measure But the least motion which they made It seem d a thrill of pleasure The budding twigs spread out their fan To catch the breezy air And I must think do all I can That there was pleasure there If this belief from

desolate Her father took another mate And Ruth not seven years old A slighted child at her own will Went wandering over dale and hill In thoughtless freedom bold And she had made a pipe of straw And music from that pipe could draw Like sounds of winds and floods Had built a bower upon the green As if she from her birth had been An infant of the woods Beneath her father s roof alone She seem d to live her thoughts her own Herself her own delight Pleased with herself nor sad nor gay She pass d her time and in this way Grew up to woman s height There came a youth from Georgia s shore A military casque he wore With splendid feathers drest He brought them from the Cherokees The feathers nodded in the breeze And made a gallant crest From Indian blood you deem him sprung But no he spake the English tongue And bore a soldier s name And when America was free From battle and from jeopardy He cross the ocean came With hues of genius on his cheek In finest tones the youth could speak While he was yet a boy The moon the glory of the sun And streams that murmur as they run Had been his dearest joy He was a lovely youth I guess The panther in the wilderness Was not so fair as he And when he chose to sport and play No dolphin ever was so gay Upon the tropic sea Among the Indians he had fought And with him many tales he brought Of pleasure and of fear Such tales as told to any maid By such a youth in the green shade Were perilous to hear He told of girls a happy rout Who quit their fold with dance and shout Their pleasant Indian town To gather strawberries all day long Returning with a choral song When daylight is gone down He spake of plants that hourly change Their blossoms through a boundless range Of intermingling hues With budding fading faded flowers They stand the wonder of the bowers From morn to evening dews He told of the Magnolia spread High as a cloud high over head The cypress and her spire Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam Cover a hundred leagues and seem To set the hills on fire The youth of green savannahs spake And many an endless endless lake With all its fairy crowds Of islands that together lie As quietly as spots of sky Among the evening clouds And then he said How sweet it were A fisher or a hunter there In sunshine or in shade To wander with an easy mind And build a household fire and find A home in every glade What days and what bright years Ah me Our life were life indeed with Thee So pass d in quiet bliss And all the while said he to know That we were in a world of woe On such an earth as this And then he sometimes interwove Fond thoughts about a father s love For there said he are spun Around the heart such tender ties That our own children to our eyes Are dearer than the sun Sweet Ruth and could you go with me My helpmate in the woods to be Our shed at night to rear Or run my own adopted bride A sylvan huntress at my side And drive the flying deer Beloved Ruth No more he said The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed A solitary tear She thought again and did agree With him to sail across the sea And drive the flying deer And now as fitting is and right We in the church our faith will plight A husband and a wife Even so they did and I may say That to sweet Ruth that happy day Was more than human life Through dream and vision did she sink Delighted all the while to think That on those lonesome floods And green savannahs she should share His board with lawful joy and bear His name in the wild woods But as you have before been told This Stripling sportive gay and bold And with his dancing crest So beautiful through savage lands Had roam d about with vagrant bands Of Indians in the West The wind the tempest roaring high The tumult of a tropic sky Might well be dangerous food For him a youth to whom was given So much of earth so much of heaven And such impetuous blood Whatever in those climes he found Irregular in sight or sound Did to his mind impart A kindred impulse seem d allied To his own powers and justified The workings of his heart Nor less to feed voluptuous thought The beauteous forms of Nature wrought Fair trees and gorgeous flowers The breezes their own languor lent The stars had feelings which they sent Into those favour d bowers Yet in his worst pursuits I ween That sometimes there did intervene Pure hopes of high intent For passions link d to forms so fair And stately needs must have their share Of noble sentiment But ill he lived much evil saw With men to whom no better law Nor better life was known Deliberately and undeceived Those wild men s vices he received And gave them back his own His genius and his moral frame Were thus impair d and he became The slave of low desires A man who without self control Would seek what the degraded soul Unworthily admires And yet he with no feign d delight Had woo d the maiden day and night Had loved her night and morn What could he less than love a maid Whose heart with so much nature play d So kind and so forlorn Sometimes most earnestly he said O Ruth I have been worse than dead False thoughts thoughts bold and vain Encompass d me on every side When I in confidence and pride Had cross d the Atlantic main Before me shone a glorious world Fresh as a banner bright unfurl d To music suddenly I look d upon those hills and plains And seem d as if let loose from chains To live at liberty No more of this for now by thee Dear Ruth more happily set free With nobler zeal I burn My soul from darkness is released Like the whole sky when to the east The morning doth return Full soon that better mind was gone No hope no wish remain d not one They stirr d him now no more New objects did new pleasure give And once again he wish d to live As lawless as before Meanwhile as thus with him it fared They for the voyage were prepared And went to the sea shore But when they thither came the youth Deserted his poor bride and Ruth Could never find him more God help thee Ruth Such pains she had That she in half a year was mad And in a prison housed And there exulting in her wrongs Among the music of her songs She fearfully caroused Yet sometimes milder hours she knew Nor wanted sun nor rain nor dew Nor pastimes of the May They all were with her in her cell And a clear brook with cheerful knell Did o er the pebbles play When Ruth three seasons thus had lain There came a respite to her pain She from her prison fled But of the vagrant none took thought And where it liked her best she sought Her shelter and her bread Among the fields she breathed again The master current of her brain Ran permanent and free And coming to the banks of Tone There did she rest and dwell alone Under the greenwood tree The engines of her pain the tools That shaped her sorrow rocks and pools And airs that gently stir The vernal leaves she loved them still Nor ever tax d them with the ill Which had been done to her A barn her Winter bed supplies But till the warmth of Summer skies And Summer days is gone And all do in this tale agree She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree And other home hath none An innocent life yet far astray And Ruth will long before her day Be broken down and old Sore aches she needs must have but less Of mind than body s wretchedness From damp and rain and cold If she is prest by want of food She from her dwelling in the wood Repairs to a road side And there she begs at one steep place Where up and down with easy pace The horsemen travellers ride That oaten pipe of hers is mute Or thrown away but with a flute Her loneliness she cheers This flute made of a hemlock stalk At evening in his homeward walk The Quantock woodman hears I too have pass d her on the hills Setting her little water mills By spouts and fountains wild Such small machinery as she turn d Ere she had wept ere she had mourn d A young and happy child Farewell and when thy days are told Ill fated Ruth in hallow d mould Thy corpse shall buried be For thee a funeral bell shall ring And all the congregation sing A Christian psalm for thee W WORDSWORTH two hundred seventy four WRITTEN IN THE EUGANEAN HILLS NORTH ITALY Many a green isle needs must be In the deep wide sea of misery Or the mariner worn and wan Never thus could voyage on Day and night and night and day Drifting on his dreary way With the solid darkness black Closing round his vessel s track Whilst above the sunless sky Big with clouds hangs heavily And behind the tempest fleet Hurries on with lightning feet Riving sail and cord and plank Till the ship has almost drank Death from the o er brimming deep And sinks down down like that sleep When the dreamer seems to be Weltering through eternity And the dim low line before Of a dark and distant shore Still recedes as ever still Longing with divided will But no power to seek or shun He is ever drifted on O er the unreposing wave To the haven of the grave Ah many flowering islands lie In the waters of wide agony To such a one this morn was led My bark by soft winds piloted Mid the mountains

still Round the solitary hill Beneath is spread like a green sea The waveless plain of Lombardy Bounded by the vaporous air Islanded by cities fair Underneath day s azure eyes Ocean s nursling Venice lies A peopled labyrinth of walls Amphitrite s destined halls Which her hoary sire now paves With his blue and beaming waves Lo the sun upsprings behind Broad red radiant half reclined On the level quivering line Of the waters crystalline And before that chasm of light As within a furnace bright Column tower and dome and spire Shine like obelisks of fire Pointing with inconstant motion From the altar of dark ocean To the sapphire tinted skies As the flames of sacrifice From the marble shrines did rise As to pierce the dome of gold Where Apollo spoke of old Sun girt City thou hast been Ocean

branded brow Stooping to the slave of slaves From thy throne among the waves Wilt thou be when the sea mew Flies as once before it flew O er thine isles depopulate And all is in its ancient state Save

To the point of heaven s profound Fills the overflowing sky And the plains that silent lie Underneath the leaves unsodden Where the infant frost has trodden With his morning winged feet Whose bright print is gleaming yet And the red and golden vines Piercing with their trellised lines The rough dark skirted wilderness The dun and bladed grass no less Pointing from this hoary tower In the windless

frail bark of this lone being Pass to other sufferers fleeing And its ancient pilot Pain Sits beside the helm again Other flowering isles must be In the sea of life and agony Other spirits float and flee O er that gulf ev n now perhaps On some rock the wild wave wraps With folding wings they waiting sit For my bark to pilot it To some calm and blooming cove Where for me and those I love May a windless bower be built Far from passion pain and guilt In a dell mid lawny hills Which the wild sea murmur fills And soft sunshine and the sound Of old forests echoing round And the light and smell divine Of all flowers that breathe and shine We may live so happy there That the spirits of the air Envying us may even entice To our healing paradise The polluting multitude But their rage would be subdued By that clime divine and calm And the winds whose wings rain balm On the uplifted soul and leaves Under which the bright sea heaves While each breathless interval In their whisperings musical

earth and fill Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air With living hues and odours plain and hill Wild Spirit which art moving everywhere Destroyer and preserver Hear O hear Thou on whose stream mid the steep sky s commotion Loose clouds like earth s decaying leaves are shed Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean Angels of rain and lightning there are spread On the blue surface of thine airy surge Like the bright hair uplifted from the head Of some fierce Maenad ev n from the dim verge Of the horizon to the zenith s height The locks of the approaching storm Thou dirge Of the dying year to which this closing night Will be the dome of a vast sepulchre Vaulted with all thy congregated might Of vapours from whose solid atmosphere Black rain and fire and hail will burst O hear Thou who didst waken from his summer dreams The blue Mediterranean where he lay Lull d by the coil of his crystalline streams Beside a pumice isle in Baiae s bay And saw in sleep old palaces and towers Quivering within the wave s intenser day All overgrown with azure moss and flowers So sweet the sense faints picturing them Thou For whose path the Atlantic s level powers Cleave themselves into chasms while far below The sea blooms and the oozy woods which wear The sapless foliage of the ocean know Thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear And tremble and despoil themselves O hear If I were a dead leaf thou mightest bear If I were a swift cloud to fly with thee A wave to pant beneath thy power and share The impulse of thy strength only less free Than Thou O uncontrollable If even I were as in my boyhood and could be The comrade of thy wanderings over heaven As then when to outstrip the skyey speed Scarce seem d a vision I would ne er have striven As thus with thee in prayer in my sore need O lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud I fall upon the thorns of life I bleed A heavy weight of hours has chain d and bow d One too like thee tameless and swift and proud Make me thy lyre ev n as the forest is What if my leaves are falling like its own The tumult of thy mighty harmonies Will take from both a deep autumnal tone Sweet though in sadness Be thou Spirit fierce My spirit Be thou me impetuous one Drive my dead thoughts over the universe Like wither d leaves to quicken a new birth And by the incantation of this verse Scatter as from an unextinguish d hearth Ashes and sparks my words among mankind Be through my lips to unawaken d earth The trumpet of a prophecy O Wind If Winter comes can Spring be far behind P B SHELLEY two hundred seventy six NATURE AND THE POET Suggested by a Picture of Peele Castle in a Storm painted by Sir George Beaumont I was thy neighbour once thou rugged Pile Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee I saw thee every day and all the while Thy form was sleeping on a glassy sea So pure the sky so quiet was the air So like so very like was day to day Whene er I look d thy image still was there It trembled but it never pass d away How perfect was the calm It seem d no sleep No mood which season takes away or brings I could have fancied that the mighty Deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things Ah then if mine had been the painter s hand To express what then I saw and add the gleam The light that never was on sea or land The consecration and the Poet s dream I would have planted thee thou hoary pile Amid a world how different from this Beside a sea that could not cease to smile On tranquil land beneath a sky of bliss A picture had it been of lasting ease Elysian quiet without toil or strife No motion but the moving tide a breeze Or merely silent Nature s breathing life Such in the fond illusion of my heart Such picture would I at that time have made And seen the soul of truth in every part A steadfast peace that might not be betray d So once it would have been tis so no more I have submitted to a new control A power is gone which nothing can restore A deep distress hath humanised my soul Not for a moment could I now behold A smiling sea and be what I have been The feeling of my loss will ne er be old This which I know I speak with mind serene Then Beaumont Friend who would have been the friend If he had lived of him whom I deplore This work of thine I blame not but commend This sea in anger and that dismal shore O tis a passionate work yet wise and well Well chosen is the spirit that is here That hulk which labours in the deadly swell This rueful sky this pageantry of fear And this huge Castle standing here sublime I love to see the look with which it braves Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time The lightning the fierce wind and trampling waves Farewell farewell the heart that lives alone Housed in a dream at distance from the Kind Such happiness wherever it be known Is to be pitied for tis surely blind But welcome fortitude and patient cheer And frequent sights of what is to be borne Such sights or worse as are before me here Not without hope we suffer and we mourn W WORDSWORTH two hundred seventy seven THE POET S DREAM On a Poet s lips I slept Dreaming like a love adept In the sound his breathing kept Nor seeks nor finds he mortal blisses But feeds on the aerial kisses Of shapes that haunt Thought s wildernesses He will watch from dawn to gloom The lake reflected sun illume The yellow bees in the ivy bloom Nor heed nor see what things they be But from these create he can Forms more real than living Man Nurslings of immortality P B SHELLEY two hundred seventy eight The World is too much with us late and soon Getting and spending we lay waste our powers Little we see in Nature that is ours We have given our hearts away a sordid boon This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon The winds that will be howling at all hours And are up gather d now like sleeping flowers For this for everything we are out of tune It moves us not Great God I d rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn So might I standing on this pleasant lea Have glimpses that would

alter d size But Springtide blossoms on thy lips And tears take sunshine from thine eyes Life is but Thought so think I will That Youth and I are housemates still Dew drops are the gems of morning But the tears of mournful eve Where no hope is life s a warning That only serves to make us grieve When we are old That only serves to make us grieve With oft and tedious taking leave Like some poor nigh related guest That may not rudely be dismist Yet hath out stay d his welcome while And tells the jest without a smile S T COLERIDGE two hundred eighty one THE TWO APRIL MORNINGS We walk d along while bright and red Uprose the morning sun And Matthew stopp d he looked and said The will of God be done A village schoolmaster was he With hair of glittering gray As blithe a man as you could see On a spring holiday And on that morning through the grass And by the steaming rills We travel d merrily to pass A day among the hills Our work said I was well begun Then from thy breast what thought Beneath so beautiful a sun So sad a sigh has brought A second time did Matthew stop And fixing still his eye Upon the eastern mountain top To me he made reply Yon cloud with that long purple cleft Brings fresh into my mind A day like this which I have left Full thirty years behind And just above yon slope of corn Such colours and no other Were in the sky that April morn Of this the very brother With rod and line I sued the sport Which that sweet season gave And to the church yard come stopp d short Beside my daughter s grave Nine summers had she scarcely seen The pride of all the vale And then she sang she would have been A very nightingale Six feet in earth my Emma lay And yet I loved her more For so it seem d than till that day I e er had loved before And turning from her grave I met Beside the church yard yew A blooming Girl whose hair was wet With points of morning dew A basket on her head she bare Her brow was smooth and white To see a child so very fair It was a pure delight No fountain from its rocky cave E er tripped with foot so free She seem d as happy as a wave That dances on the sea There came from me a sigh of pain Which I could ill confine I looked at her and looked again And did not wish her mine Matthew is in his grave yet now Methinks I see him stand As at that moment with a bough Of wilding in his hand W WORDSWORTH two hundred eighty two THE FOUNTAIN A Conversation We talk d with open heart and tongue Affectionate and true A pair of friends though I was young And Matthew seventy two We lay beneath a spreading oak Beside a mossy seat And from the turf a fountain broke And gurgled at our feet Now Matthew said I let us match This water s pleasant tune With some old border song or catch That suits a summer s noon Or of the church clock and the chimes Sing here beneath the shade That half mad thing of witty rhymes Which you last April made In silence Matthew lay and eyed The spring beneath the tree And thus the dear old man replied The gray hair d man of glee No check no stay this Streamlet fears How merrily it goes Twill murmur on a thousand years And flow as now it flows And here on this delightful day I cannot choose but think How oft a vigorous man I lay Beside this fountain s brink My eyes are dim with childish tears My heart is idly stirr d For the same sound is in my ears Which in those days I heard Thus fares it still in our decay And yet the wiser mind Mourns less for what Age takes away Than what it leaves behind The blackbird amid leafy trees The lark above the hill Let loose their carols when they please Are quiet when they will With Nature never do they wage A foolish strife they see A happy youth and their old age Is beautiful and free But we are press d by heavy laws And often glad no more We wear a face of joy because We have been glad of yore If there be one who need bemoan His kindred laid in earth The household hearts that were his own It is the man of mirth My days my friend are almost gone My life has been approved And many love me but by none Am I enough beloved Now both himself and me he wrongs The man who thus complains I live and sing my idle songs Upon these happy plains And Matthew for thy children dead I ll be a son to thee At this he grasp d my hand and said Alas that cannot be We rose up from the fountain side And down the smooth descent Of the green sheep track did we glide And through the wood we went And ere we came to Leonard s Rock He sang those witty rhymes About the crazy old church clock And the bewilder d chimes W WORDSWORTH two hundred eighty three THE RIVER OF LIFE The more we live more brief appear Our life s succeeding stages A day to childhood seems a year And years like passing ages The gladsome current of our youth Ere passion yet disorders Steals lingering like a river smooth Along its grassy borders But as the careworn cheek grows wan And sorrow s shafts fly thicker Ye Stars that measure life to man Why seem your courses quicker When joys have lost their bloom and breath And life itself is vapid Why as we reach the Falls of Death Feel we its tide more rapid It may be strange yet who would change Time s course to lower speeding When one by one our friends have gone And left our bosoms bleeding Heaven gives our years of fading strength Indemnifying fleetness And those of youth a seeming length Proportion d to their sweetness T CAMPBELL two

He has his summer when luxuriously Spring s honey d cud of youthful thought he loves To ruminate and by such dreaming high Is nearest unto heaven quiet coves His soul has in its Autumn when his wings

up when I behold A rainbow in the sky So was it when my life began So is it now I am a man So be it when I shall grow old Or let me die The Child is father of the Man I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety W WORDSWORTH two hundred eighty seven ODE ON INTIMATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD There was a time when meadow grove and stream The earth and every common sight To me did seem Apparell d in celestial light The glory and the freshness of a dream It is not now as it hath been of yore Turn wheresoe er I may By night or day The things which I have seen I now can see no more The rainbow comes and goes And lovely is the rose The moon doth with delight Look round her when the heavens are bare Waters on a starry night Are beautiful and fair The sunshine is a glorious birth But yet I know where er I go That there hath pass d away a glory from the earth Now while the birds thus sing a joyous song And while the young lambs bound As to the tabor s sound To me alone there came a thought of grief A timely utterance gave that thought relief And I again am strong The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep No more shall grief of mine the season wrong I hear the echoes through the mountains throng The winds come to me from the fields of sleep And all the earth is gay Land and sea Give themselves up to jollity And with the heart of May Doth every beast keep holiday Thou child of joy Shout round me let me hear thy shouts thou happy Shepherd boy Ye blessed creatures I have heard the call Ye to each other make I see The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee My heart is at your festival My head hath its coronal The fulness of your bliss I feel I feel it all O evil day if I were sullen While Earth herself is adorning This sweet May morning And the children are pulling On every side In a thousand valleys far and wide Fresh flowers while the sun shines warm And the babe leaps up on his mother s arm I hear I hear with joy I hear But there s a tree of many one A single field which I have look d upon Both of them speak of something that is gone The pansy at my feet Doth the same tale repeat Whither is fled the visionary gleam Where is it now the glory and the dream Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting The Soul that rises with us our life s Star Hath had elsewhere its setting And cometh from afar Not in entire forgetfulness And not in utter nakedness But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God who is our home Heaven lies about us in our infancy Shades of the prison house begin to close Upon the growing boy But he beholds the light and whence it flows He sees it in his joy The youth who daily farther from the east Must travel still is Nature s priest And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended At length the man perceives it die away And fade into the light of common day Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind And even with something of a mother s mind And no unworthy aim The homely nurse doth all she can To make her foster child her inmate Man Forget the glories he hath known And that imperial palace whence he came Behold the Child among his new born blisses A six years darling of a pigmy size See where mid work of his own hand he lies Fretted by sallies of his mother s kisses With light upon him from his father s eyes See at his feet some little plan or chart Some fragment from his dream of human life Shaped by himself with newly learned art A wedding or a festival A mourning or a funeral And this hath now his heart And unto this he frames his song Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business love or strife But it will not be long Ere this be thrown aside And with new joy and pride The little actor cons another part Filling from time to time his humorous stage With all the Persons down to palsied Age That life brings with her in her equipage As if his whole vocation Were endless imitation Thou whose exterior semblance doth belie Thy soul s immensity Thou best philosopher who yet dost keep Thy heritage thou eye among the blind That deaf and silent read saint the eternal deep Haunted for ever by the eternal mind Mighty prophet Seer blest On whom those truths do rest Which we are toiling all our lives to find In darkness lost the darkness of the grave Thou over whom thy immortality Broods like the day a master o er a slave A presence which is not to be put by Thou little child yet glorious in the might Of heaven born freedom on thy being s height Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight And custom lie upon thee with a weight Heavy as frost and deep almost as life O joy that in our embers Is something that doth live That nature yet remembers What was so fugitive The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest Delight and liberty the simple creed Of childhood whether busy or at rest With new fledged hope still fluttering in his breast Not for these I raise The song of thanks and praise But for those obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things Fallings from us vanishings Blank misgivings of a creature Moving about in worlds not realised High instincts before which our mortal nature Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised But for those first affections Those shadowy recollections Which be they what they may Are yet the fountain light of all our day Are yet a master light of all our seeing Uphold us cherish and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal silence truths that wake To perish never Which neither listlessness nor mad endeavour Nor man nor boy Nor all that is at enmity with joy Can utterly abolish or destroy Hence in a season of calm weather Though inland far we be Our souls have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither Can in a moment travel thither And see the children sport upon the shore And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore Then sing ye birds sing sing a joyous song And let the young lambs bound As to the tabor s sound We in thought will join your throng Ye that pipe and ye that play Ye that through your hearts to day Feel the gladness of the May What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass of glory in the flower We will grieve not rather find Strength in what remains behind In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering In the faith that looks through death In years that bring the philosophic mind And O ye Fountains Meadows Hills and Groves Forebode not any severing of our loves Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might I only have relinquish d one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway I love the brooks which down their channels fret Even more than when I tripp d lightly as they The innocent brightness of a new born day Is lovely yet The clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o er man s mortality Another race hath been and other palms are won Thanks to the human heart by which we live Thanks to its tenderness its joys and fears To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears W WORDSWORTH two hundred eighty eight Music when soft voices die Vibrates in the memory Odours when sweet violets sicken Live within the sense they quicken Rose leaves when the rose is dead Are heap d for the beloved s bed And so thy thoughts when Thou art gone

of Memnon the East and wife of Tithonus the appearances of Earth and Sky during the last hours of Night She leaves him every morning in renewed youth to prepare the way for Phoebus the Sun whilst Tithonus remains in perpetual old age and grayness by Peneus streams Phoebus loved the Nymph Daphne whom he met by the river Peneus in the vale of Tempe This legend expressed the attachment of the Laurel Daphne to the Sun under whose heat the tree both fades and flourishes It has been thought worth while to explain these allusions because they illustrate the character of the Grecian Mythology which arose in the Personification of natural phenomena and was totally free from those debasing and ludicrous ideas with which through Roman and later misunderstanding or perversion it has been

regret the labour Poem thirty one upon misprision growing either granted in error or on the growth of contempt Poem thirty two With the tone of this Sonnet compare Hamlet s Give me that man That is

after death in a sacred chest This myth reproduced in Syria and Greece in the legends of Thammuz Adonis and perhaps Absyrtus represents the annual death of the Sun or the Year under the influences of the winter darkness Horus the son of Osiris as the New Year in his turn overcomes Typho It suited the genius of Milton s time to regard this primaeval poetry and philosophy of the seasons which has a further reference to the contest of Good and Evil in Creation as a malignant idolatry Shelley s Chorus in Hellas Worlds on worlds treats the subject in a larger and sweeter spirit unshower d grass as

the Parliament in stanzas twenty one twenty four This Ode beyond doubt one of the finest in our language and more in Milton s style than has been reached by any other poet is occasionally obscure from imitation of the condensed Latin syntax The meaning of saint five is rivalry or hostility are the same to a lofty spirit and limitation more hateful than opposition The allusion in saint eleven is to the old physical doctrines of the non existence of a vacuum and the impenetrability of matter in saint seventeen to the omen traditionally connected with the foundation of the Capitol at Rome The ancient belief that certain years in life complete natural periods and are hence peculiarly exposed to death is introduced in stanza twenty six by the word climacteric Poem sixty six Lycidas The person lamented is Milton s college friend Edward King drowned in sixteen thirty seven whilst crossing from Chester to Ireland Strict Pastoral Poetry was first written or perfected by the Dorian Greeks settled in Sicily but the conventional use of it exhibited more magnificently in Lycidas than in any other pastoral is apparently of Roman origin Milton employing the noble freedom of a great artist has here united ancient mythology with what may be called the modern mythology of Camus and Saint Peter to direct Christian images The metrical structure of this glorious poem is partly derived from Italian models Sisters of the sacred well the Muses said to frequent the fountain Helicon on Mount Parnassus Mona Anglesea called by the Welsh Inis Dowil or the Dark Island from its dense forests Deva the Dee a river which probably derived its magical character from Celtic traditions it was long the boundary of Briton and Saxon These places are introduced as being near the scene of the shipwreck Orpheus was torn to pieces by Thracian women Amaryllis and Neaera names used here for the love idols of poets as Damoetas previously for a shepherd the blind Fury Atropos fabled to cut the thread of life Arethuse and Mincius Sicilian and Italian waters here alluded to as synonymous with the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and Virgil oat pipe used here like Collins oaten stop No one hundred forty six for Song Hippotades Aeolus god of the Winds Panope a Nereid The names of local deities in the Hellenic mythology express generally some feature in the natural landscape which the Greeks studied and analysed with their usual unequalled insight and feeling Panope represents the boundlessness of the ocean horizon when seen from a height as compared with a limited horizon of the land in hilly countries such as Greece or Asia Minor Camus the Cam put for King s University The sanguine flower the Hyacinth of the ancients probably our Iris The pilot Saint Peter figuratively

Aldersgate Street Emathian Conqueror When Thebes was destroyed B C three hundred thirty five and the citizens massacred by thousands Alexander ordered the house of Pindar to be spared He was as incapable of appreciating the Poet as Lewis XIV of appreciating Racine but even the narrow and barbarian mind of Alexander could understand the advantage of a showy act of homage to Poetry the repeated air \Of sad Electra s poet Amongst Plutarch s vague stories he says that when the Spartan confederacy in four hundred four B C took Athens a proposal to demolish it was rejected through the effect produced on the commanders by hearing part of a chorus from the Electra of Euripides sung at a feast There is however no apparent congruity between the lines quoted one hundred sixty seven

two preceding poems appear due to the Seventeenth Century and have therefore been placed in Book II Poem one hundred eleven The remark quoted in the note to No forty seven applies equally to these truly wonderful verses which like Lycidas may be regarded as a test of any reader s insight into the most poetical aspects of Poetry The general differences between them are vast but in imaginative intensity Marvell and Shelley are closely related This poem is printed as a translation in Marvell s works but the original Latin is obviously his own The most striking verses in it here quoted as the

hortorum per opaca silentia longe Celarunt plantae virides et concolor umbra Poems one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen L Allegro and Il Penseroso It is a striking proof of Milton s astonishing power that these the earliest pure Descriptive Lyrics in our language should still remain the best in a style which so many great poets have since attempted The Bright and the Thoughtful aspects of Nature are their subjects but each is preceded by a mythological introduction in a mixed Classical and Italian manner The meaning of the first is that Gaiety is the child of Nature of the second that Pensiveness is the daughter of Sorrow and Genius one hundred twelve Perverse ingenuity has conjectured that for Cerberus we should read Erebus who in the Mythology is brother at once and husband of Night But the issue of this union is not Sadness but Day and Aether completing the circle of primary creation as the parents are both children of Chaos the first begotten of all things Hesiod the

authoritative text of this poem in his judgment superior to any other of its class in melody and pathos Part is probably not later than the seventeenth century in other stanzas a more modern hand much resembling Scott s is traceable Logan s poem one hundred twenty seven exhibits a knowledge rather of the old legend than of the old verses Hecht promised the obsolete hight mavis thrush ilka every lav

style Catullus himself could hardly have bettered it In grace tenderness simplicity and humour it is worthy of the Ancients and even more so from the completeness and unity of the picture presented Poem one hundred thirty six Perhaps no writer who has given such strong proofs of the poetic nature has left less satisfactory poetry than Thomson Yet he touched little which he did not beautify and this song with Rule Britannia and a few others must make us regret that he did not more seriously apply himself to lyrical writing Poem one hundred forty Aeolian lyre the Greeks ascribed the origin of their Lyrical Poetry to the colonies of Aeolis in Asia Minor Thracia s hills supposed a favourite resort of Mars Feather d king the Eagle of Jupiter admirably described by Pindar in a passage here imitated by Gray Idalia in Cyprus where Cytherea Venus was especially worshipped Hyperion the Sun saint six eight allude to the Poets of the Islands and Mainland of Greece to those of Rome and of

eight Henry VI founded Eton Poem one hundred sixty one The Editor knows no Sonnet more remarkable than this which with one hundred sixty two records Cowper s gratitude to the Lady whose affectionate care for many years gave what sweetness he could enjoy to a life radically wretched Petrarch s sonnets have a more ethereal grace and a more perfect finish Shakespeare s more passion Milton s stand supreme in stateliness Wordsworth s in depth and delicacy But Cowper s unites with an exquisiteness in the turn of thought which the ancients would have called Irony an intensity of pathetic tenderness peculiar to his loving and ingenuous nature There is much mannerism much that is unimportant or of now exhausted interest in his poems but where he is great it is with that elementary greatness which rests on the most universal human feelings Cowper is our highest master in simple pathos Poem one hundred sixty three fancied green cherished garden Poem one hundred sixty four Nothing except his surname appears recoverable with regard to the author of this truly noble poem It should be noted as exhibiting a rare excellence the climax of simple sublimity It is a lesson of high instructiveness to examine the essential qualities which give first rate poetical rank to lyrics such as To morrow or Sally in our Alley when compared with poems written if the phrase may be allowed in keys so different as the subtle sweetness of Shelley the grandeur of Gray and Milton or the delightful Pastoralism of the Elizabethan verse Intelligent readers will gain hence a clear understanding of the vast imaginative range of Poetry through what wide oscillations the mind and the taste of a nation may pass how many are the roads which Truth and Nature open to Excellence Poem one hundred sixty six stout Cortez History requires here Balboa A T It may be noticed that to find in Chapman s Homer the pure serene of the original the reader must bring with him the imagination of the youthful poet he must be a Greek himself as Shelley finely said of Keats Poem one hundred sixty nine The most tender and true of Byron s smaller poems Poem one hundred seventy This poem with two hundred thirty six exemplifies the peculiar skill with which Scott employs proper names nor is there a surer sign of high poetical genius Poem one hundred ninety one The Editor in this and in other instances has risked the addition or the change of a Title that the aim of the verses following may be grasped more clearly and immediately Poem one hundred ninety eight Nature s Eremite refers to the fable of the Wandering Jew This beautiful sonnet was the last word of a poet deserving the title marvellous boy in a much higher sense than Chatterton If the fulfilment may ever safely be prophesied from the promise England appears to have lost in Keats one whose gifts in Poetry have rarely been surpassed Shakespeare Milton and Wordsworth had their lives been closed at twenty five would so far as we know have left poems of less excellence and hope than the youth who from the petty school and the London surgery passed at once to a place with them of high collateral glory Poem two hundred one It is impossible not to regret that Moore has written so little in this sweet and genuinely national style Poem two hundred two A masterly example of Byron s command of strong thought and close reasoning in verse as the next is equally characteristic of Shelley s wayward intensity and two hundred four of the dramatic power the vital identification of the poet with other times and characters in which Scott is second only to Shakespeare Poem two hundred nine Bonnivard a Genevese was imprisoned by the Duke of Savoy in Chillon on the lake of Geneva for his courageous defence of his country against the tyranny with which Piedmont threatened it during the first half of the seventeenth century This noble Sonnet is worthy to stand near Milton s on the Vaudois massacre Poem two hundred ten Switzerland was usurped by the French under Napoleon in eighteen hundred Venice in seventeen ninety seven two hundred eleven Poem two hundred fifteen This battle was fought Dec two eighteen hundred between the Austrians under Archduke John and the French under Moreau in a forest near Munich Hohen Linden means High Limetrees Poem two hundred eighteen After the capture of Madrid by Napoleon Sir J Moore retreated before Soult and Ney to Corunna and was killed whilst covering the embarcation of his troops His tomb built by Ney bears this inscription John Moore leader of the English armies slain in battle eighteen oh nine Poem two hundred twenty nine The Mermaid was the club house of Shakespeare Ben Jonson and other choice spirits of that age Poem two hundred thirty Maisie Mary Scott has given us nothing more complete and lovely than this little song which unites simplicity and dramatic power to a wild wood music of the rarest quality No moral is drawn far less any conscious analysis of feeling attempted the pathetic meaning is left to be suggested by the mere presentiment of the situation Inexperienced critics have often named this which may be called the Homeric manner superficial from its apparent simple facility but first rate excellence in it as shown here in one hundred ninety six one hundred fifty six and one hundred twenty nine is in truth one of the least common triumphs of Poetry This style should be compared with what is not less perfect in its way the searching out of inner feeling the expression of hidden meanings the revelation of the heart of Nature and of the Soul within the Soul the analytical method in short most completely represented by Wordsworth and by Shelley Poem two hundred thirty four correi covert on a hillside Cumber trouble Poem two hundred thirty five Two intermediate stanzas have been here omitted They are very ingenious but of all poetical qualities ingenuity is least in accordance with pathos Poem two hundred forty three This poem has an exaltation and a glory joined with an exquisiteness of expression which place it in the highest rank amongst the many masterpieces of its illustrious Author Poem two hundred fifty two interlunar swoon interval of the Moon s invisibility Poem two hundred fifty six Calpe Gibraltar Lofoden the Maelstrom whirlpool off the N W coast of Norway Poem two hundred fifty seven This lovely poem refers here and there to a ballad by Hamilton on the subject better treated in one hundred twenty seven and one hundred twenty eight Poem two hundred sixty eight Arcturi seemingly used for northern stars And wild roses et cetera Our language has no line modulated with more subtle sweetness A good poet might have written And roses wild yet this slight change would disenchant the verse of its peculiar beauty Poem two hundred seventy Ceres daughter Proserpine God of Torment Pluto Poem two hundred seventy one This impassioned address expresses Shelley s most rapt imaginations and is the direct modern representative of the feeling which led the Greeks to the worship of Nature Poem two hundred seventy four The leading idea of this beautiful description of a day s landscape in Italy is expressed with an obscurity not unfrequent with its author It appears to be On the voyage of life are many moments of pleasure given by the sight of Nature who has power to heal even the worldliness and the uncharity of man Amphitrite was daughter to Ocean Sun girt City It is difficult not to believe that the correct reading is Seagirt Many of Shelley s poems appear to have been printed in England during his residence abroad others were printed from his manuscripts after his death Hence probably the text of no English Poet after sixteen sixty contains so many errors See the Note on No nine Poem two hundred seventy five Maenad a frenzied Nymph attendant on Dionysus in the Greek mythology The sea blooms et cetera Plants under water sympathise with the seasons of the laud and hence with the winds which affect them Poem two hundred seventy six Written soon after the death by shipwreck of Wordsworth s brother John This Poem should be compared with Shelley s following it Each is the most complete expression of the innermost spirit of his art given by these great Poets of that Idea which as in the case of the true Painter to quote the words of Reynolds subsists only in the mind The sight never beheld it nor has the hand expressed it it is an idea residing in the breast of the artist which he is always labouring to impart and which he dies at last without imparting Poem two hundred seventy eight Proteus represented the everlasting changes united with ever recurrent sameness of the Sea Poem two hundred seventy nine the Royal Saint Henry VI INDEX OF WRITERS WITH DATES
