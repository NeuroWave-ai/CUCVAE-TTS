for his country the honour and glory of its discovery But he had done all that lay in human power now and after having struggled for nine months against currents and tempests shattering icebergs and breaking through almost insurmountable barriers amid the cold of an unprecedented winter after having outdistanced all his predecessors and accomplished half his task he suddenly saw all his hopes blasted The treachery or rather the despondency of his worn out crew and the criminal folly of one or two leading spirits among them had left him and his little band of men in a terrible situation helpless in an icy desert two thousand five hundred miles away from their native land and without even a ship to shelter them However the courage of Hatteras was still undaunted The three men which were left him were the Illustration best on board his brig and while they remained he might venture to hope After the cheerful manly words of the captain the Doctor felt the best thing to be done was to look their prospects fairly in the face and know the exact state of things Accordingly leaving his companions he stole away alone down to the scene of the explosion Of the Forward the brig that had been so carefully built and had become so dear not a vestige remained Shapeless blackened fragments twisted bars of iron Illustration cable ends still smouldering and here and there in the distance spiral wreaths of smoke met his eye on all sides His cabin and all his precious treasures were gone his books and instruments and collections reduced to ashes As he stood thinking mournfully of his irreparable loss he was joined by Johnson who grasped his offered hand in speechless sorrow What s to become of us asked the Doctor Who can tell was the old sailor s reply Anyhow said Clawbonny do not let us despair Let us be men Yes mister Clawbonny you are right Now is the time to show our mettle We are in a bad plight and how to get out of it that is the question Poor old brig exclaimed the Doctor I had grown so attached to her I loved her as one loves a house where he has spent a life time Ay it s strange what a hold those planks and beams get on a fellow s heart And the long boat is that burnt asked the Doctor No mister Clawbonny Shandon and his gang have carried it off And the pirogue Shivered into a thousand pieces Stop Do you see those bits of sheet iron That is all that remains of it Then we have nothing but the Halkett boat Yes we have that still thanks to your idea of taking it with you That isn t much said the Doctor Oh those base traitors exclaimed Johnson Heaven punish them as they deserve Johnson returned the Doctor gently we must not forget how sorely they have been tried Only the best remain good in the evil day few can stand trouble Let us pity our fellow sufferers and not curse them For the next few minutes both were silent and then Johnson asked what had become of the sledge We left it about a mile off was the reply In charge of Simpson No Simpson is dead poor fellow Simpson dead Yes his strength gave way entirely and he first sank Poor Simpson And yet who knows if he isn t rather to be envied But for the dead man we have left behind we have brought back a dying one A dying man Yes Captain Altamont And in a few words he informed Johnson of their discovery An American said Johnson as the recital was ended Yes everything goes to prove that But I wonder what the Porpoise was and what brought her in these seas She rushed on to her ruin like the rest of foolhardy adventurers but tell me did you find the coal The Doctor shook his head sadly No coal not a vestige No we did not even get as far as the place mentioned by Sir Edward Belcher Then we have no fuel whatever said the old sailor No And no provisions No And no ship to make our way back to England It required courage indeed to face these gloomy realities but after a moment s silence Johnson said again Well at any rate we know exactly how we stand The first thing to be done now is to make a hut for we can t stay long exposed to this temperature Yes we ll soon manage that with Bell s help replied the Doctor Then we must go and find the sledge and bring back the American and have a consultation with Hatteras Poor captain said Johnson always forgetting his own troubles how he must feel it Clawbonny and Bell found Hatteras standing motionless his arms folded in his usual fashion He seemed gazing into space but his face had recovered its calm self possessed expression His faithful dog stood beside him like his master apparently insensible to the biting cold though the temperature was thirty two degrees below zero Bell lay on the ice in an almost inanimate condition Johnson had to take vigorous measures to rouse him but at last by dint of shaking and rubbing him with snow he succeeded Come Bell he cried don t give way like this Exert yourself my man we must have a talk about our situation and we need a place to put our heads in Come and help me Bell You haven t forgotten how to make a snow hut have you There is an iceberg all ready to hand we ve only got to hollow it out Let s set to work we shall find that is the best remedy for us Bell tried to shake off his torpor and help his comrade while mister Clawbonny undertook to go and fetch the sledge and the dogs Will you go with him captain asked Johnson No my friend said Hatteras in a gentle tone if the Doctor will kindly undertake the task Before the day ends I must come to some resolution and I need to be alone to think Go Do meantime whatever you think best I will deal with the future Illustration Johnson went back to the Doctor and said It s very strange but the captain seems quite to have got over his anger I never heard him speak so gently before So much the better said Clawbonny Believe me Johnson that man can save us yet And drawing his hood as closely round his head as possible the Doctor seized his iron tipped staff and set out without further delay Johnson and Bell commenced operations immediately They had simply to dig a hole in the heart of a great block of ice but it was not easy work owing to the extreme hardness of the material However this very hardness guaranteed the solidity of the dwelling and the further their labours advanced the more they became sheltered Hatteras alternately paced up and down and stood motionless evidently shrinking from any approach to the scene of explosion In about an hour the Doctor returned bringing with him Altamont lying on the sledge wrapped up in the folds of the tent The poor dogs were so exhausted from starvation that they could scarcely draw it along and they had begun to gnaw their harness It was indeed high time for feasts and men to take food and rest While the hut was being still further dug out the Doctor went foraging about and had the good fortune to find a little stove almost undamaged by the explosion He soon restored it to working trim and by the time the hut was completed had filled it with wood and got it lighted Before long it was roaring and diffusing a genial warmth on all sides The American was brought in and laid on blankets and the four Englishmen seated themselves round the fire to enjoy their scanty meal of biscuit and hot tea the last remains of the provisions on the sledge Not a word was spoken by Hatteras and the others respected his silence When the meal was over the Doctor rose and went out making a sign to Johnson to follow Come Johnson he said we will take an inventory of all we have left We must know exactly how we are off and our treasures are scattered in all directions so we had better begin and pick them up as fast as possible for the snow may fall at any moment and then it would be quite useless to look for anything Don t let us lose a minute then replied Johnson Fire and food those are our chief wants Very well you take one side and I ll take the other and we ll search from the centre to the circumference This task occupied two hours and all they discovered was a little salt meat about fifty lbs of pemmican three sacks of biscuits a small stock of chocolate five or six pints of brandy and about two lbs of coffee picked up bean by bean off the ice Neither blankets nor hammocks nor clothing all had been consumed in the devouring flame This slender store of provisions would hardly last three weeks and they had wood enough to supply the stove for about the same time Illustration The tired out dogs were harnessed sorely against their will and before long returned bringing the few but precious treasures found among the debris of the brig P nine Now that the inventory was made the next business was to fetch the sledge The tired out dogs were harnessed sorely against their will and before long returned bringing the few but precious treasures found among the debris of the brig These were safely deposited in the hut and then Johnson and Clawbonny half frozen with their work resumed their places beside their companions in misfortune CHAPTER II FIRST WORDS OF ALTAMONT About eight o clock in the evening the grey snow clouds cleared away for a little and the stars shone out brilliantly in the sky Hatteras seized the opportunity and went out silently to take the altitude of some of the principal constellations He wished to ascertain if the ice field was still drifting In half an hour he returned and sat down in a corner of the hut where he remained without stirring all night motionless as if asleep but in reality buried in deepest thought The next day the snow fell heavily and the Doctor congratulated himself on his wise forethought when he saw the white sheet lying three feet thick over the scene of the explosion completely obliterating all traces of the Forward It was impossible to venture outside in such weather but the stove drew capitally and made the hut quite comfortable or at any rate it seemed so to the weary worn out adventurers The American was in less pain and was evidently gradually coming back to life He opened his eyes but could not yet speak for his lips were so affected by the scurvy that articulation was impossible but he could hear and understand all that was said to him On learning what had passed and the circumstances of his discovery he expressed his thanks by gestures and the Doctor was too wise to let him know how brief his respite from death would prove In three weeks at most every vestige of food would be gone About noon Hatteras roused himself and going up to his friends said We must make up our minds what to do but I must request Johnson to tell me first all the particulars of the mutiny on the brig and how this final act of baseness came about What good will that do said the Doctor The fact is certain and it is no use thinking over it I differ from your opinion rejoined Hatteras Let me hear the whole affair from Johnson and then I will banish it from my thoughts Well said the boatswain this was how it happened I did all in my power to prevent but I am sure of that Johnson and what s more I have no doubt the ringleaders had been hatching their plans for some time That s my belief too said the Doctor Illustration Johnson s Story P eleven And so it is mine resumed Johnson for almost immediately after your departure Shandon supported by the others took the command of the ship I could not resist him and from that moment everybody did pretty much as they pleased Shandon made no attempt to restrain them it was his policy to make them believe that their privations and toils were at an end Economy was entirely disregarded A blazing fire was kept up in the stove and the men were allowed to eat and drink at discretion not only tea and coffee was at their disposal but all the spirits on board and on men who had been so long deprived of ardent liquors you may guess the result They went on in this manner from the seventh to the fifteenth of January And this was Shandon s doing asked Hatteras Yes captain Never mention his name to me again Go on Johnson It was about the twenty fourth or twenty fifth of January that they resolved to abandon the ship Their plan was to reach the west coast of Baffin s Bay and from thence to embark in the boat and follow the track of the whalers or to get to some of the Greenland settlements on the eastern side Provisions were abundant and the sick men were so excited by the hope of return that they were almost well They began their preparations for departure by making a sledge which they were to draw themselves as they had no dogs This was not ready till the fifteenth of February and I was always hoping for your arrival though I half dreaded it too for you could have done nothing with the men and they would have massacred you rather than remain on board I tried my influence on each one separately remonstrating and reasoning with them and pointing out the dangers they would encounter and also the cowardice of leaving you but it was a mere waste of words not even the best among them would listen to me Shandon was impatient to be off and fixed the twenty second of February for starting The sledge and the boat were packed as closely as possible with provisions and spirits and heaps of wood to obtain which they had hewed the brig down to her water line The last day the men ran riot They completely sacked the ship and in a drunken paroxysm Pen and two or three others set it on fire I fought and struggled against them but they threw me down and assailed me with blows and then the wretches headed by Shandon went off towards the east and were soon out of sight I found myself alone on the burning ship and what could I do The fire hole was completely blocked up with ice I had not a single drop of water For two days the Forward struggled with the flames and you know the rest A long silence followed the gloomy recital broken at length by Hatteras who said Johnson I thank you you did all you could to save my ship but single handed you could not resist Again I thank you and now let the subject be dropped Let us unite efforts for our common salvation There are four of us four companions four friends and all our lives are equally precious Let each give his opinion on the best course for us to pursue You ask us then Hatteras said the Doctor we are all devoted to you and our words come from our hearts But will you not state you own views first That would be little use said Hatteras sadly my opinion might appear interested let me hear all yours first Captain said Johnson before pronouncing on such an important matter I wish to ask you a question Ask it then Johnson You went out yesterday to ascertain our exact position well is the field drifting or stationary Perfectly stationary It had not moved since the last reckoning was made I find we are just where we were before we left in eighty deg fifteen lat and ninety seven deg thirty five long And what distance are we from the nearest sea to the west About six hundred miles And that sea is Smith s Sound was the reply The same that we could not get through last April The same Well captain now we know our actual situation we are in a better position to determine our course of action Speak your minds then said Hatteras again burying his head in his hands What do you say Bell asked the Doctor It strikes me the case doesn t need long thinking over said the carpenter We must get back at once without losing a single day or even a single hour either to the south or west and make our way to the nearest coast even if we are two months doing it We have only food for three weeks replied Hatteras without raising his head Very well said Johnson we must make the journey in three weeks since it is our last chance Even if we can only crawl on our knees before we get to our destination we must be there in twenty five days This part of the Arctic Continent is unexplored We may have to encounter difficulties Mountains and glaciers may bar our progress objected Hatteras I don t see that s any sufficient reason for not attempting it We shall have to endure sufferings no doubt and perhaps many We shall have to limit ourselves to the barest quantities of food unless our guns should procure us anything There is only about half a pound of powder left said Hatteras Come now Hatteras I know the full weight of your objections and I am not deluding myself with vain hopes But I think I can read your motive Have you any practical suggestion to offer No said Hatteras after a little hesitation You don t doubt our courage continued the Doctor We would follow you to the last you know that But must we not meantime give up all hope of reaching the Pole Your plans have been defeated by treachery Natural difficulties you might have overcome but you have been outmatched by perfidy and human weakness You have done all that man could do and you would have succeeded I am certain but situated as we are now are you not obliged to relinquish your projects for the present and is not a return to England even positively necessary before you could continue them Well captain asked Johnson after waiting a considerable time for Hatteras to reply Thus interrogated he raised his head and said in a constrained tone You think yourselves quite certain then of reaching the Sound exhausted though you are and almost without food No replied the Doctor but there is one thing certain the Sound won t come to us we must go to it We may chance to find some Esquimaux tribes further south Besides isn t there the chance of falling in with some ship that is wintering here asked Johnson Even supposing the Sound is blocked up couldn t we get across to some Greenland or Danish settlement At any rate Hatteras we can get nothing by remaining here The route to England is towards the south not the north Yes said Bell mister Clawbonny is right We must start and start at once We have been forgetting our country too long already Is this your advice Johnson asked Hatteras again Yes captain And yours Doctor Yes Hatteras Hatteras remained silent but his face in spite of himself betrayed his inward agitation The issue of his whole life hung on the decision he had to make for he felt that to return to England was to lose all He could not venture on a fourth expedition The Doctor finding he did not reply added I ought also to have said that there is not a moment to lose The sledge must be loaded with the provisions at once and as much wood as possible I must confess six hundred miles is a long journey but we can or rather we must make twenty miles a day which will bring us to the coast about the twenty sixth of March But cannot we wait a few days yet said Hatteras What are you hoping for asked Johnson I don t know Who can tell the future It is necessary too that you should get your strength a little recruited You might sink down on the road with fatigue without even a snow hut to shelter you But think of the terrible death that awaits us here replied the carpenter My friends said Hatteras in almost supplicating tones you are despairing too soon I should propose that we should seek our deliverance towards the north but you would refuse to follow me and yet why should there not be Esquimaux tribes round about the Pole as well as towards the south The open sea of the existence of which we are certified must wash the shores of continents Nature is logical in all her doings Consequently vegetation must be found there when the earth is no longer ice bound Is there not a promised land awaiting us in the north from which you would flee Hatteras became animated as he spoke and Doctor Clawbonny s excitable nature was so wrought upon that his decision began to waver He was on the point of yielding when Johnson with his wiser head and calmer temperament recalled him to reason and duty by calling out Come Bell let us be off to the sledge All right said Bell and the two had risen to leave the hut when Hatteras exclaimed Oh Johnson You you Well go I shall stay I shall stay Captain said Johnson stopping in spite of himself I shall stay I tell you Go Leave me like the rest Come Duk you and I will stay together The faithful dog barked as if he understood and settled himself down beside his master Johnson looked at the Doctor who seemed at a loss to know what to do but came to the conclusion at last that the best way meantime was to calm Hatteras even at the sacrifice of a day He was just about to try the force of his eloquence in this direction when he felt a light touch on his arm and turning round saw Altamont who had crawled out of bed and managed to get on his knees He was trying to speak but his swollen lips could scarcely make a sound Hatteras went towards him and watched his efforts to articulate so attentively that in a few minutes he made out a word that sounded like Porpoise and stooping over him he asked Is it the Porpoise Altamont made a sign in the affirmative and Hatteras went on with his queries now that he had found a clue In these seas The affirmative gesture was repeated Is she in the north Yes Do you know her position Yes Exactly Yes For a minute or so nothing more was said and the onlookers waited with palpitating hearts Then Hatteras spoke again and said Listen to me We must know the exact position of your vessel I will count the degrees aloud and you will stop me when I come to the right one The American assented by a motion of the head and Hatteras began We ll take the longitude first one hundred five deg No one hundred six deg one hundred seven deg It is to the west I suppose Yes replied Altamont Let us go on then one hundred nine deg one hundred ten deg one hundred twelve deg one hundred fourteen deg one hundred sixteen deg one hundred eighteen deg one hundred twenty deg Yes interrupted the sick man Illustration one hundred twenty deg of longitude and how many minutes I will count Hatteras began at number one and when he got to fifteen Altamont made a sign to stop Very good said Hatteras now for the latitude Are you listening eighty deg eighty one deg eighty two deg eighty three deg Again the sign to stop was made Now for the minutes five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty thirty five Altamont stopped him once more and smiled feebly You say then that the Porpoise is in longitude one hundred twenty deg fifteen and latitude eighty three deg thirty five Yes sighed the American and fell back motionless in the Doctor s arms completely overpowered by the effort he had made Friends exclaimed Hatteras you see I was right Our salvation lies indeed in the north always in the north We shall be saved But the joyous exulting words had hardly escaped his lips before a sudden thought made his countenance change The serpent of jealousy had stung him for this stranger was an American and he had reached three degrees nearer the Pole than the ill fated Forward CHAPTER III A SEVENTEEN DAYS MARCH These first words of Altamont had completely changed the whole aspect of affairs but his communication was still incomplete and after giving him a little time to rest the Doctor undertook the task of conversing again with him putting his questions in such a form that a movement of the head or eyes would be a sufficient answer He soon ascertained that the Porpoise was a three mast American ship from New York wrecked on the ice with provisions and combustibles in abundance still on board and that though she had been thrown on her side she had not gone to pieces and there was every chance of saving her cargo Altamont and his crew had left her two months previously taking the long boat with them on a sledge They intended to get to Smith s Sound and reach some whaler that would take them back to America but one after another succumbed to fatigue and illness till at last Altamont and two men were all that remained out of thirty and truly he had survived by a providential miracle while his two companions already lay beside him in the sleep of death Hatteras wished to know why the Porpoise had come so far north and learned in reply that she had been irresistibly driven there by the ice But his anxious fears were not satisfied with this explanation and he asked further what was the purpose of his voyage Altamont said he wanted to make the north west passage and this appeared to content the jealous Englishman for he made no more reference to the subject Well said the Doctor it strikes me that instead of trying to get to Baffin s Bay our best plan would be to go in search of the Porpoise for here lies a ship a full third of the distance nearer and more than that stocked with everything necessary for winter quarters I see no other course open to us replied Bell And the sooner we go the better added Johnson for the time we allow ourselves must depend on our provisions You are right Johnson returned the Doctor If we start to morrow we must reach the Porpoise by the fifteenth of March unless we mean to die of starvation What do you say Hatteras Let us make preparations immediately but perhaps the route may be longer than we suppose How can that be captain The man seems quite sure of the position of his ship said the Doctor But suppose the ice field should have drifted like ours Here Altamont who was listening attentively made a sign that he wished to speak and after much difficulty he succeeded in telling the Doctor that the Porpoise had struck on rocks near the coast and that it was impossible for her to move This was re assuring information though it cut off all hope of returning to Europe unless Bell could construct a smaller ship out of the wreck Illustration No time was lost in getting ready to start The sledge was the principal thing as it needed thorough repair There was plenty of wood and profiting by the experience they had recently had of this mode of transit several improvements were made by Bell Inside a sort of couch was laid for the American and covered over with the tent The small stock of provisions did not add much to the weight but to make up the deficiency as much wood was piled up on it as it could hold The Doctor did the packing and made an exact calculation of how long their stores would last He found that by allowing three quarter rations to each man and full rations to the dogs they might hold out for three weeks Towards seven in the evening they felt so worn out that they were obliged to give up work for the night but before lying down to sleep they heaped up the wood in the stove and made a roaring fire determined to allow themselves this parting luxury As they gathered round it basking in the unaccustomed heat and enjoying their hot coffee and biscuits and pemmican they became quite cheerful and forgot all their sufferings About seven in the morning they set to work again and by three in the afternoon everything was ready It was almost dark for though the sun had reappeared above the horizon since the thirty first of January his light was feeble and of short duration Happily the moon would rise about half past six and her soft beams would give sufficient light to show the road The parting moment came Altamont was overjoyed at the idea of starting though the jolting would necessarily increase his sufferings for the Doctor would find on board the medicines he required for his cure They lifted him on to the sledge and laid him as comfortably as possible and then harnessed the dogs including Duk One final look towards the icy bed where the Forward had been and the little party set out for the Porpoise Bell was scout as before the Doctor and Johnson took each a side of the sledge and lent a helping hand when necessary while Hatteras walked behind to keep all in the right track They got on pretty quickly for the weather was good and the ice smooth and hard allowing the sledge to glide easily along yet the temperature was so low that men and dogs were soon panting and had often to stop and take breath About seven the moon shone out and irradiated the whole horizon Far as the eye could see there was nothing visible but a wide stretching level plain of ice without a solitary hummock or patch to relieve the uniformity Illustration As the Doctor remarked to his companion it looked like some vast monotonous desert Ay mister Clawbonny it is a desert but we shan t die of thirst in it at any rate That s a comfort certainly but I ll tell you one thing it proves Johnson we must be a great distance from any coast The nearer the coast the more numerous the icebergs in general and you see there is not one in sight The horizon is rather misty though So it is but ever since we started we have been on this same interminable ice field Do you know mister Clawbonny that smooth as this ice is we are going over most dangerous ground Fathomless abysses lie beneath our feet That s true enough but they won t engulph us This white sheet over them is pretty tough I can tell you It is always getting thicker too for in these latitudes it snows nine days out of ten even in April and May ay and in June as well The ice here in some parts cannot be less than between thirty and forty feet thick That sounds reassuring at all events said Johnson Yes we re not like the skaters on the Serpentine always in danger of falling through This ice is strong enough to bear the weight of the Custom House in Liverpool or the Houses of Parliament in Westminster Can they reckon pretty nearly what ice will bear mister Clawbonny asked the old sailor always eager for information What can t be reckoned now a days Yes ice two inches thick will bear a man three and a half inches a man on horse back five inches an eight pounder eight inches field artillery and ten inches a whole army It is difficult to conceive of such a power of resistance but you were speaking of the incessant snow just now and I cannot help wondering where it comes from for the water all round is frozen and what makes the clouds That s a natural enough question but my notion is that nearly all the snow or rain that we get here comes from the temperate zones I fancy each of those snowflakes was originally a drop of water in some river caught up by evaporation into the air and wafted over here in the shape of clouds so that it is not impossible that when we quench our thirst with the melted snow we are actually drinking from the very rivers of our own native land Just at this moment the conversation was interrupted by Hatteras who called out that they were getting out of the straight line The increasing mist made it difficult to keep together and at last about eight o clock they determined to come to a halt as they had gone fifteen miles The tent was put up and the stove lighted and after their usual supper they lay down and slept comfortably till morning The calm atmosphere was highly favourable for though the cold became intense and the mercury was always frozen in the thermometer they found no difficulty in continuing their route confirming the truth of Parry s assertion that any man suitably clad may walk abroad with impunity in the lowest temperature provided there is no wind while on the other hand the least breeze would make the skin smart acutely and bring on violent headache which would soon end in death On the fifth of March a peculiar phenomenon occurred The sky was perfectly clear and glittering with stars when suddenly snow began to fall thick and fast though there was not a cloud in the heavens and through the white flakes the constellations could be seen shining This curious display lasted two hours and ceased before the Doctor could arrive at any satisfactory conclusion as to its cause The moon had ended her last quarter and complete darkness prevailed now for seventeen hours out of the twenty four The travellers had to fasten themselves together with a long rope to avoid getting separated and it was all but impossible to pursue the right course Moreover the brave fellows in spite of their iron will began to show signs of fatigue Halts became more frequent and yet every hour was precious for the provisions were rapidly coming to an end Hatteras hardly knew what to think as day after day went on without apparent result and he asked himself sometimes whether the Porpoise had any actual existence except in Altamont s fevered brain and more than once the idea even came into his head that perhaps national hatred might have induced the American to drag them along with himself to certain death He told the Doctor his suppositions who rejected them absolutely and laid them down to the score of the unhappy rivalry that had arisen already between the two captains Illustration On the fourteenth of March after sixteen days march the little party found themselves only yet in the eighty two deg latitude Their strength was exhausted and they had a hundred miles more to go To increase their sufferings rations had to be still further reduced Each man must be content with a fourth part to allow the dogs their full quantity Unfortunately they could not rely at all on their guns for only seven charges of powder were left and six balls They had fired at several hares and foxes on the road already but unsuccessfully However on the fifteenth the Doctor was fortunate enough to surprise a seal basking on the ice and after several shots the animal was captured and killed Johnson soon had it skinned and cut in pieces but it was so lean that it was worthless as food unless its captors would drink the oil like the Esquimaux The Doctor was bold enough to make the attempt but failed in spite of himself Next day several icebergs and hummocks were noticed on the horizon Was this a sign that land was near or was it some ice field that had broken up It was difficult to know what to surmise On arriving at the first of these hummocks the travellers set to work to make a cave in it where they could rest more comfortably than in the tent and after three hours persevering toil were able to light their stove and lie down beside it to stretch their weary limbs CHAPTER IV THE LAST CHARGE OF POWDER Johnson was obliged to take the dogs inside the hut for they would have been soon frozen outside in such dry weather Had it been snowing they would have been safe enough for the snow served as a covering and kept in the natural heat of the animals The old sailor who made a first rate dog driver tried his beasts with the oily flesh of the seal and found to his joyful surprise that they ate it greedily The Doctor said he was not astonished at this as in North America the horses were chiefly fed on fish and he thought that what would satisfy an herbivorous horse might surely content an omnivorous dog The whole party were soon buried in deep sleep for they were fairly overcome with fatigue Johnson awoke his companions early next morning and the march was resumed in haste Their lives depended now on their speed for provisions would only hold out three days longer The sky was magnificent the atmosphere extremely clear and the temperature very low The sun rose in the form of a long ellipse owing to refraction which made his horizontal diameter appear twice the length of his vertical Illustration The Doctor gun in hand wandered away from the others braving the solitude and the cold in the hope of discovering game He had only sufficient powder left to load three times and he had just three balls That was little enough should he encounter a bear for it often takes ten or twelve shots to have any effect on these enormous animals But the brave Doctor would have been satisfied with humbler game A few hares or foxes would be a welcome addition to their scanty food but all that day if even he chanced to see one either he was too far away or he was deceived by refraction and took a wrong aim He came back to his companions at night with crestfallen looks having wasted one ball and one charge of powder Next day the route appeared more difficult and the weary men could hardly drag themselves along The dogs had devoured even the entrails of the seal and began to gnaw their traces A few foxes passed in the distance and the Doctor lost another ball in attempting to shoot them They were forced to come to a halt early in the evening though the road was illumined by a splendid Aurora Borealis for they could not put one foot before the other Their last meal on the Sunday evening was a very sad one if no providential help came their doom was sealed Johnson set a few traps before going to sleep though he had no baits to put inside them He was very disappointed to find them all empty in the morning and was returning gloomily to the hut when he perceived a bear of huge dimensions The old sailor took it into his head that Heaven had sent this beast specially for him to kill and without waking his comrades he seized the Doctor s gun and was soon in pursuit of his prey On reaching the right distance he took aim but just as his finger touched the trigger he felt his arm tremble His thick gloves hampered him and flinging them hastily off he took up the gun with a firmer grasp But what a cry of agony escaped him The skin of his fingers stuck to the gun as if it had been red hot and he was forced to let it drop The sudden fall made it go off and the last ball was discharged in the air The Doctor ran out at the noise of the report and understood all at a glance He saw the animal walking quietly off and poor Johnson forgetting his sufferings in his despair Illustration I am a regular milksop he exclaimed a cry baby that can t stand the least pain And at my age too Come Johnson go in at once or you will be frost bitten Look at your hands they are white already Come come this minute I am not worth troubling about mister Clawbonny said the old boatswain Never mind me But you must come in you obstinate fellow Come now I tell you it will be too late presently At last he succeeded in dragging the poor fellow into the tent where he made him plunge his hands into a bowl of water which the heat of the stove kept in a liquid state though still cold Johnson s hands had hardy touched it before it froze immediately You see it was high time you came in I should have been forced to amputate soon said the Doctor Thanks to his endeavours all danger was over in about an hour but he was advised to keep his hands at a good distance from the stove for some time still That morning they had no breakfast Pemmican and salt beef were both done Not a crumb of biscuit remained They were obliged to content themselves with half a cup of hot coffee and start off again They scarcely went three miles before they were compelled to give up for the day They had no supper but coffee and the dogs were so ravenous that they were almost devouring each other Johnson fancied he could see the bear following them in the distance but he made no remark to his companions Sleep forsook the unfortunate men and their eyes grew wild and haggard Tuesday morning came and it was thirty four hours since they had tasted a morsel of food Yet these brave stout hearted men continued their march sustained by their superhuman energy of purpose They pushed the sledge themselves for the dogs could no longer draw it At the end of two hours they sank exhausted Hatteras urged them to make a fresh attempt but his entreaties and supplications were powerless they could not do impossibilities Illustration Well at any rate he said I won t die of cold if I must of hunger He set to work to hew out a hut in an iceberg aided by Johnson and really they looked like men digging their own tomb It was hard labour but at length the task was accomplished The little house was ready and the miserable men took up their abode in it In the evening while the others lay motionless a sort of hallucination came over Johnson and he began raving about bears The Doctor roused himself from his torpor and asked the old man what he meant and what bear he was talking about The bear that is following us replied Johnson A bear following us Yes for the last two days For the last two days You have seen him Yes about a mile to leeward And you never told me Johnson What was the good True enough said the Doctor we have not a single bail to send after him No not even a bit of iron The Doctor was silent for a minute as if thinking Then he said Are you quite certain the animal is following us Yes mister Clawbonny he is reckoning on a good feed of human flesh Johnson exclaimed the Doctor grieved at the despairing mood of his companion He is sure enough of his meal continued the You have no ball I ll make one You have no lead No but I have mercury So saying he took the thermometer which stood at fifty deg above zero and went outside and laid it on a block of ice Then he came in again and said Tomorrow Go to sleep and wait till the sun rises With the first streak of dawn next day the Doctor and Johnson rushed out to look at the thermometer All the mercury had frozen into a compact cylindrical mass The Doctor broke the tube and took it out Here was a hard piece of metal ready for use It is wonderful mister Clawbonny you ought to be a proud man Not at all my friend I am only gifted with a good memory and I have read a great deal How did that help you Why I just happened to recollect a fact related by Captain Ross in his voyages He states that they pierced a plank an inch thick with a bullet made of mercury Oil would even have suited my purpose for he adds that a ball of frozen almond oil splits through a post without breaking in pieces It is quite incredible But it is a fact Johnson Well come now this bit of metal may save our lives We ll leave it exposed to the air a little while and go and have a look for the bear Just then Hatteras made his appearance and the Doctor told him his project and showed him the mercury The captain grasped his hand silently and the three hunters went off in quest of their game Illustration The weather was very clear and Hatteras who was a little ahead of the others speedily discovered the bear about three hundred yards distant sitting on his hind quarters sniffing the air evidently scenting the intruders on his domains There he is he exclaimed Hush cried the Doctor But the enormous quadruped even when he perceived his antagonists never stirred and displayed neither fear nor anger It would not be easy to get near him however and Hatteras said Friends this is no idle sport our very existence is at stake we must act prudently Yes replied the Doctor for we have but the one shot to depend upon We must not miss for if Away they went while the old boatswain slipped behind a hummock which completely hid him from the bear who continued still in the same place and in the same position CHAPTER V THE SEAL AND THE BEAR You know Doctor said Hatteras as they returned to the hut the polar bears subsist almost entirely on seals They ll lie in wait for them beside the crevasses for whole days 
8765-295000-0001	train-other-500	ready to strangle them the moment their heads appear above the surface It is not likely then that a bear will be frightened of a seal I think I see what you are after but it is dangerous
8765-295000-0002	train-other-500	Yes but there is more chance of success than in trying any other plan so I mean to risk it I am going to dress myself in the seal s skin and creep along the ice Come don t let us lose time Load the gun and give it me
8765-295000-0003	train-other-500	The Doctor could not say anything for he would have done the same himself so he followed Hatteras silently to the sledge taking with him a couple of hatchets for his own and Johnson s use Hatteras soon made his toilette and slipped into the skin
none	none	 which was big enough to cover him almost entirely 
8765-295000-0004	train-other-500	Now then give me the gun he said
none	none	 and you be off to Johnson I must try and steal a march on my adversary 
8765-295000-0005	train-other-500	Courage Hatteras said the Doctor handing him the weapon which he had carefully loaded meanwhile Never fear but be sure you don t show yourselves till I fire The Doctor soon joined the old boatswain behind the hummock and told him what they had been doing
8765-295000-0006	train-other-500	The bear was still there but moving restlessly about as if he felt the approach of danger In a quarter of an hour or so the seal made his appearance on the ice He had gone a good way round so as to come on the bear by surprise
8765-295000-0007	train-other-500	and every movement was so perfect an imitation of a seal that even the Doctor would have been deceived if he had not known it was Hatteras It is capital said Johnson in a low voice The bear had instantly caught sight of the supposed seal for he gathered himself up
8765-295000-0008	train-other-500	preparing to make a spring as the animal came nearer
none	none	 apparently seeking to return to his native element and unaware of the enemy s proximity 
8765-295000-0009	train-other-500	Bruin went to work with extreme prudence though his eyes glared with greedy desire to clutch the coveted prey for he had probably been fasting a month if not two He allowed his victim to get within ten paces of him and then sprang forward with a tremendous bound
8765-295000-0010	train-other-500	but stopped short stupefied and frightened within three steps of Hatteras who started up that moment and throwing off his disguise knelt on one knee and aimed straight at the bear s heart
none	none	 He fired and the huge monster rolled back on the ice Illustration Forward Forward shouted the Doctor 
8765-295000-0011	train-other-500	hurrying towards Hatteras for the bear had reared on his hind legs and was striking the air with one paw and tearing up the snow to stanch his wound with the other Hatteras never moved but waited knife in hand
8765-295000-0012	train-other-500	He had aimed well and fired with a sure and steady aim Before either of his companions came up he had plunged the knife in the animal s throat and made an end of him for he fell down at once to rise no more
8765-295000-0013	train-other-500	Hurrah Bravo shouted Johnson and the Doctor but Hatteras was as cool and unexcited as possible and stood with folded arms gazing at his prostrate foe It is my turn now said Johnson It is a good thing the bear is killed
none	none	 but if we leave him out here much longer he will get as hard as a stone and we shall be able to do nothing with him 
8765-295000-0014	train-other-500	He began forthwith to strip the skin off
none	none	 and a fine business it was for the enormous quadruped was almost as large as an ox 
8765-295000-0015	train-other-500	It measured nearly nine feet long and four round and the great tusks in his jaws were three inches long On cutting the carcase open Johnson found nothing but water in the stomach The beast had evidently had no food for a long time
8765-295000-0016	train-other-500	yet it was very fat and weighed fifteen hundred pounds The hunters were so famished that they had hardly patience to carry home the flesh to be cooked and it needed all the Doctor s persuasion to prevent them eating it raw On entering the hut
8765-295000-0017	train-other-500	each man with a load on his back Clawbonny was struck with the coldness that pervaded the atmosphere On going up to the stove he found the fire black out The exciting business of the morning had made Johnson neglect his accustomed duty of replenishing the stove
8765-295000-0018	train-other-500	The Doctor tried to blow the embers into a flame but finding he could not even get a red spark he went out to the sledge to fetch tinder and get the steel from Johnson The old sailor put his hand into his pocket but was surprised to find the steel missing
8765-295000-0019	train-other-500	He felt in the other pockets but it was not there Then he went into the hut again and shook the blanket he had slept in all night but his search was still unsuccessful He went back to his companions and said Are you sure Doctor you haven t the steel Quite Johnson And you haven t it either captain
none	none	 Not I replied Hatteras It has always been in your keeping said the Doctor 
8765-295000-0020	train-other-500	Well I have not got it now exclaimed Johnson turning pale
none	none	 Not got the steel repeated the Doctor shuddering involuntarily at the bare idea of its loss for it was all the means they had of procuring a fire 
8765-295000-0021	train-other-500	Look again Johnson he said The boatswain hurried to the only remaining place he could think of the hummock where he had stood to watch the bear But the missing treasure was nowhere to be found and the old sailor returned in despair Hatteras looked at him
8765-295000-0022	train-other-500	but no word of reproach escaped his lips He only said This is a serious business Doctor It is indeed said Clawbonny We have not even an instrument some glass that we might take the lens out of and use like a burning glass
8765-295000-0023	train-other-500	No and it is a great pity for the sun s rays are quite strong enough just now to light our tinder Well said Hatteras we must just appease our hunger with the raw meat and set off again as soon as we can to try to discover the ship Yes replied Clawbonny
8765-295000-0024	train-other-500	speaking to himself absorbed in his own reflections Yes that might do at a pinch Why not We might try What are you dreaming about asked Hatteras
none	none	 An idea has just occurred to me 
8765-295000-0025	train-other-500	An idea come into your head Doctor exclaimed Johnson then we are saved Will it succeed that s the question What s your project said Hatteras We want a lens well let us make one How asked Johnson
8765-295000-0026	train-other-500	With a piece of ice What Do you think that would do Why not All that is needed is to collect the sun s rays into one common focus and ice will serve that purpose as well as the finest crystal Is it possible said Johnson
8765-295000-0027	train-other-500	Yes only I should like fresh water ice it is harder and more transparent than the other There it is to your hand if I am not much mistaken said Johnson
none	none	 pointing to a hummock close by Illustration I fancy that is fresh water from the dark look of it 
8765-295000-0028	train-other-500	and the green tinge You are right Bring your hatchet Johnson A good sized piece was soon cut off about a foot in diameter and the Doctor set to work He began by chopping it into rough shape with the hatchet then he operated upon it more carefully with his knife
8765-295000-0029	train-other-500	making as smooth a surface as possible and finished the polishing process with his fingers rubbing away until he had obtained as transparent a lens as if it had been made of magnificent crystal The sun was shining brilliantly enough for the Doctor s experiment
8765-295000-0030	train-other-500	The tinder was fetched and held beneath the lens so as to catch the rays in full power In a few seconds it took fire to Johnson s rapturous delight He danced about like an idiot almost beside himself with joy and shouted Hurrah hurrah
8765-295000-0031	train-other-500	while Clawbonny hurried back into the hut and rekindled the fire The stove was soon roaring
none	none	 and it was not many minutes before the savoury odour of broiled bear steaks roused Bell from his torpor 
8765-295000-0032	train-other-500	What a feast this meal was to the poor starving men may be imagined The Doctor however counselled moderation in eating and set the example himself This is a glad day for us he said and we have no fear of wanting food all the rest of our journey
8765-295000-0033	train-other-500	Still we must not forget we have further to go yet and I think the sooner we start the better We cannot be far off now said Altamont who could almost articulate perfectly again we must be within forty eight hours march of the Porpoise
none	none	 I hope we ll find something there to make a fire with said the Doctor smiling 
8765-295000-0034	train-other-500	My lens does well enough at present but it needs the sun
none	none	 and there are plenty of days when he does not make his appearance here 
8765-295000-0035	train-other-500	within less than four degrees of the pole Less than four degrees repeated Altamont with a sigh yes my ship went further than any other has ever ventured It is time we started said Hatteras abruptly Yes replied the Doctor
8765-295000-0036	train-other-500	glancing uneasily at the two captains
none	none	 The dogs were speedily harnessed to the sledge and the march resumed Illustration As they went along the Doctor tried to get out of Altamont the real motive that had brought him so far north 
8765-295000-0037	train-other-500	But the American made only evasive replies and Clawbonny whispered in old Johnson s ear Two men we ve got that need looking after You are right said Johnson Hatteras never says a word to this American
8765-295000-0038	train-other-500	and I must say the man has not shown himself very grateful I am here fortunately mister Clawbonny said Johnson now this Yankee has come back to life again I must confess I don t much like the expression of his face
8765-295000-0039	train-other-500	I am much mistaken if he does not suspect the projects of Hatteras Do you think his own were similar Who knows
none	none	 These Americans Johnson are bold daring fellows It is likely enough an American would try to do as much as an Englishman 
8765-295000-0040	train-other-500	Then you think that Altamont I think nothing about it but his ship is certainly on the road to the North Pole But didn t Altamont say that he had been caught among the ice and dragged there irresistibly He said so but I fancied there was a peculiar smile on his lips while he spoke
none	none	 Hang it It 
8765-295000-0041	train-other-500	would be a bad job mister Clawbonny if any feeling of rivalry came between two men of their stamp Heaven forfend for it might involve the most serious consequences Johnson I hope Altamont will remember he owes his life to us
8765-295000-0042	train-other-500	But do we not owe ours to him now I grant without us he would not be alive at this moment but without him and his ship what would become of us Well mister Clawbonny you are here to keep things straight anyhow and that is a blessing
8765-295000-0043	train-other-500	I hope I may manage it Johnson The journey proceeded without any fresh incident but on the Saturday morning the travellers found themselves in a region of quite an altered character Instead of the wide smooth plain of ice that had hitherto stretched before them
8765-295000-0044	train-other-500	overturned icebergs and broken hummocks covered the horizon while the frequent blocks of fresh water ice showed that some coast was near Next day after a hearty breakfast off the bear s paws the little party continued their route
8765-295000-0045	train-other-500	but the road became toilsome and fatiguing Altamont lay watching the horizon with feverish anxiety an anxiety shared by all his companions for according to the last reckoning made by Hatteras
none	none	 they were now exactly in latitude eighty three deg thirty five and longitude one hundred twenty deg fifteen 
8765-295000-0046	train-other-500	and the question of life or death would be decided before the day was over At last about two o clock in the afternoon Altamont started up with a shout that arrested the whole party
8765-295000-0047	train-other-500	and pointing to a white mass that no eye but his could have distinguished from the surrounding icebergs exclaimed in a loud ringing voice
none	none	 The Porpoise CHAPTER VI THE PORPOISE It was the twenty fourth of March and Palm Sunday a bright joyous day in many a town and village of the Old World but in this desolate region what mournful silence prevailed No willow branches here with their silvery blossom not even a single withered leaf to be seen not a blade of grass Yet this was a glad day to the travellers for it promised them speedy deliverance from the death that had seemed so inevitable They hastened onward the dogs put forth renewed energy and Duk barked his loudest till before long they arrived at the ship The Porpoise was completely buried under the snow All her masts and rigging had been destroyed in the shipwreck and she was lying on a bed of rocks so entirely on her side that her hull was uppermost They had to knock away fifteen feet of ice before they could even catch a glimpse of her and it was not without great difficulty that they managed to get on board and made the welcome discovery that the provision stores had not been visited by any four footed marauders It was quite evident however that the ship was not habitable Never mind said Hatteras we must build a snow house and make ourselves comfortable on land Yes but we need not hurry over it said the Doctor let us do it well while we re about it and for a time we can make shift on board for we must build a good substantial house that will protect us from the bears as well as the cold I ll undertake to be the architect and you shall see what a first rate job I ll make of it I don t doubt your talents mister Clawbonny replied Johnson but meantime let us see about taking up our abode here and making an inventory of the stores we find There does not seem a boat visible of any description and I fear these timbers are in too bad a condition to build a new ship out of them I don t know that returned Clawbonny time and thought do wonders but our first business is to build a house and not a ship one thing at a time I propose And quite right too said Hatteras so we ll go ashore again They returned to the sledge to communicate the result of their investigation to Bell and Altamont and about four in the afternoon the five men installed themselves as well as they could on the wreck Bell had managed to make a tolerably level floor with planks and spars the stiffened cushions and hammocks were placed round the stove to thaw and were soon fit for use Altamont with the Doctor s assistance got on board without much trouble and a sigh of satisfaction escaped him as if he felt himself once more at home a sigh which to Johnson s ear boded no good The rest of the day was given to repose and they wound up with a good supper off the remains of the bear backed by a plentiful supply of biscuit and hot tea Illustration The poor fellows felt like colonists safely arrived at their destination P fifty seven It was late next morning before Hatteras and his companions woke for their minds were not burdened now with any solicitudes about the morrow and they might sleep as long as they pleased The poor fellows felt like colonists safely arrived at their destination who had forgotten all the sufferings of the voyage and thought only of the new life that lay before them Well it is something at all events said the Doctor rousing himself and stretching his arms for a fellow not to need to ask where he is going to find his next bed and breakfast Let us see what there is on board before we say much said Johnson The Porpoise has been thoroughly equipped and provisioned for a long voyage and on making an inventory of what stores remained they found six thousand one hundred fifty lbs of flour fat and raisins two thousand lbs of salt beef and pork fifteen hundred lbs of pemmican seven hundred lbs of sugar and the same of chocolate a chest and a half of tea weighing ninety six lbs five hundred lbs of rice several barrels of preserved fruits and vegetables a quantity of lime juice with all sorts of medicines and three hundred gallons of rum and brandy There was also a large supply of gunpowder ball and shot and coal and wood in abundance Altogether there was enough to last those five men for more than two years and all fear of death from starvation or cold was at an end Well Hatteras we re sure of enough to live on now said the Doctor and there is nothing to hinder us reaching the Pole The Pole echoed Hatteras Yes why not Can t we push our way overland in the summer months We might overland but how could we cross water Perhaps we may be able to build a boat out of some of the ship s planks Out of an American ship exclaimed the captain contemptuously Clawbonny was prudent enough to make no reply and presently changed the conversation by saying Well now we have seen what we have to depend upon we must begin our house and store rooms We have materials enough at hand and Bell I hope you are going to distinguish yourself he added I am ready mister Clawbonny replied Bell and as for material there is enough for a town here with houses and streets We don t require that we ll content ourselves with imitating the Hudson s Bay Company They entrench themselves in fortresses against the Indians and wild beasts That s all we need a house one side and stores the other with a wall and two bastions I must try to make a plan Ah Doctor if you undertake it said Johnson I am sure you ll make a good thing of it Well the first part of the business is to go and choose the ground Will you come with us Hatteras I ll trust all that to you Doctor replied the captain I m going to look along the coast Altamont was too feeble yet to take part in any work so he remained on the ship while the others commenced to explore the unknown continent On examining the coast they found that the Porpoise was in a sort of bay bristling with dangerous rocks and that to the west far as the eye could reach the sea extended entirely frozen now though if Belcher and Penny were to be believed open during the summer months Towards the north a promontory stretched out into the sea and about three miles away was an island of moderate size The roadstead thus formed would have afforded safe anchorage to ships but for the difficulty of entering it A considerable distance inland there was a solitary mountain about three thousand feet high by the Doctor s reckoning and half way up the steep rocky cliffs that rose from the shore they noticed a circular plateau open on three sides to the bay and sheltered on the fourth by a precipitous wall one hundred twenty feet high This seemed to the Doctor the very place for this house from its naturally fortified situation By cutting steps in the ice they managed to climb up and examine it more closely Illustration They were soon convinced they could not have a better foundation and resolved to commence operations forthwith by removing the hard snow more than ten feet deep which covered the ground as both dwelling and storehouses must have a solid foundation This preparatory work occupied the whole of Monday Tuesday and Wednesday At last they came to hard granite close in grain and containing garnets and felspar crystals which flew out with every stroke of the pickaxe Illustration The dimensions and plan of the snow house were then settled by the Doctor It was to be divided into three rooms as all they needed was a bed room sitting room and kitchen The sitting room was to be in the middle the kitchen to the left and the bed room to the right For five days they toiled unremittingly There was plenty of material and the walls required to be thick enough to resist summer thaws Already the house began to present an imposing appearance There were four windows in front made of splendid sheets of ice in Esquimaux fashion through which the light came softly in as if through frosted glass Outside there was a long covered passage between the two windows of the sitting room This was the entrance hall and it was shut in by a strong door taken from the cabin of the Porpoise The Doctor was highly delighted with his performance when all was finished for though it would have been difficult to say to what style of architecture it belonged it was strong and that was the chief thing The next business was to move in all the furniture of the Porpoise The beds were brought first and laid down round the large stove in the sleeping room then came chairs tables arm chairs cupboards and benches for the sitting room and finally the ship furnaces and cooking utensils for the kitchen Sails spread on the ground did duty for carpets and also served for inner doors Illustration The walls of the house were over five feet thick and the windows resembled port holes for cannon Every part was as solid as possible and what more was wanted Yet if the Doctor could have had his way he would have made all manner of ornamental additions in humble imitation of the Ice Palace built in saint Petersburgh in January seventeen forty of which he had read an account He amused his companions after work in the evening by describing its grandeur the cannons in front and statues of exquisite beauty and the wonderful elephant that spouted water out of his trunk by day and flaming naphtha by night all cut out of ice He also depicted the interior with tables and toilette tables mirrors candelabra tapers beds mattresses pillows curtains time pieces chairs playing cards wardrobes completely fitted up in fact everything in the way of furniture that could be mentioned and the whole entirely composed of ice It was on Easter Sunday the thirty first of March when the travellers installed themselves in their new abode and after holding divine service in the sitting room they devoted the remainder of the day to rest Next morning they set about building the storehouses and powder magazine This took a whole week longer including the time spent in unloading the vessel which was a task of considerable difficulty as the temperature was so low that they could not work for many hours at a time At length on the eighth of April provisions fuel and ammunition were all safe on terra firma and deposited in their respective places A sort of kennel was constructed a little distance from the house for the Greenland dogs which the Doctor dignified by the name of Dog Palace Duk shared his master s quarters All that now remained to be done was to put a parapet right round the plateau by way of fortification Illustration By the fifteenth this was also completed and the snow house might bid defiance to a whole tribe of Esquimaux or any other hostile invaders if indeed any human beings whatever were to be found on this unknown continent for Hatteras who had minutely examined the bay and the surrounding coast had not been able to discover the least vestiges of the huts that are generally met with on shores frequented by Greenland tribes The shipwrecked sailors of the Porpoise and Forward seemed to be the first whose feet had ever trod this lone region CHAPTER VII AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION While all these preparations for winter were going on Altamont was fast regaining strength His vigorous constitution triumphed and he was even able to lend a helping hand in the unlading of the ship He was a true type of the American a shrewd intelligent man full of energy and resolution enterprising bold and ready for anything He was a native of New York he informed his companions and had been a sailor from his boyhood The Porpoise had been equipped and sent out by a company of wealthy merchants belonging to the States at the head of which was the famous Grinnell There were many points of resemblance between Altamont and Hatteras but no affinities Indeed any similarity that there was between them tended rather to create discord than to make the men friends With a greater show of frankness he was in reality far more deep and crafty than Hatteras He was more free and easy but not so true hearted and somehow his apparent openness did not inspire such confidence as the Englishman s gloomy reserve Illustration The Doctor was in constant dread of a collision between the rival captains and yet one must command inevitably and which should it be Hatteras had the men but Altamont had the ship and it was hard to say whose was the better right It required all the Doctor s tact to keep things smooth for the simplest conversation threatened to lead to strife At last in spite of all his endeavours an outbreak occurred on the occasion of a grand banquet by way of house warming when the new habitation was completed This banquet was doctor Clawbonny s idea He was head cook and distinguished himself by the concoction of a wonderful pudding which would positively have done no dishonour to the cuisine of the Lord Chancellor of England Bell most opportunely chanced to shoot a white hare and several ptarmigans which made an agreeable variety from the pemmican and salt meat Clawbonny was master of the ceremonies and brought in his pudding adorning himself with the insignia of his office a big apron and a knife dangling at his belt As Altamont did not conform to the teetotal regime of his English companions gin and brandy were set on the table after dinner and the others by the Doctor s orders joined him in a glass for once that the festive occasion might be duly honoured When the different toasts were being drunk one was given to the United States to which Hatteras made no response This important business over the Doctor introduced an interesting subject of conversation by saying My friends it is not enough to have come thus far in spite of so many difficulties we have something more yet to do I propose we should bestow a name on this continent where we have found friendly shelter and rest and not only on the continent but on the several bays peaks and promontories that we meet with This has been invariably done by navigators and is a most necessary proceeding Quite right said Johnson when once a place is named it takes away the feeling of being castaways on an unknown shore Yes added Bell and we might be going on some expedition and obliged to separate or go out hunting and it would make it much easier to find one another if each locality had a definite name Illustration Very well then said the Doctor since we are all agreed let us go steadily to work Hatteras had taken no part in the conversation as yet but seeing all eyes fixed on him he rose at last and said If no one objects I think the most suitable name we can give our house is that of its skilful architect the best man among us Let us call it Doctor s House Just the thing said Bell First rate exclaimed Johnson Doctor s House We cannot do better chimed in Altamont Hurrah for Doctor Clawbonny Three hearty cheers were given in which Duk joined lustily barking his loudest It is agreed then said Hatteras that this house is to be called Doctor s House The Doctor almost overcome by his feelings modestly protested against the honour but he was obliged to yield to the wishes of his friends and the new habitation was formally named Doctor s House Now then said the Doctor let us go onto name the most important of our discoveries There is that immense sea which surrounds us unfurrowed as yet by a single ship A single ship repeated Altamont I think you have forgotten the Porpoise and yet she certainly did not get here overland Well it would not be difficult to believe she had replied Hatteras to see on what she lies at present True enough Hatteras said Altamont in a piqued tone but after all is not that better than being blown to atoms like the Forward Hatteras was about to make some sharp retort but Clawbonny interposed It is not a question of ships my friends he said but of a fresh sea It is no new sea returned Altamont it is in every Polar chart and has a name already It is called the Arctic Ocean and I think it would be very inconvenient to alter its designation Should we find out by and by that instead of being an ocean it is only a strait or gulf it will be time enough to alter it then So be it said Hatteras Very well that is an understood thing then said the Doctor almost regretting that he had started a discussion so pregnant with national rivalries Let us proceed with the continent where we find ourselves at present resumed Hatteras I am not aware that any name whatever has been affixed to it even in the most recent charts He looked at Altamont as he spoke who met his gaze steadily and said Possibly you may be mistaken again Hatteras Mistaken What This unknown continent this virgin soil Has already a name replied Altamont coolly Hatteras was silent but his lip quivered And what name has it then asked the Doctor rather astonished at Altamont s affirmation My dear Clawbonny replied the American it is the custom not to say the right of every navigator to christen the soil on which he is the first to set foot It appears to me therefore that it is my privilege and duty on this occasion to exercise my prerogative and But sir interrupted Johnson rather nettled at his sang froid It would be a difficult matter to prove that the Porpoise did not come here even supposing she reached this coast by land continued Altamont without noticing Johnson s protest The fact is indisputable he added looking at Hatteras Illustration I dispute the claim said the Englishman restraining himself by a powerful effort P seventy two I dispute the claim said the Englishman restraining himself by a powerful effort To name a country you must first discover it I suppose and that you certainly did not do Besides but for us where would you have been sir at this moment pray Lying twenty feet deep under the snow And without me sir retorted Altamont hotly without me and my ship where would you all be at this moment Dead from cold and hunger Come come friends said the Doctor don t get to words all that can be easily settled Listen to me mister Hatteras said Altamont is welcome to name whatever territories he may discover should he succeed in discovering any but this continent belongs to me I should not even consent to its having two names like Grinnell s Land which is also called Prince Albert s Land because it was discovered almost simultaneously by an Englishman and an American This is quite another matter my right of priority is incontestable No ship before mine ever touched this shore no foot before mine ever trod this soil I have given it a name and that name it shall keep And what is that name inquired the Doctor New America replied Altamont Hatteras trembled with suppressed passion but by a violent effort restrained himself Can you prove to me said Altamont that an Englishman has set foot here before an American Johnson and Bell said nothing though quite as much offended as the captain by Altamont s imperious tone They felt that reply was impossible For a few minutes there was an awkward silence which the Doctor broke by saying My friends the highest human law is justice It includes all others Let us be just then and don t let any bad feeling get in among us The priority of Altamont seems to me indisputable We will take our revenge by and by and England will get her full share in our future discoveries Let the name New America stand for the continent itself but I suppose Altamont has not yet disposed of all the bays and capes and headlands it contains and I imagine there will be nothing to prevent us calling this bay Victoria Bay Nothing whatever provided that yonder cape is called Cape Washington replied Altamont You might choose a name sir exclaimed Hatteras almost beside himself with passion that is less offensive to an Englishman But not one which sounds so sweet to an American retorted Altamont proudly Come come said the Doctor no discussion on that subject An American has a perfect right to be proud of his great countryman Let us honour genius wherever it is met with and since Altamont has made his choice let us take our turn next let the captain Doctor interrupted Hatteras I have no wish that my name should figure anywhere on this continent seeing that it belongs to America Is this your unalterable determination asked Clawbonny It is The Doctor did not insist further Very well we ll have it to ourselves then he continued turning to Johnson and Bell We ll leave our traces behind us I propose that the island we see out there about three miles away from the shore should be called Isle Johnson in honour of our boatswain Oh mister Clawbonny began Johnson in no little confusion And that mountain that we discovered in the west we will call Bell Mount if our carpenter is willing It is doing me too much honour replied Bell It is simple justice returned the Doctor Nothing could be better said Altamont Now then all we have to do is to christen our fort said the Doctor about that there will be no discussion I hope for it is neither to our gracious sovereign Queen Victoria nor to Washington that we owe our safety and shelter here but to God who brought about our meeting and by so doing saved us all Let our little fort be called Fort Providence Your remarks are just said Altamont no name could be more suitable Fort Providence added Johnson sounds well too In our future excursions then we shall go by Cape Washington to Victoria Bay and from thence to Fort Providence where we shall find food and rest at Doctor s House The business is settled then so far resumed the Doctor As our discoveries multiply we shall have other names to give but I trust friends we shall have no disputes about them for placed as we are we need all the help and love we can give each other Let us be strong by being united Who knows what dangers yet we may have to brave and what sufferings to endure before we see our native land once more Let us be one in heart though five in number and let us lay aside all feelings of rivalry Such feelings are bad enough at all times but among us they would be doubly wrong You understand me Altamont and you Hatteras Neither of the captains replied but the Doctor took no notice of their silence and went on to speak of other things Sundry expeditions were planned to forage for fresh food It would soon be spring and hares and partridges foxes and bears would re appear So it was determined that part of every day should be spent in hunting and exploring this unknown continent of New America Illustration Clambering up the steep rocky wall against which the Doctor s House leaned he succeeded though with considerable difficulty in reaching the top P seventy seven CHAPTER VIII AN EXCURSION TO THE NORTH OF VICTORIA BAY Next morning Clawbonny was out by dawn of day Clambering up the steep rocky wall against which the Doctor s House leaned 
8765-295003-0001	train-other-500	he succeeded though with considerable difficulty in reaching the top which he found terminated abruptly in a sort of truncated cone
8765-295003-0002	train-other-500	From this elevation there was an extensive view over a vast tract of country which was all disordered and convulsed as if it had undergone some volcanic commotion
none	none	 Sea and land as far as it was possible to distinguish one from the other 
8765-295003-0003	train-other-500	were covered with a sheet of ice A new project struck the Doctor s mind which was soon matured and ripe for execution He lost no time in going back to the snow house and consulting over it with his companions I have got an idea he said
8765-295003-0004	train-other-500	I think of constructing a lighthouse on the top of that cone above our heads A lighthouse they all exclaimed Yes a lighthouse
none	none	 It would be a double advantage It would be a beacon to guide us in distant excursions 
8765-295003-0005	train-other-500	and also serve to illumine our plateau in the long dreary winter months There is no doubt replied Altamont of its utility but how would you contrive to make it
none	none	 With one of the lanterns out of the Porpoise All right but how will you feed your lamp With seal oil 
8765-295003-0006	train-other-500	No seal oil would not give nearly sufficient light It would scarcely be visible through the fog Are you going to try to make gas out of our coal then No not that either for gas would not be strong enough and worse still it would waste our combustibles
8765-295003-0007	train-other-500	Well replied Altamont I m at a loss to see how you Oh I m prepared for everything after the mercury bullet and the ice lens and Fort Providence I believe mister Clawbonny can do anything exclaimed Johnson
8765-295003-0008	train-other-500	Come Clawbonny tell us what your light is to be then said Altamont That s soon told replied Clawbonny I mean to have an electric light An electric light Yes why not Haven t you a galvanic battery on board your ship Yes
8765-295003-0009	train-other-500	Well there will be no difficulty then in producing an electric light and that will cost nothing and be far brighter First rate said Johnson let us set to work at once By all means
8765-295003-0010	train-other-500	There is plenty of material In an hour we can raise a pillar of ice ten feet high and that is quite enough Away went the Doctor followed by his companions and the column was soon erected and crowned with a ship lantern
8765-295003-0011	train-other-500	The conducting wires were properly adjusted within it and the pile with which they communicated fixed up in the sitting room where the warmth of the stove would protect it from the action of the frost As soon as it grew dark the experiment was made and proved a complete success
8765-295003-0012	train-other-500	An intense brilliant light streamed from the lantern and illumined the entire plateau and the plains beneath Johnson could not help clapping his hands half beside himself with delight Well I declare mister Clawbonny he exclaimed you re our sun now
8765-295003-0013	train-other-500	One must be a little of everything you know was Clawbonny s modest reply
none	none	 It was too cold however even to stand admiring more than a minute and the whole party were glad enough to get indoors again and tuck themselves up in their warm blankets 
8765-295003-0014	train-other-500	A regular course of life commenced now though uncertain weather and frequent changes of temperature made it sometimes impracticable to venture outside the hut at all
none	none	 and it was not till the Saturday after the installation that a day came that was favourable enough for a hunting excursion when Bell and Altamont and the Doctor determined to take advantage of it and try to replenish their stock of provisions 
8765-295003-0015	train-other-500	They started very early in the morning each armed with a double barrelled gun and plenty of powder and shot
none	none	 a hatchet and a snow knife Illustration The weather was cloudy but Clawbonny put the galvanic battery in action before he left 
8765-295003-0016	train-other-500	and the bright rays of the electric light did duty for the glorious orb of day
none	none	 and in truth was no bad substitute 
8765-295003-0017	train-other-500	for the light was equal to three thousand candles or three hundred gas burners It was intensely cold but dry and there was little or no wind The hunters set off in the direction of Cape Washington
8765-295003-0018	train-other-500	and the hard snow so favoured their march that in three hours they had gone fifteen miles Duk jumping and barking beside them all the way
none	none	 They kept as close to the coast as possible 
8765-295003-0019	train-other-500	but found no trace of human habitation and indeed scarcely a sign of animal life A few snow birds however darting to and fro announced the approach of spring and the return of the animal creation The sea was still entirely frozen over
8765-295003-0020	train-other-500	but it was evident from the open breathing holes in the ice that the seals had been quite recently on the surface In one part the holes were so numerous that the Doctor said to his companions that he had no doubt that when summer came they would be seen
8765-295003-0021	train-other-500	there in hundreds and would be easily captured for on unfrequented shores they were not so difficult of approach But once frighten them and they all vanish as if by enchantment and never return to the spot again
8765-295003-0022	train-other-500	Inexperienced hunters he said have often lost a whole shoal by attacking them en masse with noisy shouts instead of singly and silently Is it for the oil or skin that they are mostly hunted Europeans hunt them for the skin
none	none	 but the Esquimaux eat them 
8765-295003-0023	train-other-500	They live on seals and nothing is so delicious to them as a piece of the flesh dipped in the blood and oil
none	none	 After all cooking has a good deal to do with it 
8765-295003-0024	train-other-500	and I ll bet you something I could dress you cutlets you would not turn up your nose at unless for their black appearance We ll set you to work on it said Bell and I ll eat as much as you like to please you My good Bell
8765-295003-0025	train-other-500	you mean to say to please yourself but your voracity would never equal the Green landers for they devour from ten to fifteen pounds of meat a day Fifteen pounds said Bell What stomachs Arctic stomachs replied the Doctor are prodigious
8765-295003-0026	train-other-500	they can expand at will and I may add contract at will so that they can endure starvation quite as well as abundance When an Esquimaux sits down to dinner he is quite thin and by the time he has finished he is so corpulent you would hardly recognize him
8765-295003-0027	train-other-500	But then we must remember that one meal sometimes has to last a whole day This voracity must be peculiar to the inhabitants of cold countries said Altamont I think it is replied the Doctor In the Arctic regions people must eat enormously
8765-295003-0028	train-other-500	it is not only one of the conditions of strength but of existence
none	none	 The Hudson s Bay Company always reckoned on this account eight lbs of meat to each man a day or twelve lbs of fish or two lbs of pemmican 
8765-295003-0029	train-other-500	Invigorating regimen certainly said Bell Not so much as you imagine my friend An Indian who guzzles like that can t do a whit better day s work than an Englishman who has his pound of beef and pint of beer Things are best as they are then mister Clawbonny
8765-295003-0030	train-other-500	No doubt of it and yet an Esquimaux meal may well astonish us In Sir John Ross s narrative he states his surprise at the appetites of his guides He tells us that two of them just two mind
8765-295003-0031	train-other-500	devoured a quarter of a buffalo in one morning They cut the meat in long narrow strips and the mode of eating was either for the one to bite off as much as his mouth could hold and then pass it on to the other
8765-295003-0032	train-other-500	or to leave the long ribbons of meat dangling from the mouth and devour them gradually like boa constrictors
none	none	 lying at full length on the ground Illustration Faugh exclaimed Bell what disgusting brutes 
8765-295003-0033	train-other-500	Every man has his own fashion of dining remarked the philosophical American Happily said the Doctor Well if eating is such an imperative necessity in these latitudes
8765-295003-0034	train-other-500	it quite accounts for all the journals of Arctic travellers being so full of eating and drinking You are right returned the Doctor I have been struck by the same fact but I think it arises not only from the necessity of full diet but from the extreme difficulty
8765-295003-0035	train-other-500	sometimes in procuring it The thought of food is always uppermost in the mind and naturally finds mention in the narrative And yet said Altamont if my memory serves me right in the coldest parts of Norway the peasants do not seem to need such substantial fare
8765-295003-0036	train-other-500	Milk diet is their staple food with eggs and bread made of the bark of the birch tree a little salmon occasionally but never meat and still they are fine hardy fellows It is an affair of organization out of my power to explain
8765-295003-0037	train-other-500	replied Clawbonny but I have no doubt that if these same Norwegians were transplanted to Greenland
none	none	 they would learn to eat like the Esquimaux by the second or third generation 
8765-295003-0038	train-other-500	Even if we ourselves were to remain in this blessed country long we should be as bad as the Esquimaux even if we escaped becoming regular gluttons I declare mister Clawbonny you make me feel hungry with talking so much about eating exclaimed Bell
8765-295003-0039	train-other-500	Not I said Altamont It rather sickens me and makes me loathe the sight of a seal But stop I do believe we are going to have the chance of a dinner off one for I am much mistaken if that s not something alive lying on those lumps of ice yonder
8765-295003-0040	train-other-500	It is a walrus exclaimed the Doctor Be quiet and let us get up to him Clawbonny was right it was a walrus of huge dimensions disporting himself not more than two hundred yards away
8765-295003-0041	train-other-500	The hunters separated going in different directions so as to surround the animal and cut off all retreat They crept along cautiously behind the hummocks
none	none	 and managed to get within a few paces of him unperceived when they fired simultaneously Illustration The walrus rolled over but speedily got up again and tried to make his escape but Altamont fell upon him with his hatchet and cut off his dorsal fins He made a desperate resistance but was overpowered by his enemies 
8765-295003-0042	train-other-500	and soon lay dead reddening the ice field with his blood It was a fine animal measuring more than fifteen feet in length
none	none	 and would have been worth a good deal for the oil 
8765-295003-0043	train-other-500	but the hunters contented themselves with cutting off the most savoury parts and left the rest to the ravens which had just begun to make their appearance
none	none	 Night was drawing on and it was time to think of returning to Fort Providence 
8765-295003-0044	train-other-500	The moon had not yet risen but the sky was serene and cloudless and already glittering with stars magnificent stars Come said the Doctor let us be off for it is getting late
none	none	 Our hunting has not been very successful but still if a man has found something for his supper he need not grumble 
8765-295003-0045	train-other-500	Let us go the shortest road however and get quickly home without losing our way The stars will guide us They resolved to try a more direct route back by going further inland and avoiding the windings of the coast
none	none	 but after some hours walking they found themselves no nearer Doctor s House and it was evident that they must have lost their way 
8765-295003-0046	train-other-500	The question was raised whether to construct a hut and rest till morning or proceed but Clawbonny insisted on going on as Hatteras and Johnson would be so uneasy Duk will guide us he said he won t go wrong
8765-295003-0047	train-other-500	His instinct can dispense with star and compass Just let us keep close behind him
none	none	 They did well to trust to Duk for very speedily a faint light appeared in the horizon almost like a star glimmering through the mist which hung low above the ground There s our lighthouse exclaimed the Doctor Do you think it is mister Clawbonny said Bell Illustration Soon they were walking in a bright luminous track leaving their long shadows behind them on the spotless snow P eighty seven I m certain of it Come on faster The light became stronger the nearer they approached and soon they were walking in a bright luminous track leaving their long shadows behind them on the spotless snow Quickening their steps they hastened forward and in another half hour they were climbing the ascent to Fort Providence CHAPTER IX COLD AND HEAT Hatteras and Johnson had been getting somewhat uneasy at the prolonged absence of their companions and were delighted to see them back safe and sound The hunters were no less glad to find themselves once more in a warm shelter for the temperature had fallen considerably as night drew on and the thermometer outside was seventy three deg below zero The poor hunters were half frozen and so worn out that they could hardly drag their limbs along but the stoves were roaring and crackling cheerily and the big kitchen fire waiting to cook such game as might be brought in Clawbonny donned his official apron again and soon had his seal cutlets dressed and smoking on the table By nine o clock the whole party were enjoying a good supper and Bell couldn t help exclaiming Well even at the risk of being taken for an Esquimaux I must confess eating is the most important business if one has to winter in these regions A good meal isn t to be sneezed at They all had their mouths crammed too full to speak but the Doctor signified his agreement with Bell s views by an approving nod The cutlets were pronounced first rate and it seemed as if they were for they were all eaten to the very last morsel For dessert they had coffee which the Doctor brewed himself in a French coffee pot over spirits of wine He never allowed anybody but himself to concoct this precious beverage for he made a point of serving it boiling hot always declaring it was not fit to drink unless it burnt his tongue This evening he took it so scalding that Altamont exclaimed Illustration You ll skin your throat Not a bit of it was the Doctor s reply Then your palate must be copper sheathed said Johnson Not at all friends I advise you to copy my example Many persons and I am one can drink coffee at a temperature of one hundred thirty one deg one hundred thirty one deg said Altamont why that is hotter than the hand could bear Of course it is Altamont for the hand could not bear more than one hundred twenty two deg but the palate and tongue are less sensitive You surprise me Well I will convince you it is fact returned Clawbonny and taking up a thermometer he plunged it into the steaming coffee He waited till the mercury rose as high as one hundred thirty one deg and then withdrew it and swallowed the liquid with evident gusto Bell tried to follow his example but burnt his mouth severely You are not used to it said the Doctor coolly Can you tell us Clawbonny asked Altamont what is the highest temperature that the human body can bear Yes several curious experiments have been made in that respect I remember reading of some servant girls in the town of Rochefoucauld in France who could stay ten minutes in a baker s large oven when the temperature was three hundred deg while potatoes and meat were cooking all round them What girls exclaimed Altamont Well there is another case where eight of our own countrymen Fordyce Banks Solander Blagdin Home Nooth Lord Seaforth and Captain Phillips went into one as hot as two hundred deg where eggs and beef were frizzling And they were Englishmen said Bell with a touch of national pride Oh the Americans could have done better than that said Altamont They would have roasted returned the Doctor laughing At all events they have never tried it so I shall stand up for my countrymen There is one more instance I recollect and really it is so incredible that it would be impossible to believe it if it were not attested by unimpeachable evidence The Duke of Ragusa and Illustration doctor Jung a Frenchman and an Austrian saw a Turk plunge into a bath at one hundred seventy deg But that is not so astonishing as those servant girls or our own countrymen said Johnson I beg your pardon replied Clawbonny there is a great difference between plunging into hot air and hot water Hot air produces perspiration which protects the skin but boiling water scalds The maximum heat of baths is one hundred seven deg so that this Turk must have been an extraordinary fellow to endure such temperature What is the mean temperature mister Clawbonny of animated beings asked Johnson That varies with the species replied the Doctor Birds have the highest especially the duck and the hen The mammalia come next and human beings The temperature of Englishmen averages one hundred one deg I am sure mister Altamont is going to claim a higher rate for his countrymen said Johnson smiling Well sure enough we ve some precious hot ones among us but as I never have put a thermometer down their throats to ascertain I can t give you statistics There is no sensible difference said the Doctor between men of different races when they are placed under the same conditions whatever their food may be I may almost say their temperature would be the same at the Equator as the Pole Then the heat of our bodies is the same here as in England replied Altamont Just about it The other species of mammalia are generally hotter than human beings The horse the hare the elephant the porpoise and the tiger are nearly the same but the cat the squirrel the rat the panther the sheep the ox the dog the monkey and the goat are as high as one hundred three deg and the pig is one hundred four deg Rather humiliating to us put in Altamont Then come the amphibia and the fish resumed the Doctor whose temperature varies with that of the water The serpent has a temperature of eighty six deg the frog seventy deg and the shark several degrees less Insects appear to have the temperature of air and water Illustration All this is very well interrupted Hatteras who had hitherto taken no part in the conversation and we are obliged to the Doctor for his scientific information but we are really talking as if we were going to brave the heat of the torrid zone I think it would be far more seasonable to speak of cold if the Doctor could tell us what is the lowest temperature on record I can enlighten you on that too replied the Doctor There are a great number of memorable winters which appear to have come at intervals of about forty one years In thirteen sixty four the Rhone was frozen over as far as Arles in fourteen oh eight the Danube was frozen throughout its entire extent and the wolves crossed the Cattigut on firm ground in fifteen oh nine the Adriatic and the Mediterranean were frozen at Venice and Marseilles and the Baltic on the tenth of April in sixteen oh eight all the cattle died in England from the cold in seventeen eighty nine the Thames was frozen as far as Gravesend and the frightful winter of eighteen thirteen will long be remembered in France The earliest and longest ever known in the present century was in eighteen twenty nine So much for Europe But here within the Polar circle what is the lowest degree asked Altamont My word said the Doctor I think we have experienced the lowest ourselves for one day the thermometer was seventy two deg below zero and if my memory serves me right the lowest temperature mentioned hitherto by Arctic voyagers has been sixty one deg at Melville Island sixty five deg at Port Felix and seventy deg at Fort Reliance Yes said Hatteras it was the unusual severity of the winter that barred our progress for it came on just at the worst time possible You were stopped you say asked Altamont looking fixedly at the captain Yes in our voyage west the Doctor hastened to reply Then the maximum and minimum temperatures said Altamont resuming the conversation are about two hundred deg apart So you see my friends we may make ourselves easy But if the sun were suddenly extinguished suggested Johnson would not the earth s temperature be far lower There is no fear of such a catastrophe but even should it happen the temperature would be scarcely any different Illustration That s curious It is but Fourrier a learned Frenchman has proved the fact incontestably If it were not the case the difference between day and night would be far greater as also the degree of cold at the Poles But now I think friends we should be the better of a few hours sleep Who has charge of the stove It is my turn to night said Bell Well pray keep up a good fire for it is a perishing night Trust me for that said Bell But do look out the sky is all in a blaze Ay it is a magnificent aurora replied the Doctor going up to the window How beautiful I never tire gazing at it No more he ever did though his companions had become so used to such displays that they hardly noticed them now He soon followed the example of the others however and lay down on his bed beside the fire leaving Bell to mount guard CHAPTER X WINTER PLEASURES It is a dreary affair to live at the Pole for there is no going out for many long months and nothing to break the weary monotony The day after the hunting excursion was dark and snowy and Clawbonny could find no occupation except polishing up the ice walls of the hut as they became damp with the heat inside and emptying out the snow which drifted into the long passage leading to the inner door The Snow House stood out well defying storm and tempest and the snow only seemed to increase the thickness of the walls The storehouses too did not give way the least but though they were only a few yards off it was found necessary to lay in enough provisions for the day as very often the weather made it almost impossible to venture that short distance The unloading of the Porpoise turned out to have been a wise precaution for she was slowly but surely being crashed to pieces by the silent irresistible pressure around her Still the Doctor was always hoping enough planks might be sufficiently sound to construct a small vessel to convey them back to England but the right time to build had not come Illustration Illustration The five men were consequently compelled to spend the greater part of the day in complete idleness Hatteras lolled on his bed absorbed in thought Altamont smoked or dozed and the Doctor took care not to disturb either of them for he was in perpetual fear of a quarrel between them At meal times he always led the conversation away from irritating topics and sought as far as possible to instruct and interest all parties Whenever he was not engaged with the preparation of his notes he gave them dissertations on history geography or meteorology handling his subject in an easy though philosophical manner drawing lessons from the most trivial incidents His inexhaustible memory was never at a loss for fact or illustration when his good humour and geniality made him the life and soul of the little company He was implicitly trusted by all even by Hatteras who cherished a deep affection for him Yet no man felt the compulsory confinement more painfully than Clawbonny He longed ardently for the breaking up of the frost to resume his excursions though he dreaded the rivalry that might ensue between the two captains Yet things must come to a crisis soon or late and meantime he resolved to use his best endeavors to bring both parties to a better mind but to reconcile an American and an Englishman was no easy task He and Johnson had many a talk on the subject for the old sailor s views quite coincided with his own as to the difficult complications which awaited them in the future However the bad weather continued and leaving Fort Providence even for an hour was out of the question Day and night they were pent up in these glittering ice walls and time hung heavily on their hands at least on all but the Doctor s and he always managed to find some occupation for himself Illustration I declare said Altamont one evening life like this is not worth having We might as well be some of those reptiles that sleep all the winter But I suppose there is no help for it I am afraid not said the Doctor unfortunately we are too few in number to get up any amusement Then you think if there were more of us we should find more to do Of course when whole ships crews have wintered here they have managed to while away the time famously Well I must say I should like to know how It would need a vast amount of ingenuity to extract anything amusing out of our circumstances I suppose they did not play at charades No but they introduced the press and the theatre What They had a newspaper exclaimed the American They acted a comedy said Bell That they did said the Doctor When Parry wintered at Melville Island he started both amusements among his men and they met with great success Well I must confess I should like to have been there returned Johnson for it must have been rather curious work Curious and amusing too my good Johnson Lieutenant Beechey was the theatre manager and Captain Sabina chief editor of the newspaper called The Winter Chronicle or the Gazette of Northern Georgia Good titles said Altamont The newspaper appeared daily from the first of November eighteen nineteen to the twentieth of March eighteen twenty It reported the different excursions and hunting parties and accidents and adventures and published amusing stories No doubt the articles were not up to the Spectator or the Daily Telegraph but the readers were neither critical nor blase and found great pleasure in their perusal Illustration My word said Altamont I should like to read some of the articles Would you Well you shall judge for yourself What can you repeat them from memory No but you had Parry s Voyages on board the Porpoise and I can read you his own narrative if you like This proposition was so eagerly welcomed that the Doctor fetched the book forthwith and soon found the passage in question Here is a letter he said addressed to the editor Your proposition to establish a journal has been received by us with the greatest satisfaction I am convinced that under your direction it will be a great source of amusement and go a long way to lighten our hundred days of darkness The interest I take in the matter myself has led me to study the effect of your announcement on my comrades and I can testify to use reporter s language that the thing has produced an immense sensation The day after your prospectus appeared there was an unusual and unprecedented demand for ink among us and our green tablecloth was deluged with snippings and parings of quill pens to the injury of one of our servants who got a piece driven right under his nail I know for a fact that Sergeant Martin had no less than nine pen knives to sharpen It was quite a novel sight to see all the writing desks brought out which had not made their appearance for a couple of months and judging by the reams of paper visible more than one visit must have been made to the depths of the hold I must not forget to tell you that I believe attempts will be made to slip into your box sundry articles which are not altogether original as they have been published already I can declare that no later than last night I saw an author bending over his desk holding a volume of the Spectator open with one hand and thawing the frozen ink in his pen at the lamp with the other I need not warn you to be on your guard against such tricks for it would never do for us to have articles in our Winter Chronicle which our great grandfathers read over their breakfast tables a century ago Well well said Altamont there is a good deal of clever humour in that writer He must have been a sharp fellow You re right Here is an amusing catalogue of Arctic tribulations To go out in the morning for a walk and the moment you put your foot outside the ship find yourself immersed in the cook s water hole To go out hunting and fall in with a splendid reindeer take aim and find your gun has gone off with a flash in the pan owing to damp powder To set out on a march with a good supply of soft new bread in your pocket and discover when you want to eat that it has frozen so hard that you would break your teeth if you attempted to bite it through To rush from the table when it is reported that a wolf is in sight and on coming back to find the cat has eaten your dinner To be returning quietly home from a walk absorbed in profitable meditation and suddenly find yourself in the embrace of a bear We might supplement this list ourselves said the Doctor to almost any amount for there is a sort of pleasure in enumerating troubles when one has got the better of them I declare said Altamont this Winter Journal is an amusing affair I wish we could subscribe to it Suppose we start one said Johnson For us five exclaimed Clawbonny we might do for editors but there would not be readers enough No nor spectators enough if we tried to get up a comedy added Altamont Tell us some more about Captain Parry s theatre said Johnson did they play new pieces Certainly At first two volumes on board the Hecla were gone through but as there was a performance once a fortnight this repertoire was soon exhausted Then they had to improvise fresh plays Parry himself composed one which had immense success It was called The North West Passage or the End of the Voyage A famous title said Altamont but I must confess if I had chosen such a subject I should have been at a loss for the denouement You are right said Bell who can say what the end will be What does that matter replied mister Clawbonny Why should we trouble about the last act while the first ones are going on well Leave all that to Providence friends let us each play our own role as perfectly as we can and since the denouement belongs to the Great Author of all things we will trust his skill He will manage our affairs for us never fear Well we d better go and dream about it said Johnson for it s getting late and it is time we went to bed said Johnson You re in a great hurry old fellow replied the Doctor Why would you sit up mister Clawbonny I am so comfortable in my bed and then I always have such good dreams I dream invariably of hot countries so that I might almost say half my life is spent in the tropics and half at the North Pole You re a happy man Johnson said Altamont to be blessed with such a fortunate organization Indeed I am replied Johnson Well come after that it would be positive cruelty to keep our good friend pining here said the Doctor his tropical sun awaits him so let s all go to bed CHAPTER XI TRACES OF BEARS On the twenty sixth of April during the night there was a sudden change in the weather The thermometer fell several degrees and the inmates of Doctor s House could hardly keep themselves warm even in their beds Altamont had charge of the stove and he found it needed careful replenishing to preserve the temperature at fifty deg above zero This increase of cold betokened the cessation of the stormy weather and the Doctor hailed it gladly as the harbinger of his favourite hunting and exploring expeditions He rose early next morning and climbed up to the top of the cone The wind had shifted north the air was clear and the snow firm and smooth to the tread Before long the five companions had left Doctor s House and were busily engaged in clearing the heavy masses of snow off the roof and sides for the house was no longer distinguishable from the plateau as the snow had drifted to a depth of full fifteen feet It took two hours to remove the frozen snow and restore the architectural form of the dwelling At length the granite foundations appeared and the storehouses and powder magazines were once more accessible Illustration But as in so uncertain a climate a storm might cut off their supplies any day they wisely resolved to provide for any such emergency by carrying over a good stock of provisions to the kitchen and then Clawbonny Altamont and Bell started off with their guns in search of game for the want of fresh food began to be urgently felt The three companions went across the east side of the cone right down into the centre of the far stretching snow covered plain beneath but they did not need to go far for numerous traces of animals appeared on all sides within a circle of two miles round Fort Providence After gazing attentively at these traces for some minutes the hunters looked at each other silently and then the Doctor exclaimed Well these are plain enough I think Ay only too plain added Bell bears have been here First rate game said Altamont There s only one fault about it And what is that asked Bell What do you mean I mean this there are distinct traces of five bears and five bears are rather too much for five men Are you sure there are five said Clawbonny Look and see for yourself Here is one footprint and there is another quite different These claws are far wider apart than those and see here again that paw belongs to a much smaller bear I tell you if you look carefully you will see the marks of all five different bears distinctly You re right said Bell after a close inspection If that s the case then said the Doctor we must take care what we re about and not be foolhardy for these animals are starving after the severe winter and they might be extremely dangerous to encounter and since we are sure of their number And of their intentions too put in Altamont You think they have discovered our presence here No doubt of it unless we have got into a bear pass but then why should these footprints be in a circle round our fort Look these animals have come from the south east and stopped at this place and commenced to reconnoitre the coast Illustration You re right said the Doctor and what s more it is certain that they have been here last night And other nights before that replied Altamont I don t think so rejoined Clawbonny It is more likely that they waited till the cessation of the tempest and were on their way down to the bay intending to catch seals when they scented us Well we can easily find out if they come tonight said Altamont How By effacing all the marks in a given place and if to morrow we find fresh ones it will be evident that Fort Providence is the goal for which the bears are bound Illustration Very good at any rate we shall know then what we have to expect The three hunters set to work and scraped the snow over till all the footprints were obliterated for a considerable distance It is singular though said Bell that bears could scent us all that way off we have not been burning anything fat which might have attracted them Oh replied the Doctor bears are endowed with a wonderfully keen sense of smell and a piercing sight and more than that they are extremely intelligent almost more so than any other animal They have smelt something unusual and besides who can tell whether they have not even found their way as far as our plateau during the tempest But then why did they stop here last night asked Altamont Well that s a question I can t answer but there is no doubt they will continue narrowing their circles till they reach Fort Providence We shall soon see said Altamont And meantime we had best go on added the Doctor and keep a sharp look out But not a sign of anything living was visible and after a time they returned to the snow house Hatteras and Johnson were informed how matters stood and it was resolved to maintain a vigilant watch Night came but nothing disturbed its calm splendour nothing was heard to indicate approaching danger Next morning at early dawn Hatteras and his companions well armed went out to reconnoitre the state of the snow They found the same identical footmarks but somewhat nearer Evidently the enemy was bent on the siege of Fort Providence But where can the bears be said Bell Behind the icebergs watching us replied the Doctor Don t let us expose ourselves imprudently What about going hunting then asked Altamont We must put it off for a day or two I think and rub out the marks again and see if they are renewed to morrow The Doctor s advice was followed and they entrenched themselves for the present in the fort The lighthouse was taken down as it was not of actual use meantime and might help to attract the bears Each took it in turn to keep watch on the upper plateau The day passed without a sign of the enemy s existence and next morning when they hurried eagerly out to examine the snow judge their astonishment to find it wholly untouched Capital exclaimed Altamont The bears are put off the scent they have no perseverance and have grown tired waiting for us They are off and a good riddance Now let us start for a day s hunting Softly softly said the Doctor I m not so sure they have gone I think we had better wait one day more It is evident the bears have not been here last night at least on this side but still Well let us go right round the plateau and see how things stand said the impatient Altamont All right said Clawbonny Come along Away they went but it was impossible to scrutinize carefully a track of two miles and no trace of the enemy was discoverable Now then can t we go hunting said Altamont Wait till to morrow urged the Doctor again His friend was very unwilling to delay but yielded the point at last and returned to the fort Illustration As on the preceding night each man took his hour s watch on the upper plateau When it came to Altamont s turn and he had gone out to relieve Bell Hatteras called his old companions round him The Doctor left his desk and Johnson his cooking and hastened to their captain s side supposing he wanted to talk over their perilous situation but Hatteras never gave it a thought My friends he said let us take advantage of the American s absence to speak of business There are things which cannot concern him and with which I do not choose him to meddle Johnson and Clawbonny looked at each other wondering what the captain was driving at I wish he continued to talk with you about our plans for the future All right talk away while we are alone said the Doctor In a month or six weeks at the outside the time for making distant excursions will come again Have you thought of what we had better undertake in summer Have you captain asked Johnson Have I I may say that not an hour of my life passes without revolving in my mind my one cherished purpose I suppose not a man among you intends to retrace his steps No one replied and Hatteras went on to say For my own part even if I must go alone I will push on to the North Pole Never were men so near it before for we are not more than three hundred sixty miles distant at most and I will not lose such an opportunity without making every attempt to reach it even though it be an impossibility What are your views Doctor Your own Hatteras And yours Johnson Like the Doctor s And yours Bell Captain replied the carpenter it is true we have neither wives nor children waiting us in England but after all it is one s country one s native land Have you no thoughts of returning home We can return after we have discovered the Pole quite as well as before and even better Our difficulties will not increase for as we near the Pole we get away from the point of greatest cold We have fuel and provisions enough There is nothing to stop us and we should be culpable in my opinion if we allowed ourselves to abandon the project Very well captain I ll go along with you That s right I never doubted you said Hatteras We shall succeed and England will have all the glory But there is an American among us said Johnson Hatteras could not repress an impatient exclamation I know it he said in a stern voice We cannot leave him behind added the Doctor No we can t repeated Hatteras almost mechanically And he will be sure to go too Yes he will go too but who will command You captain And if you all obey my orders will the Yankee refuse I shouldn t think so but suppose he should what can be done He and I must fight it out then The three Englishmen looked at Hatteras but said nothing Then the Doctor asked how they were to go By the coast as far as possible was the reply But what if we find open water as is likely enough Well we ll go across it But we have no boat Hatteras did not answer and looked embarrassed Perhaps suggested Bell we might make a ship out of some of the planks of the Porpoise Never exclaimed Hatteras vehemently Never said Johnson The Doctor shook his head He understood the feeling of the captain Never reiterated Hatteras A boat made out of an American ship would be an American But captain began Johnson The Doctor made a sign to the old boatswain not to press the subject further and resolved in his own mind to reserve the question for discussion at a more opportune moment He managed to turn the conversation to other matters till it abruptly terminated by the entrance of Altamont This ended the day and the night passed quietly without the least disturbance The bears had evidently disappeared CHAPTER XII IMPRISONED IN DOCTOR S HOUSE The first business next day was to arrange for a hunt It was settled that Altamont Bell and Hatteras should form the party 
8664-295007-0001	train-other-500	while Clawbonny should go and explore as far as Isle Johnson and make some hydrographic notes and Johnson should remain behind to keep house The three hunters soon completed their preparations
8664-295007-0002	train-other-500	They armed themselves each with a double barrelled revolver and a rifle and took plenty of powder and shot Each man also carried in his belt his indispensable snow knife and hatchet
8664-295007-0003	train-other-500	and a small supply of pemmican in case night should surprise them before their return
none	none	 Thus equipped they could go far and might count on a good supply of game At eight o clock they started accompanied by Duk 
8664-295007-0004	train-other-500	who frisked and gambolled with delight They went up the hill to the east across the cone and down into the plain below The Doctor next took his departure after agreeing with Johnson on a signal of alarm in case of danger
none	none	 The old boatswain was left alone but he had plenty to do 
8664-295007-0005	train-other-500	He began by unfastening the Greenland dogs and letting them out for a run after their long wearisome confinement Then he attended to divers housekeeping matters He had to replenish the stock of combustibles and provisions
8664-295007-0006	train-other-500	to arrange the store houses to mend several broken utensils to repair the rents in coverlets and get new shoes ready for summer excursions There was no lack of work
none	none	 and the old sailor s nimble clever fingers could do anything Illustration While his hands were busy his mind was occupied with the conversation of the preceding evening 
8664-295007-0007	train-other-500	He thought with regret over the captain s obstinacy and yet he felt that there was something grand and even heroic in his determination that neither an American nor an American ship should first touch the Pole
8664-295007-0008	train-other-500	The hunters had been gone about an hour when Johnson suddenly heard the report of a gun Capital he exclaimed They have found something and pretty quickly too for me to hear their guns so distinctly The atmosphere must be very clear
none	none	 A second and a third shot followed Bravo again exclaimed the boatswain they must have fallen in luck s way Illustration Hatteras could only manage to keep off his pursuers by flinging down one article after another P one hundred twenty But when three more shots came in rapid succession the old man turned pale and a horrible thought crossed his mind which made him rush out and climb hastily to the top of the cone He shuddered at the sight which met his eyes The three hunters followed by Duk were tearing home at full speed 
8664-295007-0009	train-other-500	followed by the five huge bears Their six balls had evidently taken no effect and the terrible monsters were close on their heels Hatteras who brought up the rear
8664-295007-0010	train-other-500	could only manage to keep off his pursuers by flinging down one article after another first his cap then his hatchet and finally his gun
8664-295007-0011	train-other-500	He knew that the inquisitive bears would stop and examine every object sniffing all round it and this gave him a little time otherwise he could not have escaped for these animals outstrip the fleetest horse
8664-295007-0012	train-other-500	and one monster was so near that Hatteras had to brandish his knife vigorously to ward off a tremendous blow of his paw At last though panting and out of breath the three men reached Johnson safely
8664-295007-0013	train-other-500	and slid down the rock with him into the snow house The bears stopped short on the upper plateau and Hatteras and his companions lost no time in barring and barricading them out Here we are at last exclaimed Hatteras
8664-295007-0014	train-other-500	we can defend ourselves better now It is five against five Four said Johnson in a frightened voice How The Doctor replied Johnson pointing to the empty sitting room Well
8664-295007-0015	train-other-500	he is in Isle Johnson A bad job for him said Bell But we can t leave him to his fate in this fashion said Altamont No
none	none	 let s be off to find him at once replied Hatteras Illustration He opened the door but soon shut it narrowly escaping a bear s hug 
8664-295007-0016	train-other-500	They are there he exclaimed All asked Bell The whole pack Altamont rushed to the windows and began to fill up the deep embrasure with blocks of ice which he broke off the walls of the house
8664-295007-0017	train-other-500	His companions followed his example silently
none	none	 Not a sound was heard but the low deep growl of Duk 
8664-295007-0018	train-other-500	To tell the simple truth however it was not their own danger that occupied their thoughts but their absent friend the Doctor s It was for him they trembled not for themselves Poor Clawbonny
8664-295007-0019	train-other-500	so good and devoted as he had been to every member of the little colony This was the first time they had been separated from him Extreme peril and most likely a frightful death awaited him
8664-295007-0020	train-other-500	for he might return unsuspectingly to Fort Providence
none	none	 and find himself in the power of these ferocious animals Illustration And yet said Johnson 
8664-295007-0021	train-other-500	unless I am much mistaken he must be on guard Your repeated shots cannot but have warned him He must surely be aware that something unusual has happened But suppose he was too far away to hear them replied Altamont
8664-295007-0022	train-other-500	or has not understood the cause of them It is ten chances to one but he ll come quickly back never imagining the danger The bears are screened from sight by the crag completely
8664-295007-0023	train-other-500	We must get rid of them before he comes said Hatteras
none	none	 But how asked Bell Illustration It was difficult to reply to this for a sortie was out of the question 
8664-295007-0024	train-other-500	They had taken care to barricade the entrance passage but the bears could easily find a way in if they chose So it was thought advisable to keep a close watch on their movements outside by listening attentively in each room
8664-295007-0025	train-other-500	so as to be able to resist all attempts at invasion They could hear them distinctly prowling about growling and scraping the walls with their enormous paws However some action must be taken speedily
8664-295007-0026	train-other-500	for time was passing Altamont resolved to try a port hole through which he might fire on his assailants He had soon scooped out a hole in the wall but his gun was hardly pushed through when it was seized with irresistible force
8664-295007-0027	train-other-500	and wrested from his grasp before he could even fire Confound it he exclaimed we re no match for them And he hastened to stop up the breach as fast as possible This state of things had lasted upwards of an hour
8664-295007-0028	train-other-500	and there seemed no prospect of a termination The question of a sortie began now to be seriously discussed There was little chance of success as the bears could not be attacked separately
8664-295007-0029	train-other-500	but Hatteras and his companions had grown so impatient and it must be confessed were also so much ashamed of being kept in prison by beasts that they would even have dared the risk if the captain had not suddenly thought of a new mode of defence
8664-295007-0030	train-other-500	He took Johnson s furnace poker and thrust it into the stove while he made an opening in the snow wall or rather a partial opening for he left a thin sheet of ice on the outer side As soon as the poker was red hot
8664-295007-0031	train-other-500	he said to his comrades who stood eagerly watching him wondering what he was going to do This red hot bar will keep off the bears when they try to get hold of it and we shall be able easily to fire across it without letting them snatch away our guns
8664-295007-0032	train-other-500	A good idea said Bell posting himself beside Altamont Hatteras withdrew the poker and instantly plunged it in the wall The melting snow made a loud hissing noise and two bears ran and made a snatch at the glowing bar
8664-295007-0033	train-other-500	but they fell back with a terrible howl and at the same moment four shots resounded one after the other Hit exclaimed Altamont Hit echoed Bell Let us repeat the dose said Hatteras carefully stopping up the opening meantime
8664-295007-0034	train-other-500	The poker was again thrust into the fire and in a few minutes was ready for Hatteras to recommence operations Altamont and Bell reloaded their guns and took their places but this time the poker would not pass through
none	none	 Confound the beasts exclaimed the impetuous American 
8664-295007-0035	train-other-500	What s the matter asked Johnson What s the matter Why those plaguey animals are piling up block after block intending to bury us alive Impossible Look for yourself
8664-295007-0036	train-other-500	the poker can t get through I declare it is getting absurd now It was worse than absurd it was alarming Things grew worse It was evident that the bears meant to stifle their prey
8664-295007-0037	train-other-500	for the sagacious animals were heaping up huge masses which would make escape impossible It is too bad said old Johnson with a mortified look One might put up with men but
none	none	 bears Illustration Two hours elapsed without bringing any relief to the prisoners 
8664-295007-0038	train-other-500	to go out was impossible and the thick walls excluded all sound Altamont walked impatiently up and down full of exasperation and excitement at finding himself worsted for once Hatteras could think of nothing but the Doctor
none	none	 and of the serious peril which threatened him Illustration Oh if mister Clawbonny were only here said Johnson 
8664-295007-0039	train-other-500	What could he do asked Altamont Oh he d manage to get us out somehow How pray said the American crossly If I knew that I should not need him However I know what his advice just now would be
8664-295007-0040	train-other-500	What To take some food that can t hurt us
none	none	 What do you say mister Altamont 
8664-295007-0041	train-other-500	Oh let s eat by all means if that will please you though we re in a ridiculous not to say humiliating plight I ll bet you we ll find a way out after dinner
none	none	 No one replied but they seated themselves round the table Illustration Johnson trained in Clawbonny s school 
8664-295007-0042	train-other-500	tried to be brave and unconcerned about the danger but he could scarcely manage it His jokes stuck in his throat Moreover the whole party began to feel uncomfortable The atmosphere was getting dense
8664-295007-0043	train-other-500	for every opening was hermetically sealed The stoves would hardly draw and it was evident would soon go out altogether for want of oxygen Hatteras was the first to see their fresh danger and he made no attempt to hide it from his companions
8664-295007-0044	train-other-500	If that is the case said Altamont we must get out at all risks Yes replied Hatteras but let us wait till night We will make a hole in the roof and let in a provision of air and then one of us can fire out of it on the bears
8664-295007-0045	train-other-500	It is the only thing we can do I suppose said Altamont So it was agreed but waiting was hard work and Altamont could not refrain from giving vent to his impatience by thundering maledictions on the bears
8664-295007-0046	train-other-500	and abusing the ill fate which had placed them in such an awkward and humbling predicament
none	none	 It was beasts versus men he said and certainly the men cut a pretty figure CHAPTER XIII THE MINE Night drew on and the lamp in the sitting room already began to burn dim for want of oxygen At eight o clock the final arrangements were completed and all that remained to do was to make an opening in the roof They had been working away at this for some minutes and Bell was showing himself quite an adept in the business when Johnson who had been keeping watch in the sleeping room came hurriedly in to his companions pulling such a long face that the captain asked immediately what was the matter Nothing exactly said the old sailor and yet Come out with it exclaimed Altamont Hush don t you hear a peculiar noise Where Here on this side on the wall of the room Bell stopped working and listened attentively like the rest Johnson was right a noise there certainly was on the side wall as if some one were cutting the ice Don t you hear it repeated Johnson Hear it Yes plain enough replied Altamont Is it the bears asked Bell Most assuredly Well they have changed their tactics said old Johnson and given up the idea of suffocating us Or may be they suppose we are suffocated by now suggested the American getting furious at his invisible enemies They are going to attack us said Bell Well what of it returned Hatteras We shall have a hand to hand struggle that s all And so much the better added Altamont that s far more to my taste I have had enough of invisible foes let me see my antagonist and then I can fight him Ay said Johnson but not with guns They would be useless here With knife and hatchet then returned the American The noise increased and it was evident that the point of attack was the angle of the wall formed by its junction with the cliff They are hardly six feet off now said the boatswain Right Johnson replied Altamont but we have time enough to be ready for them And seizing a hatchet he placed himself in fighting attitude planting his right foot firmly forward and throwing himself back Hatteras and the others followed his example and Johnson took care to load a gun in case of necessity Every minute the sound came nearer till at last only a thin coating separated them from their assailants Presently this gave way with a loud crack and a huge dark mass rolled over into the room Altamont had already swung his hatchet to strike when he was arrested by a well known voice exclaiming For Heaven s sake stop The Doctor the Doctor cried Johnson And the Doctor it actually was who had tumbled in among them in such undignified fashion How do ye do good friends he said picking himself smartly up His companions stood stupefied for a moment but joy soon loosened their tongues and each rushed eagerly forward to welcome his old comrade with a loving embrace Hatteras was for once fairly overcome with emotion and positively hugged him like a child And is it really you mister Clawbonny said Johnson Myself and nobody else my old fellow I assure you I have been far more uneasy about you than you could have been about me But how did you know we had been attacked by a troop of bears asked Altamont What we were most afraid of was that you would come quickly back to Fort Providence never dreaming of danger Oh I saw it all Your repeated shots gave me the alarm When you commenced firing I was beside the wreck of the Porpoise but I climbed up a hummock and discovered five bears close on your heels Oh how anxious I was for you But when I saw you disappear down the cliff while the bears stood hesitating on the edge as if uncertain what to do I felt sure that you had managed to get safely inside the house and barricade it I crept cautiously nearer sometimes going on all fours sometimes slipping between great blocks of ice till I came at last quite close to our fort and then I found the bears working away like beavers They were prowling about the snow and dragging enormous blocks of ice towards the house piling them up like a wall evidently intending to bury you alive It is a lucky thing they did not take it into their heads to dash down the blocks from the summit of the cone for you must have been crushed inevitably But what danger you were in mister Clawbonny said Bell Any moment they might have turned round and attacked you They never thought of it even Johnson s Greenland dogs came in sight several times but they did not take the trouble to go after them No they imagined themselves sure of a more savoury supper Thanks for the compliment said Altamont laughing Oh there is nothing to be proud of When I saw what the bears were up to I determined to get back to you by some means or other I waited till night but as soon as it got dark I glided noiselessly along towards the powder magazine I had my reasons for choosing that point from which to work my way hither and I speedily commenced operations with my snow knife A famous tool it is For three mortal hours I have been hacking and heaving away but here I am at last tired enough and starving but still safe here To share our fate said Altamont No to save you all but for any sake give me a biscuit and a bit of meat for I feel sinking for want of food A substantial meal was soon before him but the vivacious little man could talk all the while he was eating and was quite ready to answer any questions Did you say to save us asked Bell Most assuredly was the reply Well certainly if you found your way in we can find our way out by the same road A likely story and leave the field clear for the whole pack to come in and find out our stores Pretty havoc they would make No we must stay here said Hatteras Of course we must replied Clawbonny but we ll get rid of the bears for all that I told you so said Johnson rubbing his hands I knew nothing was hopeless if mister Clawbonny was here he has always some expedient in his wise head My poor head is very empty I fear but by dint of rummaging perhaps I Doctor interrupted Altamont I suppose there is no fear of the bears getting in by the passage you have made No I took care to stop up the opening thoroughly and now we can reach the powder magazine without letting them see us All right and now will you let us have your plan of getting rid of these comical assailants Illustration My plan is quite simple and part of the work is done already What do you mean You shall see But I am forgetting that I brought a companion with me What do you say said Johnson I have a companion to introduce to you replied the Doctor going out again into the passage and bringing back a dead fox newly killed I shot it this morning he continued and never did fox come more opportunely What on earth do you mean asked Altamont I mean to blow up the bears en masse with one hundred lbs of powder But where is the powder exclaimed his friend In the magazine This passage will lead to it I made it purposely And where is the mine to be inquired Altamont At the furthest point from the house and stores And how will you manage to entice the bears there all to one spot I ll undertake that business but we have talked enough let us set to work We have a hundred feet more to add to our passage to night and that is no easy matter but as there are five of us we can take turns at it Bell will begin and we will lie down and sleep meantime Well really said Johnson the more I think of it the more feasible seems the Doctor s plan It is a sure one anyway said Clawbonny So sure that I can feel the bear s fur already on my shoulder Well come let s begin then Away he went into the gloomy passage followed by Bell and in a few moments they had reached the powder magazine and stood among the well arranged barrels The Doctor pointed out to his companion the exact spot where he began excavating and then left him to his task at which he laboured diligently for about an hour when Altamont came to relieve him All the snow he had dug out was taken to the kitchen and melted to prevent its taking up room The captain succeeded Altamont and was followed by Johnson In ten hours that is to say about eight in the morning the gallery was entirely open Illustration With the first streak of day the Doctor was up to reconnoitre the position of the enemy The patient animals were still occupying their old position prowling up and down and growling The house had already almost disappeared beneath the piled up blocks of ice but even while he gazed a council of war seemed being held which evidently resulted in the determination to alter the plan of action for suddenly all the five bears began vigorously to pull down these same heaped up blocks What are they about asked Hatteras who was standing beside him Well they look to me to be bent on demolishing their own work and getting right down to us as fast as possible but wait a bit my gentlemen we ll demolish you first However we have not a minute to lose Hastening away to the mine he had the chamber where the powder was to be lodged enlarged the whole breadth and height of the sloping rock against which the wall leaned till the upper part was about a foot thick and had to be propped up to prevent its falling in A strong stake was fixed firmly on the granite foundation on the top of which the dead fox was fastened A rope was attached to the lower part of the stake sufficiently long to reach the powder stores This is the bait he said pointing to the dead fox and here is the mine he added rolling in a keg of powder containing about one hundred lbs But Doctor said Hatteras won t that blow us up too as well as the bears No we shall be too far from the scene of explosion Besides our house is solid and we can soon repair the walls even if they should get a bit shaken And how do you propose to manage asked Altamont See By hauling in this rope we lower the post which props up the roof and make it give way and bring up the dead fox to light and I think you will agree with me that the bears are so famished with their long fasting that they won t lose much time in rushing towards their unexpected meal Well just at that very moment I shall set fire to the mine and blow up both the guests and the meal Capital Capital shouted Johnson who had been listening with intense interest Illustration Hatteras said nothing for he had such absolute confidence in his friend that he wanted no further explanation But Altamont must know the why and wherefore of everything But Doctor he said can you reckon on your match so exactly that you can be quite sure it will fire the mine at the right moment I don t need to reckon at all that s a difficulty easily got over Then you have a match a hundred feet long No You are simply going to lay a train of powder No that might miss fire Well there is no way then but for one of us to devote his life to the others and go and light the powder himself I m ready said Johnson eagerly ready and willing Quite useless my brave fellow replied the Doctor holding out his hand All our lives are precious and they will be all spared thank God Well I give it up said the American I ll make no more guesses I should like to know what is the good of learning physics said the Doctor smiling if they can t help a man at a pinch like this Haven t we an electric battery and long enough lines attached to it to serve our purpose We can fire our mine whenever we please in an instant and without the slightest danger Hurrah exclaimed Johnson Hurrah echoed the others without heeding whether the enemy heard them or not The Doctor s idea was immediately carried out and the connecting lines uncoiled and laid down from the house to the chamber of the mine one end of each remaining attached to the electric pile and the other inserted into the keg of powder By nine o clock everything was ready It was high time for the bears were furiously engaged in the work of demolition Johnson was stationed in the powder magazine in charge of the cord which held the bait Now said Clawbonny to his companions load your guns in case our assailants are not killed Stand beside Johnson and the moment the explosion is over rush out Illustration All right said Altamont And now we have done all we can to help ourselves So may Heaven help us Hatteras Altamont and Bell repaired to the powder magazine while the Doctor remained alone beside the pile Soon he heard Johnson s voice in the distance calling out Ready All right was the reply Johnson pulled his rope vigorously and then rushed to the loop hole to see the effect The thin shell of ice had given way and the body of the fox lay among the ruins The bears were somewhat scared at first but the next minute had eagerly rushed to seize the booty Fire called out Johnson and at once the electric spark was sent along the lines right into the keg of powder A formidable explosion ensued the house was shaken as if by an earthquake and the walls cracked asunder Hatteras Altamont and Bell hurried out with the guns but they might spare their shot for four of the bears lay dead and the fifth half roasted though alive was scampering away in terror as fast as his legs could carry him Hurrah Three cheers for Clawbonny they shouted and overwhelmed the Doctor with plaudits and thanks CHAPTER XIV AN ARCTIC SPRING 
8765-295009-0000	train-other-500	The prisoners were free and their joy found vent in the noisiest demonstrations They employed the rest of the day in repairing the house which had suffered greatly by the explosion They cleared away the blocks piled up by the animals
8765-295009-0001	train-other-500	and filled up the rents in the walls working with might and main enlivened by the many songs of old Johnson Next morning there was a singular rise in the temperature
none	none	 the thermometer going up to fifteen deg above zero This comparative heat lasted several days In sheltered spots the glass rose as high as thirty one deg 
8765-295009-0002	train-other-500	and symptoms of a thaw appeared The ice began to crack here and there and jets of salt water were thrown up like fountains in an English park
8765-295009-0003	train-other-500	A few days later the rain fell in torrents Thick vapour rose from the snow giving promise of the speedy disappearance of these immense masses The sun s pale disc became deeper in colour and remained longer above the horizon
none	none	 The night was scarcely longer than three hours Illustration Other tokens of spring s approach were manifest of equal significance 
8765-295009-0004	train-other-500	the birds were returning in flocks and the air resounded with their deafening cries
none	none	 Hares were seen on the shores of the bay and mice in such abundance that their burrows completely honeycombed the ground Illustration The Doctor drew the attention of his companions to the fact 
8765-295009-0005	train-other-500	that almost all these animals were beginning to lose their white winter dress and would soon put on summer attire while nature was already providing mosses and poppies
none	none	 and saxifragas and short grass for their sustenance A new world lay beneath that melting snow 
8765-295009-0006	train-other-500	But with these inoffensive animals came back their natural enemies Foxes and wolves arrived in search of their prey and dismal howls broke the silence of the short night Arctic wolves closely resemble dogs
8765-295009-0007	train-other-500	and their barking would deceive the most practised ears even the canine race themselves have been deceived by it Indeed it seems as if the wily animals employed this ruse to attract the dogs and make them their prey
8765-295009-0008	train-other-500	Several navigators have mentioned the fact and the Doctor s own experience confirmed it Johnson took care not to let his Greenlanders loose of Duk there was little fear nothing could take him in For about a fortnight
8765-295009-0009	train-other-500	hunting was the principal occupation There was an abundant supply of fresh meat to be had They shot partridges ptarmigans and snow ortolans which are delicious eating The hunters never went far from Fort Providence
8765-295009-0010	train-other-500	for game was so plentiful that it seemed waiting their guns and the whole bay presented an animated appearance The thaw meanwhile was making rapid progress
none	none	 The thermometer stood steadily at thirty two deg above zero 
8765-295009-0011	train-other-500	and the water ran down the mountain sides in cataracts and dashed in torrents through the ravines The Doctor lost no time in clearing about an acre of ground in which he sowed the seeds of anti scorbutic plants
none	none	 He just had the pleasure of seeing tiny little green leaves begin to sprout 
8765-295009-0012	train-other-500	when the cold returned in full force
none	none	 In a single night the thermometer lost nearly forty deg it went down to eight deg below zero 
8765-295009-0013	train-other-500	Everything was frozen birds quadrupeds amphibia disappeared as if by magic seal holes reclosed and the ice once more became hard as granite The change was most striking
8765-295009-0014	train-other-500	it occurred on the eighteenth of May during the night The Doctor was rather disappointed at having all his work to do again but Hatteras bore the grievance most unphilosophically
none	none	 as it interfered with all his plans of speedy departure Illustration Do you think we shall have a long spell of this weather mister Clawbonny asked Johnson 
8765-295009-0015	train-other-500	No my friend I don t it is a last blow from the cold You see these are his dominions and he won t be driven out without making some resistance He can defend himself pretty well said Bell rubbing his face Yes but I ought to have waited
8765-295009-0016	train-other-500	and not have wasted my seed like an ignoramus
none	none	 and all the more as I could if necessary have made them sprout by the kitchen stoves 
8765-295009-0017	train-other-500	But do you mean to say asked Altamont that you might have anticipated the sudden change Of course and without being a wizard
none	none	 I ought to have put my seed under the protection of Saint Paucratius 
8765-295009-0018	train-other-500	and the other two saints whose fete days fall this month Absurd Pray tell me what they have to do with it What influence can they possibly have on the temperature
8765-295009-0019	train-other-500	An immense one if we are to believe horticulturists who call them the patron saints of the frost And for what reason Because generally there is a periodical frost in the month of May and it is coldest from the eleventh to the thirteenth
8765-295009-0020	train-other-500	That is the fact And how is it explained In two ways Some say that a larger number of asteroids come between the earth and the sun at this time of year
8765-295009-0021	train-other-500	and others that the mere melting of the snow necessarily absorbs a large amount of heat and accounts for the low temperature Both theories are plausible enough but the fact remains whichever we accept
none	none	 and I ought to have remembered it 
8765-295009-0022	train-other-500	The Doctor was right for the cold lasted till the end of the month and put an end to all their hunting expeditions
none	none	 The old monotonous life in doors recommenced and was unmarked by any incident except a serious illness which suddenly attacked Bell 
8765-295009-0023	train-other-500	This was violent quinsy but under the Doctor s skilful treatment it was soon cured Ice was the only remedy he employed administered in small pieces
none	none	 and in twenty four hours Bell was himself again Illustration During this compulsory leisure 
8765-295009-0024	train-other-500	Clawbonny determined to have a talk with the captain on an important subject the building of a sloop out of the planks of the Porpoise The Doctor hardly knew how to begin as Hatteras had declared so vehemently that he would never consent to use a morsel of American wood
8765-295009-0025	train-other-500	yet it was high time he were brought to reason as June was at hand the only season for distant expeditions and they could not start without a ship He thought over it a long while and at last drew the captain aside and said in the kindest gentlest way
none	none	 Hatteras do you believe I m your friend 
8765-295009-0026	train-other-500	Most certainly I do replied the captain earnestly my best indeed my only friend And if I give you a piece of advice without your asking will you consider my motive is perfectly disinterested
8765-295009-0027	train-other-500	Yes for I know you have never been actuated by self interest But what are you driving at
none	none	 Wait Hatteras I have one thing more to ask 
8765-295009-0028	train-other-500	Do you look on me as a true hearted Englishman like yourself anxious for his country s glory Hatteras looked surprised but simply said I do
none	none	 You desire to reach the North Pole the Doctor went on 
8765-295009-0029	train-other-500	and I understand and share your ambition but to achieve your object you must employ the right means Well and have I not sacrificed everything for it No Hatteras you have not sacrificed your personal antipathies
none	none	 Even at this very moment I know you are in the mood to refuse the indispensable conditions of reaching the pole 
8765-295009-0030	train-other-500	Ah it is the boat you want to talk about and that man Hatteras let us discuss the question calmly and examine the case on all sides The coast on which we find ourselves at present may terminate abruptly
8765-295009-0031	train-other-500	we have no proof that it stretches right away to the pole indeed if your present information prove correct we ought to come to an open sea during the summer months Well supposing we reach this Arctic Ocean and find it free from ice and easy to navigate
8765-295009-0032	train-other-500	what shall we do if we have no ship Hatteras made no reply Tell me now would you like to find yourself only a few miles from the pole and not be able to get to it Hatteras still said nothing but buried his head in his hands
8765-295009-0033	train-other-500	Besides continued the Doctor look at the question in its moral aspect Here is an Englishman who sacrifices his fortune and even his life to win fresh glory for his country
8765-295009-0034	train-other-500	but because the boat which bears him across an unknown ocean or touches the new shore happens to be made of the planks of an American vessel a cast away wreck of no use to anyone will that lessen the honour of the discovery
none	none	 If you yourself had found the hull of some wrecked vessel lying deserted on the shore would you have hesitated to make use of it 
8765-295009-0035	train-other-500	and must not a sloop built by four Englishmen and manned by four Englishmen be English from keel to gunwale Hatteras was still silent No continued Clawbonny the real truth is it is not the sloop you care about it is the man
none	none	 Yes Doctor yes replied the captain It is this American I detest 
8765-295009-0036	train-other-500	I hate him with a thorough English hatred Fate has thrown him in my path To save you To ruin me He seems to defy me and speaks as if he were lord and master
8765-295009-0037	train-other-500	He thinks he has my destiny in his hands and knows all my projects Didn t we see the man in his true colours when we were giving names to the different coasts Has he ever avowed his object in coming so far north
none	none	 You will never get out of my head that this man is not the leader of some expedition sent out by the American government 
8765-295009-0038	train-other-500	Well Hatteras suppose it is so does it follow that this expedition is to search for the North Pole May it not be to find the North West Passage But anyway
8765-295009-0039	train-other-500	Altamont is in complete ignorance of our object for neither Johnson nor Bell nor myself have ever breathed a word to him about it and I am sure you have not Well let him always remain so He must be told in the end for we can t leave him here alone Why not
8765-295009-0040	train-other-500	Can t he stay here in Fort Providence He would never consent to that Hatteras and moreover to leave a man in that way and not know whether we might find him safe when we came back would be worse than imprudent it would be inhuman Altamont will come with us
8765-295009-0041	train-other-500	he must come But we need not disclose our projects let us tell him nothing but simply build a sloop for the ostensible purpose of making a survey of the coast Hatteras could not bring himself to consent but said
8765-295009-0042	train-other-500	And suppose the man won t allow his ship to be cut up In that case you must take the law in your own hands and build a vessel in spite of him I wish to goodness he would refuse then He must be asked before he can refuse
none	none	 I ll undertake the asking said Clawbonny 
8765-295009-0043	train-other-500	He kept his word for that very same night at supper he managed to turn the conversation towards the subject of making excursions during summer for hydrographical purposes You will join us I suppose Altamont he said Of course replied the American
8765-295009-0044	train-other-500	We must know how far New America extends Hatteras looked fixedly at his rival but said nothing
none	none	 And for that purpose continued Altamont we had better build a little ship out of the remains of the Porpoise It is the best possible use we can make of her You hear Bell said the Doctor eagerly We ll all set to work to morrow morning Illustration The carpenter began his task immediately P one hundred fifty four CHAPTER XV THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE Next morning Altamont Bell and the Doctor repaired to the Porpoise There was no lack of wood for shattered as the old three master had been by the icebergs she could still supply the principal parts of a new ship and the carpenter began his task immediately In the end of May the temperature again rose and spring returned for good and all Rain fell copiously and before long the melting snow was running down every little slope in falls and cascades Hatteras could not contain his delight at these signs of a general thaw among the ice fields for an open sea would bring him liberty At last he might hope to ascertain for himself whether his predecessors were correct in their assertions about a polar basin This was a frequent topic of thought and conversation with him and one evening when he was going over all the old familiar arguments in support of his theory Altamont took up the subject and declared his opinion that the polar basin extended west as well as east But it was impossible for the American and Englishman to talk long about anything without coming to words so intensely national were both doctor Kane was the first bone of contention on this occasion for the jealous Englishman was unwilling to grant his rival the glory of being a discoverer alleging his belief that though the brave adventurer had gone far north it was by mere chance he had made a discovery Illustration Chance interrupted Altamont hotly Do you mean to assert that it is not to Kane s energy and science that we owe his great discovery I mean to say that doctor Kane s name is not worth mentioning in a country made illustrious by such names as Parry and Franklin and Ross and Belcher and Penny in a country where the seas opened the North West Passage to an Englishman McClure McClure exclaimed the American Well if ever chance favoured anyone it was that McClure Do you pretend to deny it I do said Hatteras becoming quite excited It was his courage and perseverance in remaining four whole winters among the ice I believe that don t I said Altamont sneeringly He was caught among the bergs and could not get away but didn t he after all abandon his ship the Investigator and try to get back home Besides putting the man aside what is the value of his discovery I maintain that the North West Passage is still undiscovered for not a single ship to this day has ever sailed from Behring s Straits to Baffin s Bay The fact was indisputable but Hatteras started to his feet and said I will not permit the honour of an English captain to be attacked in my presence any longer You will not permit echoed Altamont also springing erect But these are facts and it is out of your power to destroy them Sir shouted Hatteras pale with rage My friends interposed the Doctor pray be calm This is a scientific point we are discussing But Hatteras was deaf to reason now and said angrily I ll tell you the facts sir And I ll tell you retorted the irate American Gentlemen said Clawbonny in a firm tone allow me to speak for I know the facts of the case as well as and perhaps better than you and I can state them impartially Illustration Yes yes cried Bell and Johnson who had been anxiously watching the strife Well go on said Altamont finding himself in the minority while Hatteras simply made a sign of acquiescence and resumed his seat The Doctor brought a chart and spread it out on the table that his auditors might follow his narration intelligibly and be able to judge the merits of McClure for themselves It was in eighteen forty eight he said that two vessels the Herald and the Plover were sent out in search of Franklin but their efforts proving ineffectual two others were despatched to assist them the Investigator in command of McClure and the Enterprise in command of Captain Collison The Investigator arrived first in Behring s Straits and without waiting for her consort set out with the declared purpose to find Franklin or the North West Passage The gallant young officer hoped to push north as far as Melville Sound but just at the extremity of the Strait he was stopped by an insurmountable barrier of ice and forced to winter there During the long dreary months however he and his officers undertook a journey over the ice field to make sure of its communicating with Melville Sound Yes but he did not get through said Altamont Stop a bit replied Clawbonny as soon as a thaw set in McClure renewed his attempt to bring his ship into Melville Sound and had succeeded in getting within twenty miles when contrary winds set in and dragged her south with irresistible violence This decided the captain to alter his course He determined to go in a westerly direction but after a fearful struggle with icebergs he stuck fast in the first of the series of straits Illustration which end in Baffin s Bay and was obliged to winter in Mercy Bay His provisions would only hold out eighteen months longer but he would not give up He set out on a sledge and reached Melville Island hoping to fall in with some ship or other but all he found in Winter Harbour was a cairn which contained a document stating that Captain Austin s lieutenant McClintock had been there the preceding year McClure replaced this document by another which stated his intention of returning to England by the North West Passage he had discovered by Lancaster Sound and Baffin s Bay and that in the event of his not being heard of he might be looked for north or west of Melville Island Then he went back to Mercy Bay with undaunted courage to pass a third winter By the beginning of March his stock of provisions was so reduced in consequence of the utter scarcity of game through the severity of the season that McClure resolved to send half his men to England either by Baffin s Bay or by McKenzie River and Hudson s Bay The other half would manage to work the vessel to Europe He kept all his best sailors and selected for departure only those to whom a fourth winter would have been fatal Everything was arranged for their leaving and the day fixed when McClure who was out walking with Lieutenant Craswell observed a man running towards them flinging up his arms and gesticulating frantically and on getting nearer recognized him as Lieutenant Prim officer on board the Herald one of the ships he had parted with in Behring s Straits two years before Captain Kellett the Commander had reached Winter Harbour and finding McClure s document in the cairn had dispatched his lieutenant in search of him McClure accompanied him back and arranged with the captain to send him his batch of invalids Lieutenant Craswell took charge of these and conveyed them safely to Winter Harbour Leaving them there he went across the ice four hundred and seventy miles and arrived at Isle Beechy where a few days afterwards he took passage with twelve men on board the Phoenix and reached London safely on the seventh of October eighteen fifty three having traversed the whole extent between Behring s Straits and Cape Farewell Well if arriving on one side and leaving at the other is not going through I don t know what is said Hatteras Yes but he went four hundred and seventy miles over ice fields objected Altamont What of that Everything that is the gist of the whole argument It was not the Investigator that went through No replied Clawbonny for at the close of the fourth winter McClure was obliged to leave her among the ice Well in maritime expeditions the vessel has to get through and not the man and if ever the Northwest Passage is practicable it will be for ships and not sledges If a ship cannot go a sloop must A sloop exclaimed Hatteras discovering a hidden meaning in the words Altamont said the Doctor your distinction is simply puerile and in that respect we all consider that you are in the wrong You may easily do that returned the American It is four against one but that will not prevent me from holding my own opinion Keep it and welcome but keep it to yourself if you please for the future exclaimed Hatteras And pray what right have you to speak to me like this sir shouted Altamont in a fury My right as captain returned Hatteras equally angry Am I to submit to your orders then Most assuredly and woe to you if Illustration The Doctor did not allow him to proceed for he really feared the two antagonists might come to blows P one hundred sixty two The Doctor did not allow him to proceed for he really feared the two antagonists might come to blows Bell and Johnson seconded his endeavours to make peace and after a few conciliatory words Altamont turned on his heel and walked carelessly away whistling Yankee Doodle Hatteras went outside and paced up and down with rapid strides In about an hour he came back and retired to bed without saying another word CHAPTER XVI ARCTIC ARCADIA On the twenty ninth of May for the first time the sun never set His glowing disc just touched the boundary line of the horizon and rose again immediately The period was now entered when the day lasts twenty four hours Next morning there was a magnificent halo the monarch of day appeared surrounded by a luminous circle radiant with all the prismatic colours This phenomenon never lost its charm for the Doctor however frequently it occurred and he always noted carefully down all particulars respecting it Before long the feathered tribes began to return filling the air with their discordant cries Flocks of bustards and Canadian geese from Florida or Arkansas came flying north with marvellous rapidity bringing spring beneath their wings The Doctor shot several and among them one or two cranes and a solitary stork The snow was now fast melting and the ice fields were covered with slush All round the bay large pools had formed between which the soil appeared as if some product of spring The Doctor recommenced his sowing for he had plenty of seed but he was surprised to find sorrel growing already between the half dried stones and even pale sickly heaths trying to show their delicate pink blossoms At last it began to be really hot weather On the fifteenth of June the thermometer stood at fifty seven deg above zero The Doctor scarcely believed his eyes but it was a positive fact and it was soon confirmed by the changed appearance of the country Illustration An excursion was made to Isle Johnson but it turned out to be a barren little islet of no importance whatever though it gave the old boatswain infinite pleasure to know that those sea girt rocks bore his name There was some danger of both house and stores melting but happily this high temperature proved exceptional the thermometer seldom averaging much above freezing point By the middle of June the sloop had made good progress and already presented a shapely appearance As Bell and Johnson took the work of construction entirely on themselves the others went hunting and succeeded in killing several deer in spite of its being difficult game to approach Altamont adopted the Indian practice of crawling on all fours and adjusting his gun and arms so as to simulate horns and deceive the timid animal till he could get near enough to take good aim Illustration Their principal object of pursuit however was the musk ox which Parry had met with in such numbers in Melville Island but not a solitary specimen was to be seen anywhere about Victoria Bay and a distant excursion was therefore resolved upon which would serve the double purpose of hunting and surveying the eastern coast Illustration The three hunters accompanied by Duk set out on Monday the seventeenth of June at six in the morning each man armed with a double barrelled gun a hatchet and snow knife and provisions for several days It was a fine bright morning and by ten o clock they had gone twelve miles but not a living thing had crossed their path and the hunt threatened to turn out a mere excursion However they went on in hope after a good breakfast and half an hour s rest The ground was getting gradually lower and presented a peculiar appearance from the snow which lay here and there in ridges unmelted At a distance it looked like the sea when a strong wind is lashing up the waves and cresting them with a white foam Illustration Before long they reached a sort of glen at the bottom of which was a winding river It was almost completely thawed and already the banks were clothed with a species of vegetation as if the sun had done his best to fertilise the soil I tell you what said the Doctor a few enterprising colonists might make a fine settlement here With a little industry and perseverance wonders might be done in this country Ah if I am not much mistaken it has some four footed inhabitants already Those frisky little fellows know the best spots to choose Hares I declare That s jolly said Altamont loading his gun Illustration Stop cried the Doctor stop you furious hunter Let the poor little things alone they are not thinking of running away Look they are actually coming to us I do believe He was right for presently three or four young hares gambolling away among the fresh moss and tiny heaths came running about their legs so fearlessly and trustfully that even Altamont was disarmed They Illustration It was a strange and touching spectacle to see the pretty creatures they flew on Clawbonny s shoulders et cetera P one hundred sixty nine rubbed against the Doctor s knees and let him stroke them till the kind hearted man could not help saying to Altamont Why give shot to those who come for caresses The death of these little beasts could do us no good You say what s true Clawbonny Let them live replied Hatteras Illustration And these ptarmigans too I suppose and these long legged plovers added Altamont as a whole covey of birds flew down among the hunters never suspecting their danger Duk could not tell what to make of it and stood stupefied It was a strange and touching spectacle to see the pretty creatures they flew on Clawbonny s shoulders and lay down at his feet as if inviting friendly caresses and doing their utmost to welcome the strangers The whole glen echoed with their joyous cries as they darted to and fro from all parts The good Doctor seemed some mighty enchanter The hunters had continued their course along the banks of the river when a sudden bend in the valley revealed a herd of deer eight or ten in number peacefully browsing on some lichens that lay half buried in the snow They were charming creatures so graceful and gentle male and female both adorned with noble antlers wide spreading and deeply notched Their skin had already lost its winter whiteness and began to assume the brown tint of summer Strange to say they appeared not a whit more afraid than the birds or hares The three men were now right in the centre of the herd but not one made the least movement to run away This time the worthy Doctor had far more difficulty in restraining Altamont s impatience for the mere sight of such magnificent animals roused his hunting instincts and he became quite excited while Hatteras on the contrary seemed really touched to see the splendid creatures rubbing their heads so affectionately and trustfully against the good Clawbonny the friend of every living thing But I say exclaimed Altamont didn t we come out expressly to hunt To hunt the musk ox and nothing else replied Clawbonny Besides we shouldn t know what to do with this game even if we killed it we have provisions enough Let us for once enjoy the sight of men and animals in perfect amity It proves no human beings have been here before said Hatteras True and that proves something more these animals are not of American origin How do you make that out said Altamont Why if they had been born in North America they would have known how to treat that mammiferous biped called man and would have fled at the first glimpse of us No they are from the north most likely from the untrodden wilds of Asia so Altamont you have no right to claim them as fellow countrymen Illustration Oh a hunter doesn t examine his game so closely as all that Everything is grist that comes to his mill All right Calm yourself my brave Nimrod For my own part I would rather never fire another shot than make one of these beautiful creatures afraid of me See even Duk fraternizes with them Believe me it is well to be kind where we can Kindness is power Well well so be it said Altamont not at all understanding such scruples But I should like to see what you would do if you had no weapon but kindness among a pack of bears or wolves You wouldn t make much of it I make no pretensions to charm wild beasts I don t believe much in Orpheus and his enchantments Besides bears and wolves would not come to us like these hares and partridges and deer Why not They have never seen human beings either No but they are savage by nature said Clawbonny and ferocity like wickedness engenders suspicion This is true of men as well as animals They spent the whole day in the glen which the Doctor christened Arctic Arcadia and when evening came they lay down to rest in the hollow of a rock which seemed as if expressly prepared for their accommodation CHAPTER XVII ALTAMONT S REVENGE Next morning as the fine weather still continued the hunters determined to have another search for the musk ox It was only fair to give Altamont a chance with the distinct understanding that he should have the right of firing however fascinating the game they might meet Besides the flesh of the musk ox though a little too highly impregnated with the smell is savoury food and the hunters would gladly carry back a few pounds of it to Fort Providence During the first part of the day nothing occurred worth mentioning but they noticed a considerable change in the aspect of the country and appearances seemed to indicate that they were approaching a hilly region This New America was evidently either a continent or an island of considerable extent Duk was running far ahead of his party when he stopped suddenly short and began sniffing the ground as if he had caught scent of game Next minute he rushed forward again with extreme rapidity and was speedily out of sight But loud distinct barking convinced the hunters that the faithful fellow had at last discovered the desired object They hurried onwards and after an hour and a half s quick walking found him standing in front of two formidable looking animals and barking furiously The Doctor recognized them at once as belonging to the musk ox or Ovibos genus as naturalists call it by the very wide horns touching each other at their base by the absence of muzzle by the narrow square chanfrin resembling that of a sheep and by the very short tail Their hair was long and thickly matted and mixed with fine brown silky wool Illustration These singular looking quadrupeds were not the least afraid of Duk though extremely surprised but at the first glimpse of the hunters they took flight and it was no easy task to go after them for half an hour s swift running brought them no nearer and made the whole party so out of breath that they were forced to come to a halt Confound the beasts said Altamont Yes Altamont I ll make them over to you replied Clawbonny they are true Americans and they don t appear to have a very favourable idea of their fellow countrymen Illustration That proves our hunting prowess rejoined Altamont Meantime the oxen finding themselves no longer pursued had stopped short Further pursuit was evidently useless If they were to be captured at all they must be surrounded and the plateau which they first happened to have reached was very favourable for the purpose Leaving Duk to worry them they went down by the neighbouring ravines and got to the one end of the plateau where Altamont and the Doctor hid themselves behind projecting rocks while Hatteras went on to the other end intending to startle the animals by his sudden appearance and drive them back towards his companions I suppose you have no objection this time to bestow a few bullets on these gentry said Altamont Oh no it is a fair field now and no favour returned Clawbonny The oxen had begun to shake themselves impatiently at Duk trying to kick him off when Hatteras started up right in front of them shouting and chasing them back This was the signal for Altamont and the Doctor to rush forward and fire but at the sight of two assailants the terrified animals wheeled round and attacked Hatteras He met their onset with a firm steady foot and fired straight at their heads But both his balls were powerless and only served still further to madden the enraged beasts They rushed upon the unfortunate man like furies and threw him on the ground in an instant He is a dead man exclaimed the Doctor in despairing accents A tremendous struggle was going on in Altamont s breast at the sight of his prostrate foe and though his first impulse was to hasten to his help he stopped short battling with himself and his prejudices But his hesitation scarcely lasted half a second his better self conquered and exclaiming No it would be cowardly he rushed forward with Clawbonny Hatteras full well understood how his rival felt but would rather have died than have begged his intervention However he had hardly time to think about it before Altamont was at his side He could not have held out much longer for it was impossible to ward off the blows of horns and hoofs of two such powerful antagonists and in a few minutes more he must have been torn to pieces But suddenly two shots resounded and Hatteras felt the balls graze his head Ilustration Dealt him such a tremendous blow on the head with his hatchet that the skull was completely split open P one hundred seventy seven Courage shouted Altamont flinging away his discharged weapon and throwing himself right in front of the raging animals One of them shot to the heart fell dead as he reached the spot while the other dashed madly on Hatteras and was about to gore the unfortunate captain with his horns when Altamont plunged his snow knife far into the beast s wide open jaws with one hand with the other dealt him such a tremendous blow on the head with his hatchet that the skull was completely split open It was done so quickly that it seemed like a flash of lightning and all was over The second ox lay dead and Clawbonny shouted Hurrah hurrah Hatteras was saved He owed his life to the man he hated the most What a storm of conflicting passions this must have roused in his soul But where was the emotion he could not master However his action was prompt whatever his feeling might be Without a moment s hesitancy he went up to his rival and said in a grave voice Altamont you have saved my life You saved mine replied the American There was a moment s silence and then Altamont added We re quits Hatteras No Altamont said the captain when the Doctor dragged you out of your icy tomb I did not know who you were but you saved me at the peril of your own life knowing quite well who I was Why you are a fellow creature at any rate and whatever faults an American may have he is no coward No indeed said the Doctor He is a man every inch as much as yourself Hatteras And like me he shall have part in the glory that awaits us The glory of reaching the North Pole asked Altamont Yes replied Hatteras proudly I guessed right then said Altamont And you have actually dared to conceive such a project Oh it is grand I tell you it is sublime even to think of it But tell me said Hatteras in a hurried manner you were not bound for the Pole then yourself Altamont hesitated Come speak out man urged the Doctor Well to tell the truth I was not and the truth is better than self love No I had no such grand purpose in view I was trying to clear the North West Passage and that was all Altamont said Hatteras holding out his hand be our companion to glory come with us and find the North Pole The two men clasped hands in a warm hearty grasp and the bond of friendship between them was sealed When they turned to look for the Doctor they found him in tears Ah friends he said wiping his eyes you have made me so happy it is almost more than I can bear You have sacrificed this miserable nationality for the sake of the common cause You have said What does it matter if only the Pole is discovered whether it is by an Englishman or an American Why should we brag of being American or English when we can boast that we are men The good little man was beside himself with joy He hugged the reconciled enemies to his bosom and cemented their friendship by his own affection to both At last he grew calm after at least a twentieth embrace and said It is time I went to work now Since I am no hunter I must use my talents in another direction And he began to cut up the oxen so skilfully that he seemed like a surgeon making a delicate autopsy His two companions looked on smiling In a few minutes the adroit operator had cut off more than a hundred pounds of flesh This he divided into three parts Each man took one and they retraced their steps to Fort Providence At ten o clock they arrived at Doctor s House where Johnson and Bell had a good supper prepared for them But before sitting down to enjoy it the Doctor exclaimed in a jubilant tone and pointing to his two companions My dear old Johnson I took out an American and an Englishman with me didn t I Yes mister Clawbonny Well I bring back two brothers This was joyous news to the sailors and they shook hands warmly with Altamont while the Doctor recounted all that had passed and how the American captain had saved the English captain s life That night no five happier men could have been found than those that lay sleeping in the little snow house CHAPTER XVIII FINAL PREPARATIONS Next day the weather changed the cold returned Snow and rain and tempest came in quick succession for several days Bell had completed the sloop and done his work well for the little vessel was admirably adapted for the purpose contemplated being high at the sides and partly decked so as to be able to stand a heavy sea and yet light enough to be drawn on the sledge without overburdening the dogs At last a change of the greatest importance took place The ice began to tremble in the centre of the bay and the highest masses became loosened at their base ready to form icebergs and drift away before the first gale but Hatteras would not wait for the ice fields to break up before he started Since the journey must be made on land he did not care whether the sea was open or not and the day of departure was fixed for the twenty fifth of June Johnson and Bell undertaking the necessary repairs of the sledge On the twentieth finding there was space enough between the broken ice to allow the sloop to get through it was determined to take her a trial trip to Cape Washington Illustration The sea was not quite open but it would have been impossible to go across on foot This short sail of six hours sufficiently tested the powers of the sloop and proved her excellent qualities In coming back they witnessed a curious sight it was the chase of a seal by a gigantic bear mister Bruin was too busily engaged to notice the vessel or he would have pursued he was intently watching beside a seal hole with the patience of a true hunter or rather angler for he was certainly fishing just then He watched in absolute silence without stirring or giving the least sign of life Illustration But all of a sudden there was a slight disturbance on the surface of the water in the hole which announced the coming up of the amphibious animal to breathe Instantly the bear lay flat on his belly with his two paws stretched round the opening Illustration The poor seal struggled desperately but could not free himself from the iron grasp of his enemy P one hundred eighty four Next minute up came the seal but his head no sooner appeared above the water than the bear s paws closed about him like a vice and dragged him right out The poor seal struggled desperately but could not free himself from the iron grasp of his enemy who hugged him closer and closer till suffocation was complete Then he carried him off to his den as if the weight were nothing leaping lightly from pack to pack till he gained terra firma safely Illustration On the twenty second of June Hatteras began to load the sledge They put in two hundred lbs of salt meat three cases of vegetables and preserved meat besides lime juice and flour and medicines They also took two hundred lbs of powder and a stock of fire arms Including the sloop and the Halkett boat there was about fifteen hundred lbs weight a heavy Illustration load for four dogs and all the more as they would have to drag it every day instead of only four days successively like the dogs employed by the Esquimaux who always keep a relay for their sledges However the distance to the Pole was not one hundred fifty miles at the outside and they did not intend to go more than twelve miles a day as they could do it comfortably in a month Even if land failed them they could always fall back on the sloop and finish the journey without fatigue to men or dogs Illustration All the party were in excellent health though they had lost flesh a little but by attending to the Doctor s wise counsels they had weathered the winter without being attacked by any of the maladies incident to the climate Now they were almost at their journey s end and not one doubted of success for a common bond of sympathy bound fast the five men and made them strong to persevere On Sunday the twenty third all was ready and it was resolved to devote the entire day to rest The dwellers on Fort Providence could not see the last day dawn without some emotion It cost them a pang to leave the snow hut which had served them in such good stead and this hospitable shore where they had passed the winter Take it altogether they had spent very happy hours there and the Doctor made a touching reference to the subject as they sat round the table at the evening meal and did not forget to thank God for his manifest protection Illustration They retired early to rest for they needed to be up betimes So passed the last night in Fort Providence CHAPTER XIX MARCH TO THE NORTH Next day at early dawn Hatteras gave the signal for departure The well fed and well rested dogs were harnessed to the sledge They had been having a good time of it all the winter and might be expected to do good service during the summer It was six in the morning when the expedition started After following the windings of the bay and going past Cape Washington they struck into the direct route for the north and by seven o clock had lost sight of the lighthouse and Fort Providence During the first two days they made twenty miles in twelve hours devoting the remainder of the time to rest and meals The tent was quite sufficient protection during sleep The temperature began to rise In many places the snow melted entirely away 
7389-295014-0000	train-other-500	and great patches of water appeared here and there complete ponds which a little stretch of imagination might easily convert into lakes The travellers were often up to their knees but they only laughed over it
7389-295014-0001	train-other-500	and indeed the Doctor was rather glad of such unexpected baths But for all that he said the water has no business to wet us here It is an element which has no right to this country
none	none	 except in a solid or vaporous state Ice or vapour is all very well but water never Illustration Hunting was not forgotten during the march 
7389-295014-0002	train-other-500	for fresh meat was a necessity Altamont and Bell kept their guns loaded and shot ptarmigans guillemots geese and a few young hares but by degrees
none	none	 birds and animals had been changing from trustfulness to fear and had become so shy and difficult to approach that very often but for Duk the hunters would have wasted their powder Hatteras advised them not to go more than a mile away as there was not a day 
7389-295014-0003	train-other-500	nor even an hour to lose
none	none	 for three months of fine weather was the utmost they Illustration could count upon 
7389-295014-0004	train-other-500	Besides the sledge was often coming to difficult places when each man was needed to lend a helping hand
none	none	 On the third day 
7389-295014-0005	train-other-500	they came to a lake several acres in extent and still entirely frozen over The sun s rays had little access to it owing to its situation and the ice was so strong
none	none	 that it must have dated from some remote winter 
7389-295014-0006	train-other-500	It was strong enough to bear both the travellers and their sledge
none	none	 and was covered with dry snow Illustration From this point the country became gradually lower 
7389-295014-0007	train-other-500	from which the Doctor concluded that it did not extend to the Pole but that most probably this New America was an island Up to this time the expedition had been attended with no fatigue
7389-295014-0008	train-other-500	The travellers had only suffered from the intense glare of the sun on the snow which threatened them with snow blindness At another time of the year
none	none	 they might have avoided this by walking during the night 
7389-295014-0009	train-other-500	but at present there was no night at all Happily the snow was beginning to melt and the brilliancy would diminish
none	none	 as the process of dissolution advanced Illustration On the twenty eighth of June the thermometer rose to forty five deg 
7389-295014-0010	train-other-500	and the rain fell in torrents Hatteras and his companions however marched stoically on and even hailed the downpour with delight knowing that it would hasten the disappearance of the snow
none	none	 As they went along the Doctor often picked up stones both round ones and flat pebbles as if worn away by the tide He thought from this they must be near the Polar Basin 
7389-295014-0011	train-other-500	and yet far as the eye could reach was one interminable plain
none	none	 There was not a trace of houses or huts or cairns visible It was evident that the Greenlanders had not pushed their way so far north and yet the famished tribes would have found their account in coming for the country abounded in game Bears were frequently seen and numerous herds of musk oxen and deer Illustration Bell killed a fox and Altamont a musk ox P one hundred ninety two On the twenty ninth Bell killed a fox and Altamont a musk ox These supplies of fresh food were very acceptable 
7389-295014-0012	train-other-500	and even the Doctor surveyed with considerable satisfaction the haunches of meat they managed to procure from time to time Don t let us stint ourselves he used to say on these occasions
7389-295014-0013	train-other-500	food is no unimportant matter in expeditions like ours Especially said Johnson when a meal depends on a lucky shot You re right Johnson
none	none	 a man does not think so much about dinner when he knows the soup pot is simmering by the kitchen fire On the thirtieth they came to a district which seemed Illustration to have been upturned by some volcanic convulsion 
7389-295014-0014	train-other-500	so covered was it with cones and sharp lofty peaks A strong breeze from the south east was blowing which soon increased to a hurricane sweeping over the rocks covered with snow
7389-295014-0015	train-other-500	and the huge masses of ice which took the forms of icebergs and hummocks though on dry land The tempest was followed by damp warm weather which caused a regular thaw
7389-295014-0016	train-other-500	On all sides nothing could be heard but the noise of cracking ice and falling avalanches The travellers had to be very careful in avoiding hills and even in speaking aloud
7389-295014-0017	train-other-500	for the slightest agitation in the air might have caused a catastrophe
none	none	 Indeed the suddenness is the peculiar feature in Arctic Illustration avalanches 
7389-295014-0018	train-other-500	distinguishing them from those of Switzerland and Norway Often the dislodgment of a block of ice is instantaneous and not even a cannon ball or thunderbolt could be more rapid in its descent
7389-295014-0019	train-other-500	The loosening the fall and the crash happen almost simultaneously Happily however
none	none	 no accident befel any of the party and three days afterwards they came to smooth level ground again Illustration But here a new phenomenon met their gaze 
7389-295014-0020	train-other-500	a phenomenon which was long a subject of patient inquiry among the learned of both hemispheres They came to a long chain of low hills which seemed to extend for miles
7389-295014-0021	train-other-500	and were all covered on the eastern side with bright red snow It is easy to imagine the surprise and half terrified exclamations of the little company at the sight of this long red curtain
none	none	 but the Doctor hastened to reassure them or rather to instruct them as to the nature of this peculiar snow He told them that this same red substance had been found in Switzerland 
7389-295014-0022	train-other-500	in the heart of the Alps and that the colour proceeded solely from the presence of certain corpuscles about the nature of which for a long time chemists could not agree
7389-295014-0023	train-other-500	They could not decide whether these corpuscles were of animal or vegetable origin but at last it was settled that they belonged to the family of fungi being a sort of microscopic champignon
none	none	 of the species Uredo 
7389-295014-0024	train-other-500	Turning the snow over with his iron tipped staff the Doctor found that the colouring matter measured nine feet deep He pointed this out to his companions that they might have some idea of the enormous number
none	none	 of these tiny mushrooms in a layer extending so many miles 
7389-295014-0025	train-other-500	This phenomenon was none the less strange for being explained
none	none	 for red is a colour seldom seen in nature over any considerable area 
7389-295014-0026	train-other-500	The reflection of the sun s rays upon it produced the most peculiar effect lighting up men and animals and rocks with a fiery glow as if proceeding from some flame within
none	none	 When the snow melted it looked like blood as the red particles do not decompose It seemed to the travellers as if rivulets of blood were running among their feet Illustration The Doctor filled several bottles with this precious substance to examine at leisure as he had only had a glimpse of the Crimson Cliffs in Baffin s Bay Illustration This Field of Blood as he called it took three hours to get over and then the country resumed its usual aspect Illustration At Bell s suggestion torches were contrived P one hundred ninety nine CHAPTER XX FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW On the fourth of July there was such an exceedingly dense fog that it was very difficult to keep the straight course for the north No misadventure however befel the party during the darkness except the loss of Bell s snow shoes At Bell s suggestion which fired the Doctor s inventive genius torches were contrived made of tow steeped in spirits of wine and fastened on the end of a stick and these served somewhat to help them on though they made but small progress for on the sixth after the fog had cleared off the Doctor took their bearings and found that they had only been marching at the rate of eight miles a day Determined to make up for lost time they rose next morning very early and started off Bell and Altamont as usual going ahead of the rest and acting as scouts Johnson and the others kept beside the sledge and were soon nearly two miles behind the guides but the weather was so dry and clear that all their movements could be distinctly observed What now said Clawbonny as he saw them make a sudden halt and stoop down as if examining the ground I was just wondering what they are about myself replied old Johnson Perhaps they have come on the tracks of animals suggested Hatteras No said Clawbonny it can t be that Illustration Why not Because Duk would bark Well it is quite evident they are examining some sort of marks Let s get on then said Hatteras and urging forward the dogs they rejoined their companions in about twenty minutes and shared their surprise at finding unmistakable fresh footprints of human beings in the snow as plain as if only made the preceding day They are Esquimaux footprints said Hatteras Do you think so asked Altamont There is no doubt of it But what do you make of this then returned Altamont pointing to another footmark repeated in Illustration several places Do you believe for a minute that was made by an Esquimaux It was incontestably the print of a European boot nails sole and heel clearly stamped in the snow There was no room for doubt and Hatteras exclaimed in amazement Europeans here Evidently said Johnson And yet it is so improbable that we must take a second look before pronouncing an opinion said Clawbonny But the longer he looked the more apparent became the fact Hatteras was chagrined beyond measure A European here so near the Pole The footprints extended for about a quarter of a mile and then diverged to the west Should the travellers follow them further No said Hatteras let us go on He was interrupted by an exclamation from the Doctor who had just picked up an object that gave still more convincing proof of European origin It was part of a pocket spy glass Well if we still had any doubts about the footmarks this settles the case at once at any rate said Clawbonny Forward exclaimed Hatteras so energetically that instinctively each one obeyed and the march was resumed forthwith The day wore away but no further sign of the presence of suspected rivals was discovered and they prepared to encamp for the night The tent was pitched in a ravine for shelter as the sky was dark and threatening and a violent north wind was blowing I m afraid we ll have a bad night said Johnson A pretty noisy one I expect replied the Doctor but not cold We had better take every precaution and fasten down our tent with good big stones You are right mister Clawbonny If the hurricane swept away our tent I don t know where we should find it again Illustration The tent held fast but sleep was impossible for the tempest was let loose and raged with tremendous violence It seems to me said the Doctor during a brief lull in the deafening roar as if I could hear the sound of collisions between icebergs and ice fields If we were near the sea I could really believe there was a general break up in the ice I can t explain the noises any other way said Johnson Can we have reached the coast I wonder asked Hatteras It is not impossible replied Clawbonny Listen Do you hear that crash That is certainly the sound of icebergs falling We cannot be very far from the ocean Well if it turn out to be so I shall push right on over the ice fields Oh they ll be all broken up after such a storm as this We shall see what to morrow brings but all I can say is if any poor fellows are wandering about in a night like this I pity them The storm lasted for ten hours and the weary travellers anxiously watched for the morning About daybreak its fury seemed to have spent itself and Hatteras accompanied by Bell and Altamont ventured to leave the tent They climbed a hill about three hundred feet high which commanded a wide view But what a metamorphosed region met their gaze All the ice had completely vanished the storm had chased away the winter and stripped the soil everywhere of its snow covering Illustration Three hours afterwards they arrived at the coast and shouted simultaneously The sea the sea P two hundred six But Hatteras scarcely bestowed a glance on surrounding objects his eager gaze was bent on the northern horizon which appeared shrouded in black mist That may very likely be caused by the ocean suggested Clawbonny You are right The sea must be there was the reply That tint is what we call the blink of open water said Johnson Come on then to the sledge at once and let us get to this unknown ocean exclaimed Hatteras Their few preparations were soon made and the march resumed Three hours afterwards they arrived at the coast and shouted simultaneously The sea the sea Ay and open sea added Hatteras And so it was The storm had opened wide the Polar Basin and the loosened packs were drifting in all directions The icebergs had weighed anchor and were sailing out into the open sea This new ocean stretched far away out of sight and not a single island or continent was visible On the east and west the coast formed two capes or headlands which sloped gently down to the sea In the centre a projecting rock formed a small natural bay sheltered on three sides into which a wide river fell bearing in its bosom the melted snows of winter After a careful survey of the coast Hatteras determined to launch the sloop that very day and to unpack the sledge and get everything on board The tent was soon put up and a comfortable repast prepared This important business despatched work commenced and all hands were so expeditious and willing that by five Illustration o clock nothing more remained to be done The sloop lay rocking gracefully in the little bay and all the cargo was on board except the tent and what was required for the night s encampment The sight of the sloop suggested to Clawbonny the propriety of giving Altamont s name to the little bay His proposition to that effect met with unanimous approval and the port was forthwith dignified by the title of Altamont Harbour According to the Doctor s calculations the travellers were now only nine deg distant from the Pole They had gone over two hundred miles from Victoria Bay to Altamont Harbour and were in latitude eighty seven deg five and longitude one hundred eighteen deg thirty five CHAPTER XXI THE OPEN SEA Next morning by eight o clock all the remaining effects were on board and the preparations for departure completed But before starting the Doctor thought he would like to take a last look at the country and see if any further traces of the presence of strangers could be discovered for the mysterious footmarks they had met with were never out of his thoughts He climbed to the top of a height which commanded a view of the whole southern horizon and took out his pocket telescope But what was his astonishment to find he could see nothing through it not even neighbouring objects He rubbed his eyes and looked again but with no better result Then he began to examine the telescope the object glass was gone The object glass This explained the whole mystery foot prints and all and with a shout of surprise he hurried down the hill to impart his discovery to the wondering companions who came running towards him startled by his loud exclamation and full of anxiety at his precipitate descent Well what is the matter now said Johnson The Doctor could hardly speak he was so out of breath At last he managed to gasp out The tracks footmarks strangers What said Hatteras strangers here No no the object glass the object glass out of my telescope Illustration And he held out his spy glass for them to look at Ah I see said Altamont it is wanting Yes But then the footmarks They were ours friends just ours exclaimed the Doctor We had lost ourselves in the fog and been wandering in a circle But the boot marks objected Hatteras Bell s He walked about a whole day after he had lost his snow shoes So I did said Bell The mistake was so evident that they all laughed heartily except Hatteras though no one was more glad than he at the discovery A quarter of an hour afterwards the little sloop sailed out of Altamont Harbour and commenced her voyage of discovery The wind was favourable but there was little of it and the weather was positively warm The sloop was none the worse for the sledge journey She was in first rate trim and easily managed Johnson steered the Doctor Bell and the American leaned back against the cargo and Hatteras stood at the prow his fixed eager gaze bent steadily on that mysterious point towards which he felt drawn with irresistible power like the magnetic needle to the Pole He wished to be the first to descry any shore that might come in sight and he had every right to the honour The water of this Polar Sea presented some peculiar features worth mentioning In colour it was a faint ultramarine blue and possessed such wonderful transparency that one seemed to gaze down into fathomless depths These depths were lighted up no doubt by some electrical phenomenon and so many varieties of living creatures were visible that the vessel seemed to be sailing over a vast aquarium Innumerable flocks of birds were flying over the surface of this marvellous ocean darkening the sky like thick heavy storm clouds Water fowl of every description were among them from the albatross to the penguin and all of gigantic proportions Their cries were absolutely deafening and some of them had such Illustration immense wide spreading wings that they covered the sloop completely as they flew over The Doctor thought himself a good naturalist but he found his science greatly at fault for many a species here was wholly unknown to any ornithological society Illustration And the Doctor leaning over the side of the vessel could see the whales and the dolphins and all the rest of the monsters of the deep P two hundred fourteen The good little man was equally nonplussed when he looked at the water for he saw the most wonderful medusae some so large that they looked like little islands floating about among Brobdignagian sea weeds And below the surface what a spectacle met the eye Myriads of fish of every species young manati at play with each other narwhals with their one strong weapon of defence like the horn of a unicorn chasing the timid seals whales of every tribe spouting out columns of water and mucilage and filling the air with a peculiar whizzing noise dolphins seals and walruses sea dogs and sea horses sea bears and sea elephants quietly browsing on submarine pastures and the Doctor could gaze at them all as easily and clearly as if they were in glass tanks in the Zoological Gardens There was a strange supernatural purity about the atmosphere It seemed charged to overflowing with oxygen and had a marvellous power of exhilaration producing an almost intoxicating effect on the brain Towards evening Hatteras and his companions lost sight of the coast Night came on though the sun remained just above the horizon but it had the same influence on animated nature as in temperate zones Birds fish and all the cetacea disappeared and perfect silence prevailed Since the departure from Altamont Harbour the sloop had made one degree further north The next day brought no signs of land there was not even a speck on the horizon The wind was still favourable and the sea pretty calm The birds and fishes returned as numerously as on the preceding day and the Doctor leaning over the side of the vessel could see the whales and the dolphins and all the rest of the monsters of the deep gradually coming up from the clear depths below On the surface far as the eye could reach nothing was visible except a solitary iceberg here and there and a few scattered floes Indeed but little ice was met with anywhere The sloop was ten degrees above the point of greatest cold and consequently in the same temperature as Baffin s Bay and Disko It was therefore not astonishing that the sea should be open in these summer months This is a fact of great practical value for if ever the whalers can penetrate north as far as the Polar basin they may be sure of an immediate cargo as this part of the ocean seems the general reservoir of whales and seals and every marine species The day wore on but still nothing appeared on the horizon Hatteras never left the prow of the ship but stood glass in hand eagerly gazing into the distance with anxious questioning eyes and seeking to discover in the colour of the water the shape of the waves and the breath of the wind indications of approaching land CHAPTER XXII GETTING NEAR THE POLE Hour after hour passed away and still Hatteras persevered in his weary watch though his hopes appeared doomed to disappointment At length about six in the evening a dim hazy shapeless sort of mist seemed to rise far away between sea and sky It was not a cloud for it was constantly vanishing and then reappearing next minute Hatteras was the first to notice this peculiar phenomenon but after an hour s scrutiny through his telescope he could make nothing of it All at once however some sure indication met his eye and stretching out his arm to the horizon he shouted in a clear ringing voice Land land His words produced an electrical effect on his companions and every man rushed to his side I see it I see it said Clawbonny Yes yes so do I exclaimed Johnson It is a cloud said Altamont Land land repeated Hatteras in tones of absolute conviction Even while he spoke the appearance vanished and when it returned again the Doctor fancied he caught a gleam of light about the smoke for an instant Illustration It is a volcano he exclaimed P two hundred seventeen It is a volcano he exclaimed A volcano repeated Altamont Undoubtedly Illustration In so high a latitude Why not Is not Iceland a volcanic island indeed almost made of volcanoes one might say Well has not our famous countryman James Ross affirmed the existence of two active volcanoes the Erebus and the Terror on the Southern Continent in longitude one hundred seventy deg and latitude seventy eight deg Why then should not volcanoes be found near the North Pole It is possible certainly replied Altamont Ah now I see it distinctly exclaimed the Doctor It is a volcano Let us make right for it then said Hatteras Illustration It was impossible longer to doubt the proximity of the coast In twenty four hours probably the bold navigators might hope to set foot on its untrodden soil But strange as it was now that they were so near the goal of their voyage no one showed the joy which might have been expected Each man sat silent absorbed in his own thoughts wondering what sort of place this Pole must be The birds seemed to shun it for though it was evening they were all flying towards the south with outspread wings Was it then so inhospitable that not so much as a sea gull or a ptarmigan could find a shelter The fish too even the large cetacea were hastening away through the transparent waters What Illustration could cause this feeling either of repulsion or terror At last sleep overcame the tired men and one after another dropped off leaving Hatteras to keep watch He took the helm and tried his best not to close his eyes for he grudged losing precious time but the slow motion of the vessel rocked him into a state of such irresistible somnolence that in spite of himself he was soon like his companions locked fast in deep slumber He began to dream and imagination brought back all the scenes of his past life He dreamt of his ship the Forward and of the traitors that had burnt it Again he felt all the agonies of disappointment and failure and forgot his actual situation Then the scene changed and he saw himself at the Pole unfurling the Union Jack While memory and fancy were thus busied an enormous cloud of an olive tinge had begun to darken sea and sky A hurricane was at hand The first blast of the tempest roused the captain and his companions and they were on their feet in an instant ready to meet it The sea had risen tremendously and the ship was tossing violently up and down on the billows Hatteras took the helm again and kept a firm hold of it while Johnson and Bell baled out the water which was constantly dashing over the ship It was a difficult matter to preserve the right course for the thick fog made it impossible to see more than a few yards off This sudden tempest might well seem to such excited men a stern prohibition against further approach to the Pole but it needed but a glance at their resolute faces to know that they would neither yield to winds nor waves but go right on to the end Illustration For a whole day the struggle lasted death threatening them each moment but about six in the evening just as the fury of the waves seemed at its highest pitch there came a sudden calm The wind was stilled as if miraculously and the sea became smooth as glass Then came a most extraordinary inexplicable phenomenon The fog without dispersing became strangely luminous and the sloop sailed along in a zone of electric light Mast sail and rigging appeared pencilled in black against the phosphorescent sky with wondrous distinctness The men were bathed in light and their faces shone with a fiery glow The volcano exclaimed Hatteras Is it possible said Bell No no replied Clawbonny We should be suffocated with its flames so near Perhaps it is the reflection suggested Altamont Not that much even for then we must be near land and in that case we should hear the noise of the eruption What is it then asked the captain It is a cosmical phenomenon replied the Doctor seldom met hitherto If we go on we shall soon get out of our luminous sphere and be back in the darkness and tempest again Well let s go on come what may said Hatteras The Doctor was right Gradually the fog began to lose its light and then its transparency and the howling wind was heard not far off A few minutes more and the little vessel was caught in a violent squall and swept back into the cyclone But the hurricane had fortunately turned a point towards the south and left the vessel free to run before the wind straight towards the Pole There was imminent danger of her sinking for she sped along at frenzied speed and any sudden collision with rock or iceberg must have inevitably dashed her to pieces But not a man on board counselled prudence They were intoxicated with the danger and no speed could be quick enough to satisfy their longing impatience to reach the unknown At last they began evidently to near the coast Strange symptoms were manifest in the air the fog suddenly rent like a curtain torn by the wind and for an instant like a flash of lightning an immense column of flame was seen on the horizon The volcano the volcano was the simultaneous exclamation But the words had hardly passed their lips before the fantastic vision had vanished The wind suddenly changed to south east and drove the ship back again from the land Confound it said Hatteras we weren t three miles from the coast However resistance was impossible All that could be done was to keep tacking but every few minutes the little sloop would be thrown on her side though she righted herself again immediately obedient to the helm As Hatteras stood with dishevelled hair grasping the helm as if welded to his hand he seemed the animating soul of the ship All at once a fearful sight met his gaze Scarcely twenty yards in front was a great block of ice coming right towards them mounting and falling on the stormy billows ready to overturn at any moment and crush them in its descent But this was not the only danger that threatened the bold navigators The iceberg was packed with white bears huddling close together and evidently beside themselves with terror The iceberg made frightful lurches sometimes inclining at such a sharp angle that the animals rolled pell mell over each other and set up a loud growling which mingled with the roar of the elements and made a terrible concert For a quarter of an hour which seemed a whole century the sloop sailed on in this formidable company sometimes a few yards distant and sometimes near enough to touch The Greenland dogs trembled for fear but Duk was quite imperturbable At last the iceberg lost ground and got driven by the wind further and further away till it disappeared in the fog only at intervals betraying its presence by the ominous growls of its equipage Illustration Mast and sail were torn off and went flying away through the darkness like some large white bird P two hundred twenty four The storm now burst forth with redoubled fury The little barque was lifted bodily out of the water and whirled round and round with the most frightful rapidity Mast and sail were torn off and went flying away through the darkness like some large white bird A whirlpool began to form among the waves drawing down the ship gradually by its irresistible suction Illustration Deeper and deeper she sank whizzing round at such tremendous speed that to the poor fellows on board the water seemed motionless All five men stood erect gazing at each other in speechless terror But suddenly the ship rose perpendicularly her prow went above the edge of the vortex and getting out of the centre of attraction by her own velocity she escaped at a tangent from the circumference and was thrown far beyond swift as a ball from a cannon s mouth Altamont the Doctor Johnson and Bell were pitched flat on the planks When they got up Hatteras had disappeared It was two o clock in the morning CHAPTER XXIII THE ENGLISH FLAG For a few seconds they seemed stupefied and then a cry of Hatteras broke from every lip On all sides nothing was visible but the tempestuous ocean Duk barked desperately and Bell could hardly keep him from leaping into the waves Take the helm Altamont said the Doctor and let us try our utmost to find our poor captain Johnson and Bell seized the oars and rowed about for more than an hour but their search was vain Hatteras was lost Lost and so near the Pole just as he had caught sight of the goal The Doctor called and shouted and fired signals and Duk made piteous lamentations but there was no response Clawbonny could bear up no longer he buried his head in his hands and fairly wept aloud At such a distance from the coast it was impossible Hatteras could reach it alive without an oar or even so much as a spar to help him if ever he touched the haven of his desire it would be as a swollen mutilated corpse Longer search was useless and nothing remained but to resume the route north The tempest was dying out and about five in the morning on the eleventh of July the wind fell and the sea gradually became calm The sky recovered its polar clearness and less than three miles away the land appeared in all its grandeur The new continent was only an island or rather a volcano fixed like a lighthouse on the North Pole of the world Illustration Two men in a boat observing a volcano in the distance The mountain was in full activity pouring out a mass of burning stones and glowing rock At every fresh eruption there was a convulsive heaving within as if some mighty giant were respiring and the masses ejected were thrown up high into the air amidst jets of bright flame streams of lava rolling down the sides in impetuous torrents In one part serpents of fire seemed writhing and wriggling amongst smoking rocks and in Illustration another the glowing liquid fell in cascades in the midst of purple vapour into a river of fire below formed of a thousand igneous streams which emptied itself into the sea the waters hissing and seething like a boiling cauldron Apparently there was only one crater to the volcano out of which the columns of fire issued streaked with forked lightning Electricity seemed to have something to do with this magnificent panorama Above the panting flames waved an immense plume shaped cloud of smoke red at its base and black at its summit It rose with incomparable majesty and unrolled in thick volumes The sky was ash colour to a great height and it was evident that the darkness that had prevailed while the tempest lasted which had seemed quite inexplicable to the Doctor was owing to the columns of cinders overspreading the sun like a thick curtain He remembered a similar phenomenon which occurred in the Barbadoes where the whole island was plunged in profound obscurity by the mass of cinders ejected from the crater of Isle saint Vincent This enormous ignivomous rock in the middle of the sea was six thousand feet high just about the altitude of Hecla It seemed to rise gradually out of the water as the boat got nearer There was no trace of vegetation indeed there was no shore the rock ran straight down to the sea Can we land said the Doctor The wind is carrying us right to it said Altamont But I don t see an inch of land to set our foot upon It seems so at this distance said Johnson but we shall be sure to find some place to run in our boat at and that is all we want Let us go on then said Clawbonny dejectedly He had no heart now for anything The North Pole was indeed before his eyes but not the man who had discovered it As they got nearer the island which was not more than eight or ten miles in circumference the navigators noticed a tiny fiord just large enough to harbour their boat and made towards it immediately They feared their captain s dead body would meet their eyes on the coast and yet it seemed difficult for a corpse to lie on it for there was no shore and the sea broke on steep rocks which were covered with cinders above watermark At last the little sloop glided gently into the narrow opening between two sandbanks just visible above the water where she would be safe from the violence of the breakers but before she could be moored Duk began howling and barking again in the most piteous manner as if calling on the cruel sea and stony rocks to yield up his lost master The Doctor tried to calm him by caresses but in vain The faithful beast as if he would represent the captain sprang on shore with a tremendous bound sending a cloud of cinders after him Duk Duk called Clawbonny But Duk had already disappeared Illustration After the sloop was made fast they all got out and went after him Altamont was just going to climb to the top of a pile of stones when the Doctor exclaimed Listen Duk was barking vehemently some distance off but his bark seemed full of grief rather than fury Has he come on the track of some animal do you think asked Johnson No no said Clawbonny shuddering His bark is too sorrowful it is the dog s tear He has found the body of Hatteras They all four rushed forward in spite of the blinding cinder dust and came to the far end of a fiord where they discovered the dog barking round a corpse wrapped in the British flag Hatteras Hatteras cried the Doctor throwing himself on the body of his friend But next minute he started up with an indescribable cry and shouted Alive alive Yes said a feeble voice yes alive at the North Pole on Queen s Island Hurrah for England shouted all with one accord And for America added Clawbonny holding out one hand to Hatteras and the other to Altamont Duk was not behind with his hurrah which was worth quite as much as the others For a few minutes the joy of recovery of their captain filled all their hearts and the poor fellows could not restrain their tears The Doctor found on examination that he was not seriously hurt The wind threw him on the coast where landing was perilous work but after being driven back more than once into the sea the hardy sailor had managed to scramble on to a rock and gradually to hoist himself above the waves Then he must have become insensible for he remembered nothing more except rolling himself in his flag He only awoke to consciousness with the loud barking and caresses of his faithful Duk After a little Hatteras was able to stand up supported by the Doctor and tried to get back to the sloop He kept exclaiming The Pole the North Pole You are happy now said his friend Yes happy And are not you Isn t it joy to find yourself here The ground we tread is round the Pole The air we breathe is the air that blows round the Pole The sea we have crossed is the sea which washes the Pole Oh the North Pole the North Pole He had become quite delirious with excitement and fever burned in his veins His eyes shone with unnatural brilliancy and his brain seemed on fire Perfect rest was what he most needed for the Doctor found it impossible to quiet him A place of encampment must therefore be fixed upon immediately Illustration Altamont speedily discovered a grotto composed of rocks P two hundred thirty four Altamont speedily discovered a grotto composed of rocks which had so fallen as to form a sort of cave Johnson and Bell carried in provisions and gave the dogs their liberty About eleven o clock breakfast or rather dinner was ready consisting of pemmican salt meat and smoking hot tea and coffee But Hatteras would do nothing till the exact position of the island was ascertained so the Doctor and Altamont set to work with their instruments and found that the exact latitude of the grotto was eighty nine deg fifty nine fifteen The longitude was of little importance for all the meridians blended a few hundred feet higher The ninety deg of lat was then only about three quarters of a mile off or just about the summit of the volcano When the result was communicated to Hatteras he desired that a formal document might be drawn up to attest the fact and two copies made one of which should be deposited on a cairn on the island Clawbonny was the scribe and indited the following document a copy of which is now among the archives of the Royal Geographical Society of London On this eleventh day of July eighteen sixty one in North latitude eighty nine deg fifty nine fifteen was discovered Queen s Island at the North Pole by Captain Hatteras Commander of the brig Forward of Liverpool who signs this as also all his companions Whoever may find this document is requested to forward it to the Admiralty Signed JOHN HATTERAS Commander of the Forward doctor CLAWBONNY ALTAMONT Commander of the Porpoise JOHNSON Boatswain BELL Carpenter And now friends come to table said the Doctor merrily Coming to table was just squatting on the ground But who said Clawbonny would not give all the tables and dining rooms in the world to dine at eighty nine fifty nine and fifteen N lat It was an exciting occasion this first meal at the Pole What neither ancients nor moderns neither Europeans nor Americans nor Asiatics had been able to accomplish was now achieved and all past sufferings and perils were forgotten in the glow of success But after all said Johnson after toasts to Hatteras and the North Pole had been enthusiastically drunk what is there so very special about the North Pole Will you tell me mister Clawbonny Just this my good Johnson It is the only point of the globe that is motionless all the other points are revolving with extreme rapidity But I don t see that we are any more motionless here than at Liverpool Because in both cases you are a party concerned both in the motion and the rest but the fact is certain Clawbonny then went on to describe the diurnal and annual motions of the earth the one round its own axis the extremities of which are the poles which is accomplished in twenty four hours and the other round the sun which takes a whole year Bell and Johnson listened half incredulously and Illustration couldn t see why the earth could not have been allowed to keep still till Altamont informed them that they would then have had neither day nor night nor spring summer autumn and winter Ay and worse still said Clawbonny if the motion chanced to be interrupted we should fall right into the sun in sixty four and a half days What take sixty four and a half days to fall exclaimed Johnson Yes we are ninety five millions of miles off But when I say the Pole is motionless it is not strictly true it is only so in comparison with the rest of the globe for it has a certain movement of its own and completes a circle in about twenty six thousand years This comes from the precession of the equinoxes A long and learned talk was started on this subject between Altamont and the Doctor simplified however as much as possible for the benefit of Bell and Johnson Hatteras took no part in it and even when they went on to speculate about the earth s centre and discussed several of the theories that had been advanced respecting it he seemed not to hear it was evident his thoughts were far away Among other opinions put forth was one in our own days which greatly excited Altamont s surprise It was held that there was an immense opening at the poles which led into the heart of the earth and that it was out of the opening that the light of the Aurora Borealis streamed This was gravely stated and Captain Synness a countryman of our own actually proposed that Sir Humphrey Davy Humboldt and Arago should undertake an expedition through it but they refused And quite right too said Altamont So say I but you see my friends what absurdities imagination has conjured up about these regions and how sooner or later the simple reality comes to light CHAPTER XXIV MOUNT HATTERAS After this conversation they all made themselves as comfortable as they could and lay down to sleep All except Hatteras and why could this extraordinary man not sleep like the others Was not the purpose of his life attained now Had he not realized his most daring project Why could he not rest Indeed might not one have supposed that after the strain his nervous system had undergone he would long for rest But no he grew more and more excited and it was not the thought of returning that so affected him Was he bent on going farther still Had his passion for travel no limits Was the world too small for him now he had circumnavigated it Whatever might be the cause he could not sleep yet this first night at the Pole was clear and calm The isle was absolutely uninhabited not a bird was to be seen in this burning atmosphere not an animal on these scoriae covered rocks not a fish in these seething waters Next morning when Altamont and the others awoke Hatteras was gone Feeling uneasy at his absence they hurried out of the grotto in search of him Illustration There he was standing on a rock gazing fixedly at the top of the mountain P two hundred forty two There he was standing on a rock gazing fixedly at the top of the mountain His instruments were in his hand and he was evidently calculating the exact longitude and latitude The Doctor went towards him and spoke but it was long before he could rouse him from his absorbing contemplations At last the captain seemed to understand and Clawbonny said while he examined him with a keen scrutinizing glance Let us go round the island Here we are all ready for our last excursion The last repeated Hatteras as if in a dream Yes the last truly but he added with more animation the most wonderful He pressed both hands on his brow as he spoke as if to calm the inward tumult Just then Altamont and the others came up and their appearance seemed to dispel the hallucinations under which he was labouring My friends he said in a voice full of emotion thanks for your courage thanks for your perseverance thanks for your superhuman efforts through which we are permitted to set our feet on this soil Captain said Johnson we have only obeyed orders to you alone belongs the honour No no exclaimed Hatteras with a violent outburst of emotion to all of you as much as to me To Altamont as much as any of us as much as the Doctor himself Oh let my heart break in your hands it cannot contain its joy and gratitude any longer He grasped the hands of his brave companions as he spoke and paced up and down as if he had lost all self control We have only done our duty as Englishmen said Bell And as friends added Clawbonny Yes but all did not do it replied Hatteras some gave way However we must pardon them pardon both the traitors and those who were led away by them Poor fellows I forgive them You hear me Doctor Yes replied Clawbonny beginning to be seriously uneasy at his friend s excitement I have no wish therefore continued the captain that they should lose the little fortune they came so far to seek No the original agreement is to remain unaltered and they shall be rich if they ever see England again It would have been difficult not to have been touched by the pathetic tone of voice in which Hatteras said this But captain interrupted Johnson trying to joke one would think you were making your will Perhaps I am said Hatteras gravely And yet you have a long bright career of glory before you Who knows was the reply No one answered and the Doctor did not dare to guess his meaning but Hatteras soon made them understand it for presently he said in a hurried agitated manner as if he could scarcely command himself Friends listen to me We have done much already but much yet remains to be done His companions heard him with profound astonishment Yes he resumed we are close to the Pole but we are not on it How do you make that out said Altamont Yes replied Hatteras with vehemence I said an Englishman should plant his foot on the Pole of the world I said it and an Englishman shall What cried Clawbonny We are still forty five from the unknown point resumed Hatteras with increasing animation and to that point I shall go But it is on the summit of the volcano said the Doctor I shall go It is an inaccessible cone I shall go But it is a yawning fiery crater I shall go The tone of absolute determination in which Hatteras pronounced these words it is impossible to describe His friends were stupefied and gazed in terror at the blazing mountain At last the Doctor recovered himself and began to urge and entreat Hatteras to renounce his project He tried every means his heart dictated from humble supplications to friendly threats but he could gain nothing a sort of frenzy had come over the captain an absolute monomania about the Pole Nothing but violent measures would keep him back from destruction but the Doctor was unwilling to employ these unless driven to extremity He trusted moreover that physical impossibilities insuperable obstacles would bar his further progress and meantime finding all protestations were useless he simply said Very well since you are bent on it we ll go too Yes replied Hatteras half way up the mountain but not a step beyond You know you have to carry back to England the duplicate of the document in the cairn Yes but It is settled said Hatteras in an imperious tone and since the prayers of a friend will not suffice the captain commands The Doctor did not insist longer and a few minutes after the little band set out accompanied by Duk It was about eight o clock when they commenced their difficult ascent the sky was splendid and the thermometer stood at fifty two deg Hatteras and his dog went first closely followed by the others I am afraid said Johnson to the Doctor No no there s nothing to be afraid of we are here This singular little island appeared to be of recent formation and was evidently the product of successive volcanic eruptions The rocks were all lying loose on the top of each other and it was a marvel how they preserved their equilibrium Strictly speaking the mountain was only a heap of stones thrown down from a height and the mass of rocks which composed the island had evidently come out of the bowels of the earth The earth indeed may be compared to a vast cauldron of spherical form in which under the influence of a central fire immense quantities of vapours are generated which would explode the globe but for the safety valves outside These safety valves are volcanoes when one closes another opens and at the Poles where the crust of the earth is thinner owing to its being flattened it is not surprising that a volcano should be suddenly formed by the upheaving of some part of the ocean bed The Doctor while following Hatteras was closely following all the peculiarities of the island and he was further confirmed in his opinion as to its recent formation by the absence of water Had it existed for centuries the thermal springs would have flowed from its bosom As they got higher the ascent became more and more difficult for the flanks of the mountain were almost perpendicular and it required the utmost care to keep them from falling Clouds of scoriae and ashes would whirl round them repeatedly threatening them with asphyxia or torrents of lava would bar their passage In parts where these torrents ran horizontally the outside had become hardened while underneath was the boiling lava and every step the travellers took had first to be tested with the iron tipped staff to avoid being suddenly plunged into the scalding liquid At intervals large fragments of red hot rock were thrown up from the crater and burst in the air like bomb shells scattering the debris to enormous distances in all directions Hatteras however climbed up the steepest ascents with surprising agility disdaining the help of his staff He arrived before long at a circular rock a sort of plateau about ten feet wide A river of boiling lava surrounded it except in one part where it forked away to a higher rock leaving a narrow passage through which Hatteras fearlessly passed Here he stopped and his companions managed to rejoin him He seemed to be measuring with his eye the distance he had yet to get over Horizontally he was not more than two hundred yards from the top of the crater but vertically he had nearly three times that distance to traverse The ascent had occupied three hours already Hatteras showed no signs of fatigue while the others were almost spent The summit of the volcano appeared inaccessible and the Doctor determined at any price to prevent Hatteras from attempting to proceed He tried gentle means first but the captain s excitement was fast becoming delirium During their ascent symptoms of insanity had become more and more marked and no one could be surprised who knew anything of his previous history Hatteras said the Doctor it is enough we cannot go further Stop then he replied in a strangely altered voice I am going higher No it is useless you are at the Pole already No no higher higher My friend do you know who is speaking to you It is I Doctor Clawbonny Higher higher repeated the madman Very well we shall not allow it that is all He had hardly uttered the words before Hatteras by a superhuman effort sprang over the boiling lava and was beyond the reach of his companions A cry of horror burst from every lip for they thought the poor captain must have perished in that fiery gulf but there he was safe on the other side accompanied by his faithful Duk who would not leave him He speedily disappeared behind a curtain of smoke and they heard his voice growing fainter in the distance shouting To the north to the north to the top of Mount Hatteras Remember Mount Hatteras All pursuit of him was out of the question it was impossible to leap across the fiery torrent and equally impossible to get round it Altamont indeed was mad enough to make an attempt and would certainly have lost his life if the others had not held him back by main force Hatteras Hatteras shouted the Doctor but no response was heard save the faint bark of Duk At intervals however a glimpse of him could be caught through the clouds of smoke and showers of ashes Sometimes his head sometimes his arm appeared then he was out of sight again and a few minutes later was seen higher up clinging to the rocks His size constantly decreased with the fantastic rapidity of objects rising upwards in the air In half an hour he was only half his size The air was full of the deep rumbling noise of the volcano and the mountain shook and trembled From time to time a loud fail was heard behind and the travellers would see some enormous rock rebounding from the heights to engulph itself in the polar basin below Illustration Hatteras did not even turn once to look back but marched straight on carrying his country s flag attached to his staff P two hundred forty nine Hatteras did not even turn once to look back but marched straight on carrying his country s flag attached to his staff His terrified friends watched every movement and saw him gradually decrease to microscopic dimensions while Duk looked no larger than a big rat Then came a moment of intense anxiety for the wind beat down on them an immense sheet of flame and they could see nothing but the red glare A cry of agony escaped the Doctor but an instant afterwards Hatteras reappeared waving his flag For a whole hour this fearful spectacle went on an hour of battle with unsteady loose rocks and quagmires of ashes where the foolhardy climber sank up to his waist Sometimes they saw him hoist himself up by leaning knees and loins against the rocks in narrow intricate winding paths and sometimes he would be hanging on by both hands to some sharp crag swinging to and fro like a withered tuft Illustration At last he reached the summit of the mountain the mouth of the crater Here the Doctor hoped the infatuated man would stop at any rate and would perhaps recover his senses and expose himself to no more danger than the descent involved Once more he shouted Hatteras Hatteras There was such a pathos of entreaty in his tone that Altamont felt moved to his inmost soul I ll save him yet he exclaimed and before Clawbonny could hinder him he had cleared with a bound the torrent of fire and was out of sight among the rocks Meantime Hatteras had mounted a rock which overhung the crater and stood waving his flag amidst showers of stones which rained down on him Duk was by his side but the poor beast was growing dizzy in such close proximity to the abyss Hatteras balanced his staff in one hand and with the other sought to find the precise mathematical point where all the meridians of the globe meet the point on which it was his sublime purpose to plant his foot All at once the rock gave way and he disappeared A cry of horror broke from his companions and rang to the top of the mountain Clawbonny thought his friend had perished and lay buried for ever in the depths of the volcano A second only a second though it seemed an age elapsed and there was Altamont and the dog holding the ill fated Hatteras Man and dog had caught him at the very moment when he disappeared in the abyss Hatteras was saved Saved in spite of himself and half an hour later be lay unconscious in the arms of his despairing companions When he came to himself the Doctor looked at him in speechless anguish for there was no glance of recognition in his eye It was the eye of a blind man who gazes without seeing Good heavens exclaimed Johnson he is blind No replied Clawbonny no My poor friends we have only saved the body of Hatteras his soul is left behind on the top of the volcano His reason is gone Insane exclaimed Johnson and Altamont in consternation Insane replied the Doctor and the big tears ran down his cheeks CHAPTER XXV RETURN SOUTH Three hours after this sad denouement of the adventures of Captain Hatteras the whole party were back once more in the grotto Clawbonny was asked his opinion as to what was best to be done Well friends he said we cannot stay longer in this island the sea is open and we have enough provisions We ought to start at once and get back without the least delay to Fort Providence where we must winter That is my opinion too said Altamont The wind is favourable so to morrow we will get to sea The day passed in profound dejection The insanity of the captain was a bad omen and when they began to talk over the return voyage their hearts failed them for fear They missed the intrepid spirit of their leader However like brave men they prepared to battle anew with the elements and with themselves if ever they felt inclined to give way Illustration Next morning they made all ready to sail and brought the tent and all its belongings on board But before leaving these rocks never to return the Doctor carrying out the intentions of Hatteras had a cairn erected on the very spot where the poor fellow had jumped ashore It was made of great blocks placed one on the top of the other so as to be a landmark perfectly visible while the eruptions of the volcano left it undisturbed On one of the side stones Bell chiselled the simple inscription JOHN HATTERAS The duplicate of the document attesting the discovery of the North Pole was enclosed in a tinned iron cylinder and deposited in the cairn to remain as a silent witness among those desert rocks This done the four men and the captain a poor body without a soul set out on the return voyage accompanied by the faithful Duk who had become sad and downcast A new sail was manufactured out of the tent and about ten o clock the little sloop sailed out before the wind She made a quick passage finding abundance of open water It was certainly easier to get away from the Pole than to get to it But Hatteras knew nothing that was passing around him He lay full length in the boat perfectly silent with lifeless eye and folded arms and Duk lying at his feet Clawbonny frequently addressed him but could elicit no reply On the fifteenth they sighted Altamont Harbour but as the sea was open all along the coast they determined to go round to Victoria Bay by water instead of crossing New America in the sledge The voyage was easy and rapid In a week they accomplished what had taken a fortnight in the sledge and on the twenty third they cast anchor in Victoria Bay As soon as the sloop was made fast they all hastened to Fort Providence But what a scene of devastation met their eyes Doctor s House stores powder magazine fortifications all had melted away and the provisions had been ransacked by devouring animals The navigators had almost come to the end of their supplies and had been reckoning on replenishing their stores at Fort Providence The impossibility of wintering there now was evident and they decided to get to Baffin s Bay by the shortest route We have no alternative said Clawbonny Baffin s Bay is not more than six hundred miles distant We can sail as long as there is water enough under our sloop and get to Jones Sound and then on to the Danish settlements Yes said Altamont let us collect what food remains and be off at once After a thorough search a few cases of pemmican were found scattered here and there and two barrels of preserved meat altogether enough for six weeks and a good supply of powder It was soon collected and brought on board and the remainder of the day was employed in caulking the sloop and putting her in good trim Next morning they put out once more to sea The voyage presented no great difficulties the drift ice being easily avoided but still the Doctor thought it advisable in case of possible delays to limit the rations to one half This was no great hardship as there was not much work for anyone to do and all were in perfect health Besides they found a little shooting and brought down ducks and geese and guillemots or sea turtledoves Water they were able to supply themselves with in abundance from the fresh water icebergs they constantly fell in with as they kept near the coast not daring to venture out to the open sea in so frail a barque At that time of the year the thermometer was already constantly below freezing point The frequent rains changed to snow and the weather became gloomy Each day the sun dipped lower below the horizon and on the thirtieth for a few minutes he was out of sight altogether However the little sloop sailed steadily on without stopping an instant They knew what fatigues and obstacles a land journey involved if they should be forced to adopt it and no time was to be lost for soon the open water would harden to firm ground already the young ice had begun to form In these high latitudes there is neither spring nor autumn winter follows close on the heels of summer On the thirty first the first stars glimmered overhead and from that time forwards there was continual fog which considerably impeded navigation The Doctor became very uneasy at these multiplied indications of approaching winter He knew the difficulties Sir John Ross had to contend with after he left his ship to try and reach Baffin s Bay and how after all he was compelled to return and pass a fourth winter on board It was bad enough with shelter and food and fuel but if any such calamity befell the survivors of the Forward if they were obliged to stop or return they were lost Illustration The Doctor said nothing of his anxieties to his companions but only urged them to get as far east as possible At last after thirty days tolerably quick sailing and after battling for forty eight hours against the increasing drift ice and risking the frail sloop a hundred times the navigators saw themselves blocked in on all sides Further progress was impossible for the sea was frozen in every direction and the thermometer was only fifteen deg above zero Altamont made a reckoning with scrupulous precision and found they were in seventy seven deg fifteen latitude and eighty five deg two longitude This is our exact position then said the Doctor We are in South Lincoln just at Cape Eden and are entering Jones Sound With a little more good luck we should have found open water right to Baffin s Bay But we must not grumble If my poor Hatteras had found as navigable a sea at first he would have soon reached the Pole His men would not have deserted him and his brain would not have given way under the pressure of terrible trial I suppose then said Altamont our only course is to leave the sloop and get by sledge to the east coast of Lincoln Yes but I think we should go through Jones Sound and get to South Devon instead of crossing Lincoln Why Because the nearer we get to Lancaster Sound the more chance we have of meeting whalers You are right but I question whether the ice is firm enough to make it practicable We ll try replied Clawbonny The little vessel was unloaded and the sledge put together again All the parts were in good condition so the next day the dogs were harnessed and they started off along the coast to reach the ice field but Altamont s opinion proved right They could not get through Jones Sound and were obliged to follow the coast to Lincoln At last on the twenty fourth they set foot on North Devon Now said Clawbonny we have only to cross this and get to Cape Warender at the entrance to Lancaster Sound But the weather became frightful and very cold The snow storms and tempests returned with winter violence and the travellers felt too weak to contend with them Their stock of provisions was almost exhausted and rations had to be reduced now to a third that the dogs might have food enough to keep them in working condition The nature of the ground added greatly to the fatigue North Devon is extremely wild and rugged and the path across the Trauter mountains is through difficult gorges The whole party men and dogs and sledge alike were frequently forced to stop for they could not struggle on against the fury of the elements More than once despair crept over the brave little band hardy as they were and used to Polar sufferings Though scarcely aware of it themselves they were completely worn out physically and mentally It was not till the thirtieth of August that they emerged from these wild mountains into a plain which seemed to have been upturned and convulsed by volcanic action at some distant period Here it was absolutely necessary to take a few days rest for the travellers could not drag one foot after the other and two of the dogs had died from exhaustion None of the party felt equal to put up the tent so they took shelter behind an iceberg Provisions were now so reduced that notwithstanding their scanty rations there was only enough left for one week Starvation stared the poor fellows in the face Illustration Dead frozen P two hundred sixty two Altamont who had displayed great unselfishness and devotion to the others roused his sinking energies and determined to go out and find food for his comrades He took his gun called Duk and went off almost unnoticed by the rest He had been absent about an hour and only once during that time had they heard the report of his gun and now he was coming back empty handed but running as if terrified What is the matter asked the Doctor Down there under the snow said Altamont speaking as if scared and pointing in a particular direction What A whole party of men Alive Dead frozen and even He did not finish the sentence but a look of unspeakable horror came over his face The Doctor and the others were so roused by this incident that they managed to get up and drag themselves after Altamont towards the place he indicated They soon arrived at a narrow part at the bottom of a ravine and what a spectacle met their gaze Dead bodies already stiff lay half buried in a winding sheet of snow A leg visible here an arm there and yonder shrunken hands and rigid faces stamped with the expression of rage and despair The Doctor stooped down to look at them more closely but instantly started back pale and agitated while Duk barked ominously Horrible horrible he said What is it asked Johnson Don t you recognize them What do you mean Look and see It was evident this ravine had been but recently the scene of a fearful straggle with cold and despair and starvation for by certain horrible remains it was manifest that the poor wretches had been feeding on human flesh perhaps while still warm and palpitating and among them the Doctor recognized Shandon Pen and the ill fated crew of the Forward Their strength had failed provisions had come to an end their boat had been broken perhaps by an avalanche or engulphed in some abyss and they could not take advantage of the open sea or perhaps they had lost their way in wandering over these unknown continents Moreover men who set out under the excitement of a revolt were not likely to remain long united The leader of a rebellion has but a doubtful power and no doubt Shandon s authority had been soon cast off Be that as it might it was evident the crew had come through agonies of suffering and despair before this last terrible catastrophe but the secret of their miseries is buried with them beneath the polar snows Come away come away said the Doctor dragging his companions from the scene Horror gave them momentary strength and they resumed their march without stopping a minute longer CHAPTER XXVI CONCLUSION It would be useless to enumerate all the misfortunes which befell the survivors of the expedition Even the men themselves were never able to give any detailed narrative of the events which occurred during the week subsequent to the horrible discovery related in the last chapter However on the ninth of September by superhuman exertions they arrived at last at Cape Horsburg the extreme point of North Devon They were absolutely starving For forty eight hours they had tasted nothing and their last meal had been off the flesh of their last Esquimaux dog Bell could go no further and Johnson felt himself dying They were on the shore of Baffin s Bay now half frozen over that is to say on the road to Europe and three miles off the waves were dashing noiselessly on the sharp edges of the ice field Here they must wait their chance of a whaler appearing and for how long But Heaven pitied the poor fellows for the very next day Altamont distinctly perceived a sail on the horizon Every one knows the torturing suspense that follows such an appearance and the agonizing dread lest it should prove a false hope The vessel seems alternately to approach and recede and too often just at the very moment when the poor castaways think they are saved the sail begins to disappear and is soon out of sight Illustration Two hours later after unheard of exertions the survivors of the Forward were picked up by the Hans Christian P two hundred sixty six The Doctor and his companions went through all these experiences They had succeeded in reaching the western boundary of the ice field by carrying and pushing each other along and they watched the ship gradually fade away from view without observing them in spite of their loud cries for help Just then a happy inspiration came to the Doctor His fertile genius which had served him many a time in such good stead supplied him with one last idea A floe driven by the current struck against the icefield and Clawbonny exclaimed pointing to it This floe His companions could not understand what he meant Let us embark on it let us embark on it Oh mister Clawbonny mister Clawbonny said Johnson pressing his hand Bell assisted by Altamont hurried to the sledge and brought back one of the poles which he stuck fast on the ice like a mast and fastened it with ropes The tent was torn up to furnish a sail and as soon as the frail raft was ready the poor fellows jumped upon it and sailed out to the open sea Two hours later after unheard of exertions the survivors of the Forward were picked up by the Hans Christian a Danish whaler on her way to Davis Straits They were more like spectres than human beings and the sight of their sufferings was enough It told its own tale but the captain received them with such hearty sympathy and lavished on them such care and kindness that he succeeded in keeping them alive Ten days afterwards Clawbonny Johnson Bell Altamont and Captain Hatteras landed at Korsam in Zealand an island belonging to Denmark They took the steamer to Kiel and from there proceeded by Altona and Hamburg to London where they arrived on the thirteenth of the same month scarcely recovered after their long sufferings The first care of Clawbonny was to request the Royal Geographical Society to receive a communication from him He was accordingly admitted to the next Illustration P two hundred sixty seven seance and one can imagine the astonishment of the learned assembly and the enthusiastic applause produced by the reading of Hatteras document The English have a passion for geographical discovery from the lord to the cockney from the merchant down to the dock labourer and the news of this grand discovery speedily flashed along the telegraph wires throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom Hatteras was lauded as a martyr by all the newspapers and every Englishman felt proud of him The Doctor and his companions had the honour of being presented to the Queen by the Lord Chancellor and they were feted and lionized in all quarters The Government confirmed the names of Queen s Island Mount Hatteras and Altamont Harbour Altamont would not part from his companions in misery and glory but followed them to Liverpool where they were joyously welcomed back after being so long supposed dead and buried beneath the eternal snows But doctor Clawbonny would never allow that any honour was due to himself He claimed all the merit of the discovery for his unfortunate captain and in the narrative of his voyage published the next year under the auspices of the Royal Geographical Society he places John Hatteras on a level with the most illustrious navigators and makes him the compeer of all the brave daring men who have sacrificed themselves for the progress of science The insanity of this poor victim of a sublime passion was of a mild type and he lived quietly at Sten Cottage a private asylum near Liverpool where the Doctor himself had placed him He never spoke and understood nothing that was said to him reason and speech had fled together The only tie that connected him with the outside world was his friendship for Duk who was allowed to remain with him For a considerable time the captain had been in the habit of walking in the garden for hours accompanied by his faithful dog who watched him with sad wistful eyes but his promenade was always in one direction in a particular part of the garden When he got to the end of this path he would stop and begin to walk backwards If anyone stopped him he would point with his finger towards a certain part of the sky but let anyone attempt to turn him round and he became angry while Duk as if sharing his master s sentiments would bark furiously The Doctor who often visited his afflicted friend noticed this strange proceeding one day and soon understood the reason of it He saw how it was that he paced so constantly in a given direction as if under the influence of some magnetic force This was the secret John Hatteras invariably walked towards the North The End End of the Voyage Extraordinaire End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Field of Ice by Jules
