chopped and put in it and a little parsley oyster sauce and celery sauce are good with boiled turkey or chicken To Boil Beef Tongue Corned Beef c If the tongue is dry let it soak for several hours put it to boil in cold water and keep it boiling slowly for two hours but if it is just out of the pickle the water should boil when it goes in Corned or pickled beef or pork require longer boiling than that which is dry you can tell when it is done by the bones coming out easily Pour drawn butter over it when dished To Boil a Ham A large ham should boil three or four hours very slowly it should be put in cold water and be kept covered during the whole process a small ham will boil in two hours All bacon requires much the same management and if you boil cabbage or greens with it skim all the

boil in an hour and a half dish it up with drawn butter Oyster sauce is an improvement to boiled veal Roasting Meat Roasting either meat or poultry requires more attention than boiling or stewing it is very important to baste it frequently and if the meat has been frozen it should have time to thaw before cooking Beef veal or mutton that is roasted in a stove or oven requires more flour dredged on it than when cooked before the fire in a tin kitchen There should be but little water in the dripping pan as that steams the meat and prevents its browning it is best to add more as the water evaporates and where there is plenty of flour on the meat it incorporates with the gravy and it requires no thickening add a little seasoning before you take up the gravy Meat that has been hanging up some time should be roasted in preference to boiling as the fire extracts any taste it may have acquired To rub fresh meat with salt and pepper will prevent the flies from troubling it and will make it keep longer To Roast a Turkey to make Gravy c A very large turkey will take three hours to roast and is best done before the fire in a tin oven Wash the turkey very clean and let it lay in salt and

and an egg if the bread is dry moisten it with boiling water mix all well together and fill the turkey if you have fresh sausage put some in the craw have a pint of water in the bottom of the dripping pan or oven with some salt and a spoonful of lard or butter rub salt pepper and butter over the breast baste it often and turn it so that each part will be next the fire Gravy may be made from the drippings in the oven by boiling it in a skillet with thickening and seasoning Hash gravy should be made by boiling the giblets and neck in a quart of water which chop fine then season and thicken have both the gravies on the table in separate tureens Cranberry and damson sauce are suitable to eat with roast poultry To Roast a Goose Make a stuffing of bread butter salt pepper sage thyme and onions it requires but little butter as geese are generally fat wash it well in salt and water wipe it and rub the inside with salt and pepper A common sized goose will roast in an hour and a small one in less time pour off nearly all the fat that drips from the goose as it will make the gravy too rich Make hash gravy of the giblets the same as for turkey Ducks Wild ducks are generally cooked without stuffing and for those that like them rare fifteen or twenty minutes will be long enough for common ducks a stuffing should be made the same as for a goose they will roast in half an hour Currant jelly and apple sauce should be eaten with ducks and geese Chickens A large fowl will roast in an hour and a small one in half an hour boil the livers and gizzards in a skillet with a pint of water thicken and season for gravy The breasts of the chickens should be rubbed with butter or lard to keep them from breaking Tie the legs in to keep them from bursting out When butter is scarce it is a good way to make rich short cake to stuff poultry with it will require nothing added but pepper parsley c To Roast Beef Season the beef with pepper and salt and put it in the tin kitchen well skewered to the spit with a pint of water in the bottom baste and turn it frequently so that every part may have the fire A very large piece of beef will take three hours to roast when it is done pour

the feet with twine have a pint and a half of water in the bottom of the tin kitchen with a spoonful of lard and a little salt with this baste it and turn it so as each part will have the benefit of the fire It should be basted until the skin begins to get stiff with the heat of the fire then grease it all over with butter or lard and continue to turn it before the fire but baste no more or the skin will blister A pig will take from two to three hours to roast according to the size when it is done pour the water out in a skillet season it and thicken it with flour and water To make hash

in the middle let it cook slowly for about two hours have hot water in a tea kettle and if it should dry up too much pour some in just before you dish it add a little parsley and thyme Veal lamb and

dough Giblet Pie and Soup If you can get livers and gizzards from market you can have a very nice pie made the same as chicken pie or soup with dumplings made of milk egg and flour beaten together and

joint cut grease a pan with lard and lay the pieces in put in some lumps of butter and season it well with pepper and salt then pour the batter over and bake it an hour in a stove or dutch oven Veal or beef makes a very nice pudding done in the same way but the batter need not be as rich as for chicken and it requires no butter Or it makes a good dish if you cut slices of ham after it will not do to appear on the table make a batter as for other pudding put in a little butter and pepper and bake it in a pan Cold Chicken With Vinegar Cut up the chicken in small pieces and crack the bones season it with salt and pepper and put it in a deep baking plate with a lump of butter and a table spoonful of vinegar cover it with hot water put a plate over and let it stew on a stove or hot embers Chicken Salad Cut up the white parts of a cold chicken season it with oil or drawn butter mustard pepper salt and celery chopped very fine and a little vinegar Turkey salad is made in the same manner as above Stewed Chickens With Rice The rice must first be soaked in water and very nicely washed or it will not be white two tea cupsful of rice are sufficient to serve with one chicken and must be boiled in a quart of water which should be boiling when you put the rice in add a dessert spoonful of salt generally half an hour is long enough to boil rice and it must not be too long in the water after it is done or it is less wholesome Drain the water off if the rice has not absorbed it and place it in the bottom of the dish the chicken must be in preparation at the same time with the rice and should be cut up at the joints as for fried or fricasseed chicken and salted and seasoned boil it in a little more water than sufficient to cover it and when it is done take it out and lay it over the rice on the dish then rub a small piece of butter with sufficient flour to thicken it and stir both together in the liquor which must remain over the fire for about two minutes and just before it is taken up add the yelk of an egg well beaten and some chopped parsley it must then be immediately poured over the chicken In preparing this dish take care that it does not get smoked SOUPS In making soup allow yourself plenty of time Dumplings should be put in about half an hour before the soup is done and herbs a quarter of an hour vegetables about an hour rice twenty minutes If herbs are put in too soon the flavor will fly off and be lost Chicken Soup Cut up the chicken cut each joint and let it boil an hour make dumplings of a pint of milk an egg a little salt and flour stirred in till quite stiff drop this in a spoonful at a time while it is boiling stir in a little thickening with enough pepper salt and parsley to season the whole let it boil a few minutes longer and take it up in a tureen Chopped celery is a great improvement to chicken soup and new corn cut off the cob and put in when it is half done gives it a very nice flavor Brown Calf s Head Soup Scald and clean the head and put it to boil with two gallons of water a shank of veal three onions two carrots a little bacon and a bunch of sweet herbs When they have boiled half an hour take out the head and shank of veal and cut all the meat off the bones into pieces of two inches square let the soup boil half an hour longer when strain it and put in the meat season it with salt cayenne and black pepper and cloves if you like thicken it with butter and browned flour and let it boil nearly an hour put some fried force meat balls in the tureen and just before you pour out the soup stir into it a table spoonful of sugar browned in a frying pan and half a pint of wine This resembles turtle soup Beef Shin Soup Mutton Soup c Crack the shin in several pieces and wash it through three waters put it in a pot of water four hours before dinner when it begins to boil take off the scum as it risen and keep it covered an hour before it is done skim off all the fat and put in potatoes onions turnips carrots and cut cabbage if you like it either beat up dumplings with eggs and milk or roll them out of dough made as pie crust a few minutes before it is done stir in thickening with parsley thyme pepper and salt and tomatoes if they are in season then dish it for dinner A shin will make a good dinner for a large family and will do to warm up if any is left To eat pickles with it or pour a little vinegar in your plate is an improvement Soup made of mutton veal and lamb does not require many vegetables carrots and potatoes are the most suitable A shank of veal or mutton will make a small pot of very good soup Celery cut fine is very nice seasoning Gumbo Soup Take two pounds fresh beef put this in a dinner pot with two gallons of water after boiling two hours throw in a quarter of a peck of ocra cut into small slices and about a quart of ripe tomatoes peeled and cut up slice four or five large onions fry them brown and dust in while they are frying from your dredge box several spoonsful of flour add

it rise again Have your baking pans greased and when it is light mould out the bread and put it in them set it by the fire covered with a cloth till it begins to crack on the top when it is light enough to bake To bake in a stove requires care to turn it frequently if it browns too fast at first leave the door open a little while a thick loaf will bake in an hour and a small one in less time In trying the heat of a stove drop a few drops of water on the top if it boils gently it is in good order and the heat should be kept at this point To Bake a Dutch oven Loaf If you wish to make a large loaf it will take three pints of water more than half a tea cup of yeast and two spoonsful of salt when the rising is light knead it up have the dutch oven greased put it in and set it near the fire but not so near that it will scald When it rises so as to crack on the top set the oven on coals have the lid hot cut the loaf slightly across the top dividing it in four stick it with a fork and put the lid on when it is on a few minutes see that it does not bake too fast it should have but little heat at the bottom and the coals on the top should be renewed frequently turn the oven round occasionally If baked slowly it will take an hour and a half when done wrap it in a large cloth till it gets cold To Bake in a Brick Oven If you have a large family or board the laborers of a farm it is necessary to have a brick oven so as to bake but twice a week and to persons that understand the management of them it is much the easiest way If you arrange every thing with judgment half a dozen loaves of bread as many pies or puddings rusk rolls or biscuit may be baked at the same time Some persons knead up their bread over night in winter to do this the sponge should be made up at four o clock in the afternoon If you wish to put corn flour in your bread scald one quart of it to six loaves and work it in the flour that you are going to stir in the rising to make six loaves of bread you should have three quarts of water and a tea cup of yeast Scalded corn flour or boiled mashed potatoes assists bread to rise very much in cold weather Have a quart of potatoes well boiled and rolled fine with a rolling pin on your cake board mix them well in the rising after it is light if the oven is not ready move the bread to a cool place If the bread is sour before you mould it out mix a heaped tea spoonful of salaeratus in a little water spread out the bread on the board dust a little flour on it and spread the salaeratus and water over and work it well through This quite takes away the sour taste but if the bread is made of good lively yeast it seldom requires it let it rise in the pans about half an hour Many persons that make their own bread are in the constant practice of using salaeratus putting in the rising for six loaves a heaped tea spoonful dissolved in a little warm water in this there is no disadvantage and it insures sweet bread and will also answer in making rolls or light cakes Common sized loaves will bake in an hour in the brick oven If they slip easily in the pans and upon breaking a little piece from the side it rises from the pressure of the finger it is done but if it should not rise put it back again when the bread is taken out of the oven wrap it in a cloth till quite cold You should have a large tin vessel with holes in the top to keep bread in in this way it will be moist at the end of the week in cool weather Coarse brown flour or middlings makes very sweet light bread by putting in scalded corn meal say to two loaves half a pint and is also good to use for breakfast made as buckwheat cakes Directions for Heating a Brick Oven c It is very important to have good oven wood split fine and the oven filled with it as soon as the baking is out by this precaution it is always ready and dry Early in the morning take out half of the wood and spread the remainder over the oven in such a way as it will take fire easily light a few sticks in the fire and put them in when it burns well turn the wood about and occasionally add more till it is all in when it is burnt to coals stir them about well with a long handled shovel made for the purpose When it looks bright on the top and sides it is hot enough let the coals lay all over the bottom till near the time of putting in the bread when draw them to the mouth as it is apt to get cool the quickest If you have biscuit to bake put some of the coals on one side near the front as they require a quick heat and should be put in immediately after the coals are taken out they will bake in fifteen or twenty minutes When all the coals are taken out if the bottom of the oven sparkles it is very hot and should wait a few minutes but if not you may put in the bread first and then the pies if you have a plain rice pudding to bake it should be put in the middle of the front and have two or three shovels of coals put round it if the oven is rather cool Close the oven with a wooden stopper made to fit it after they have been in a few minutes see that they do not brown too fast if so keep the stopper down a little while Pies made of green fruit will bake in three quarters of an hour but if the fruit has been stewed half an hour will be long enough Rusk or rolls take about half an hour to bake in a brick oven if you should have to open the oven very often before the bread is done put in a few shovels of coals and shut it up When all is taken out fill the oven with wood ready for the next baking There is nothing in any department of cooking that gives more satisfaction to a young housekeeper than to have accomplished what is called a good baking Graham Bread Take six quarts of unbolted flour one tea cup of good yeast and six spoonsful of molasses mix them with a pint of milk warm water and a tea spoonful of salaeratus make a hole in the flour and stir this mixture in it till it is like batter then proceed as with fine flour Mould it when light into four loaves Have your oven hotter than for other bread and bake it fully one hour and a half It is an excellent article of diet for dyspeptic and sedentary persons Dyspepsy Bread This is three fourths unbolted flour and the remaining fourth common flour and is risen and made as other light bread but should be baked rather more Yeast It is important to those that make their own bread to make their own yeast or they cannot judge of its strength The best is the old fashioned hop yeast which will keep for six weeks in winter Put a pint of hops in a pot with a quart of water cover it tightly and let it boil slowly for half an hour strain it while boiling hot on a pint of flour and a heaped table spoonful of salt stir it well and let it stand till nearly cool when put in a tea cupful of good yeast if it is not sweet put in a little salaeratus just as you stir it in keep it in a warm place till it rises when put it in a stone jug and cork it tightly Keep it in a cool place in summer but do not let it freeze in winter shake it before you use any When your yeast jug is empty fill it with water and let it soak wash it well and if it should smell sour rinse it with salaeratus water If you have a garden raise your own hops by all means pick them by the first of September or they will lose their strength dry them on sheets spread on the garret floor If you buy hops choose light green ones with the yellow dust about them Brown hops have generally stayed too long on the vines Another Method Put two handsful of hops into three pints of water let it boil to one quart when cold strain it on to a pint of best flour a table spoonful of salt half a pint of sugar house molasses and a tea cup of good yeast as it rises skim off the top several times when the yeast looks white bottle it up tight and it will keep for several weeks Corn Flour Dry yeast Put a large handful of good hops in a quart of water cover it close and let it boil nearly half away when strain it over corn flour it must all be wet but not so soft as for bread put in a large spoonful of salt and mix it well when about milk warm put in two table spoonsful of yeast observe that the yeast is lively rub it through with your hands it must be so stiff as just to stick together set it in a warm place to rise which it should do in a few hours When light rub in more corn flour and scatter it in dishes very thin or put it on a cloth on a large waiter spread thinly It should be dried quickly or it may turn sour either in the sun which is best or a warm stove room stir it over frequently when perfectly dry cover it close either in a jar or wooden box and keep it in a dry closet Select a sunny day and begin early in the morning as by this method you may have your yeast dry by night Half a tea cupful is enough for two loaves of wheat bread it should be soaked in water some minutes before using it and it is generally best to put in half a tea spoonful of salaeratus as dry yeast is more apt to turn sour than the liquid yeast Some good housekeepers use this yeast where hops are scarce and it answers very well It will keep good six weeks or two months Potato Yeast Boil four large potatoes with a tea cupful of hops tied loosely in a bag mash the potatoes in a pan with a spoonful of salt and four of flour pour the hop water on it and mix all together when nearly cold put in two table spoonsful of yeast put it in a quart jar and let it rise it will do to use in five or six hours This yeast is much weaker than the first receipt but it has this advantage that with a pint of it you may knead up four loaves of bread at night without making rising It is best to make this yeast once a week always being careful to have the jar sweet before you put it in Potato Yeast with Sugar To about a quart of potatoes boiled and made thin enough with warm water to pass through a sieve add when cold a tea cupful of sugar a table spoonful of salt and a gill of common yeast This is a quick yeast but will not keep so long as those before mentioned Dry Yeast Put a pint of hops in half a gallon of water cover it close and boil it down to one half strain it over flour enough to make a thick batter when nearly cold put in a tea cup of yeast and three table spoonsful of salt when well risen work in as much corn meal as will make it as stiff as biscuit dough add a spoonful of sugar and one of ginger when it rises again make it out into little cakes which must be dried in the shade and turned twice a day If made in dry weather this yeast will keep for several months and is useful when hops are scarce it should be kept in a tight box or a bag hung up in a dry place Milk Yeast If you have no yeast you may make some with milk to rise with Take a pint of new milk and stir in it two tea spoonsful of salt and half a tea cup of flour keep it moderately warm by the fire and it will lighten in about an hour stir in flour enough to make a large loaf of bread with more milk or water This yeast should be used immediately and will do to lighten hop yeast To thicken half a gallon of water with a quarter of a pound of sugar a little salt and flour makes very good yeast when you cannot get hops It will do to use in a day Superior Boiled Milk Rolls Boil a quart of new milk pour it on a quart of flour while boiling hot and stir it well when nearly cold add two tea spoonsful of salt two table spoonsful of

baking pan which has been rubbed with lard or butter set them in a warm place to rise again if the weather is warm on a table in the kitchen but if cold set them by the fire When light put them in a cool place till you are ready to bake they should have a moderate heat and will bake in half an hour In winter they may be moulded out and placed in the bake pan over night for breakfast or some hours before wanted for tea and kept in a cool place till half an hour before baking when set them near the stove to rise up With the addition of nutmeg and sugar you may make nice rusk Egg Rolls Boil a

should be well mixed or beaten If it is mixed over night it should generally be done with cold water and set in the cellar or some cool place in summer in winter it requires rather a warmer place to stand It sours more easily than bread made of other flour In the morning if you find that it is at all acid dissolve half a tea spoonful of salaeratus in warm water and stir it just before it is put to bake Where milk is used it should be baked immediately and the richer the milk the more palatable it is Whatever you bake this bread in should be well greased first as it is more apt to adhere to the oven than some other kinds of flour It should bake with a quick heat When you buy salaeratus pound it fine put it in a wide mouthed bottle and cork it tight Some persons keep it dissolved in water

Common Pies One pound of lard to a gallon of flour will make very good common pies Work the lard in the flour put in some salt and wet it with water make it so that it can just be rolled out when you have put in the fruit wet the crust with water put on the top and close it up stick it with a fork on the top To Stew Fruit for Pies All fruits that are not fully ripe should be stewed and sweetened To boil a gallon of molasses at a time and keep it to sweeten pies is cheaper than sugar and answers a very good purpose where there is a large family When fruit is fully ripe it does very well to bake in pies without being stewed After washing the dried fruit put it on to stew in a bell metal kettle over the fire or in a tin pan in a stove let it have plenty of water as it swells very much and if it seems dry put in more water Apples take longer to stew than peaches and should have more water Fruit stewed in this way is very good to put on the table to eat with meat Do not stir the fruit while it is stewing or it will burn Dried cherries and damsons may be stewed in the same manner adding the sugar before they are quite done Pie Crust Sift a pound and a half of flour and take out a quarter for rolling cut in it a quarter of a pound of lard mix it with water and roll it out cut half a pound of butter and put it in at two rollings with the flour that was left out For making the bottom crust of pies cut half a pound of lard into a pound of flour with a little salt mix it stiff and grease the plates before you make pies always make your paste in a cold place and bake it soon Some persons prefer mixing crust with milk instead of water Paste for Puddings Sift a pound of flour have half a pound of butter and quarter of a pound of lard save out a quarter of the flour for rolling cut the lard into the remainder and mix it with water roll it out and flake in half of the butter dust over it some of the flour close it up roll it again and put in the rest of the butter This quantity will make crust for five or six puddings Another Way To three and a half pounds of sifted flour put two pounds of lard and a piece of volatile salts as large as a full sized nutmeg dissolved in a little water make a pretty stiff paste then roll in three quarters of a pound of butter This will make about eight pies and twelve shells Puff Paste Sift a pound of flour and take out a quarter for rolling divide a pound of butter into four parts cut one part of the butter into the flour with a knife make it a stiff dough with water roll it out and flake it with part of the butler do this three times till it is all in handle it as little as possible and keep it in a cool place This quantity will make crust sufficient for three puddings and ten puffs They should bake with a quick beat but do not let them burn they will take from ten to fifteen minutes to bake according to the number of layers of paste Do not put on the preserves till a short time before they are eaten Rich Mince Pies Take four pounds of beef boiled and chopped fine pick and chop three pounds of suet wash two pounds of currants and one of raisins grate the peel of two lemons and put in the juice pound a spoonful of dried orange peel slice an ounce of citron and chop twelve large apples mix these together with three pounds of sugar half a pint of wine and the same of brandy and sweet cider to make it a proper thickness put in mace and nutmeg to your taste If the cider is not sweet you must put in more sugar before the pies are baked cut several places in the top of each with a pair of scissors Mince Pies not so Rich Take four pounds of beef after it has been boiled and chopped one of suet two of sugar two of raisins and four of chopped apples mix these together with a pint of wine and cider to make it thin enough season to your taste with mace nutmeg and orange peel if it is not sweet enough put in more sugar Warm the pies before they are eaten Where persons are not fond of suet put butter instead and stew the apples instead of so much cider Farmers Mince Pies When you kill a beef save the head for pies it is some trouble to prepare it but it is very nice for the purpose Split the head take out the brains and eyes wash it well in cold water and soak it all night with two hog s heads that have been cleaned in the morning boil them till you can take out the bones easily skim off the froth as it rises or it will stick to the meat pick out the bones and chop it fine with three pounds of suet This should be done the day before you want to bake Mix to this quantity of meat two gallons of chopped apples four pounds of raisins half a gallon of boiled molasses a pint of currant wine a tea cup of rose brandy an ounce of cinnamon orange peel and mace from two to four nutmegs and sweet cider enough to make it the right thickness if the cider is not sweet put in more molasses when all is mixed it is best to bake a small pie as you can alter the seasoning if it is not to your taste If you have not raisins dried cherries or small grapes that have been preserved in molasses are very good or stewed dried apples instead of green and where you have no cider stew the apples in plenty of water so as to have them very soft a little good vinegar sweetened and mixed with water also does instead of cider but is not so good This will make about forty pies and if you have a convenient way of keeping them you may bake all at once as they will keep for two months very readily when the weather is cold If you do not bake all at once put what is left in a jar cover the top

chop Have two heads nicely washed and cleaned boil pick out the bones and chop them mix with the other meat and season as you do other mince pies they do not require any suet The lower crust of mince pies need not be so rich as the top always cut several places in the top crust with scissors to keep the juice from wasting When you warm mince pies do it gradually and do not have the crust scorched Some prefer them cold When the pies are very plain a little preserve syrup and a glass of wine added is an improvement Currant Pie After stemming green currants scald them and allow them to stand awhile pour off the water have the crust in your plates put in the currants sweeten them well put in a little water a dust of flour and a little orange peel Gooseberries are prepared in the same way but require more sugar Cherries should not be scalded Pumpkin Pudding Choose a yellow pumpkin with a fine grain pare and cut it in small pieces boil it in plenty of water and take it up as soon as it

dried and sifted sugar rolled fine spices pounded and sifted Where brown sugar is used it should be spread on a dish and dried before rolling it I have known very good pound cake made with brown sugar also jumbles c Persons that make their own butter sometimes use it fresh from the churn which prevents the necessity of washing the salt out of it for cake and it mixes more readily than hard butter Currants should be picked over washed and dried raisins should be stemmed and stoned When these preparations are made the day before it is a great assistance Eggs should be fresh or they will not beat light in beating the whites take a broad flat dish and beat them until you can hold the dish upside down this is a test of their lightness A large bowl is best for mixing and beating cake You must use your hand for mixing the sugar and butter and as you add the other ingredients you may take a large wooden spoon beat it some time after all is mixed The oven should be ready to bake immediately as standing makes cake heavy A brick oven is the most certain and over your pans of cake you should spread several layers of newspaper to prevent its browning too suddenly Cake requires more time than bread a large cake should stay in the oven from an hour and a half to two hours turning and looking at it from time to time when you think it is sufficiently baked stick a broad bright knife in the centre if it is dry and free from dough when drawn out the cake is likely to be done though sometimes this is not a certain test and you will have to draw a little from the centre of the cake with the knife A broom straw will sometimes answer in a small cake instead of a knife A large stone pan with a cover is the best for keeping cake or a large covered bowl Icing for Cake Roll and sift a pound of loaf sugar whip the whites of three eggs put in the sugar gradually and beat it for half an hour if it is so thick that it will not run put in some rose water let the cake be nearly cool dry it in an oven that is nearly cool Another Way Put the white of one egg and a little rose water into half a pound of pulverized sugar and heat them together till they stand when it is nearly light enough add a few drops of lemon juice or a small portion of tartaric acid dissolved in a little water It must be beaten in a bowl which has never had any thing greasy in it either cream or butter The cake must have a little flour sifted over it and wiped off with a towel then cover it with a thin coat of the icing set it under the stove or in a place that is a little warm and let it harden then add the second coat thicker this will he perfectly white but the first is always dark and has crumbs through it A Rich Fruit Cake Have the following articles prepared before you begin the cake dry and sift four pounds of flour four pounds of butter with the salt washed out two pounds of loaf sugar pounded one ounce of nutmegs grated an ounce of mace pounded wash four pounds of currants dry pick and rub

jar and prick each one with a needle strew over them half their weight in pounded rock candy and fill up the jar with brandy To Conserve Peaches Take the yellow peaches pare them and cut them from the stone in one piece to six pounds of peaches have two pounds of sugar make a syrup of three quarters of a pound of sugar and a little water put them in and let them stay till they are quite clear then

the Use of Earthen Vessels Have your kettle well cleaned and fill it early in the morning with cider made of sound apples and just from the press let it boil half away which may be done by three o clock in the afternoon have pared and cut enough good apples to fill the kettle put them in a clean tub and pour the boiling cider over then scour the kettle and put in the apples and cider let them boil briskly till the apples sink to the bottom slacken the fire and let them stew like preserves till ten o clock at night Some dried quinces stewed in cider and put in are an improvement Season with orange peel cinnamon or cloves just before it is done if you like it sweeter you can put in some sugar an hour before it is done If any thing occur that you cannot finish it in a day pour it in a tub and finish it the next day when it is done put it in stone jars Any thing acid should not be put in earthen vessels as the glazing is poisonous This way of making apple butter requires but little stirring you must keep a constant watch that it does not burn Pears and peaches may be done in the same way and if they are sweet will not require sugar Another Way It is important to have a large copper or bell metal kettle into which put the cider as soon as it comes from the press put it over a brisk fire and boil it half away then put the cider from the kettle into clean stone jars warm the jars to prevent the danger of breaking them have your apples pared and cut over night as many as would fill your kettle twice have the kettle well cleaned and in the morning put in half the cider and fill the kettle nearly full of apples and put it over a brisk fire when they begin to boil up stir them down which may be done two or three times before you put in your stick to stir constantly then put in the rest of the apples and cider as fast as the kettle will take them and boil it four hours after the last apples are put in stirring it all the time you should have for the purpose a stick made of hickory wood somewhat like a common hoe with holes in it Candied Preserves c If your preserves candy set the jars in hot water for half an hour if they are in glass jars put them in something else as glass cracks easily when exposed to heat Preserves made with white Havana sugar are not so liable to candy as others Common preserves are improved and are more certain to keep well by being placed on flat dishes and set in a brick oven after the bread is taken out they may remain two or more hours without injury When preserves are about to boil over you should have a common fan at hand and fan them which will sometimes answer instead of taking them from the fire Cider Marmalade Boil two gallons of sweet cider down to one gallon have ready two gallons of apples pared and cut pour the cider out of the kettle and clean it then put in the apples and pour the cider in and two or three pounds of sugar if it will not hold all conveniently add at intervals let them stew four hours do not stir till they are nearly done stirring makes fruit stick to the kettle and burn if you stir once you must keep on This is a pleasant sauce for dinner or eaten with bread and butter at tea and will keep in a cool place through the winter Tomato Figs Take six pounds of sugar to one peck or sixteen pounds of ripe tomatoes the pear shaped look best put them over the fire without peeling in your preserving kettle their own juice being sufficient without the addition of water boil them until the sugar penetrates and they are clarified They are then taken out spread on dishes flattened and dried in the sun or in a brick oven after the bread is taken out A small quantity of the syrup should be occasionally sprinkled over them whilst drying after which pack them down in jars sprinkling each layer with powdered sugar The syrup is afterwards concentrated and bottled for use They retain surprisingly their flavor which is agreeable and somewhat similar to the best figs Ordinary brown sugar may be used a large portion of which is retained in syrup Molasses Candy or Taffy Put a quart of good molasses not sugar house in a dutch oven or iron pot having previously greased it with butter let it boil very fast stirring it all the time for fifteen minutes then put in a tea cup of sugar and let it boil fifteen minutes longer stirring all the time take a little out on a plate and when it is brittle pour it while hot into tin plates rubbed with butter put it in a cold place and break it up when you want it for use never put taffy in china or earthen plates as they would probably be broken in taking it out Some think it an improvement to add the kernels of black walnuts nicely picked put them in just as you take up the taffy and give it one stir a tea cup of kernels to a pint of molasses is a good proportion Walnut Cheese Take a pint of nice kernels and pound them in a mortar with two tea cups of brown sugar and a table spoonful of water put it in cups or small bowls and it will turn out like other cheese It is a favorite refreshment with some country children CORDIALS WINES VINEGAR PICKLES c Peach Cordial Put a gallon of peach brandy into a wide mouthed

seasoning for cake Quince Cordial Grate the quinces and strain them to every quart of juice put a pound of loaf sugar and a pint of spirits boil strain and bottle it Cherry Cordial Mash and strain the cherries boil the juice and to a gallon put two pounds of sugar and half a pint of spirits the sugar should be boiled in it skim and strain when cold bottle it Lemon Brandy Have a bottle three quarters full of brandy when you use lemons for other purposes pare off the yellow skin very thin cut it small and drop it in the bottle till you get it full Be careful not to put in any of the tough white part as that will give it a bitter taste cork the bottle and keep it to season cakes and puddings Rose Brandy Fill a large bottle with damask rose leaves picked while they are fresh fill the bottle with brandy or good spirits of any kind cork it tightly and set it away for use It will bear filling up several times Blackberry Cordial Mash and strain the blackberries put the juice on to boil in a brass or bell metal kettle skim it well and to each gallon of juice put three pounds of sugar and a quart of spirits bruise some cloves and put in This is valuable as a medicine for children in summer Rose Water Gather the damask rose leaves have a tin pan that will fit under your warming pan wring a thin towel out of water spread it over the pan and put rose leaves on this about two inches thick put another wet towel on top of the leaves and three or four thicknesses of paper on it put hot embers in the warming pan and set it on top of the paper propped up so as not to fall when you renew the coals sprinkle the towel that is at the top of the rose leaves when all the strength is out of the leaves they will be in a cake dry this and put it in your drawers to scent the clothes put another set of leaves in sprinkle the towels and so till you have used up all your rose leaves Rose water is a very nice seasoning for cake or pudding it should be kept corked tightly Cologne Put into a bottle half an ounce of oil of lavender one drachm of oil of rosemary two of essence of lemon two of essence of bergamot forty drops of oil of cinnamon and a little musk if you like it pour on it three pints of best alcohol Blackberry Wine Gather the fruit when fully ripe but before the sun has had time to dry the juice put it in a tub and pour in clear cold water enough to cover it mash it to a pulp with a wooden masher strain it through a linen bag or towel a deal of juice will remain in the pulp which in order to get you must add some sugar to it and boil it in your preserving kettle when you may strain again and will have little left but seeds to every gallon of the liquor add three pounds of good brown sugar pour it in a keg which should stand in a cellar or cool dry place let it stand two or three weeks with the bung laid loosely on as the froth works out fill it up with some of the liquor kept out for the purpose French brandy in the proportion of a quart to five gallons is an improvement At the end of three or four weeks it may be closely bunged and put away in a safe dry closet where it should remain undisturbed for a year when it may be racked off bottled and sealed over Gooseberry Wine Put three pounds of lump sugar in a gallon of water boil and skim it when it is nearly cold pour in it four quarts of ripe gooseberries that have been well mashed and let it stand two days stirring it frequently steep half an ounce of isinglass in a pint of brandy for two days and beat it with the whites of four eggs till they froth and put it in the wine stir it up

have a gallon of it saved in a jug to fill up with as it works out When it is done working bung it up You may rack it off towards spring or it will not hurt it to stand a year If you want a barrel of wine you must have eight gallons of currant juice sixteen of water and seventy two pounds of sugar put in a quart of brandy after it has done working if you can get a clean brandy barrel to put it in it is better than a new one Another Way Mash well together equal quantities of currants and water strain the juice and to every gallon add three pounds of best brown sugar fill the cask two thirds full bung it tight and put clay over by this means the air is excluded while the process of fermentation is going on the cask should be iron bound rack it off and bottle or put in demijohns the next spring after making Elderberry Wine c To each gallon of berries put one of water mash them in a tub and leave them two days stirring them frequently then strain them and to each gallon of juice put

floor Molasses Beer Take five pints of molasses half a pint of yeast two spoonsful of pounded ginger and one of allspice put these into a clean half barrel and pour on it two gallons of boiling water shake it till a fermentation is produced then fill it up with warm water and let it work with the bung out a day when it will be fit for use remove it to a cold place or bottle it This is a very good drink for laboring people in warm weather To Make Cider To make cider that will keep sweet for a length of time requires particular attention to all the points All the works and utensils in use must be perfectly clean so that nothing acid shall come in contact with the pulp or liquor while pressing The casks should be cleaned in the following manner After washing each barrel clean put in a lump of unslaked lime and pour in a gallon of boiling water bung it up and roll the barrel several times a day letting it lay with the bung down in the evening empty out the lime water and wash the barrel clean in several waters after the water is drained out burn a brimstone match in it made of a piece of coarse muslin one inch broad and four long dipped in melted brimstone light one end of the match and put it in put the bung on slightly so as to hold the other end and allow air sufficient to make it burn when the rag has burned out drive in the bung to keep in the sulphuric gas which if allowed time will condense on the sides The apples should be kept under cover and secured from rain After they have laid to mellow for two or three weeks select those that are sound break off the stems and leaves have the trough perfectly clean and after they are ground keep them from the sun and rain for twenty four hours then press them and fill into the casks the first running is always the best each cask that is filled should be numbered so as to know the quality and after they are all filled draw off and mix them the weak with the strong keep the casks filled up with cider while they are fermenting when the fermentation is subsiding there will be a thin white scum rise slowly when this is all off lay on the bung lightly rack it off in a few days in barrels in which brimstone has been used and bung it tight rack it off again in March and keep the bungs in tight To Make Vinegar You may always have good vinegar for pickling and other purposes by taking a little pains Get a tight whiskey barrel if it is clean you need not rinse it and put into it ten gallons of the best vinegar you can procure with one quart of whiskey and one quart of molasses every day for a week add a gallon of good cider that has not been watered and shake the barrel each time let it stand in this state two weeks shaking the barrel frequently After this you may put in a gallon of cider occasionally with any that has been left at table or the settlings of decanters or bottles that have had wine in but do not put in any water It will make much sooner in the garret or a warm place but if the barrel is fixed early in the summer you will have plenty to pickle with in the fall taste it so as not to add cider too fast Have a phial with a string attached to it that you can put in at the bung You should have a barrel of good hard cider before you begin to make vinegar If you are in want of vinegar fill a jug from the barrel and set it in the hot sun where it will turn sour much quicker It is a good plan to keep a jug in a closet where you can empty all the slops of cider and wine and when you get it full empty it in the barrel After the pickling is done you can put as much hard cider in the barrel a gallon at a time as you have taken out with a little molasses and half a pint of whiskey if you put too much of the latter it will prevent it from getting sour but a little gives strength to the cider and the molasses increases the acidity and helps to color it If you should have any juice of cherries currants or blackberries put it in or if you can get cheap sour raisins they will be an improvement to the flavor of the vinegar a tea cup of burnt sugar will give it a good color Vinegar made in this way will keep pickles good for several years If the cider has not sufficient strength it will take longer to make To Pickle Mangoes Pick your musk melons at a proper age before they get too hard make a slit in the sides and take out the seeds with a tea spoon boil a pickle of ground alum salt that will bear an egg and let the melons lay in this a week then make a new pickle and let them lay in it another week then wash them and scald them in weak vinegar or sour cider with cabbage leaves around the kettle put them in a jar and put the vinegar and leaves in with them leave them two days then wipe them carefully and to two dozen mangoes have an ounce of mace one of cloves some nasturtions small onions scraped horse radish and mustard seed sufficient to fill them fill up the inside of each one and tie them round with strings Put them in your kettle with strong vinegar and let them scald a few minutes then put them in a wide mouthed jar and pour the vinegar over have them covered close and they will keep good for several years Large green tomatoes make good mangoes previously salted and drained when fill them as other mangoes For Pickling Mangoes with Oil and Vinegar Cut a square piece out to remove the inside lay them in salt and water nine or ten days and afterwards green them as any other pickle For stuffing take two ounces of garlic dried and pulverized two ounces of horse radish prepared as the garlic two ounces of nutmegs two ounces of cloves two ounces of mace two ounces of whole mustard seed When the mangoes are large put a small cucumber and two beans in each Wipe each mango perfectly dry before the stuffing is put in sew each up and tie twine around it then put them in a pot and pour the pot two thirds full of sharp vinegar pour sweet oil on the top till covered The ingredients must be mixed with sweet oil The spices c mentioned are sufficient for a dozen mangoes Cucumbers Gather the cucumbers while they are small lay them in a jar with salt enough to make a pickle pour in a little water and if there is not salt enough to cover them in a few days put in more At the end of two weeks put them in a kettle with cabbage leaves around and through them fill it up with weak vinegar and let them scald three hours put all in a jar for three days then take out the cucumbers pour out the vinegar and leaves put them back in the jar with some cloves peppers horse radish and mustard boil some strong vinegar and pour over them Small Cucumbers Wash small cucumbers from two to four inches long put a gallon of very strong vinegar in a large jar with mustard seed scraped horse radish and celery seed a small portion of each and a tea cupful of salt put the cucumbers in the jar tie them close Martina s may be pickled in the same way or in the old way of pickling cucumbers To Pickle Cherries or Peaches If peaches wipe them well with a coarse towel if cherries cut the stems half off but do not stone them put them in jars and to every half gallon of vinegar it takes to cover them put a pound of sugar and cloves and cinnamon to taste boil and skim it well and when nearly cool pour it over the fruit for three successive days pour off the vinegar and boil and pour it on again Peaches Pick out sound clingstone peaches lay them in salt and water for a day then wipe them on a coarse cloth boil up some strong vinegar with a little ginger whole pepper and mustard seed put the peaches in a jar and pour this over White Walnuts Take full grown white walnuts or butter nuts before the shells get so hard that a pin will not run through easily put them in a jar boil a pickle of ground alum salt that will bear an egg skim it and when it gets cold pour it on the walnuts let them lay in this ten days then make another pickle as strong as the first and leave them in it ten days longer then scrape each one carefully until you get all the rough skin off wipe them with a very coarse cloth and let them soak in cold water two days boil them in weak vinegar and let them lay in this a week boil enough good vinegar to cover them mix together scraped horse radish mustard seed cloves red pepper onions and garlic put a layer of the walnuts in a jar and sprinkle the spice over pour the boiling vinegar over the top English Walnuts Gather them when nearly full grown but not too hard pour boiling salt and water on them let them be covered with it nine days changing it every third day then take them out on dishes and put them in the sun to blacken turning them over then put them in a jar and strew over them pepper cloves garlic mustard seed and scraped horse radish cover them with cold strong vinegar and tie them up Black Walnuts Gather the walnuts while you can run a pin through them boil them in an iron pot three hours to soften the shell put them in a tub of cold water hull and wash them and put them in your jars pour salt and water over them and change it every day for a week at the end of that time scald them in weak vinegar let them stand in this three days then pour it off and for half a bushel of hulled walnuts have quarter of a pound of cloves a tea cup of mustard seed two spoonsful of black pepper a pint of scraped horse radish two pods of red pepper some sliced onions and garlic put these in the jars with the walnuts and fill them up with strong cold vinegar Pickled walnuts will keep for six or seven years and are as good at the last as the first Virginia Yellow Pickles To two gallons of vinegar put one pound of ginger quarter of a pound of black pepper two ounces of red pepper two of cloves a tea cup of celery seed a pint of horse radish a pint of mustard seed a few onions or garlic and three ounces of turmeric to turn them yellow The above ingredients should be mixed together in a jar and set in the sun by the first of July tied up close with a block over each jar to keep out the rain Put whatever you intend to pickle in salt and water for two or three days then pour boiling salt and water on them wash them and drop them in the jars of vinegar You can pickle any thing in this way but walnuts The same pickle by adding more vinegar to it will do for two years if the jars are set by a fire a much less time will do to take the strength out of the spices the turmeric should be tied up in a bag Tomatoes Scald and peel a peck of ripe tomatoes lay them on dishes and strew salt thickly over them let them stand for twenty four hours occasionally pouring off the liquor that the salt extracts then drain them on a sifter and gently squeeze them as it is this juice that weakens the vinegar and makes the pickles spoil take a large jar put in a layer of tomatoes then a layer of sliced onions mustard seed cloves and white pepper or whole black pepper you may if you like break two pods of red pepper and put in each jar When the jar is full pour very strong vinegar over and in a few days they will be ready for use and will keep all winter They retain much of the tomato flavor and should be kept in a cool place Another Way Take small round tomatoes when they are not too ripe stick them with a needle in several places to keep the skin from bursting and let them lay a week in salt and water then wash them and put them in a jar with some cloves pepper and small onions cover them with strong cold vinegar and tie up the jar Pepper Mangoes Take fully grown green peppers cut a slit in the side of each and take out the seeds make a strong brine and lay them in it for three days then soak them in clear water a day and night pack them in a jar and pour boiling vinegar over them with a piece of alum let them stay in this three days when boil the vinegar again and pour over them when they are green stuff them with chopped cabbage mustard seed cloves horse radish pepper and a small onion in each tie them up put them in a jar boil fresh vinegar and pour over Observe always to have the kettle you boil vinegar in well cleaned never put pickles in common earthen ware as the glazing is poisonous Onions Peel small white onions and pour boiling milk and water over them when cold put them in a jar and make a pickle of strong vinegar a little mace ginger white mustard seed and horse radish boil it and pour over them If you want them to be white do not put in black pepper or cloves Mushrooms Take the small round mushrooms that are pale pink underneath with white tops and peel easily put them in a jar with a little mace white mustard seed and salt cover them with cold vinegar and tie them close If you put in black pepper or cloves it will turn them dark Nasturtions Have some strong vinegar in a jar with a little salt and as you gather the nasturtions put them in and keep the jar tied close Cherries Take sound morel cherries with the stems on and put them in a jar boil spices in strong vinegar and pour over them hot Damsons may be done in the same way A little sugar improves the pickle Cabbage Take firm heads of purple cabbage quarter them sprinkle them with salt and let them lay three or four days when shave them fine drain off the salt and put them in a jar boil enough vinegar to cover them with horse radish pepper and cloves when nearly cold pour it on the cabbage and put in a little cochineal tied up in a bag it will he fit for use in a week Another Way Cut hard cabbage fine as for slaw sprinkle salt through it and let it lay under a moderate pressure for twelve hours then drain well through a colander slice a dozen raw onions have a large jar in readiness put in a layer of cabbage strew in some of the onions a few cloves a tea cupful of mustard seed some whole black pepper cut six half ripe red pepper pods and sprinkle in add a little more salt boil vinegar and pour on sufficient to cover the mixture Cut Cucumbers Slice large cucumbers lengthwise do not pare them then cut them half an inch thick if you have small ones slice them across put them in a large jar and sprinkle them well with salt after standing a day or two pour off the liquid the salt has extracted drain them and wash the jar and put the cucumbers in alternately with sliced onions mustard seed white pepper whole black pepper and a few cloves pour over them strong vinegar and tie close keep them in a cool place but do not allow them to freeze in severe weather as freezing spoils the flavor of pickles When pickles do not keep well pour off the vinegar and put more on but if the vinegar is of the best quality there is little fear of this Putting alcohol on over paper will prevent their moulding Cucumber Catsup Take full grown cucumbers pare them and cut out the lines of white pith which are on three sides cut them in slices about half an inch thick to six cucumbers put one onion sliced fine then sprinkle them with salt placing the fruit in layers with salt between next morning press the liquor from them put them in small jars and fill up with strong vinegar seasoned with pepper mustard seed and salt if necessary The small jars are recommended as the cucumbers do not keep well after they have been exposed to the air Tomato Catsup Take a peck of ripe tomatoes wash and cut out the stems but do not peel them put them over the fire in your bell metal kettle cover them and let them boil till soft enough to mash when pour them in a colander placed over a pan drain them and throw away the liquid then mash and strain the tomatoes a few at a time through a ball sifter this is rather a tedious process but as the waste liquor has been previously drained off the catsup will require but about twenty minutes boiling throw in the spices before you take it up fine pepper and salt mustard and a few whole cloves and sliced onions if you like their flavor allow a tea cup of strong vinegar to each bottle of catsup part of which may be put in with the spices and the rest in each bottle on top of the catsup before you cork and seal them Walnut Catsup Gather the walnuts as for pickling and put them in salt and water for ten days then pound them in a mortar and to every dozen walnuts put a quart of strong vinegar and stir it every day for a week then strain it through a bag and to every quart of liquor put a tea spoonful of pounded mace the same of cloves and a few pieces of garlic or onion boil it twenty minutes and when cold bottle it White or black walnuts are as good for catsup as the English walnut and will keep good for several years Green Tomato Catsup After the tomatoes have ceased to ripen slice and put them in a jar with salt scattered through them let them stand two days then drain them in a colander put them in the jars they are to remain in strewing sliced onions cloves whole pepper mustard seed and one or two red pepper pods through them boil vinegar enough to cover them and pour over tie them close and put a plate on each jar Mushroom Catsup Take the largest mushrooms those that are beginning to turn dark cut off the roots put them in a stone jar with some salt mash them and cover the jar let them stand two days stirring them several times a day then strain and boil the liquor to every quart of which put a tea spoonful of whole pepper and the same of cloves and mustard seed and a little ginger when cold bottle it leaving room in each bottle for a tea cupful of strong vinegar and a table spoonful of brandy cork them up and seal them over Tomato Sauce Scald and peel a peck of ripe tomatoes cut them in slices and lay them on a large dish cover well with salt each layer the next morning put the tomatoes in a colander or on a sifter and drain off all the liquid then mash them with a wooden masher and to each quart put a pint of strong vinegar two table spoonsful of white mustard seed a dozen cloves a dozen grains of black pepper an onion sliced and chopped a table spoonful of salt if mashed fine you can pour it out of wide mouthed bottles put a table spoonful of spirits in each bottle at the top cork tight and seal If you prefer putting the sauce in small stone jars put spirits on paper at the top of each Spiced Peaches Take nine pounds of good ripe peaches rub them with a course towel and halve them put four pounds of sugar and a pint of good vinegar in your preserving kettle with cloves cinnamon and mace when the syrup is formed throw in the peaches a few at a time so as to keep them as whole as may be when clear take them out and put in more boil the syrup till quite rich and then pour it over the peaches Cherries may be done in the same way Mushroom Sauce Gather large mushrooms that have not turned dark peel them and cut off the stems put them in a pan and strew salt over each layer when all are in mash them well then put them in a jar put a plate on the top and set it in a pot of cold water let it heat gradually and boil for fifteen or twenty minutes to each quart of the pulp put three tea cupsful of strong vinegar two tea spoonsful of powdered mace or one of cloves two of white mustard seed one of black pepper put it in jars or wide mouthed bottles with a spoonful of alcohol at the top of each and secure it from the air This is by some preferred to the catsup TO CURE BACON BEEF PORK SAUSAGE c To Cure Bacon To one thousand weight of pork put one bushel of fine salt one pound and a half of saltpetre rolled fine and mixed with the salt rub this on the meat and pack it away in a tight hogshead let it lay for six weeks then hang it up and smoke it with hickory wood every day for two weeks and afterwards two or three times a week for a month then take it down and rub it all over with hickory ashes which is an effectual remedy against the fly or skipper When the weather is unusually warm at the time of salting your pork more care is requisite to preserve it from taint When it is cut up if it seems warm lay it on boards or on the bare ground till it is sufficiently cool for salting examine the meat tubs or casks frequently and if there is an appearance of mould strew salt over if the weather has been very warm after packing and on examining you should find evidence of its spoiling lose no time in unpacking the meat for a hogshead of hams and shoulders that are in this state have six pounds of brown sugar three pounds of salaeratus mixed with half a bushel of salt rub each piece with this and as you pack it in the hogshead which should be well washed and cleaned sprinkle a little coarse salt over each layer of pork and also on the bottom of the hogshead I have known this plan to save a large quantity of pork that would have been unfit for use if it had not been discovered and attended to in time Some persons use crushed charcoal to purify their meat Shoulders are more easily affected than hams and if the weather is warm the ribs should be cut out of the shoulders Jowls also require particular care black pepper about a pound to a hogshead sprinkled on the meat before it is hung up to smoke is valuable as a preventive where flies are troublesome have a large pepper box kept for the purpose and dust every part that is exposed pepper is also good to put on beef before it is hung up to dry wash it off before cooking and it does not injure the flavor To Pickle Pork Take out all the ribs and cut it in pieces of about three pounds each pack it in a tight barrel and salt it well with coarse salt boil a very strong pickle made of coarse salt and when it is cold pour it over the meat and put a weight on the top if you wish pork to keep do not put saltpetre in as it injures the flavor To Cure Hams and Shoulders To cure five hundred weight of hams and shoulders take fifteen quarts of common salt one pound and a half of saltpetre rolled fine half a pound of red pepper pods chopped fine and four quarts of molasses mix them all together and rub the meat well pack it down cover it close and let it remain six weeks then hang it up and smoke it with green hickory wood for three weeks If there is a damp spell of weather it is best to make a fire in your meat house occasionally through the summer to keep the meat from moulding To Make a Pickle for Chines Rub the chines with fine salt and pack them in a tight barrel make a pickle of coarse salt strong enough to bear an egg boil and skim it and when nearly cold pour it on let there be enough to cover them and put a weight on the top Chines are good smoked It is best to make a separate pickle for the heads wash and scrape them cut off the ears and noses and take out the eyes The jowls may be packed and smoked with the bacon Sausage Meat c Separate the tender parts of the meat from the rough and bony pieces and chop each sort separately to twenty two pounds of meat have half a pound of salt three heaped table spoonsful of sage three of pepper and two of thyme If you have a box large enough to hold this quantity sprinkle it over the meat before it is chopped and it will be thoroughly mixed by the time it is done It is best to have a small piece fried to taste and if it is not seasoned right it can be altered you should have some pieces of fat chopped in with the meat The sage and thyme should be carefully dried but not heated too much neither should it be hung up too near the fire as it would spoil the flavor rub it through a wire sifter and if that should not make it fine enough pound it in a mortar or grind it in your pepper mill The pepper should be ground and ready some days before it is needed as the pork season in the country is while it lasts one of the busiest in the year every thing should be prepared beforehand that you possibly can It is a good plan to have plenty of bread and pies baked and a quantity of apples stewed vegetables washed and ready to cook so that every member of the family that is able may devote herself to the work of putting away the meat which is of so much importance for the coming year while some are cutting up the fat to render into lard others may be employed in assorting the sausage meat and cutting it into small pieces for the chopping machine by trimming off every part that can be spared You can have one hundred pounds of sausage from twelve hundred weight of pork and since the introduction of sausage choppers a great deal more sausage is made than formerly by the old method Clean a few of the maws and soak them in salt and water and fill them with sausage meat sew them close let them lay in pickle for two weeks then hang them up and when your meat is smoked let them have a few days smoke In this way sausage will keep all summer and is very nice when boiled slowly for several hours and eaten cold The best fat to chop in with sausage is taken from the chines or back bones To keep sausage for present use put it in small stone pans and pour melted lard over the top for later in the season make muslin bags that will hold about three pounds with a loop sewed on to hang them up by fill them with meat tie them tight and hang them in a cool airy place they will keep in this way till August when you want to fry them rip part of the seam cut out as many slices as you want tie up the bag and hang it up again If you have a large quantity a sausage chopper is a great convenience Liver Sausage Take four livers with the lights and hearts have two heads cleaned and boil them with any scraps or skinny pieces you have skim the pot take out the livers when they are done and let the heads boil longer when they are done pick out the bones and chop all together season with sage thyme sweet marjoram salt and pepper put it in pans and fry it as sausage Bologna Sausage Chop ten pounds of beef with two pounds and a half of the fat of fresh pork pound one ounce of mace and one of cloves and mix in let it stand a day then stuff it in large skins let them lay in brine ten days then hang them up to smoke a few days they can be put in the same brine with beef or tongues Hogs Head Cheese Take off the ears and noses of four heads and pick out the eyes and lay them in salt and water all night then wash and put them on to boil take out the bones carefully chop and season them well and pack it in bowls they will turn out whole and may be eaten cold with vinegar or fried as sausage Pigs Feet Pigs feet should be well cleaned by dipping them in scalding water and scraping off the hairs leave them in weak salt and water two days changing it each day if you wish to boil them for souse they are now ready but if the weather is cold they will keep in this a month They should be kept in a cold place and if they are frozen there is no danger of their spoiling but if there comes on a thaw change the salt and water soak them in fresh water all night before you boil them In this way they are good to eat with pepper and vinegar while hot or may be dipped in batter and fried after they are cold To make Souse Boil the feet till the bones come out easily and pick out all the large bones pack them in a stone pan with pepper and salt and cover it with vinegar they may be eaten cold or dipped in flour and fried Another way is to pick out all the bones season them with salt pepper and sage and warm them up as you want to use them Pigs feet after being boiled are very nice stewed as terrapins make the gravy with butter and water they are nourishing food for delicate persons Vessels for salting meat should be cleaned well after the meat is hung up and set on boards in the cellar if they do not smell sweet they should be washed and soaked before meat is packed in them again You should see that the hoops are sound and have covers made to fit them If taken care of in this way they will last a number of years Scrapple Take eight pounds of scraps of pork that will not do for sausage boil it in four gallons of water when tender chop it fine strain the liquor and pour it back into the pot put in the meat season it with sage summer savory salt and pepper to taste stir in a quart of corn meal after simmering a few minutes thicken it with buckwheat flour very thick it requires very little cooking after it is thickened but must be stirred constantly Dried Beef An experienced housekeeper has furnished the following method for curing and drying beef which will keep good for two years without being injured by must or fly and is much admired Have the rounds divided leaving a piece of the sinew to hang up by lay the pieces in a tub of cold water for an hour then rub each piece of beef that will weigh fifteen or twenty pounds with a handful of brown sugar and a table spoonful of saltpetre pulverized and a pint of fine salt sprinkle fine salt in the bottom of a clean tight barrel and lay the pieces in strewing a little coarse salt between each piece let it lay two days then make the brine in a clean tub with cold water and ground alum salt stir it well it must be strong enough to bear an egg half up put in half a pound of best brown sugar and a table spoonful of saltpetre to each gallon of the salt and water pour it over the beef put a clean large stone on the top of the meat to keep it under the pickle which is very important put a cover on the barrel examine it occasionally to see that the pickle does not leak and if it should need more add of the same strength let it stand six weeks then hang it up in the smoke house and after it has drained smoke it moderately for ten days it should then hang in a dry place before cooking let it soak for twenty four hours a piece that weighs fifteen or twenty pounds should boil two hours one half the size one hour and a small piece should soak six or twelve hours according to size Beef cured in this way will make a nice relish when thinly sliced and eaten cold for breakfast or tea or put between slices of bread and butter for lunch it will keep for several weeks and persons of delicate stomachs can sometimes relish a thin slice eaten cold when they cannot retain hot or rich food This receipt will answer for all parts of the beef to be boiled for the dinner table through the summer To Cure Beef Make a pickle of six quarts of salt six gallons of water half a pound of saltpetre and three of sugar or half a gallon of molasses pack the beef in a barrel with fine and coarse salt mixed when the pickle is cold pour it over and put a weight on the top let it stay two weeks when you can hang it up and smoke it to boil through the summer or boil the pickle over again and leave it in till you want to use it this is for two hundred pounds A New Method of Curing Beef Take six gallons of water nine pounds of salt fine and coarse mixed three pounds of sugar one quart of molasses three ounces of saltpetre and one ounce of pearl ash or salaeratus boil and skim it well and let it stand till entirely cold when pour it on beef that has been sprinkled with salt for several days You can boil of this beef from the brine all winter or hang it up and smoke it with your bacon To Cure a Dozen Tongues Soak the tongues an hour in a tub of cold water to extract the blood and cut off most of the root mix together a quarter of a pound of saltpetre finely powdered one pound of brown sugar and a pint of salt rub the tongues with this and put them in a tight barrel then make a pickle that will bear an egg which pour over them turn them every three days and let them stay in the pickle two weeks then smoke them two days and hang them up in a dry place boil and skim the pickle that the tongues have been in and it will do for a round of beef Pickle for Two Rounds of Beef Cut the rounds in a suitable shape for drying mix together two pints of salt one of molasses or a pound of sugar and half a pound of saltpetre rub them with this and pack them in a tight vessel make a pickle that will bear an egg and pour it over put a weight on the top and let it lay for ten days when take it out and smoke it two days hang it up in a dry place it will be fit to slice and broil in a week or cut it very thin and stew or fry it with butter and cream Legs of mutton may be salted as rounds of beef and will resemble venison when dried and chipped In preparing pickle for any kind of meat observe that one gallon of water will hold in solution a quart of salt and two ounces of saltpetre To Corn Beef Pork or Mutton Rub the meat well with salt and pack it in a tub If the weather is warm it will require a good deal of salt but no saltpetre To Restore Meat that has been kept too long When meat has been kept too long in summer it may be improved by putting it in sour milk for several hours or washing it in vinegar is good some hours before it is cooked you must wash it well in cold water several times if it lays all night in sour milk or salt and vinegar it should be put in soak early in the morning in cold water In very hot weather when you have fresh meat fowls or fish left at dinner sprinkle them with strong vinegar salt and pepper warm this up the next day either as a fry or stew the vinegar will evaporate and not injure the taste Cold rock fish is good seasoned with salt pepper and vinegar to use as a relish for breakfast or tea To Keep Meat Fresh Where persons live a distance from market and have no fresh meat but what they kill it is important to know how to keep it fresh In winter if it is hung up in an out house it will keep very well for six weeks or more when it has once frozen it is safe till a thaw comes on when rub it with salt In the summer if you have an ice house you can keep it without trouble If rubbed with salt and pinned in a cloth it will keep in the cellar two days or by lowering it down your well attached to a rope and changing the cloth every other day it will keep good a week in hot weather To Put up Herring and Shad Those that put up their own fish should be careful to have the barrels tight and well cleaned if the pickle leaks from them they are liable to spoil Scale the fish and wash them as it will save much time when you prepare them for cooking take out the gills but leave on the heads of herrings The heads should be taken off the shad and split them down the back put a layer of fish then a layer of ground alum salt and after they are packed put on a weight to keep them down If herring are well cured they will be good at the end of two years To Put up Herring According to the Harford Mode First put the herring into the brine left from curing bacon or if you have none of that description make a brine that will bear an egg and let them remain in it thirty or forty hours then if for pickled herring change them into new brine which must also bear an egg and head them up to keep If for red herring hang them up and smoke them thoroughly A little saltpetre added to the brine is an improvement It is better to take out the roe BUTTER CHEESE

spoonful of the above preparation dissolved in a tea cup of water keep stirring it until it boils again when pour it out drink it with sugar and cream to your taste This is called by some Rac a haut chocolate and is very nice for delicate persons as well as those in health LARD TALLOW SOAP AND CANDLES Rendering Lard The leaf lard should be rendered by itself as it does not take so long as that with the skin on Cut it up fine and put it in a clean pot with half a pint of water stir it frequently and let it boil fast at first when the cracklings are light brown and float on the top it is nearly done and should cook slowly when done strain it into your vessels with a thin cloth put over a colander If you put lard in stone or earthen jars it should be cooled first as there is danger of their cracking white oak firkins with iron hoops and covers to fit tight are good to keep lard and if taken care of will last for twenty years The fat that has the skin on should be cut very fine taking the skin off first It takes longer to boil than leaf lard and there is more danger of burning put a pint of water in the pot The skins should be boiled alone and will do for soap fat after the lard is out of them Soak the inside fat all night in salt and water wash it in the morning and put it to boil without any water in the pot It is not so nice as other lard and should be strained by itself It does very well for frying Lard keeps well in large tin vessels with tight covers and is not apt to mould Rendering Tallow Cut the tallow fine and put it to boil in a large pot with a quart of water stir it frequently and keep it boiling moderately for six hours when the cracklings begin to turn brown it should boil very slowly till done Put a little water in the bottom of your dutch ovens or tin pans and strain it in with a cloth over the colander or the settlings will run through and hurt the looks of your candles Soap It requires some care and experience to have good soap but when you once get beforehand it is easy to keep up the supply if the ashes are good The leystand should be made of cedar or pine boards in the shape of a mill hopper and have holes bored in the bottom for the ley to run through have four posts planted in the ground to support it let it be high enough for a small tub to set under If you cannot have it under a shed there should be a tight cover of boards to protect it from the rain Put some sticks in the bottom of the leystand and some straw and pack in a bushel of ashes then half a peck of lime and when it is half full of ashes put in two buckets of water and another when you get near the top pack it well and put on some more water then cover it over pour on hot water three times a day for several days When you are ready to make soap have a large pot of water which must be kept boiling and put it on as fast as it will bear save the strongest ley by itself if the ley will float an egg it will answer have your soap fat laying in strong ley through the winter put a gallon of this in a large pot and put to it a gallon of the strongest ley let it boil an hour stirring it often then put in two gallons more of strong ley when this has boiled put in weak ley till the pot is full let it boil an hour or two slowly and be careful that it does not go over cool some on a plate and if thick it is done but if not boil it longer Put it away in a tight barrel and prepare to make more soap if you have two large pots both of them can be kept going at the same time Several barrels of soap can be made from one ley stand A large oil cask is good to keep soap in If a barrel leaks set it under a spout in a rain or fill it with water It is of the greatest importance to keep the soap fat in strong ley Have an oil barrel in the cellar half full of strong ley and put in cracklings bacon skins pot skimmings beef bones or any scraps when eaten by ley it will take but little boiling It is much the easiest and safest way where there are children to make the soap without boiling Put four gallons of soap fat that has been eaten with ley in a barrel with eight gallons of strong ley stir it two or three times a day for a week or two then fill it up with weaker ley you may have several barrels making at a time so as always to have some for use it takes some time to make it in this way But if you are careful and once get ahead you need not boil the soap unless you prefer it so if your ley is not strong dissolve potash in hot water and add to strengthen it Hard Soap Have fifteen pounds of clean fat to twenty gallons of clear strong ley let it boil until thick when put in half a peck of coarse salt if it does not curdle in two hours put in more salt till it does then pour it out in a tub to cool till the next day when put on your pot with some weak ley cut the soap out of the tub and boil it in this an hour then put it in the tub let it get cold cut it in squares and put it on a board to dry Unless you have plenty of ashes and soap fat it is much cheaper to buy hard soap than to make it If you have but a barrel full of ashes you can make a barrel of soap bore a hole in the bottom of a barrel put a few sticks across when half full of ashes put in a quart of lime and some water keep the hole plugged up till you are ready to make the soap You can have a barrel of ashes put in the cellar in winter to use for washing and scrubbing keep a tub under it to hold the ley as it drops Potash Soap Persons living in cities frequently have grease that would do to make soap but are at a loss for ley in consequence of burning coal instead of wood Twelve pounds of pure grease of any kind put with ten pounds of potash in an oil barrel and filled with water makes good thick soap and is much cheaper than buying hard soap It should be stirred frequently and if the ingredients are put together in warm weather and the barrel stands where it can be exposed to the heat of the sun without danger of getting rain in it it will be fit for use in a few weeks without the aid of fire if you wish to make soap immediately put three pounds of potash four of grease and about ten gallons of water in a large iron pot boil it over the fire and it will make good thick soap in a few hours it need only boil long enough to dissolve the potash which is sometimes in very hard lumps If you use the crumbled potash you must put rather more of it as it is not so strong and a little lump of quick lime will make it turn quicker Another Receipt Two days before you wish to commence your soap pour about two gallons of boiling water on ten or twelve pounds of potash to dissolve it then put it in an iron pot or kettle with ten gallons of rain water hang it over the fire and when it has dissolved pour twelve pounds of grease which has been purified by boiling in water or weak ley into a well hooped barrel an oil barrel from which one head has been taken and the bung well fastened is best then pour the water in which the potash was dissolved over the grease in the barrel and stir it for half an hour afterwards fill up the barrel with cold soft water and stir it every day for two weeks If at the end of that time the fat swims on the top beat a pound or two more of potash fine throw it in the barrel stir it well and the soap will be finished Labor saving Soap Take two pounds salt soda two pounds yellow bar soap ten quarts of water Cut the soap in thin slices and boil all together two hours and strain it through a cloth let it cool and it is fit for use Put the clothes in soak the night before you wash and to every pail of water in which you boil them add one pound of the soap They will need no rubbing merely rinse them out and they will be perfectly clean and white This soap can be made for two cents per pound Ley and Soda Preparation for Washing Clothes To sixteen gallons of water put one gallon of lime water twelve ounces of soft soap or if hard soap it must be first melted and four ounces of soda put them together in your wash kettle and when nearly boiling put in the clothes being careful to have them as much of a kind as possible they should be wet first with common water boil one hour then wash scald and blue as usual The limestone should remain in the water at least four days before it is used and be about of the strength of lime water for drinking and the same stone will do for several times if good The ley will do for boiling a second set of clothes by adding a little more and afterwards for towels and coarse things Prints and flannels must not be boiled Volatile Soap And Directions for Washing Clothes Cut up three pounds of country bard soap into three pints of strong ley simmer it over the fire until the soap is dissolved and add to it three ounces of pearl ash pour it into a stone jar and stir in half a pint of spirits of turpentine and a gill of spirits of hartshorn cover the jar tight and tie a cloth over it To use the soap have a tub half full of water as hot as you can bear your hands in assort the clothes and beginning with the cleanest of them rub a small quantity of the soap on the soiled parts of each article and immerse them in the water one by one until it will cover no more let them soak for fifteen or twenty minutes then stir them well for a few minutes and boil them for half an hour in eight or ten gallons of water to which a table spoonful of the soap has been added rinse them using blue water where it is required as usual and they are ready for drying After the white clothes are finished the same waters will answer for the colored ones adding hot water and more soap By the use of this soap most of the rubbing can be dispensed with and it is not injurious to the texture of the clothes It has been proved that the clothes washed in this way are more durable than with the common soaps and the rubbing required in connection with them It is particularly recommended for washing flannels and calicoes The above quantity is sufficient for a family of four or five persons for a month varying slightly as the clothes are more or less soiled Its cheapness recommends it to all housekeepers Candles Weigh the tallow then you can judge how many candles you can make six and eight candles to the pound do very well for working and reading by ten to the pound does to use in the kitchen or to carry about the house Put the wicks on the rods the day before you expect to make candles and dip them in a little melted tallow you can then straighten them out Have a large pot nearly half full of hot water melt the tallow in another pot and fill it up and keep more tallow at the fire to fill in as it is used out put coals under the pot to keep it at a proper heat Have poles set on stools about a foot apart to support the rods dip the rods in the pot alternately until they are as large as you wish them Wax makes candles burn longer but turns them yellow The best way is to put in two pounds of wax when you first begin to dip and it will be used up before they are dipped the last time when they are done cut off the ends and put them in boxes Most good managers in the country make enough candles at a time to last a year If you have not enough tallow to dip candles you can mould some mutton tallow is very good for this purpose MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS Clear Starching Wash your muslins nicely rub hard soap on them and pour boiling water on let them lay in this half an hour or if they are very yellow boil them in water that has a little blue in a bell metal kettle let them dry in the sun boil your starch half an hour as it will be clearer and the things will take less clapping rub the starch over the muslin until it is well covered then clap it a few times afterwards stretch out the muslin and hold it to the fire until it smokes then stretch clap and shake it until the piece is dry enough to iron When you begin to starch have a pile of plates near and as fast as the things are ready to iron fold them up and put them between the plates to keep moist It is a good plan to have a board about three feet long and a foot wide with a piece of blanket tacked on round the edges to iron your collars and handkerchiefs on There is an art in doing up muslins which will take but little time when once it is acquired The same directions answer for clear starching crape which must first be bleached as flannels are done and add some drop lake to the blue coloring In cold weather to rub your hands over with a little clean tallow prevents them from chapping and will not alter the appearance of the muslin To make Corn Starch Gather the corn when it is a proper age for table use have a large tin grater and grate the corn into a clean vessel into which drop the cobs as you grate them until the vessel is about half full rub the cobs and squeeze them dry as possible and put them into another vessel of clean water rub and squeeze them again the third rinsing will take all the starch out let it settle and then pour all the starch together and strain it through a coarse cloth and then through a flannel and let it settle until the next morning when you will find a thick yellow substance under the water covering the pure white article in the bottom of the vessel remove the yellow substance and pour clean water on the starch and stir it up as soon as it settles thoroughly again pour off the water and put the starch on dishes and set it in the sun to dry When you want to use it moisten it with cold water and pour boiling water on till it is the right consistency for use It requires no boiling Potato Starch Pare the potatoes and scrape or grate them in a pan of water when this is done stir them well and let them stand a few minutes to settle pour off the water and the pulp from the top pour water on the starch that has settled and stir it up let it settle again when it will be nice and white and may be put on plates to dry in the sun after which it may be put away in a box or paper bags It maybe used immediately Stir it in boiling water as other starch but boil it much less It is said that potato starch will injure muslins when left to lay by for some time it is used in some preparations of confectionary and answers the same purpose as Poland starch To make Common Starch Mix a pint of wheat flour with cold water till it is the consistence of batter stir it into a gallon of boiling water let it boil a few minutes when strain it and mix in the blue when it is ready to thin for white clothes Some put a small piece of tallow in the starch as it boils it makes it clearer Washing Calicoes c Calicoes may be kept from fading by washing them in the suds after white clothes if it requires more soap stir it in the water as putting it on the garment will fade it have the water moderately warm and put in a handful of salt when all the dirt is out rinse them in clean water starch and hang them to dry on the wrong side where they will get the air but not the sun Alum is good to set colors If you want to wash a calico dress which you know will fade make a corn mush and as it boils pour off half which use as soap in washing the dress and with the other half which should be boiled well starch it and hang it out immediately In washing bed quilts to prevent fading spread them on the clean grass wrong side up this prevents the colors running into each other For chintz or lawn dresses have very nice starch and clap it into them after they are hung on the line they iron much better this way and look almost like new sometimes to wash the cuffs and lower part carefully and press it all over will do without washing the whole dress For ironing the skirt have a narrow ironing board covered with a piece of blanket to slip inside the dress Table Cloths c When two or three spots get on a table cloth dip a towel in clean water and rub them off and dry the cloth before it is put away this saves washing and if done carefully it will look like a clean cloth If table cloths are stained with fruit pour boiling water on the spots before soap is put on when it is so deep that this will not take it out apply lemon juice and salt dry it in the sun and put it on several times You should always have cup plates as the marks of a coffee cup spoils the appearance of a cloth and the stain is hard to get out When table cloths and towels get yellow soak them in sour milk several days Unbleached table cloths are very good to save washing in winter and can be laid by in summer care should be taken to hang them to dry in the shade as that will keep them from bleaching New table cloths do not require any starch but those that are partly worn look better for a little every thing washes easier that has starch in Nice table cloths and all fine things after being sprinkled and folded should be tightly rolled up in towels and ironed till perfectly dry they will then retain their gloss Large table cloths should be brushed clean from crumbs and folded without shaking as that tumbles them those in daily use should be put under a press a heavy book is suitable or a board may be made for the purpose they will keep in credit much longer than when laid in a drawer It is well to put a common muslin cloth under a damask one on the table as it improves the appearance Flannels Have the water in which you wash flannel as hot as you can bear your hands in and rub the soap in the water or it will shrink the flannel The water it is rinsed in should also be hot When flannels have become yellow and fulled up I have often smoked them with brimstone and they will be as white as new and the fulled places will open The best plan is to have a box or chest with strings put across to hang the flannels on and a drawer to pull out where you can set in a pan with coals and brimstone Have the flannels nicely washed and put them in wet close it up till you think it wants more brimstone when you can pull out the drawer and renew it After they are bleached they should hang up in the air to let the smell of the brimstone escape If you have but a few things to do you can put strings across the top of an old barrel with both the heads out cover it with a thick cloth and lift it up to put in a pan of brimstone and coals Always wash scarlet flannel with hard soap Mending Clothes All clothes should be looked over before they are put away and if any require mending it must not be neglected a broken stitch that can be mended in a few minutes if left till it has been worn again will require much more time If young housekeepers suffer their mending to get behind hand it will discourage them After mending a shirt it should be pressed before it is put away If stocking heels are run while they are new and the thin places darned in time it saves much work Washing Windows A little soda dissolved in the water is valuable for washing windows do not let it run on the sash or it will stain the paint rinse them in clear water and wipe dry with a clean soft towel When they are but little soiled clear water will answer but if smoked or coated with any thing soda should be always used Some persons rub their windows with soft buckskin or newspaper when they are dry and clean to give them a polish To Make White or Colored Washes Dyeing c Take half a bushel of unslaked lime slack with boiling water covering it during the process to keep in the steam Strain the liquid through a fine sieve or strainer and add to it a peck of clean salt previously dissolved in warm water three pounds of ground rice boiled to a thin paste stir in boiling hot one pound of Spanish whiting one of clean glue dissolved by soaking it well and simmering over a slow fire in a small kettle within a larger one containing water add five gallons of boiling water to the whole mixture stir it well and if you are not ready to use it cover it close It should be put on quite hot for this purpose it can be kept in a kettle on a portable furnace Coloring matter may be added to make any shade desired Spanish brown stirred in will make a pink color more or less deep according to the quantity a delicate tinge of this is very pretty for inside walls Indigo mixed with the Spanish brown makes a delicate purple or alone with the mixture a pale blue Lamp black in moderate quantity makes a slate color suitable for the outside of buildings Lamp black and Spanish brown together produce a reddish stone color yellow ochre a yellow wash but chrome goes further and makes a brighter color It is well to try on a shingle or piece of paper or board and let it dry to ascertain the color If you wash over old paper make a sizing of wheat flour like thin starch put it on and when dry put on the coloring for a white washed wall make a sizing of whiting and glue water This precaution should always be taken before using chrome yellow or green as the previous use of lime injures the color of the chrome When walls have been badly smoked add to your white wash sufficient indigo to make it a clear white To Mix White wash Pour a kettle of boiling water on a peck of unslaked lime put in two pounds of whiting and half a pint of salt when all are mixed together put in half an ounce of Prussian blue finely powdered add water to make it a proper thickness to put on a wall White wash for Buildings or Fences Put in a barrel one bushel of best unslaked lime pour on it two buckets of boiling water and when it is mixed put in six pounds of fine whiting fill up the barrel with water stir it well and keep it covered from the rain let it stand several days before you use it when stir it up thin it with milk as you use it and put half a pint of salt to each bucket full This makes a durable wash for a rough cast or frame house or for fences the salt prevents it from peeling off Chrome Yellow wash Mix four pounds of whiting with as much water as will go over the room dissolve a tea cupful of glue and put in then wash the walls with this to prevent the lime from affecting the chrome if they come in contact the walls will be striped and will not look at all well Mix a wash of whiting water and glue and color it with two pounds of chrome yellow After walls have been yellow and you want to have them white they must be washed over with whiting and glue and then white washed in the usual way Yellow Ochre wash Dissolve a pound of glue in hot water and stir into it three pounds of yellow ochre and one of whiting mix it well and thin it with water or skim milk It is a suitable wash for a common room or kitchen Lamp black mixed with molasses and put in white wash makes a good color for a kitchen To Dye Orange Color For five pounds of woolen yarn have one pound of annotta dissolve it in boiling water and put it in a pot of soft water with half a pound of pearl ash boil them ten minutes stirring it well wet the yarn in soap suds put it in and let it boil twenty minutes then hang it in the sun and when dry if it is not deep enough dip it in again and after it is thoroughly dry wash it

Winter Pick them carefully so as not to bruise them put them in an out house exposed to the north either in boxes or barrels or lying in heaps after they have been several weeks in this situation pick them over and put them in barrels which should be headed if the weather is not severe let them remain in this cold situation as long as it will be safe without their being frozen then remove them to the cellar Do not shut the windows till the severe weather comes on Some persons pack them in dry chaff or sand and put them in barrels and boxes in a cool garret Directions for Making Matresses If you have an old curled hair matress you can make two that will be equally useful as those that are composed of curled hair by using cotton and hackled corn husks in alternate layers with the hair Some persons use a quantity of green corn and save all the husks and strip them with a fork or hackle and spread them on a garret floor to dry they are nicer in this state than prepared from the dry husk but if you have not sufficient take the dry husks from corn that has been stripped off the top and blade in the field and have it hackled as flax for one matress have as much as will fill two flour barrels tightly packed sixteen pounds of refuse cotton such as is sometimes sold very low at the factories and half the hair of an old matress which should be well picked measure the bedstead you wish it for and allow to each breadth of the ticking a quarter of a yard in length over for a small matress less should be allowed and the same in width as it takes up in making cut the side strips as deep as you wish the matress fit the corners cut out a place for the foot posts or fit each end square alike after the bottom and sides are sewed together run a tuck all round to save binding sew the tick in a quilting frame and stay it to the end pieces as a quilt put a table under to support the weight which can be shifted as it is sewed first put a layer of hair then cotton then husks alternately till it is done be careful to let the hair be next the ticking put some all round the sides and edges When all is in put on the top and baste it down with strong thread then with a chalk line strike across to form squares to sew it by Have a long needle prepared and polished smoothly threaded with twine or several strands of strong shoe thread this should be well waxed and long enough to go through and back again have tufts or two pieces of strong cloth prepared to secure the stitches on both sides one person should be under the frame to pull the needle through and put it back it should be tied tightly as possible when you have done stitching the matress should be sewed all round taken out of the frame and the raw edges bound They can be made of cotton and husks without hair or cotton alone Those that have sheep can use the coarse wool and such as is not profitable for manufacturing with the husks it is more elastic than cotton Many persons are deprived of one of the greatest comforts in summer and sleep on feathers when a little care in preparing the materials and putting them together would furnish your chambers with the most healthy and pleasant beds a large cotton sheet should be kept on a matress or a case made of unbleached muslin this covering should be occasionally washed and starched If you cannot get husks straw will answer or hay To Make a Rag Carpet Ten pounds of purple warp ten of green four of yellow seven of red will make a pretty stripe mingled and arranged according to your fancy the above quantity of warp with fifty eight pounds of rags will make forty two yards yard wide In most cities warp can be purchased ready colored A very good proportion is a pound and a quarter of rags and three quarters of a pound of warp to the yard Save all the scraps in cutting out work have a bag for the purpose hanging in a convenient place and when you have leisure cut them Old muslin garments that are not worth giving away may be torn in strips and colored In cutting out clothes for boys from men s garments there will always be scraps and strips By purchasing a little red flannel to mix in the appearance is improved A carpet wears cleaner to be about one third cotton and two thirds woollen rags to mix the colors Do not sew a strip that is longer than three yards and the cotton should be much shorter as the warp is usually of that material there is more danger from fire To Keep Furs and Woollens Crack the grains of black pepper and sprinkle in among your furs and woollen clothes after they have been shaken and aired fold them smooth and put them in linen bags or sheets keep them in a large trunk or dark closet and look at them once through the summer to see that they are safe Tobacco and camphor are also good to pack them in but the smell continues with them a long time and is disagreeable to some persons They should be well shaken and aired before they are worn To Keep Curtains Take the curtains down in the spring shake them carefully and brush the dust from them let them air a day but not so that the sun will fade them then fold them neatly and pin them up in sheets Moreen or worsted curtains require the same care as woollen cloths To Keep Blankets in Summer If you have any blankets that are soiled and require washing in the spring have it nicely done when they are perfectly dry put them on a bedstead in a spare chamber keeping out one to use on each bed through the summer spread a large sheet over tuck under all round and secure the corners with pins tins will keep them from dust and moths and makes a good bed to use in hot weather Carpets c When you take up carpets in the spring to put down matting have them well shaken and if there are any spots on them they should be washed off with a stiff brush and dried if there is oil or grease spilt on them mix up whiting or nice clay with water spread it on both sides of the spot and baste thick paper over it When dry fold it up the size of a bedstead and pin a coarse sheet round it In this way they will be secure from moths and the addition of a few quilted comforts on the top makes a very pleasant bed in summer The small moth fly appears early in the summer and should always be destroyed when seen as the moth is produced from the eggs which they deposit in woollens by being careful to kill them when they first come a house may be kept nearly clear of them Select the softest brooms for sweeping carpets as stiff ones wear them out House Linen Have a book in which to set down all the bed and table linen towels and napkins every article of which should be marked and numbered and counted at least once a month To Clean Paint Rub some whiting very fine on a plate have ready some clean warm water and a piece of flannel which dip in the water and squeeze very dry then take as much whiting as will stick to the flannel and rub the paint to remove dust or grease then wash it well with clean water and wipe it dry with a soft cloth Bran boiled in water and left to settle is very good to clean paint use a soft cloth or flannel it will take off fly specks and impart a gloss to the paint wipe it quite dry Unless soap is used with great care it will injure paint Varnished paint requires nothing but clean warm water and to be wiped dry To Clean Bedsteads In the summer bedsteads should be brushed and searched every week if they are infested with bugs boil the sacking in ley and water or put it in an oven on some boards after the bread is taken out to kill the eggs fill a large bottle with red pepper pods of the strongest kind and fill it up with vinegar put this in each crack of the bedsteads every morning until they entirely disappear never omit to search the bedsteads longer than a week It is a good way to fill up all the cracks of the bedsteads with resin soap After they are cleaned move the bed from the wall and fill up every crack in the plastering with calcined plaster and water or putty Sometimes bed bugs are brought in the cleanest houses before the family are aware of it When persons return from travelling the trunks should always be examined before they are taken into the chambers or put away a little care at the proper time will prevent much trouble Some persons scald their bedsteads with boiling vinegar the acid is said to dissolve the shell of the egg If poison is used great care is necessary It is said that lard is good to use on bedsteads that are infested with bugs the grease prevents their increase All the cracks should be filled after the bedstead has been well searched To Clean Floors Scour all the spots with soap and sand then go all over with the long scrubbing brush a few boards at a time rinse it well and wipe it dry A floor that has been well cleaned and dried without being walked on will keep clean much longer than one that has been half done too much soap or ley makes a floor look yellow Bare floors are very pleasant in summer and when they get a few spots they can be taken out with dry white sand and a shoe sole and will not need scrubbing more than two or three times in a summer Cleaning Cellars Rats Roaches In the spring cellars should be swept and all refuse vegetables taken out if left till warm weather they will become putrid and endanger the health of your family The sprouts should be rubbed from the potatoes all the barrels should be moved and swept under Have boards laid on the floor for meat and fish barrels and after they are emptied have them washed and drained ready for use Empty flour barrels should be swept out and the heads and hoops saved Have lime sprinkled over the cellar floor twice during the summer or oftener if it should be necessary If the windows are kept shut in warm weather the air will be unwholesome Do not trust to servants examine and see that it is done thoroughly The apartments where cold meat and milk are kept should be cobwebbed and swept once a week and the safe washed out at least that often If the cellar is paved with brick keep a part of it washed clean to set cold meat and milk on cover them with tin pans and put a weight on the top if rats are troublesome If there are rat holes have them stopped with pieces of brick and broken glass bottles never use ratsbane without the greatest caution as it is a dangerous remedy No food or milk should be in the cellar at the time and keep it locked up all the while it is there I have heard of lives being lost by it Have water set about in pans for the rats to drink and after three days clear it all away and have the cellar cleaned and aired before putting any thing in it Several persons have been in great danger from burning the arsenic when it is used it should be put deep in the ground and covered up Mice are kept under by a good cat and traps If roaches are troublesome set bowls or deep dishes with molasses and a plate on the top with room for them to get in and set it close to a wall I have seen hundreds caught in this way in one night and it is much safer than setting any thing poisonous about the kitchen or pantry They should be burnt in the morning and the dishes set again at night If you find a closet infested with ants remove every thing that will attract them scald and clean it well and they will soon leave it It is said that strips of cotton or linen dipped in spirits of turpentine and placed about the closets will drive them away Mats should be placed at all the outside doors and at the top and bottom of the cellar stairs Putting Straw under Carpets It is thought that carpets wear better when straw is spread over the floor before they are put down and it will prevent the dust from rising so much Care should be taken to have them well tacked down as it is dangerous on account of fire Where straw is used they may be kept down a much longer time without being shaken Picking Geese c When you pick geese and ducks have a tub of boiling water dip each one in turning it over to let every part be well scalded and as each one is scalded wrap it up in a cloth and when they are nearly cold pick them In this way the pen feathers are loosened and they can be picked much cleaner Wetting the feathers does not hurt them if they are well dried They should be put in bags and frequently sunned Baking them in the oven after the bread comes out cures them more thoroughly than any other way Turkey and chicken feathers are not so good for beds as goose and duck they may be picked in the same way Marble c Marble mantles should be washed but seldom wipe off spots with a damp cloth and rub them dry Hearths should be washed with soap and water When there is a spot of grease mix clay or whiting with soft soap and put on Soap stone hearths may be scoured with soap and fine sand and washed off To Restore Colors taken out by Acid c Hartshorn rubbed on a silk or woollen garment will restore the color without injuring it Spirits of turpentine is good to take grease or drops of paint out of cloth apply it till the paint can be scraped off Rub French chalk or magnesia on silk or ribbon that has been greased and hold near the fire this will absorb the grease so that it may be brushed off To make New Feather Beds In making new feather beds put half a pound of cayenne and half a pound of black pepper in each bed this will prevent the moths from getting into new feathers that have not been well cured It is best to air your beds frequently and shake them up even if they are not slept in It is the oil in the feathers that makes them smell bad and when in constant use the heat of the body dries it up gradually when beds or pillows have acquired this unpleasant smell open them and put a few pounded cloves in each When new beds are covered with cases the moth will sometimes eat through without its being discovered Covers also prevent the air from sweetening the feathers and when new they should never be covered unless in use When beds are slept on it is best to have a thick cotton sheet or if it is cold weather a blanket between the under sheet and the bed and have them washed and aired occasionally To Clean Silver Wash the silver in soda water rub it with whiting and polish it with a piece of dry buckskin Embossed silver requires a stiff brush Another way is to let the silver lay in chalk and water for an hour then take it out and wipe it dry on flannel polish it with a piece of buckskin Britannia Ware First wash it clean in soap suds then rub it with a woollen cloth and whiting and polish off with dry buckskin Brass First rub the brasses with turpentine vinegar or whiskey then with rotten stone and a woollen cloth and polish off with a piece of soft leather For brasses that have been long out of use chalk and vinegar may be used To Clean Stoves or Grates Have the stove slightly warm and if there is rust on it rub it off with a dry brush mix some black lead or British lustre with boiling water rub it on a small part of the stove at a time and polish it with a stiff brush If the stove needs but little cleaning wet the spots with water dust a little lead on the brush and rub it quickly The black lead should be washed off several times a year and then renewed Sheet iron stoves should be rubbed with a woollen cloth as a brush is apt to streak The lead may be mixed with the white of an egg in cold water Alum water is good to mix lustre it prevents the stove from rusting To polish the hearth of a Franklin stove rub it over with a piece of grindstone or use coarse sand with the sole of a shoe when it begins to look bright polish it with pumice stone Cement to Mend Cracks in Stoves Take two parts of ashes three of clay and one of sand mix them well together with water and put it on when the stove is cold It is also good to stop a leak in a roof Fire proof Cement Slack a peck of lime in boiling water put into it three pounds of salt three of brown sugar and one of alum mix them well together and color it with lamp black or ochre This has been recommended to put on the roof of a building that is exposed to fire To Take Spots out of Mahogany Put a piece of paper on the spot and hold a warm iron over it then rub it with a waxed cloth If furniture is hurt with flies it should be well washed with a cloth and rubbed with a cork and a waxed cloth Varnished furniture should be first rubbed with sweet oil and then with a waxed cloth To Take Grease out of Floors Mix clay or fullers earth with ley and put a thick coat on the grease spot scrape it off every few days and put on more To put soft soap on the place and rub it over with a hot iron will take out the grease Wash for Hearths Mix red ochre in milk and put it on the hearths with a brush Blacking for Boots and Shoes Take one ounce of vitriolic acid one wine glass of olive oil two ounces of ivory black an ounce of gum arabic a quart of vinegar and a tea cup of molasses put the vitriol and oil together then add the ivory black and other ingredients when all are well mixed bottle it To Make Boots and Shoes Water proof Take one pint of linseed oil one ounce of Burgundy pitch two of beeswax and two of spirits of turpentine melt them carefully over a slow fire With this you may rub new or old shoes in the sun or at a short distance from the fire and they will last longer never shrink and keep out water To Make Blacking for Morocco Shoes Pound some black sealing wax and put in a bottle with half a pint of alcohol shake it frequently and when it is dissolved you may rub it on morocco shoes when they are scaled or defaced and they will look almost like new dry it on in the sun To Grease Eggs for Winter In the spring when eggs are plenty and cheap it is very well to put up several hundred to use in the winter when it is very difficult to get them even in the country Grease each egg with sweet lard and as you do so lay them in a keg or jar or old tin vessels that are out of use put them in a dry closet and keep them covered over if they are put in the cellar they are liable to mould which spoils them entirely Do not put in any cracked ones or they will injure the rest In this way they have been known to keep a year and were nearly as good for puddings or batter cakes as fresh eggs They do not do to boil or make pound or sponge cake as they lose part of their lightening property To Keep Eggs in Lime Water Pour two gallons of hot water on a pint of lime and half a pint of salt put the eggs in a jar or keg and when it is cold pour it over them and put them in a cellar to keep be sure that there are no cracked ones Eggs may be kept a month or longer spread out separately on dishes so as one will not lay on another They will keep best in a dark closet To Clean Soiled Eggs When eggs are discolored from laying on the ground wash them first in strong vinegar and then in cold water and wipe them dry on a soft towel Chloride of Lime A few spoonsful of chloride of lime dissolved in some water in a bowl or saucer is very useful to purify the apartment of an invalid or in any case where there is an unpleasant smell of any kind It is a cheap article and should always he kept convenient where there is sickness in the house To Take Lime out of Cloth Lime spots on woollen clothes may be effectually removed by putting a little strong vinegar on the part which completely neutralizes the lime and does not usually effect the color but it will be safest to wash it over with a cloth dipped in water and rub it till nearly dry Hartshorn and alcohol mixed together are very useful in taking spots out of cloth or merino applied with something that will not leave lint To Take Wax or Spermaceti out of Cloth Hold a red hot flat iron within an inch or two of the cloth and this will make the wax or spermaceti evaporate entirely then rub the place with a towel that is free from lint or clean brown paper To Remove a Stopper from a Decanter Wet a cloth with hot water and wrap it round the neck of the bottle this will cause the glass to expand and the neck will be enlarged so as to allow of the stopper to be withdrawn without any trouble Precautions against Fire Perhaps it may not be improper to remark that houses have been saved from being destroyed by fire at night by there having been buckets of water left in the kitchen Never go to bed without seeing that there is a supply in readiness Housekeepers should also arrange their family affairs so as to have as little going about with lights by servants as possible Chimneys should be swept at proper intervals and if you burn them let it be on a rainy morning and never at night To Take Ink and Stains out of Linen Dip the spotted part in pure melted tallow then wash out the tallow and the ink will come out with it If you get a stain of fruit of any kind on linen boil a little new milk and dip the parts in and out for a few minutes this must be done before any water is used or it will not be likely to succeed Oxalic acid or salt and lemon juice are good and care should be taken to rinse the articles well after the application Herbs Gardens and Yards If you have a garden be careful to raise herbs both for cooking and to use in sickness Parsley thyme sage and sweet marjoram occupy very little room in a garden and cannot very well be dispensed with for kitchen use and every family should have a bunch of wormwood it is a fine tonic either made while fresh cut fine with cold water or after it has been dried made with boiling water Tansey is also a useful herb Hoarhound is excellent for coughs and is particularly useful in consumptive complaints either as a syrup or made into candy Balm is a cooling drink in a fever Catnip tea is useful when you have a cold and wish to produce a perspiration and is good for infants that have the colic Garlic is good for colds and for children that have the croup you should have some taken up in the fall to use through the winter The root of elecampane gathered in the fall scraped sliced and strung with a needle and thread to dry will keep its strength for several years and is useful for a cough with hoarhound Rue is a valuable herb a tea made of it and sweetened is good for worms It is not expected that persons living in a town should have room in their garden for herbs but they are generally to be purchased at market and should always be kept in the house as sometimes in the winter they are much needed when it is difficult to find them Herbs should be spread out on a cloth to dry turn them every day when dry put them in thick paper bags and close up the top so as to exclude the air They can be kept hanging up or laid on the shelf of a closet where they will not be affected by damp Such herbs as sage thyme and sweet marjoram when thoroughly dry should be pounded sifted and corked in bottles Parsley should be cut fine with a pair of scissors dried and put in bottles it is nearly as good this way as when fresh keep it in a dark closet Where you have a garden do not throw away the soap suds that are left from washing as they are very good to water herbs and flowers It is very important to have early vegetables A garden that is spaded or ploughed in the winter is ready to plant much earlier There are many things that will bear the spring frosts without injury and if planted early will be ready to grow when the fine weather comes Tomatoes should be sowed in boxes or a hot bed to be ready to transplant The scrapings of a cellar are good to put in the garden to enrich it Ashes sprinkled on a yard or grass plat will keep down the coarse grass and produce white clover The grass should be cut out of a brick pavement with a knife and boiling ley poured on to kill the roots Seeds should be saved as they ripen from the finest plants they should be kept in a box with a tight lid to keep them from mice Greasers for Bake irons Take pieces of fat from the back bone or chine of pork cut them in pieces of half a pound each leave the skin on salt them They will do to grease the bake iron where you have buckwheat cakes every morning in winter and should be kept in a cool place after remaining in salt several weeks they may be hung up in an airy place This is nicer than suet Cement for the Tops of Bottles or Jars Take equal parts of rosin and brick dust pounded fine a lump of beeswax stew them together and keep in an old tin melting it when you want to seal your bottles or jars Cement for Mending Cast iron To mend a crack or sand hole in an iron pot beat up the white of an egg and mix equal weight of salt and sifted ashes work it very smooth and fill up the crack let it harden before it is used If it is a large sand hole you wish to mend put in a rivet and secure it with the cement if it gets loose it is easily fastened by the same process Weather Proof Cement Take of fine sand one part two of clay three of ashes mix with linseed oil to the consistency required Put it on with a towel or brush It is said to become as hard as marble To Cleanse Vials c Put ashes and water in each one and boil them in water letting them heat gradually Pie plates may be cleansed in the same way Iron pots that have been used for boiling milk may be cleaned by boiling ashes and water in them Mending China with Milk China can be mended if not too badly broken by boiling it in skim milk it should be entirely clear of cream or the oily particles will prevent its adhesion Tie the pieces with tape or fine cord put them into a kettle of cold milk and let them boil two hours then take it off the fire and when cold take the china out and set it away let it stand for several months China pitchers tea pot lids cup plates and dishes have been used for years after being mended in this way Mending China with White Lead Take the bottom of an old paint keg and carefully with a small knife put it on the edge of glass or china close the parts together and place away if badly broken mend the small parts first and set away then when dry putty the edges you wish to join carefully and set on the top shelf of a closet where it will be undisturbed for a year Linseed Oil for Furniture For polishing mahogany or walnut furniture that has never been varnished linseed oil has been recommended It possesses a tendency to harden and become solid on long exposure to the air It is this peculiar quality that renders it useful in its application to furniture Rub the furniture you wish to polish having previously washed all the wax from it with soap and water all over with the oil a small piece of sponge is suitable for the purpose let it remain a few minutes so as to sink in the wood then rub it in with a soft cloth and again with a clean cloth Do this every other day and your table will soon be fit to use for breakfast or tea without fear of spoiling the polish when you wash it off it should be done with plain warm water as soap will injure it It is best not to use a table till it has had several rubbings with the oil and then apply it once a week The pores being filled with the application it becomes hard Always give a table that is in use a rub with a dry cloth every morning For Filtering Water Put a thick layer of pounded charcoal say six inches at the bottom of a large earthen flower pot over this lay a bed of fine sand which has been washed to prevent its giving a taste to the water pour the water in the filterer and put a large stone pitcher under to receive it On A Larger Scale Prepare a tight barrel by charring it on the inside by having some hickory or oak shavings burnt in it then put in half a peck of quick lime and fill it with water After the lime water has stood in the barrel for two weeks it will be ready for use This preparation of the barrel is necessary to remove the acid from the wood which would communicate an unpleasant taste to the water Fit a partition in the barrel perforated with many holes about three inches from the bottom of the barrel and having put in a tube to go down from the top through the partition nearly to the bottom put on the perforated partition some broken charcoal then finer charcoal a foot thick then about a foot of clean washed sand To use this filter pour the water through the tube which should be open at the top like a funnel the water runs to the bottom and filters upward leaving all the impurities at the bottom The pure water is drawn off from the top of the barrel by means of a spile or faucet To Keep Water Cool in Summer when you have not Ice Where you live at a distance from water and wish to keep it cool put a large stone vessel in the coldest place you can find fill it with water cover it with a towel and wrap a wet cloth around it this will keep it cool for some hours which is a comfort in warm weather To Purify Water To put a small lump of lime into your water cask is useful Agitating and exposing it to the air will help to keep it fresh Strain muddy water through a sieve in which a cloth or sponge or a layer of fine sand or charcoal has been placed Hard water may be softened and rendered suitable for washing by adding to every twelve gallons of water about a quarter of a pound of sal soda Gum Arabic Paste Pulverize in a mortar an ounce of gum arabic pour on boiling water and stir it till dissolved do not put too much water If you wish to keep this paste any length of time put it in a wide mouthed phial and pour alcohol over it keep it corked and as you use it you may thin it with water if required put it on with a feather or brush Preserving Kettles Bell metal copper and brass kettles require very nice cleaning immediately before they are used or it will endanger your health Vinegar with salt or ashes should be used save the vinegar that is left in the pickle jars for this purpose To Clean Knives and Forks In some families the knives are a great care to the housekeeper but by proper management it is rendered easy After using them they should be wiped with a cloth dipped in warm water then wiped dry the handles should never be put in hot water then polish them with Bristol or Bath brick which with the rubbing cloths should be kept in a small box with a strip of leather nailed on one edge on which to polish them after they are rubbed with the brick Knives that are not in daily use should be wrapped in raw cotton and then in paper and if kept in a dry place will not be liable to rust To Clean Teeth With Remarks on Fixing the Habit c Pulverized charcoal mixed with honey is very good to cleanse teeth and make them white A little Peruvian bark put in a phial with lime water is excellent to use occasionally by those that have offensive teeth and tincture of myrrh mixed with a little water may be used with advantage to harden the gums A little Peruvian bark put in the teeth just before going to bed and washed out in the morning is an excellent preservative of teeth It is very important for parents to insist on children cleaning their teeth at least it is well for them to begin before they lose their first set as it makes them last longer and fixes the habit which is of great importance To Clean Kid Gloves Take a piece of flannel moisten it with a little milk rub it on a cake of mild soap and apply it to the soiled spots on the gloves as soon as the dirt is removed rub the spot with a dry piece of flannel and dry them on the hands Care must be taken that the gloves are not made too wet or they will have a wrinkled appearance Dark gloves that are worn in winter should be exposed to the sun for about a quarter of an hour in the spring before putting them away or they will be liable to

old housekeepers have their favorite recipes it is for the young and inexperienced these are particularly intended and may be used with safety when a physician is not at hand Remarks upon a Deeply Seated Cough It is very important to begin in time with a cold Consumption is sometimes prevented by very simple remedies To put Burgundy pitch plasters on the breast and back of the neck often has a good effect they should be re spread frequently and when one part is irritated change them to another place Put one on your side if you have a pain there Flannel should be put on next the skin by all means which with the above simple remedies will cure a cold if begun with in time I have frequently known new flannel put on those that usually wore it greatly to benefit a delicate person The increased irritation of the new flannel acts on the pores of the skin and promotes circulation Hair soles worn in the shoe or socks made of flannel or soft buckskin worn under the stockings are very good to keep the feet warm and dry Persons predisposed to consumption should have nourishing food and not eat too much at a time they should avoid strong tea or coffee and drink milk Eggs oysters fresh fish and fowls are very good for them Fruit of all kinds is useful They should take exercise in the air particularly riding on horse back or take a short walk but not so as to be fatigued to work moderately in a garden when the ground is not too damp is good exercise for a delicate person the smell of fresh earth and of flowers is beneficial to both body and mind After taking exercise a glass of lemonade is very refreshing and promotes appetite If there should be perspiration at night change the sheets and pillow cases frequently and the under garments air the chamber and bed clothes every day if the weather is too damp to raise the windows shake up the bed and leave it unmade half of the day and put it out in the sun occasionally By all means avoid strong medicine or any thing that has a tendency to weaken the body Sometimes blisters are used with very good effect also rubbing the breast and back with camphor or spirits or with a piece of dry flannel Taking anodyne drops particularly laudanum should be avoided if possible they may still the cough during the night but it will come on with increased violence in the morning they weaken the stomach increase the fever and sometimes cause delirium Everything that tends to excite or irritate the mind should be kept from them It is very important to talk cheerfully to sick persons particularly if confined to their chamber which can be done without lightness or trifling If they see gloomy faces around them it has a very disheartening effect and if the mind sinks such is its intimate connection with the body that it is hard to raise it I have known persons by judicious management to live for many years after it was thought they were in a deep decline by avoiding weakening medicines taking exercise on horse back and on foot and never indulging in a full meal Sometimes such persons have very good appetites and it is a satisfaction to their friends to see them eat heartily but they should eat something frequently rather than over load the stomach too much When they come in hungry from a ride to beat up an egg with a tea spoonful of wine and a little sugar and nutmeg put in a tumbler with some milk and taken with a cracker or biscuit or a piece of thin toast broken up in it has a very strengthening effect Persons are seldom benefitted by a strict diet but it is sometimes enforced till they lose their appetite and cannot eat If the weather is so that exercise cannot be taken out of doors some method should be devised for taking it in the house Rubbing furniture and playing battle door are good exercise for a female but should not be taken too much at a time Men that are confined to the house are sometimes very much at a loss what to do if such would purchase a few tools and appropriate a spare room as a workshop it would promote their health I have known men that were but little acquainted with the use of tools do many useful and ornamental pieces of work that were greatly valued by their friends and the exertion kept their spirits from sinking when the weather was too inclement to take exercise in the open air For a Cough Take a wine glass of the juice of the green hoarhound or if that cannot be obtained a strong decoction from the dry herb will answer mix it in half a pint of new milk sweetened either with sugar or honey take this half an hour before breakfast It has been known to cure obstinate coughs and persons that have taken it for four weeks or more have gained strength and flesh and the pain in the breast was relieved Flannel should be worn Elecampane and Hoarhound Syrup Put a pint of hoarhound in a quart of water and let it draw by the fire put a tea cupful of dried elecampane root in a pint of water cover it close and let it boil till all the strength is out strain it and the hoarhound together and put them to boil with a pound of sugar when it is a rich syrup pour it in a pitcher to cool and bottle it Take a table spoonful at a time when the cough is troublesome Sometimes flaxseed is a useful addition to this syrup Brown Mixture for a Cough Take of paregoric liquorice and gum arabic each an ounce from fifty to one hundred drops of antimonial wine and two gills of hot water mix them well together and when cold bottle and cork it tight take two tea spoonsful at a time if it should nauseate give a smaller quantity If this produce profuse perspiration avoid going in the air unless well wrapped up This has been useful in the latter stages of the whooping cough Ginger Tea With Remarks on its Use c Strong ginger tea sweetened and taken hot on going to bed is very good Where persons have been exposed to the air and think they have taken fresh cold keep the feet warm by taking a hot brick to bed and do not increase the cold the next day If it is not deeply seated taking this a few nights will give relief A piece of ginger root kept about the person to chew is good for a tickling in the throat which many persons are subject to when sitting in close heated apartments in lecture rooms or places of worship Lemon Mixture for a Cough Put two fresh eggs in a jar cover them with the juice of six large lemons let it stand until the hard shell of the eggs is eaten off then beat it together strain it and add half a pound of rock candy one gill of brandy and two table spoonsful of sweet oil Mixture of Lemon Juice and Honey Take half a pint of honey and squeeze the juice of four lemons on it mix well together and add a small portion of sugar take a tea spoonful every time the cough is troublesome Hoarhound Candy Put two pounds of sugar in a pint of hoarhound tea as strong as can be made which may be done by drawing two sets of hoarhound in the same water till the strength is out of each when it is cold mix in the sugar and the white of an egg when it begins to boil take off the scum as it rises boil it slowly till it becomes thick so that when you drop it on a plate it will be hard and crisp and pour it out in plates that have been greased with a little sweet butter when cold you can break it up for use and tie it up in a jar This is quite as useful as the candy you buy and is much cheaper it is very convenient for persons that have a cough to have a little box of this about them to take when there is a tickling in the throat Mustard Bath for the Feet Soap Stones c It gives relief to a bad cold in the early stages to soak the feet in warm water in which you have put half a tea cup of salt and two table spoonsful of pulverized mustard and to drink ginger tea You may keep your feet in the bath for half an hour and then retire with a warm soap stone wrapped in a cloth and placed near them A soap stone the size of a brick will when thoroughly heated keep warm till morning and is invaluable for an elderly person or one that suffers with cold feet Liverwort Syrup Make a quart of strong liverwort tea by extracting two sets of herbs in the same water tie a tea cup of flaxseed in a bag and put with it keep it covered while drawing when the strength is all out strain it on a pound of sugar and let it boil slowly till it is thick keeping it covered to prevent the strength from going off when cold bottle it and set the bottle in a cool place while using it Take a table spoonful at a time about six times a day This has been used for a cough with great benefit For Sore Throat Make a gargle of cayenne pepper honey and spirits or sage tea with alum and honey or figs boiled mashed and strained and use it once in two hours If it is very bad steam the mouth with a funnel held over hot vinegar and put on a hot poultice of hops boiled in weak ley and thickened with corn meal there should be a little lard spread over renew it every time it gets cold Another very good poultice is hot mush strewed with powdered camphor put it on as hot as can be borne and change it when cold A purgative should be given either of senna and salts castor oil or rhubarb and soap pills An emetic is of great importance and has caused the throat to break when persons have been very ill Sore throats have been cured when quinsy was apprehended by using powdered camphor and lard on flannel It is a good way when persons are subject to it to keep an ounce of camphor mixed with lard in a wide mouthed bottle or jar and corked tight The cayenne pepper and honey gargle should also be kept ready mixed and used when the first symptoms appear or in a violent attack a plaster of snuff and lard may be applied with benefit keeping it on only a few minutes at a time Sometimes a bag of hot ashes sprinkled with vinegar and applied hot as can be borne has cured a sore throat in one night Persons that have been afflicted for years with repeated attacks of sore throat and quinsy have been cured by bathing the throat neck and ears with cold water every morning The constant use of the shower bath is very important Keep the feet warm Molasses Posset for a Cold Take a pint of the best molasses a tea spoonful of powdered ginger a quarter of a pound of fresh butter and let them simmer together for half an hour then stir in the juice of two lemons or if you have not these two table spoonsful of strong vinegar cover over the sauce pan and let it stand by the fire five minutes longer Some of this may be taken warm or cold For Whooping Cough Dissolve a scruple of salts of tartar in a gill of water put in half a scruple of pulverized cochineal sweeten it with loaf sugar give an infant a tea spoonful of this mixture four times a day and a child four years old or upwards a table spoonful In some cases the relief is instantaneous Another Remedy Half a pint of honey half a pint of vinegar two table spoonsful of sweet oil stewed together a few minutes when cold put it in a bottle and put in a tea spoonful of laudanum shake it well and give a table spoonful when the cough is troublesome and a dose just before going to bed For an infant of six months a small tea spoonful is a dose and for a child of four years two tea spoonsful Where there is not much fever a little port or claret wine mixed with sugar and water and taken with toast broken in it is beneficial Children should be taken out riding if possible and should be well wrapped up For the Croup Put the child in warm water and keep up the temperature by putting in more hot water keep it in fifteen or twenty minutes then wipe it dry and put it in a warm bed or wrap a blanket round it and hold it on the lap give it an emetic and put powdered garlic and lard to the throat and soles of the feet keep up the perspiration by giving a few drops of antimonial wine every half hour The next morning give it a dose of rhubarb tea or castor oil and keep it from the air for several days This treatment has been very beneficial when a physician was not at hand and nothing had been done till his arrival perhaps the child would have been too far gone to recover In cases of croup to wet a piece of flannel with alcohol and apply it to the throat as hot as it can be borne has often a salutary effect applied frequently It is also good to use for a bad cold c Molasses stewed with a lump of butter and a table spoonful of vinegar taken just before you go to bed and to grease the nose forehead and breast with mutton tallow will sometimes cure a child without any thing else To pound garlic in a rag and squeeze out the juice mix it with molasses and give a tea spoonful at a time has given relief when a child was very ill Sliced onions or garlic stewed with sugar and water or molasses is very good to take for a cold Where children are subject to the croup you should always have a pot of water over the fire and light wood near to heat it as quick as possible Children that are subject to these attacks should have their feet kept warm and dry and always wear flannel next to the skin It is the duty of parents to make use of the most simple remedies which may always be in readiness and if applied in time may prevent the necessity of giving strong medicines which injure the constitutions of young children The least symptom of the disease should be attended to Lobelia is a certain remedy for croup If the case is light a few drops of the tincture increasing the dose according to the age of the child given at short intervals will cause it to vomit and prevent danger but if the attack is a severe one you should give the third preparation of lobelia for a child of ten years ten drops and so on in proportion mix it with sugar and water Every mother should keep lobelia at hand as it has been known to give certain relief in many cases A child of twelve months may take of the tincture ten drops every fifteen or twenty minutes till it acts as an emetic or relieves by perspiration one of two or three years may take twenty or thirty drops The third preparation is of much greater strength than the tincture Infants Colic c Tea made of catnip and sweetened given to an infant when it appears to be in pain is often useful Sweet marjoram tea also relieves pain and has a soothing effect on the nerves To put the feet in warm water and put a warm piece of flannel to the stomach is important but if neither of these relieve the child put it in warm water for about ten minutes and cover it from the air carefully wipe it dry and keep it warm afterwards A little weak ginger tea is good for the colic as also tea made of dried damask rose leaves a tea spoonful of leaves will make a tea cupful of tea Uneasiness is frequently caused by their stomachs being overloaded with food and care should be taken in this respect Having lately met with some remarks in the Baltimore American with which I am much pleased I take the liberty of inserting them Narcotics and anodynes cannot be given with too much caution the sensitive and nervous system of an infant should never be acted upon by these powerful drugs unless in extreme cases and of these few mothers should presume to judge Two drops of laudanum says the London Medical Gazette have been known to kill an infant and a single drop it is said stole the life of a new born babe The most experienced medical men never administer medicines of this class to the very young without exercising the utmost caution and making the most accurate calculations In the present day the more general diffusion of correct facts in physiology and pathology has caused a large class of young mothers to reject the old system of giving narcotic drugs to infants In carrying out this salutary reformation like all other reformers they have a strong opposition to contend with old fashioned nurses do much harm in opposing all nursery reformations consequently young mothers will have a hard task to execute Too many have not the steady courage to hold on to the end in mild but firm opposition to all erroneous but well meant interference But there are others whose pure and unswerving love for their tender off spring keeps them firm to their duty to these the next generation will owe much They are the little band of true hearted reformers whose good example will be like leaven spreading until its influence is felt throughout the wide circle of maternal responsibility Summer Diseases The food of children in summer should be light and nourishing if of milk be careful that it is sweet If you cannot get it fresh as often as you want it boiling will keep it sweet Sour milk and improper food sometimes bring on the summer disease which is easier prevented than cured A little rhubarb tea or tincture with a small quantity of prepared chalk will sometimes check it in its early stages but the most effectual medicine that I have tried is called by some apothecaries red mixture of which I will give a recipe

it becomes thick is a very cooling drink It may be filled up the second time Barley water is also a suitable drink Erysipelas is frequently brought on by violent exercise and the perspiration being checked too suddenly Persons that have once had it should avoid extremes of heat and cold and pay strict attention to diet not eating any thing that disagrees with them All acids particularly pickles are improper The stomach should be cleansed by emetics Small and frequent doses of senna and salts if taken just at going to bed will not occasion much sickness and tend greatly to relieve the system

prevent too sudden a check of perspiration Magnesia Charcoal and Salts Form a valuable compound for family use one ounce of each mixed together and put in a wide mouthed bottle it is useful for head ache or diseases of the skin Cases of erysipelas have been cured by its continued use Take a tea spoonful of the mixture in a little water two or three times a day or on going to bed at night Persons

the same time as a wash on the part affected borax dissolved in strong vinegar In cases of erysipelas the charcoal mixture has been used with great benefit it is excellent for purifying the blood Take it in small doses for two or three weeks then discontinue it and take it again at intervals If this medicine should be found unpleasant take a tea spoonful of jelly or something of that kind after it

round the joint keeps it warm and relieves stiffness If the pain is in the back part of the head put a blister on the neck by all means When persons have a bad spell of rheumatism they should always take medicine and avoid eating meat for a few days Equal parts of rhubarb and castile soap made into pills with a little water is a valuable medicine for rheumatism and suits aged persons the pills should be taken at night on going to bed They are easily made and should always be at hand it is valuable as a cathartic in almost every case where mild medicine is necessary The use of the shower bath is also beneficial Flannel should always be worn next the skin and the feet kept dry Bathing with camphor sometimes relieves the pain but there is a danger of driving it to a more vital part Salt and water is useful to bathe for the rheumatism when it is of long standing Deafness Remarks c A remarkable case of deafness was cured by the following remedy An aged person whose hearing had been very good gradually became so deaf as not to be able to hear common conversation after suffering some months the patient thought of trying the following remedy of honey brandy and sweet oil each a tea spoonful warm and mix well together sew a soft linen rag to the eye of a strong darning needle dip this mop in the mixture while warm and put it in the ear hold it in till cold when renew and move it

mixture also flannel round the head at night A young person was relieved by the persevering use of the following remedies Put a small blister of Spanish flies behind the ears very high up on the hard part so as to be clear of the leaders or it will occasion pain when drawn dress them in the usual way and as soon as healed renew them repeat this several times keeping wool in the ears dipped in sweet oil and at night put in small pieces of fat bacon that has been boiled and tie a handkerchief around to keep them warm When the blisters are healed the hair should be cut short to enable the patient to bathe the head in cold water which should be poured from a pitcher begin with it a little warm and gradually get it colder this should be persevered in even in cold weather wipe the head and tie it up till dry I have been induced to make these remedies public by seeing several interesting young persons suffering from deafness with a hope that they may be of use Remedy for Sick Head

If there should be any curds on the top take them off then skim off the clear butter and keep it covered by the fire give from one to two table spoonsful at a time three or four times a day This is useful in cases of dysentery and is also soothing to the stomach after violent vomiting for a long time Sometimes a plaster of mustard put on the stomach stops vomiting For Dysentery and Diarrhoea The following prescription from an eminent physician has proved valuable Take of calcined magnesia two drachms of aromatic spirits of ammonia two and a half drachms of water half a pint mix well together and as a dose for a grown person give a table spoonful every half hour until relieved Some country nurses recommend dittany tea or spice wood berries boiled in new milk A large poultice on the stomach and bowels made of new milk thickened with light bread has given relief keeping it warm Be careful to keep the patient s feet warm and to bathe the back and stomach with spirits Where the dittany and spice wood cannot be obtained other aromatics as cinnamon and cloves are good substitutes Remedies for the Dysentery and Cholera Morbus Take the roots of the low running blackberry or dewberry make a strong tea sweeten it and drink it occasionally Take a large apple cut out the core and wrap in wet paper cover it up in hot ashes and when cooked take off the paper and eat it cold Take one pint of

a little lard which should be very pure for three or four minutes then strain it and pour some in the ear before it gets cool This gives almost immediate relief The heart of a roasted onion put warm in the ear and tie around the head a silk handkerchief has given relief A Wash for Sore Ears Make a tea of the black or candle alder wet a soft rag with it and lay it on it should be applied three

a small blister behind the ears very high up on the hard part so as to avoid the leaders Infants should not be exposed to the light too soon it sometimes weakens the sight and seriously injures the eyes The pith of sassafras put in water is good to bathe inflamed eyes a decoction of young hyson tea is also used with benefit Persons afflicted with weak eyes should avoid a strong light and should not strain their eyes with reading or sewing at night I have known small doses of charcoal mixture relieve the eyes when there was slight inflammation Attention to diet is necessary Fold a linen handkerchief dip it in cold water and bind it over the eyes at night on retiring and you will experience relief Pain in the eyeballs is also relieved by gently rubbing the finger and thumb over the lids towards the nose This was published some years since and I have known it give relief and strengthen the eyes For Worms Equal parts of salt and sugar taken while fasting are good for worms a tea spoonful is sufficient for a child two years old to take half a cup of chamomile rue or wormwood tea with a little sugar two hours before breakfast is also good Give a dose of senna after they have been taking this three days It is very important to bruise garlic and rue to apply to the stomach put it in a bag and wet it with spirits every day The garlic and rue is said to keep the worms out of the stomach Wormseed oil a few drops at a time has given relief but should be used cautiously Old cheese grated and given to a child has been known to afford relief it is also beneficial when a child

swelling which proceeds from tooth ache Cure for Cholera Morbus Put a table spoonful of hot ashes in half a pint of good hard cider and give the patient three table spoonsful of it at a time This has given relief in half an hour Another cure is to take a soft cork and hum it thoroughly when it ceases to blaze powder the coal very fine on a plate Mix a table spoonful of this powder with a little milk or water or any thing agreeable to the palate repeat the dose till the disorder ceases which it generally does after two or three doses This has given relief to a person in the greatest agony with the bilious colic For Colic Drink strong ginger tea while hot and put hot bricks to the stomach and feet if this does not give relief take a dose of rhubarb or castor oil Persons subject to the colic should keep a piece of ginger about them to chew after eating wear flannel next the skin and be careful to keep the feet dry they should avoid strong coffee and tea and eat nothing that disagrees with them Dry toast without butter and crackers are good for persons that have the colic For violent cases take two table spoonsful of brandy and half a tea spoonful of black pepper For Bilious Colic and Indigestion Pour three quarts of boiling water on a quart of hickory ashes and a tea cup of soot let it stand a day then filter it and if the complaint is bad take a wine glassful before and after each meal This has been very beneficial to persons with the above complaint Warner s Cordial for Gout in the Stomach Take one ounce of rhubarb two drachms of senna two of fennel seed two of coriander seed one of saffron and one of liquorice stone and cut half a pound of good raisins and put all in a quart of good spirits let it stand in a warm place for ten days shaking it every day then strain it off and add a pint more spirits to the same ingredients when all the strength is extracted strain it and mix the first and last together Take from two to four spoonsful of this cordial in as much boiling water as will make it as hot as you can take it if the pain is not removed in half an hour repeat the dose and if your stomach will not retain it add ten drops of laudanum doctor Warner remarks after twenty years experience of this medicine in myself and others it is impossible for me to speak of it in terms higher than it deserves When the vital parts are affected persons subject to the gout should never sleep without it in their chamber Cure for Tetter Take one tea spoonful of powdered Spanish flies put them in half a pint of French brandy wash the part affected occasionally This has been highly recommended to me as a remedy for tetter on the hands but I have never seen it tried For Cramp in the Stomach Dissolve a tea spoonful of table salt in a tea cup of warm water if this does not stop the vomiting and cramp repeat the dose this is very useful in stopping the operation of an emetic when it has continued too long Flannel cloths dipped in hot spirits and sprinkled with cayenne pepper and applied to the stomach sometimes relieves the pain a mustard plaster is also of use For Cramp A foot board to the bedstead is of great service when you are taken with the cramp in the night and by placing the foot against it will sometimes give relief Another remedy is to tie a string round the limb between the body and the pain about as tight as a physician does to draw blood wear a bandage filled with pounded brimstone round the limb to prevent a return of it Sometimes to hold a roll of brimstone in each hand will relieve the cramp and persons subject to it should keep some by the bed side to use in the night For Scalds and Burns When persons are badly scalded or burned to put raw cotton on immediately and wet it with spirits is very good other remedies are linseed oil and lime water starch and cream scraped potatoes molasses and eggs beaten up and put on immediately Almost any thing will relieve the pain that excludes the air Be careful not to break the skin as it will be longer in healing If a foot is scalded pour cold water over it and cut the stocking You should be careful to use linen rags about a burn as cotton rags cause irritation After the place begins to heal up a salve may be applied made of equal parts of Burgundy pitch beeswax sheep s tallow and sweet oil melted together over the fire renew it twice a day washing the place each time with milk and water and a little castile soap A wash of weak sugar of lead water is also good for burns A poultice of powdered elm bark mixed with water and put on frequently wetting the sore with thick cream is also soothing be careful that the limb does not contract as there is great danger if the sinews are affected If there should be fever a mild cathartic should be given Comstock s Pain Extractor sometimes gives great relief you may also apply immediately with benefit a tea spoonful of air slaked lime and a table spoonful of lard sift the lime and rub them well together For a burn by vitriol or any caustic substance apply whites of eggs mixed with powdered chalk putting it on with a feather Linen rags dipped in cold water and changed every few minutes I have known applied day and night to give relief to a bad burn on the foot but avoid putting the foot in water although it gives present relief it is dangerous For Ague Take half an ounce of coarsely powdered race ginger infused in three gills of boiling water when cool strain and sweeten it and for a dose give a heaped tea spoonful of Peruvian bark in a wine glassful of the ginger tea

changing their domestics and weary their friends with complaints of those they have and inquiries for others Deliberate before you make a change if servants are honest speak the truth and have an obliging disposition it is better to bear with a few defects than to discharge them these are qualifications for the foundation of a good servant and some of the most valuable I have had were such as could hardly be put up with at first By being patient and speaking to them in a kind manner they become attached and fearful of doing any thing to offend When they break any thing or an accident occurs accustom them to inform you of it immediately Few mistresses of well regulated minds will be offended when openly told of accidents but if they are left to be found out you always feel more disposed to blame and reprove them By speaking to them in a mild and forgiving manner careless servants will become more careful A considerate mistress may without loss of dignity make them feel that she regards it as her duty to be their friend and that she feels herself under an obligation to advise them in difficulties and promote their comfort We should reflect that theirs is a life of servitude and if they over exert themselves or are too much exposed in early life it will bring on disease that will shorten their days or render old age a burden Some young persons are too indolent to wait on themselves and ring for the servants on the most trifling occasions when if they were accustomed to perform these little offices their health would be much better and we should not hear of so many complaints the result of want of exercise All female servants should have time to attend to their clothing many have to work so hard through the day that their only leisure is at night and then they hurry over their things in a careless manner Where your circumstances permit a good man servant is a valuable acquisition and they are sometimes more easily governed than females If mistresses were better informed they would not complain so much of the ignorance and awkwardness of their domestics Always give them their orders in time If a new dish is to be cooked superintend its preparation yourself If you are capable of directing a cook will soon learn to do without your constant attention If they are slow in their movements insist on their beginning early to prepare a meal so that there will be time sufficient for every thing to be done properly If you expect company have every thing prepared that can be done with safety the day previous In summer there are but few things that can be done without risk of spoiling a ham or tongue may he washed ready to boil castors and salt stands put in order and pastry or dessert prepared that will not spoil by being kept a day In winter many things can be kept for days in a state of preparation for cooking and it greatly assists the work of the family to have every thing done beforehand Do with as few domestics as possible assist with the work yourself rather than keep one too many Those that take orphan children to bring up are often rewarded for their trouble as sometimes a girl of fifteen will be more useful than one much older and where a family is small it does very well but in large families a little girl is so often called from her work that it has a tendency to unsettle and make her careless Never allow your children to call on or interrupt servants when at their work or meals to do any thing which a child could do for itself children that treat domestics with respect will generally find them willing to render any assistance in their power I have known a few housekeepers who have kept the same servants for years who have assisted in rearing the children until they almost viewed them as their own and these were not faultless If they had been discharged for trifles they might have wandered from one family to another without being attached to any until they became so indifferent as not to be worthy of employ but by the kindness and patience of their employer they became so grateful and attached as to be a treasure to her family When they become weary of such constant servitude would it not be better instead of discharging to give them time for rest and recreation in visiting their friends I have known them to return renewed in health and spirits Encourage them to lay by as much of their wages as they can possibly spare in such institutions as are thought the most safe that they may have something to look to in case of sickness or any event which would require its use Promote their reading in such books as are suited to their capacities they sometimes have a little leisure that could be well filled up in this way I have found it to increase the happiness of those under my care to encourage a fondness for reading and improving their minds it tends to keep them from unprofitable company and too much visiting to which so many are addicted Young girls should make and mend their own clothes and keep them in good order and they should be taught to knit The material of which stockings are composed costs but little and they wear much better than those that are bought Knitting fills up leisure moments and promotes industrious habits and when age comes on they will have a resource although it appears so simple yet if it is not learned while young it is hard to acquire when old When servants are guilty of faults that cannot be looked over instead of publicly reproving them take an opportunity when alone and talk coolly tell them of your sorrow at being obliged to notice their conduct encourage them to pursue a different course and that you will forgive them if they will strive to do better I have known them much improved by this mode of treatment By inspecting every department not only will waste be prevented but dishonesty In cities many persons find it necessary to lock up nearly every thing and it is a lamentable state of things that so few are to be trusted Sometimes treating servants with confidence will have a good effect but let them be aware that you have a knowledge of every thing that is going on Some young persons are completely at the mercy of their domestics I have known great uneasiness to be experienced and much loss but by showing a little moral courage and discharging those that are irreclaimable an ascendancy was gained Never suffer them to treat you with disrespect or impertinence If it is known that they will be discharged for these faults they will be on their guard If you have taken a boy or girl to bring up as a domestic endeavour to teach them at least to spell and read they are sometimes very fond of their books and if you once get them to reading it will become to them a favorite evening amusement I have known them take up their books on every occasion of leisure I have seen boys that worked hard through the day spend all the evening with their books slate and occasionally a little writing Sometimes I have in the evening felt fatigued and listless and would much rather read and amuse myself than go out to teach two or three in the kitchen but in attending to this which I consider a duty have felt a sweet reward indeed their grateful thanks expressed by words have encouraged me to keep on I have thought a little instruction in this way arouses their faculties and tends to make them more industrious When I have been prevented from teaching them for some time by indisposition or other causes I have observed they were not so cheerful in the performance of their work If they are reading any thing they do not fully understand take a little time to explain it to them It will be my young friends like sowing the good seed and you as well as they will receive the reward I wish to encourage you in the most affectionate manner to attend to this duty you will find it will strengthen you in the performance of others The more we exert our faculties the more we can accomplish He that does nothing renders himself incapable of doing any thing While we are executing one work we are preparing ourselves to undertake another REMARKS Remarks on Carving c I do not think it necessary to say much on the subject of carving as those who are accustomed to sit at a well ordered table and who observe the manner of the host and hostess can soon acquire the art both of carving and helping with ease And when placed at the head of their own table the knowledge thus gained will be found a great assistance The proper time for children to acquire good habits at meals is not when there is company it should be an every day lesson As when parents are engaged with their friends or guests they have no time to devote to the manners of their children and to reprove them at table is very unpleasant as well as mortifying Young children will soon acquire the manner of sitting quietly till they are helped if they are made to understand that they will not be permitted to eat with their parents and friends unless they behave with propriety I have thought it a great assistance to the good order of a large family for every member to be punctual in their attendance at meals and all to sit down together with a short pause before the carving and helping commences In those moments of quiet the heart is sometimes awakened to a feeling of gratitude to the Almighty dispenser of our blessings At the table different members of the family meet and where affection and kindness those aids to true politeness preside it is truly a delightful treat to be the guest of such a family Every symptom of selfishness should be discouraged for if suffered to take root in a child it lays the foundation of much that is disagreeable to themselves and others Inculcate this excellent rule of doing unto others what you wish others to do unto you and always preferring others to yourself It is the custom in some well regulated families to permit the younger members as they arrive at a suitable age to take turns in presiding not only at breakfast and tea but at the dinner table I have known quite young girls that had been taught in this way carve a fowl or joint of meat with ease and grace In helping they should be taught not to over load the plate as it takes away the appetite of some persons to be helped too largely The gravy should be stirred so that all may be helped alike and a small quantity put on the meat or fowl to which it belongs and not on vegetables unless it is particularly desired If there should be a rare dish on the table it is best to hand it round and let every one help himself after it has been nicely cut up Ham is much nicer to be cut in very thin slices So is salt beef and tongue Young housekeepers in selecting their dishes for dinner if they have not an experienced cook should avoid those that are difficult to prepare Never try a new dish when you expect company Your guests will be more gratified with a neat and moderate table with a few plain and well cooked dishes accompanied with the smiling countenance of the hostess than with a great variety of ill cooked and badly arranged viands Economy the Source of Charity If your circumstances will not admit of giving away much you can by economy give a little and a blessing will attend it There are few of the very poor that know how to repair old clothing to advantage a garment will be of much more service that is well mended before it is given to them It has been remarked that the poor are ungrateful and forget the favors conferred upon them I have seldom found them deficient in this respect and when they are if we would reflect that if some of us received no more than we deserve we should be but poorly off We know in our own families how acceptable is a nice present of something that a sick member can eat and it is sometimes the means of restoring the appetite when any thing cooked in the house is rejected The feeling of love with which it is presented is as a cordial to a sick person How much more acceptable will something nourishing be to one oppressed with poverty as well as sickness When the rich are diseased the physician often finds it necessary to enjoin strict abstinence but very different is it with the poor who frequently suffer for want of nourishment When the mother of a poor family is ill how greatly are her sufferings augmented by the knowledge that her children are deprived of her services and how acceptable to such a family would be a loaf of bread or a large bowl of soup which could be made of materials that would hardly be missed Dried beans or peas and onions are a cheap and valuable addition to soup also cold vegetables The liquor that fresh meat is boiled in should be carefully saved for that purpose if there are those near you that need it It may seem at first troublesome to a young housekeeper to take the necessary care to save for the poor It is certainly much easier to let the cook have her own way and waste or not as she pleases but for your encouragement my young friends permit me to say you will be sweetly rewarded for your attention to them One eminent for his charities near the close of life made this remark What I spent I lost but what I gave away remains with me To Encourage Children in Acts of Kindness to the Aged and Afflicted Young children may early be taught to administer to the wants of the aged and infirm Some mothers are in the practice of giving a small sum of money to their children as a reward for some little service or piece of work that they have done The money thus obtained to be laid out for a sick or old poor person This method has an excellent effect on the minds of children it incites them to industry teaches self denial and the feelings of love and charity which are thus early instilled into their tender minds make a lasting impression If they spent their little fund in trifles for their own use they would acquire a habit of selfishness which when once formed it is most difficult to eradicate I have remarked the pleasure with which children will relate the incidents of a visit which they have been permitted to make to a poor family and it is a refreshment to persons advanced in life to see a young family thus trained As soon as little girls can sew they should be encouraged to make garments for the poor or repair their own old ones as a present to a child of their own size or make patchwork out of old dresses for a bed covering for poor people Their being permitted to do these things should be as a reward for good behavior and attention to their lessons or other duties When they are old enough to make a loaf of bread a pie or a little plain cake allow them to do it and take as a present to or make broth or panada for a sick person This teaches them to prepare these things while young and may be useful to them in after life How cheering it must be to the aged or afflicted to see smiling young faces enter their dwellings bearing their little offerings of food or clothing the work of their own hands Be encouraged my dear young mothers if you thus train your children to works of charity you will be doubly blessed Early Rising Promotes Punctuality It is an old and true saying that if you waste an hour in the morning it is seldom recovered all that day This dispirits you and the next day there is still something left undone A late riser is rarely punctual in her engagements and more of the happiness of married life depends on forming a habit of strict punctuality than young persons are generally aware of If you are distressed at having acquired habits of late rising and want of punctuality remember by perseverance they can be overcome Fix an hour for rising and let nothing but illness prevent your being up at that time While forming this useful habit you should retire to rest early Many things can be better attended to at an early than a late hour in the morning Where families rise before the sun the day seems much longer all the active employments of the early riser are accomplished before her later neighbors have finished their breakfast The duties of the bath and toilet being performed her chamber well aired and arranged and her parlor in order she is ready for the more quiet employments of reading and sewing In a well regulated household servants perform their duties with life and energy Determine on an hour for your meals and if all the members of the family adhere to it scrupulous exactness will soon be established Hints to Young Wives The authoress is well aware of the difficulties which surround a young wife on her first setting out particularly if situated at a distance from the kind mother who has hitherto directed her with servants who watch every movement and who will soon discover whether the new mistress is qualified for the task she has undertaken Accustom yourself to rise early fix a certain hour and let nothing but indisposition prevent your being up at the appointed time By this means your affairs will all be arranged in good season and you will have time for recreation in walking riding or in reading such authors as will tend to strengthen and improve your mind Young persons removed from large families often suffer greatly from loneliness whereas if they were occupied with household affairs they would not feel so severely the absence of their husbands while attending to business Be punctual to the hour that has been fixed on for your meals and let good order prevail in every department of which you have the command A mistress of a family is much happier who knows how every thing is going on from the garret to the cellar By inspecting every thing you soon become interested and we all know when that is the case the most difficult pursuits become easy and pleasant And with what pleasure will a young wife welcome her husband to his meals when her conscience assures her that she has done her best and that nothing is neglected and how will it lighten his labors to reflect when absent that the partner he has chosen is performing her duty at home I am fully persuaded that the formation of domestic happiness is generally laid the first year of marriage therefore my young friends act well your part if you desire to be treated with confidence you must merit it If you keep an exact account of all your expenses there will be less danger of living beyond your income of which there have been so many lamentable instances Never buy any thing because it is recommended as being cheap many cheap things amount in time to a large sum In selecting furniture let utility not fashion govern your choice some young persons furnish their parlors so extravagantly that necessary and useful articles are neglected for want of means to purchase them Be persuaded that happiness does not consist so much in having splendid furniture as in attending to the every day comforts of those around you If you marry without the useful knowledge necessary for governing your family lose no time in acquiring it There is a time when most young girls show a fondness for domestic affairs before they are old enough to go into company when it would be an agreeable change to be absent from school and assisting their mothers the knowledge thus acquired would never be lost Many a young man who commenced with fair prospects has been ruined through his wife s ignorance of domestic duties and she has suffered from the consequent diminution of his esteem and love I once knew a lovely and accomplished young lady accustomed to every indulgence who on her marriage removed several hundred miles from her parents to reside in the country where servants were difficult to procure This delicate and sensitive young creature was much distressed by her ignorance of almost every thing connected with housekeeping and after suffering repeated mortifications concluded to learn to do the work herself and when this dearly bought knowledge was acquired she was able to teach her ignorant servants and resolved if ever she had daughters to use every means in her power to teach them When a prudent wife is made acquainted with the circumstances of her husband she will endeavor strictly to keep within their bounds always remembering that losses and events over which he has no control may occur and greatly reduce his income And how will it assist her to bear a reverse of fortune if she has acted with discretion it will strengthen the wife to encourage and cheer her partner and enable him to struggle through difficulties which were thought insurmountable Happiness will not forsake such a family though they lose almost every thing the peace which is the result of a good conscience will remain this will strengthen them to begin anew and the Divine blessing will attend such efforts A few Remarks to Encourage Young Housekeepers in their First Attempts As bread is the most important article of food one of your first attempts should be to make a few loaves of good bread and rolls of the most simple kind Bread rolls are very easily made If you succeed tolerably it will encourage you to try again When you make cakes begin with the simple kinds plain jumbles or cakes that you can roll out or crisp ginger bread Sponge cake is easier than those that have butter in them I have known young persons succeed very well with it Bread rusk is also easily made or a few plain pies Do not trust the baking to an ignorant person but superintend it yourself Sometimes baking in a stove is protracted by the dampness of the wood Before you bake have dry wood prepared Watch the time it is a good plan to have a clock near the kitchen Do not have too many things on hand at once but perfect yourself in the knowledge of a few important dishes If you make good yeast you will be more certain of good bread light cakes and rolls To cook a steak nicely is also important and with a dish of potatoes well cooked a dish of cold slaw and an apple pie or a little stewed fruit will make a good plain dinner When your family is small you can have something nice every day without cooking much Veal cutlets and mutton chops are easy to cook and may be prepared in a short time If you have a fowl and boil it you can save the soup and warm it over for the next day A cold roast fowl may be hashed On days that you have cold meat a batter pudding or plain rice pudding is easily prepared If you wish to have an early breakfast make every preparation that you can over night set the table have the relish cut ready to cook or to warm over and cold bread may be sliced and wrapped in a cloth to keep it moist Coffee should be ground and dry fuel and water at hand With these preparations breakfast may be ready in half an hour from the time the fire is made If you have warm corn bread or rolls it will require more time but if you have them made up over night and put in a cool place they will not sour and can soon be baked Maryland biscuit are very convenient as they are always ready and will keep good a week I have found it a great advantage to set the table over night particularly if you have a separate room to eat in although it takes but a short time every minute is important in the morning Where the mistress washes the breakfast things and puts them in their proper places and counts the spoons and other articles she can see when any thing is missing A mop is useful for glass and china keep a pan or a small tub for the purpose of holding the water which should not be too hot If tea things are put in very hot water it will be apt to crack them or they will look smeared Put a little soap in the water wash the glass first then the silver then the cups and saucers and lastly the plates and knives and forks If spoons have been used with eggs put them to soak immediately to prevent their turning dark Have a common waiter for the pan to stand in and on it drain your tea things Spoons when used with care require polishing but seldom as it wears the silver away Dinner dishes should be washed first in moderately warm water and soap rinsed in hot water and drained before wiping Put every thing in its proper place and inspect your pantry and cellar frequently Sometimes things are forgotten for want of attention until they are spoiled Air the cellar frequently do not let refuse vegetables accumulate or any thing that would be likely to cause sickness You should provide coarse towels of different kinds for china and glass and for the dinner dishes also knife cloths have them marked and kept in their proper places Some persons have their towels washed out every day but it is better to save them for the weekly wash If towels are thrown aside damp they are liable to mildew You should keep dusters of several kinds Old silk handkerchiefs are best for highly polished furniture or an old barege veil answers a good purpose For common purposes a square of coarse muslin or check is suitable You should keep one floor cloth for chambers and one for the kitchen Keep brooms for different purposes always use a soft one for carpets as soon as they wear stiff they will do for the kitchen or pavements Pouring a little hot water on a broom softens it for carpets You may save tea leaves to sprinkle over your carpet when you give a thorough sweeping this will brighten it and occasionally to wipe it over with a cloth that has been wrung out of hot water cleanses it of course this is only required for carpets in constant use It is of great importance to health that sleeping apartments should be well aired and swept If you sleep in an apartment where there has been fire during the day it should be well aired before going to bed or if the room is close have a little air admitted so as not to blow on persons that are asleep A window that will lower from the top is an advantage Beds should be well aired before they are made take the clothes off and leave them at least an hour In pleasant weather you may keep chamber windows hoisted for several hours and even in cold weather the windows may be kept up a short time and if on any occasion you may be obliged to have the beds made without airing turn the clothes half way down and leave them for several hours Some persons have cheap calico covers to spread over beds while the room is swept this is a good plan on account of the dust Bolster and pillow tucks wear better if you have a check case basted on this should be changed washed and starched occasionally It is a good plan also to have check covers for matresses and feather beds but the covers should not be kept on beds that are not in use lest they should be liable to moth In winter a blanket should be put next a bed that is not often slept in or for a delicate person and be particularly careful that sheets are dry before they are put away In summer it is most healthy to have your chamber floor bare and have it washed occasionally It is important to examine your clothes after they come from the wash and see that they are perfectly dry before they are put away CULTIVATION OF FLOWERS A few flowers and plants when properly taken care of are ornamental to the windows of a parlor or sitting room and will repay the care that is bestowed on them Begin with a few that are easy to cultivate and you will probably succeed Persons that are fond of flowers and have collected a number are generally willing to give their young friends a few plants and where we succeed in raising a fine plant from a slip or cutting we value it more than one that has been purchased at a green house Geraniums cactus wax plants cape and catalonian jessamines and some others are easily cultivated in a parlor Roses camelias and azaleas bloom best in a moderate temperature as the heat of a parlor unless very large dries the buds and prevents their coming to perfection I have known these to bloom beautifully in a room that was very slightly heated either over one in which there was fire or in an apartment next a stove room If the weather is very cold they should be removed to a warmer room until it moderates The windows that are open to the south are best When the blossoms have matured you can bring them to the parlor but if there is much heat they will not remain perfect so long as in a moderate room Roses are sometimes troubled with insects which should be brushed off with a feather and the plants washed with a decoction of tobacco not too strong they will not bloom when thus infested There is another insect that fastens itself to the bark of lemon trees and other plants frequent washing with soap suds and brushing the sterns removes it and some times wash the leaves with a sponge when the weather is too cold to put them out of doors Setting them out in a warm rain or watering them well all over the foliage is very reviving to plants Be careful to have pieces of old broken earthen ware at the bottom of each pot to drain them or the plants will not thrive The earth should be sometimes removed and an occasional re potting is an advantage being careful not to disturb the roots A mixture of charcoal and sand and rich earth of more than one kind is thought best Earth fresh from the woods is good for pot plants as well as borders but should always be mixed with a stronger soil Roses that are planted round a house should have a deep and rich soil made for them and they will then bloom beautifully all the season Pot plants should in summer be placed in a situation where they wilt not be exposed to intense heat Some persons place their pots in the earth on the north side of the house others keep them in a porch where they can get some sun They require much more water in summer The wax plant blooms beautifully in summer and should be kept in a sheltered situation not exposed to the wind it should have a strong frame of wood and wire to run on well secured in a tub or box Hyacinths and crocuses should be planted in pots boxes or small tubs in rich earth in October or November a small painted tub is very suitable and will hold a dozen hyacinths and as many crocus roots The most beautiful I ever saw in a window were planted in this way by keeping some in the sun and others in the shade you can have a succession of blooms they are also pretty in root glasses but this plan will exhaust the roots After blooming in the house they should be planted in the garden The same roots will not answer the next year for parlor culture they increase very fast in the garden by proper care There is something refining to the mind in the cultivation of flowers either in a garden or in pots Many hours that would be weary or lonely are thus pleasantly occupied and the mind refreshed I now take leave of the reader with a sincere desire that these remarks may be of use and that the receipts which I have been at some pains in compiling and arranging may be acceptable INDEX A Accidents poisons taken by mistake remedies for Acid to restore Colors c Acts of Kindness to Encourage Children in Adhesive
