eighteen eighty two If I do it at all I must delay no longer Incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is that huddle of diary jottings war memoranda of eighteen sixty two sixty five Nature notes of eighteen seventy seven eighty one with Western and Canadian observations afterwards all bundled up and tied by a big string the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this day this hour and what a day What an hour just passing the luxury of riant grass and blowing breeze with all the shows of sun and sky and perfect temperature never before so filling me body and soul to go home untie the bundle reel out diary scraps and memoranda just as they are large or small one after another into print pages one and let the melange s lackings and wants of connection take care of themselves It will illustrate one phase of humanity anyhow how few of life s days and hours and they not by relative value or proportion but by chance are ever noted Probably another point too how we give long preparations for some object planning and delving and fashioning and then when the actual hour for doing arrives find ourselves still quite unprepared and tumble the thing together letting hurry and crudeness tell the story better than fine work At any rate I obey my happy hour s command which seems curiously imperative May be if I don t do anything else I shall send out the most wayward spontaneous fragmentary book ever printed Note one The pages from one to fifteen are nearly verbatim an off hand letter of mine in January eighteen eighty two to an insisting friend Following I give some gloomy experiences The war of attempted secession has of course been the distinguishing event of my time I commenced at the close of eighteen sixty two and continued steadily through sixty three sixty four and sixty five to visit the sick and wounded of the army both on the field and in the hospitals in and around Washington city From the first I kept little note books for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory of names and circumstances and what was specially wanted c In these I brief d cases persons sights occurrences in camp by the bed side and not seldom by the corpses of the dead Some were scratch d down from narratives I heard and itemized while watching or waiting or tending somebody amid those scenes I have dozens of such little note books left forming a special history of those years for myself alone full of associations never to be possibly said or sung I wish I could convey to the reader the associations that attach to these soil d and creas d livraisons each composed of a sheet or two of paper folded small to carry in the pocket and fasten d with a pin I leave them just as I threw them by after the war blotch d here and there with more than one blood stain hurriedly written sometimes at the clinique not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty or defeat or of action or getting ready for it or a march Most of the pages from twenty to seventy five are verbatim copies of those lurid and blood smuch d little notebooks Very different are most of the memoranda that follow Some time after the war ended I had a paralytic stroke which prostrated me for several years In eighteen seventy six I began to get over the worst of it From this date portions of several seasons especially summers I spent at a secluded haunt down in Camden county New Jersey Timber creek quite a little river it enters from the great Delaware twelve miles away with primitive solitudes winding stream recluse and woody banks sweet feeding springs and all the charms that birds grass wild flowers rabbits and squirrels old oaks walnut trees c can bring Through these times and on these spots the diary from page seventy six onward was mostly written The COLLECT afterwards gathers up the odds and ends of whatever pieces I can now lay hands on written at various times past and swoops all together like fish in a net I suppose I publish and leave the whole gathering first from that eternal tendency to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all Nature authors included second to symbolize two or three specimen interiors personal and other out of the myriads of my time the middle range of the Nineteenth century in the New World a strange unloosen d wondrous time But the book is probably without any definite purpose that can be told in a statement ANSWER TO AN INSISTING FRIEND You ask for items details of my early life of genealogy and parentage particularly of the women of my ancestry and of its far back Netherlands stock on the maternal side of the region where I was born and raised and my mother and father before me and theirs before them with a word about Brooklyn and New York cities the times I lived there as lad and young man You say you want to get at these details mainly as the go befores and embryons of Leaves of Grass Very good you shall have at least some specimens of them all I have often thought of the meaning of such things that one can only encompass and complete matters of that kind by exploring behind perhaps very far behind themselves directly and so into their genesis antecedents and cumulative stages Then as luck would have it I lately whiled away the tedium of a week s half sickness and confinement by collating these very items for another yet unfulfilled probably abandon d purpose and if you will be satisfied with them authentic in date occurrence and fact simply and told my own way garrulous like here they are I shall not hesitate to make extracts for I catch at anything to save labor but those will be the best versions of what I want to convey GENEALOGY VAN VELSOR AND WHITMAN The later years of the last century found the Van Velsor family my mother s side living on their own farm at Cold Spring Long Island New York State near the eastern edge of Queen s county about a mile from the harbor two My father s side probably the fifth generation from the first English arrivals in New England were at the same time farmers on their own land and a fine domain it was five hundred acres all good soil gently sloping east and south about one tenth woods plenty of grand old trees two or three miles off at West Hills Suffolk county The Whitman name in the Eastern States and so branch and South starts undoubtedly from one John Whitman born sixteen oh two in Old England where he grew up married and his eldest son was born in sixteen twenty nine He came over in the True Love in sixteen forty to America and lived in Weymouth Mass which place became the mother hive of the New Englanders of the name he died in sixteen ninety two His brother reverend Zechariah Whitman also came over in the True Love either at that time or soon after and lived at Milford Conn A son of this Zechariah named Joseph migrated to Huntington Long Island and permanently settled there Savage s Genealogical Dictionary vol iv p five hundred twenty four gets the Whitman family establish d at Huntington per this Joseph before sixteen sixty four It is quite certain that from that beginning and from Joseph the West Hill Whitmans and all others in Suffolk county have since radiated myself among the number John and Zechariah both went to England and back again divers times they had large families and several of their children were born in the old country We hear of the father of John and Zechariah Abijah Whitman who goes over into the fifteen hundred s but we know little about him except that he also was for some time in America These old pedigree reminiscences come up to me vividly from a visit I made not long since in my sixty threed year to West Hills and to the burial grounds of my ancestry both sides I extract from notes of that visit written there and then Note two Long Island was settled first on the west end by the Dutch from Holland then on the east end by the English the dividing line of the two nationalities being a little west of Huntington where my father s folks lived and where I was born THE OLD WHITMAN AND VAN VELSOR CEMETERIES July twenty nine eighteen eighty one After more than forty years absence except a brief visit to take my father there once more two years before he died went down Long Island on a week s jaunt to the place where I was born thirty miles from New York city Rode around the old familiar spots viewing and pondering and dwelling long upon them every thing coming back to me Went to the old Whitman homestead on the upland and took a view eastward inclining south over the broad and beautiful farm lands of my grandfather seventeen eighty and my father There was the new house eighteen ten the big oak a hundred and fifty or two hundred years old there the well the sloping kitchen garden and a little way off even the well kept remains of the dwelling of my great grandfather seventeen fifty sixty still standing with its mighty timbers and low ceilings Near by a stately grove of tall vigorous black walnuts beautiful Apollo like the sons or grandsons no doubt of black walnuts during or before seventeen seventy six On the other side of the road spread the famous apple orchard over twenty acres the trees planted by hands long mouldering in the grave my uncle Jesse s but quite many of them evidently capable of throwing out their annual blossoms and fruit yet I now write these lines seated on an old grave doubtless of a century since at least on the burial hill of the Whitmans of many generations Fifty or more graves are quite plainly traceable and as many more decay d out of all form depress d mounds crumbled and broken stones cover d with moss the gray and sterile hill the clumps of chestnuts outside the silence just varied by the soughing wind There is always the deepest eloquence of sermon or poem in any of these ancient graveyards of which Long Island has so many so what must this one have been to me My whole family history with its succession of links from the first settlement down to date told here three centuries concentrate on this sterile acre The next day July thirty I devoted to the maternal locality and if possible was still more penetrated and impress d I write this paragraph on the burial hul of the Van Velsors near Cold Spring the most significant depository of the dead that could be imagin d without the slightest help from art but far ahead of it soil sterile a mostly bare plateau flat of half an acre the top of a hill brush and well grown trees and dense woods bordering all around very primi tive secluded no visitors no road you cannot drive here you have to bring the dead on foot and follow on foot Two or three score graves quite plain as many more almost rubb d out My grandfather Cornelius and my grandmother Amy Naomi and numerous relatives nearer or remoter on my mother s side lie buried here The scene as I stood or sat the delicate and wild odor of the woods a slightly drizzling rain the emotional atmosphere of the place and the inferr d reminiscences were fitting accompaniments THE MATERNAL HOMESTEAD I went down from this ancient grave place eighty or ninety rods to the site of the Van Velsor homestead where my mother was born seventeen ninety five and where every spot had been familiar to me as a child and youth eighteen twenty five forty Then stood there a long rambling dark gray shingle sided house with sheds pens a great barn and much open road space Now of all those not a vestige left all had been pull d down erased and the plough and harrow pass d over foundations road spaces and everything for many summers fenced in at present and grain and clover growing like any other fine fields Only a big hole from the cellar with some little heaps of broken stone green with grass and weeds identified the place Even the copious old brook and spring seem d to have mostly dwindled away The whole scene with what it arous d memories of my young days there half a century ago the vast kitchen and ample fireplace and the sitting room adjoining the plain furniture the meals the house full of merry people my grandmother Amy s sweet old face in its Quaker cap my grandfather the Major jovial red stout with sonorous voice and characteristic physiognomy with the actual sights themselves made the most pronounc d half day s experience of my whole jaunt For there with all those wooded hilly healthy surroundings my dearest mother Louisa Van Velsor grew up her mother Amy Williams of the Friends or Quakers denomination the Williams family seven sisters and one brother the father and brother sailors both of whom met their deaths at sea The Van Velsor people were noted for fine horses which the men bred and train d from blooded stock My mother as a young woman was a daily and daring rider As to the head of the family himself the old race of the Netherlands so deeply grafted on Manhattan island and in Kings and Queens counties never yielded a more mark d and full Americanized specimen than Major Cornelius Van Velsor TWO OLD FAMILY INTERIORS Of the domestic and inside life of the middle of Long Island at and just before that time here are two samples The Whitmans at the beginning of the present century lived in a long story and a half farm house hugely timber d which is still standing A great smoke canopied kitchen with vast hearth and chimney form d one end of the house The existence of slavery in New York at that time and the possession by the family of some twelve or fifteen slaves house and field servants gave things quite a patriarchial look The very young darkies could be seen a swarm of them toward sundown in this kitchen squatted in a circle on the floor eating their supper of Indian pudding and milk In the house and in food and furniture all was rude but substantial No carpets or stoves were known and no coffee and tea or sugar only for the women Rousing wood fires gave both warmth and light on winter nights Pork poultry beef and all the ordinary vegetables and grains were plentiful Cider was the men s common drink and used at meals The clothes were mainly homespun Journeys were made by both men and women on horseback Both sexes labor d with their own hands the men on the farm the women in the house and around it Books were scarce The annual copy of the almanac was a treat and was pored over through the long winter evenings I must not forget to mention that both these families were near enough to the sea to behold it from the high places and to hear in still hours the roar of the surf the latter after a storm giving a peculiar sound at night Then all hands male and female went down frequently on beach and bathing parties and the men on practical expeditions for cutting salt hay and for clamming and fishing John Burroughs s NOTES The ancestors of Walt Whitman on both the paternal and maternal sides kept a good table sustained the hospitalities decorums and an excellent social reputation in the county and they were often of mark d individuality If space permitted I should consider some of the men worthy special description and still more some of the women His great grandmother on the paternal side for instance was a large swarthy woman who lived to a very old age She smoked tobacco rode on horseback like a man managed the most vicious horse and becoming a widow in later life went forth every day over her farm lands frequently in the saddle directing the labor of her slaves in language in which on exciting occasions oaths were not spared The two immediate grandmothers were in the best sense superior women The maternal one Amy Williams before marriage was a Friend or Quakeress of sweet sensible character house wifely proclivities and deeply intuitive and spiritual The other Hannah Brush was an equally noble perhaps stronger character lived to be very old had quite a family of sons was a natural lady was in early life a school mistress and had great solidity of mind W W himself makes much of the women of his ancestry The Same Out from these arrieres of persons and scenes I was born May thirty one eighteen nineteen And now to dwell awhile on the locality itself as the successive growth stages of my infancy childhood youth and manhood were all pass d on Long Island which I sometimes feel as if I had incorporated I roam d as boy and man and have lived in nearly all parts from Brooklyn to Montauk point PAUMANOK AND MY LIFE ON IT AS CHILD AND YOUNG MAN Worth fully and particularly investigating indeed this Paumanok to give the spot its aboriginal name three stretching east through Kings Queens and Suffolk counties one hundred twenty miles altogether on the north Long Island sound a beautiful varied and picturesque series of inlets necks and sea like expansions for a hundred miles to Orient point On the ocean side the great south bay dotted with countless hummocks mostly small some quite large occasionally long bars of sand out two hundred rods to a mile and a half from the shore While now and then as at Rockaway and far east along the Hamptons the beach makes right on the island the sea dashing up without intervention Several light houses on the shores east a long history of wrecks tragedies some even of late years As a youngster I was in the atmosphere and traditions of many of these wrecks of one or two almost an observer Off Hempstead beach for example was the loss of the ship Mexico in eighteen forty alluded to in the Sleepers in L of G And at Hampton some years later the destruction of the brig Elizabeth a fearful affair in one of the worst winter gales where Margaret Fuller went down with her husband and child Inside the outer bars or beach this south bay is everywhere comparatively shallow of cold winters all thick ice on the surface As a boy I often went forth with a chum or two on those frozen fields with hand sled axe and eel spear after messes of eels We would cut holes in the ice sometimes striking quite an eel bonanza and filling our baskets with great fat sweet white meated fellows The scenes the ice drawing the hand sled cutting holes spearing the eels c were of course just such fun as is dearest to boyhood The shores of this bay winter and summer and my doings there in early life are woven all through L of G One sport I was very fond of was to go on a bay party in summer to gather sea gull s eggs The gulls lay two or three eggs more than half the size of hen s eggs right on the sand and leave the sun s heat to hatch them The eastern end of Long Island the Peconic bay region I knew quite well too sail d more than once around Shelter island and down to Montauk spent many an hour on Turtle hill by the old light house on the extreme point looking out over the ceaseless roll of the Atlantic I used to like to go down there and fraternize with the blue fishers or the annual squads of sea bass takers Sometimes along Montauk peninsula it is some fifteen miles long and good grazing met the strange unkempt half barbarous herdsmen at that time living there entirely aloof from society or civilization in charge on those rich pasturages of vast droves of horses kine or sheep own d by farmers of the eastern towns Sometimes too the few remaining Indians or half breeds at that period left on Montauk peninsula but now I believe altogether extinct More in the middle of the island were the spreading Hempstead plains then eighteen thirty forty quite prairie like open uninhabited rather sterile cover d with kill calf and huckleberry bushes yet plenty of fair pasture for the cattle mostly milch cows who fed there by hundreds even thousands and at evening the plains too were own d by the towns and this was the use of them in common might be seen taking their way home branching off regularly in the right places I have often been out on the edges of these plains toward sundown and can yet recall in fancy the interminable cow processions and hear the music of the tin or copper bells clanking far or near and breathe the cool of the sweet and slightly aromatic evening air and note the sunset Through the same region of the island but further east extended wide central tracts of pine and scrub oak charcoal was largely made here monotonous and sterile But many a good day or half day did I have wandering through those solitary crossroads inhaling the peculiar and wild aroma Here and all along the island and its shores I spent intervals many years all seasons sometimes riding sometimes boating but generally afoot I was always then a good walker absorbing fields shores marine incidents characters the bay men farmers pilots always had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter and with fishermen went every summer on sailing trips always liked the bare sea beach south side and have some of my happiest hours on it to this day As I write the whole experience comes back to me after the lapse of forty and more years the soothing rustle of the waves and the saline smell boyhood s times the clam digging bare foot and with trowsers roll d up hauling down the creek the perfume of the sedge meadows the hay boat and the chowder and fishing excursions or of later years little voyages down and out New York bay in the pilot boats Those same later years also while living in Brooklyn eighteen thirty six fifty I went regularly every week in the mild seasons down to Coney Island at that time a long bare unfrequented shore which I had all to myself and where I loved after bathing to race up and down the hard sand and declaim Homer or Shakspere to the surf and sea gulls by the hour But I am getting ahead too rapidly and must keep more in my traces Note three Paumanok or Paumanake or Paumanack the Indian name of Long Island over a hundred miles long shaped like a fish plenty of sea shore sandy stormy uninviting the horizon boundless the air too strong for invalids the bays a wonderful resort for aquatic birds the south side meadows cover d with salt hay the soil of the island generally tough but good for the locust tree the apple orchard and the blackberry and with numberless springs of the sweetest water in the world Years ago among the bay men a strong wild race now extinct or rather entirely changed a native of Long Island was called a Paumanacker or Creole Paumanacker John Burroughs MY FIRST READING LAFAYETTE From eighteen twenty four to twenty eight our family lived in Brooklyn in Front Cranberry and Johnson streets In the latter my father built a nice house for a home and afterwards another in Tillary street We occupied them one after the other but they were mortgaged and we lost them I yet remember Lafayette s visit four Most of these years I went to the public schools It must have been about eighteen twenty nine or thirty that I went with my father and mother to hear Elias Hicks preach in a ball room on Brooklyn heights At about the same time employ d as a boy in an office lawyers father and two sons Clarke s Fulton street near Orange I had a nice desk and window nook to myself Edward C kindly help d me at my handwriting and composition and the signal event of my life up to that time subscribed for me to a big circulating library For a time I now revel d in romance reading of all kinds first the Arabian Nights all the volumes an amazing treat Then with sorties in very many other directions took in Walter Scott s novels one after another and his poetry and continue to enjoy novels and poetry to this day Note four On the visit of General Lafayette to this country in eighteen twenty four he came over to Brooklyn in state and rode through the city The children of the schools turn d out to join in the welcome An edifice for a free public library for youths was just then commencing and Lafayette consented to stop on his way and lay the corner stone Numerous children arriving on the ground where a huge irregular excavation for the building was already dug surrounded with heaps of rough stone several gentlemen assisted in lifting the children to safe or convenient spots to see the ceremony Among the rest Lafayette also helping the children took up the five year old Walt Whitman and pressing the child a moment to his breast and giving him a kiss handed him down to a safe spot in the excavation John Burroughs PRINTING OFFICE OLD BROOKLYN After about two years went to work in a weekly newspaper and printing office to learn the trade The paper was the Long Island Patriot owned by S E Clements who was also postmaster An old printer in the office William Hartshorne a revolutionary character who had seen Washington was a special friend of mine and I had many a talk with him about long past times The apprentices including myself boarded with his grand daughter I used occasionally to go out riding with the boss who was very kind to us boys Sundays he took us all to a great old rough fortress looking stone church on Joralemon street near where the Brooklyn city hall now is at that time broad fields and country roads everywhere around five Afterward I work d on the Long Island Star Alden Spooner s paper My father all these years pursuing his trade as carpenter and builder with varying fortune There was a growing family of children eight of us my brother Jesse the oldest myself the second my dear sisters Mary and Hannah Louisa my brothers Andrew George Thomas Jefferson and then my youngest brother Edward born eighteen thirty five and always badly crippled as I am myself of late years Note five Of the Brooklyn of that time eighteen thirty forty hardly anything remains except the lines of the old streets The population was then between ten and twelve thousand For a mile Fulton street was lined with magnificent elm trees The character of the place was thoroughly rural As a sample of comparative values it may be mention d that twenty five acres in what is now the most costly part of the city bounded by Flatbush and Fulton avenues were then bought by mister Parmentier a French emigre for four thousand dollars Who remembers the old places as they were Who remembers the old citizens of that time Among the former were Smith Wood s Coe Downing s and other public houses at the ferry the old Ferry itself Love lane the Heights as then the Wallabout with the wooden bridge and the road out beyond Fulton street to the old toll gate Among the latter were the majestic and genial General Jeremiah Johnson with others Gabriel Furman reverend E M Johnson Alden Spooner mister Pierrepont mister Joralemon Samuel Willoughby Jonathan Trotter George Hall Cyrus P Smith N B Morse John Dikeman Adrian Hegeman William Udall and old mister Duflon with his military garden GROWTH HEALTH WORK I develop d eighteen thirty three four five into a healthy strong youth grew too fast though was nearly as big as a man at fifteen or sixteen Our family at this period moved back to the country my dear mother very ill for a long time but recover d All these years I was down Long Island more or less every summer now east now west sometimes months at a stretch At sixteen seventeen and so on was fond of debating societies and had an active membership with them off and on in Brooklyn and one or two country towns on the island A most omnivorous novel reader these and later years devour d everything I could get Fond of the theatre also in New York went whenever I could sometimes witnessing fine performances eighteen thirty six seven work d as compositor in printing offices in New York city Then when little more than eighteen and for a while afterwards went to teaching country schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties Long Island and boarded round This latter I consider one of my best experiences and deepest lessons in human nature behind the scenes and in the masses In thirty nine forty I started and publish d a weekly paper in my native town Huntington Then returning to New York city and Brooklyn work d on as printer and writer mostly prose but an occasional shy at poetry MY PASSION FOR FERRIES Living in Brooklyn or New York city from this time forward my life then and still more the following years was curiously identified with Fulton ferry already becoming the greatest of its sort in the world for general importance volume variety rapidity and picturesqueness Almost daily later fifty to sixty I cross d on the boats often up in the pilot houses where I could get a full sweep absorbing shows accompaniments surroundings What oceanic currents eddies underneath the great tides of humanity also with ever shifting movements Indeed I have always had a passion for ferries to me they afford inimitable streaming never failing living poems The river and bay scenery all about New York island any time of a fine day the hurrying splashing sea tides the changing panorama of steamers all sizes often a string of big ones outward bound to distant ports the myriads of white sail d schooners sloops skiffs and the marvellously beautiful yachts the majestic sound boats as they rounded the Battery and came along towards five afternoon eastward bound the prospect off towards Staten Island or down the Narrows or the other way up the Hudson what refreshment of spirit such sights and experiences gave me years ago and many a time since My old pilot friends the Balsirs Johnny Cole Ira Smith William White and my young ferry friend Tom Gere how well I remember them all BROADWAY SIGHTS Besides Fulton ferry off and on for years I knew and frequented Broadway that noted avenue of New York s crowded and mixed humanity and of so many notables Here I saw during those times Andrew Jackson Webster Clay Seward Martin Van Buren filibuster Walker Kossuth Fitz Greene Halleck Bryant the Prince of Wales Charles Dickens the first Japanese ambassadors and lots of other celebrities of the time Always something novel or inspiriting yet mostly to me the hurrying and vast amplitude of those never ending human currents I remember seeing James Fenimore Cooper in a court room in Chambers street back of the city hall where he was carrying on a law case I think it was a charge of libel he had brought against some one I also remember seeing Edgar A Poe and having a short interview with him it must have been in eighteen forty five or six in his office second story of a corner building Duane or Pearl street He was editor and owner or part owner of the Broadway Journal The visit was about a piece of mine he had publish d Poe was very cordial in a quiet way appear d well in person dress c I have a distinct and pleasing remembrance of his looks voice manner and matter very kindly and human but subdued perhaps a little jaded For another of my reminiscences here on the west side just below Houston street I once saw it must have been about eighteen thirty two of a sharp bright January day a bent feeble but stout built very old man bearded swathed in rich furs with a great ermine cap on his head led and assisted almost carried down the steps of his high front stoop a dozen friends and servants emulous carefully holding guiding him and then lifted and tuck d in a gorgeous sleigh envelop d in other furs for a ride The sleigh was drawn by as fine a team of horses as I ever saw You needn t think all the best animals are brought up nowadays never was such horseflesh as fifty years ago on Long Island or south or in New York city folks look d for spirit and mettle in a nag not tame speed merely Well I a boy of perhaps thirteen or fourteen stopp d and gazed long at the spectacle of that fur swathed old man surrounded by friends and servants and the careful seating of him in the sleigh I remember the spirited champing horses the driver with his whip and a fellow driver by his side for extra prudence The old man the subject of so much attention I can almost see now It was John Jacob Astor The years eighteen forty six forty seven and there along see me still in New York City working as writer and printer having my usual good health and a good time generally OMNIBUS JAUNTS AND DRIVERS One phase of those days must by no means go unrecorded namely the Broadway omnibuses with their drivers The vehicles still I write this paragraph in eighteen eighty one give a portion of the character of Broadway the Fifth avenue Madison avenue and Twenty third street lines yet running But the flush days of the old Broadway stages characteristic and copious are over The Yellow birds the Red birds the original Broadway the Fourth avenue the Knickerbocker and a dozen others of twenty or thirty years ago are all gone And the men specially identified with them and giving vitality and meaning to them the drivers a strange natural quick eyed and wondrous race not only Rabelais and Cervantes would have gloated upon them but Homer and Shakspere would how well I remember them and must here give a word about them How many hours forenoons and afternoons how many exhilarating night times I have had perhaps June or July in cooler air riding the whole length of Broadway listening to some yarn and the most vivid yarns ever spun and the rarest mimicry or perhaps I declaiming some stormy passage from Julius Caesar or Richard you could roar as loudly as you chose in that heavy dense uninterrupted street bass Yes I knew all the drivers then Broadway Jack Dressmaker Balky Bill George Storms Old Elephant his brother Young Elephant who came afterward Tippy Pop Rice Big Frank Yellow Joe Pete Callahan Patsey Dee and dozens more for there were hundreds They had immense qualities largely animal eating drinking women great personal pride in their way perhaps a few slouches here and there but I should have trusted the general run of them in their simple good will and honor under all circumstances Not only for comradeship and sometimes affection great studies I found them also I suppose the critics will laugh heartily but the influence of those Broadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades undoubtedly enter d into the gestation of Leaves of Grass PLAYS AND OPERAS TOO And certain actors and singers had a good deal to do with the business All through these years off and on I frequented the old Park the Bowery Broadway and Chatham square theatres and the Italian operas at Chambers street Astor place or the Battery many seasons was on the free list writing for papers even as quite a youth The old Park theatre what names reminiscences the words bring back Placide Clarke missus Vernon Fisher Clara F missus Wood missus Seguin Ellen Tree Hackett the younger Kean Macready missus Richardson Rice singers tragedians comedians What perfect acting Henry Placide in Napoleon s Old Guard or Grandfather Whitehead or the Provoked Husband of Gibber with Fanny Kemble as Lady Townley or Sheridan Knowles in his own Virginius or inimitable Power in Born to Good Luck These and many more the years of youth and onward Fanny Kemble name to conjure up great mimic scenes withal perhaps the greatest I remember well her rendering of Bianca in Fazio and Marianna in the Wife Nothing finer did ever stage exhibit the veterans of all nations said so and my boyish heart and head felt it in every minute cell The lady was just matured strong better than merely beautiful born from the footlights had had three years practice in London and through the British towns and then she came to give America that young maturity and roseate power in all their noon or rather forenoon flush It was my good luck to see her nearly every night she play d at the old Park certainly in all her principal characters I heard these years well render d all the Italian and other operas in vogue Sonnambula the Puritans Der Freischutz Huguenots Fille d Regiment Faust Etoile du Nord Poliuto and others Verdi s Ernani Rigoletto and Trovatore with Donnizetti s Lucia or Favorita or Lucrezia and Auber s Massaniello or Rossini s William Tell and Gazza Ladra were among my special enjoyments I heard Alboni every time she sang in New York and vicinity also Grisi the tenor Mario and the baritone Badiali the finest in the world This musical passion follow d my theatrical one As a boy or young man I had seen reading them carefully the day beforehand quite all Shakspere s acting dramas play d wonderfully well Even yet I cannot conceive anything finer than old Booth in Richard Third or Lear I don t know which was best or Iago or Pescara or Sir Giles Overreach to go outside of Shakspere or Tom Hamblin in Macbeth or old Clarke either as the ghost in Hamlet or as Prospero in the Tempest with missus Austin as Ariel and Peter Richings as Caliban Then other dramas and fine players in them Forrest as Metamora or Damon or Brutus John R Scott as Tom Cringle or Rolla or Charlotte Cushman s Lady Gay Spanker in London Assurance Then of some years later at Castle Garden Battery I yet recall the splendid seasons of the Havana musical troupe under Maretzek the fine band the cool sea breezes the unsurpass d vocalism Steffan one Bosio Truffi Marini in Marino Faliero Don Pasquale or Favorita No better playing or singing ever in New York It was here too I afterward heard Jenny Lind The Battery its past associations what tales those old trees and walks and sea walls could tell THROUGH EIGHT YEARS In eighteen forty eight forty nine I was occupied as editor of the daily Eagle newspaper in Brooklyn The latter year went off on a leisurely journey and working expedition my brother Jeff with me through all the middle States and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers Lived awhile in New Orleans and work d there on the editorial staff of daily Crescent newspaper After a time plodded back northward up the Mississippi and around to and by way of the great lakes Michigan Huron and Erie to Niagara falls and lower Canada finally returning through central New York and down the Hudson traveling altogether probably eight thousand miles this trip to and fro fifty one fifty three occupied in house building in Brooklyn For a little of the first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper the Freeman fifty five lost my dear father this year by death Commenced putting Leaves of Grass to press for good at the job printing office of my friends the brothers Rome in Brooklyn after many MS doings and undoings I had great trouble in leaving out the stock poetical touches but succeeded at last I am now eighteen fifty six seven passing through my thirty seventh year SOURCES OF CHARACTER RESULTS eighteen sixty To sum up the foregoing from the outset and of course far far more unrecorded I estimate three leading sources and formative stamps to my own character now solidified for good or bad and its subsequent literary and other outgrowth the maternal nativity stock brought hither from far away Netherlands for one doubtless the best the subterranean tenacity and central bony structure obstinacy wilfulness which I get from my paternal English elements for another and the combination of my Long Island birth spot sea shores childhood s scenes absorptions with teeming Brooklyn and New York with I suppose my experiences afterward in the secession outbreak for the third For in eighteen sixty two startled by news that my brother George an officer in the fifty first New York volunteers had been seriously wounded first Fredericksburg battle December thirteenth I hurriedly went down to the field of war in Virginia But I must go back a little OPENING OF THE SECESSION WAR News of the attack on fort Sumter and the flag at Charleston harbor S C was receiv d in New York city late at night thirteenth April eighteen sixty one and was immediately sent out in extras of the newspapers I had been to the opera in Fourteenth street that night and after the performance was walking down Broadway toward twelve o clock on my way to Brooklyn when I heard in the distance the loud cries of the newsboys who came presently tearing and yelling up the street rushing from side to side even more furiously than usual I bought an extra and cross d to the Metropolitan hotel Niblo s where the great lamps were still brightly blazing and with a crowd of others who gather d impromptu read the news which was evidently authentic For the benefit of some who had no papers one of us read the telegram aloud while all listen d silently and attentively No remark was made by any of the crowd which had increas d to thirty or forty but all stood a minute or two I remember before they dispers d I can almost see them there now under the lamps at midnight again NATIONAL UPRISING AND VOLUNTEERING I have said somewhere that the three Presidentiads preceding eighteen sixty one show d how the weakness and wickedness of rulers are just as eligible here in America under republican as in Europe under dynastic influences But what can I say of that prompt and splendid wrestling with secession slavery the arch enemy personified the instant he unmistakably show d his face The volcanic upheaval of the nation after that firing on the flag at Charleston proved for certain something which had been previously in great doubt and at once substantially settled the question of disunion In my judgment it will remain as the grandest and most encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any age old or new to political progress and democracy It was not for what came to the surface merely though that was important but what it indicated below which was of eternal importance Down in the abysms of New World humanity there had form d and harden d a primal hardpan of national Union will determin d and in the majority refusing to be tamper d with or argued against confronting all emergencies and capable at any time of bursting all surface bonds and breaking out like an earthquake It is indeed the best lesson of the century or of America and it is a mighty privilege to have been part of it Two great spectacles immortal proofs of democracy unequall d in all the history of the past are furnish d by the secession war one at the beginning the other at its close Those are the general voluntary arm d upheaval and the peaceful and harmonious disbanding of the armies in the summer of eighteen sixty five CONTEMPTUOUS FEELING Even after the bombardment of Sumter however the gravity of the revolt and the power and will of the slave States for a strong and continued military resistance to national authority were not at all realized at the North except by a few Nine tenths of the people of the free States look d upon the rebellion as started in South Carolina from a feeling one half of contempt and the other half composed of anger and incredulity It was not thought it would be join d in by Virginia North Carolina or Georgia A great and cautious national official predicted that it would blow over in sixty days and folks generally believ d the prediction I remember talking about it on a Fulton ferry boat with the Brooklyn mayor who said he only hoped the Southern fire eaters would commit some overt act of resistance as they would then be at once so effectually squelch d we would never hear of secession again but he was afraid they never would have the pluck to really do anything I remember too that a couple of companies of the Thirteenth Brooklyn who rendezvou d at the city armory and started thence as thirty days men were all provided with pieces of rope conspicuously tied to their musket barrels with which to bring back each man a prisoner from the audacious South to be led in a noose on our men s early and triumphant return BATTLE OF BULL RUN JULY eighteen sixty one All this sort of feeling was destin d to be arrested and revers d by a terrible shock the battle of first Bull Run certainly as we now know it one of the most singular fights on record All battles and their results are far more matters of accident than is generally thought but this was throughout a casualty a chance Each side supposed it had won till the last moment One had in point of fact just the same right to be routed as the other By a fiction or series of fictions the national forces at the last moment exploded in a panic and fled from the field The defeated troops commenced pouring into Washington over the Long Bridge at daylight on Monday twenty twod day drizzling all through with rain The Saturday and Sunday of the battle twentieth twenty first had been parch d and hot to an extreme the dust the grime and smoke in layers sweated in follow d by other layers again sweated in absorb d by those excited souls their clothes all saturated with the clay powder filling the air stirr d up everywhere on the dry roads and trodden fields by the regiments swarming wagons artillery c all the men with this coating of murk and sweat and rain now recoiling back pouring over the Long Bridge a horrible march of twenty miles returning to Washington baffed humiliated panic struck Where are the vaunts and the proud boasts with which you went forth Where are your banners and your bands of music and your ropes to bring back your prisoners Well there isn t a band playing and there isn t a flag but clings ashamed and lank to its staff The sun rises but shines not The men appear at first sparsely and shame faced enough then thicker in the streets of Washington appear in Pennsylvania avenue and on the steps and basement entrances They come along in disorderly mobs some in squads stragglers companies Occasionally a rare regiment in perfect order with its officers some gaps dead the true braves marching in silence with lowering faces stern weary to sinking all black and dirty but every man with his musket and stepping alive but these are the exceptions Sidewalks of Pennsylvania avenue Fourteenth street c crowded jamm d with citizens darkies clerks everybody lookers on women in the windows curious expressions from faces as those swarms of dirt cover d return d soldiers there will they never end move by but nothing said no comments half our lookers on secesh of the most venomous kind they say nothing but the devil snickers in their faces During the forenoon Washington gets all over motley with these defeated soldiers queer looking objects strange eyes and faces drench d the steady rain drizzles on all day and fearfully worn hungry haggard blister d in the feet Good people but not over many of them either hurry up something for their grub They put wash kettles on the fire for soup for coffee They set tables on the side walks wagon loads of bread are purchas d swiftly cut in stout chunks Here are two aged ladies beautiful the first in the city for culture and charm they stand with store of eating and drink at an improvis d table of rough plank and give food and have the store replenished from their house every half hour all that day and there in the rain they stand active silent white hair d and give food though the tears stream down their cheeks almost without intermission the whole time Amid the deep excitement crowds and motion and desperate eagerness it seems strange to see many very many of the soldiers sleeping in the midst of all sleeping sound They drop down anywhere on the steps of houses up close by the basements or fences on the sidewalk aside on some vacant lot and deeply sleep A poor seventeen or eighteen year old boy lies there on the stoop of a grand house he sleeps so calmly so profoundly Some clutch their muskets firmly even in sleep Some in squads comrades brothers close together and on them as they lay sulkily drips the rain As afternoon pass d and evening came the streets the bar rooms knots everywhere listeners questioners terrible yarns bugaboo mask d batteries our regiment all cut up c stories and story tellers windy bragging vain centres of street crowds Resolution manliness seem to have abandon d Washington The principal hotel Willard s is full of shoulder straps thick crush d creeping with shoulder straps I see them and must have a word with them There you are shoulder straps but where are your companies where are your men Incompetents never tell me of chances of battle of getting stray d and the like I think this is your work this retreat after all Sneak blow put on airs there in Willard s sumptuous parlors and bar rooms or anywhere no explanation shall save you Bull Run is your work had you been half or one tenth worthy your men this would never have happen d Meantime in Washington among the great persons and their entourage a mixture of awful consternation uncertainty rage shame helplessness and stupefying disappointment The worst is not only imminent but already here In a few hours perhaps before the next meal the secesh generals with their victorious hordes will be upon us The dream of humanity the vaunted Union we thought so strong so impregnable lo it seems already smash d like a china plate One bitter bitter hour perhaps proud America will never again know such an hour She must pack and fly no time to spare Those white palaces the dome crown d capitol there on the hill so stately over the trees shall they be left or destroy d first For it is certain that the talk among certain of the magnates and officers and clerks and officials everywhere for twenty four hours in and around Washington after Bull Run was loud and undisguised for yielding out and out and substituting the southern rule and Lincoln promptly abdicating and departing If the secesh officers and forces had immediately follow d and by a bold Napoleonic movement had enter d Washington the first day or even the second they could have had things their own way and a powerful faction north to back them One of our returning colonels express d in public that night amid a swarm of officers and gentlemen in a crowded room the opinion that it was useless to fight that the southerners had made their title clear and that the best course for the national government to pursue was to desist from any further attempt at stopping them and admit them again to the lead on the best terms they were willing to grant Not a voice was rais d against this judgment amid that large crowd of officers and gentlemen The fact is the hour was one of the three or four of those crises we had then and afterward during the fluctuations of four years when human eyes appear d at least just as likely to see the last breath of the Union as to see it continue THE STUPOR PASSES SOMETHING ELSE BEGINS But the hour the day the night pass d and whatever returns an hour a day a night like that can never again return The President recovering himself begins that very night sternly rapidly sets about the task of reorganizing his forces and placing himself in positions for future and surer work If there were nothing else of Abraham Lincoln for history to stamp him with it is enough to send him with his wreath to the memory of all future time that he endured that hour that day bitterer than gall indeed a crucifixion day that it did not conquer him that he unflinchingly stemm d it and resolv d to lift himself and the Union out of it Then the great New York papers at once appear d commencing that evening and following it up the next morning and incessantly through many days afterwards with leaders that rang out over the land with the loudest most reverberating ring of clearest bugles full of encouragement hope inspiration unfaltering defiance Those magnificent editorials they never flagg d for a fortnight The Herald commenced them I remember the articles well The Tribune was equally cogent and inspiriting and the Times Evening Post and other principal papers were not a whit behind They came in good time for they were needed For in the humiliation of Bull Run the popular feeling north from its extreme of superciliousness recoil d to the depth of gloom and apprehension Of all the days of the war there are two especially I can never forget Those were the day following the news in New York and Brooklyn of that first Bull Run defeat and the day of Abraham Lincoln s death I was home in Brooklyn on both occasions The day of the murder we heard the news very early in the morning Mother prepared breakfast and other meals afterward as usual but not a mouthful was eaten all day by either of us We each drank half a cup of coffee that was all Little was said We got every newspaper morning and evening and the frequent extras of that period and pass d them silently to each other DOWN AT THE FRONT FALMOUTH VA opposite Fredericksburgh December twenty one eighteen sixty two Begin my visits among the camp hospitals in the army of the Potomac Spend a good part of the day in a large brick mansion on the banks of the Rappahannock used as a hospital since the battle seems to have receiv d only the worst cases Out doors at the foot of a tree within ten yards of the front of the house I notice a heap of amputated feet legs arms hands c a full load for a one horse cart Several dead bodies lie near each cover d with its brown woolen blanket In the door yard towards the river are fresh graves mostly of officers their names on pieces of arrel staves or broken boards stuck in the dirt Most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported north to their friends The large mansion is quite crowded upstairs and down everything impromptu no system all bad enough but I have no doubt the best that can be done all the wounds pretty bad some frightful the men in their old clothes unclean and bloody Some of the wounded are rebel soldiers and officers prisoners One a Mississippian a captain hit badly in leg I talk d with some time he ask d me for papers which I gave him I saw him three months afterward in Washington with his leg amputated doing well I went through the rooms downstairs and up Some of the men were dying I had nothing to give at that visit but wrote a few letters to folks home mothers c Also talk d to three or four who seem d most susceptible to it and needing it AFTER FIRST FREDERICKSBURG December twenty three to thirty one The results of the late battle are exhibited everywhere about here in thousands of cases hundreds die every day in the camp brigade and division hospitals These are merely tents and sometimes very poor ones the wounded lying on the ground lucky if their blankets are spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs or small leaves No cots seldom even a mattress It is pretty cold The ground is frozen hard and there is occasional snow I go around from one case to another I do not see that I do much good to these wounded and dying but I cannot leave them Once in a while some youngster holds on to me convulsively and I do what I can for him at any rate stop with him and sit near him for hours if he wishes it Besides the hospitals I also go occasionally on long tours through the camps talking with the men c Sometimes at night among the groups around the fires in their shebang enclosures of bushes These are curious shows full of characters and groups I soon get acquainted anywhere in camp with officers or men and am always well used Sometimes I go down on picket with the regiments I know best As to rations the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied and the men have enough such as it is mainly salt pork and hard tack Most of the regiments lodge in the flimsy little shelter tents A few have built themselves huts of logs and mud with fire places BACK TO WASHINGTON January sixty three Left camp at Falmouth with some wounded a few days since and came here by Aquia creek railroad and so on government steamer up the Potomac Many wounded were with us on the cars and boat The cars were just common platform ones The railroad journey of ten or twelve miles was made mostly before sunrise The soldiers guarding the road came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair and half awake look Those on duty were walking their posts some on banks over us others down far below the level of the track I saw large cavalry camps off the road At Aquia creek landing were numbers of wounded going north While I waited some three hours I went around among them Several wanted word sent home to parents brothers wives c which I did for them by mail the next day from Washington On the boat I had my hands full One poor fellow died going up I am now remaining in and around Washington daily visiting the hospitals Am much in Patent office Eighth street H street Armory square and others Am now able to do a little good having money as almoner of others home and getting experience To day Sunday afternoon and till nine in the evening visited Campbell hospital attended specially to one case in ward I very sick with pleurisy and typhoid fever young man farmer s son D F Russell company E sixtieth New York downhearted and feeble a long time before he would take any interest wrote a letter home to his mother in Malone Franklin county N Y at his request gave him some fruit and one or two other gifts envelop d and directed his letter c Then went thoroughly through ward six observ d every case in the ward without I think missing one gave perhaps from twenty to thirty persons each one some little gift such as oranges apples sweet crackers figs c Thursday Jan twenty one Devoted the main part of the day to Armory square hospital went pretty thoroughly through wards F G H and I some fifty cases in each ward In ward F supplied the men throughout with writing paper and stamp d envelope each distributed in small portions to proper subjects a large jar of first rate preserv d berries which had been donated to me by a lady her own cooking Found several cases I thought good subjects for small sums of money which I furnish d The wounded men often come up broke and it helps their spirits to have even the small sum I give them My paper and envelopes all gone but distributed a good lot of amusing reading matter also as I thought judicious tobacco oranges apples c Interesting cases in ward I Charles Miller bed nineteen company D fifty threed Pennsylvania is only sixteen years of age very bright courageous boy left leg amputated below the knee next bed to him another young lad very sick gave each appropriate gifts In the bed above also amputation of the left leg gave him a little jar of raspberries bed J this ward gave a small sum also to a soldier on crutches sitting on his bed near I am more and more surprised at the very great proportion of youngsters from fifteen to twenty one in the army I afterwards found a still greater proportion among the southerners Evening same day went to see D F R before alluded to found him remarkably changed for the better up and dress d quite a triumph he afterwards got well and went back to his regiment Distributed in the wards a quantity of note paper and forty or fifty stamp d envelopes of which I had recruited my stock and the men were much in need FIFTY HOURS LEFT WOUNDED ON THE FIELD Here is a case of a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the Patent office He likes to have some one to talk to and we will listen to him He got badly hit in his leg and side at Fredericksburgh that eventful Saturday thirteenth of December He lay the succeeding two days and nights helpless on the field between the city and those grim terraces of batteries his company and regiment had been compell d to leave him to his fate To make matters worse it happen d he lay with his head slightly down hill and could not help himself At the end of some fifty hours he was brought off with other wounded under a flag of truce I ask him how the rebels treated him as he lay during those two days and nights within reach of them whether they came to him whether they abused him He answers that several of the rebels soldiers and others came to him at one time and another A couple of them who were together spoke roughly and sarcastically but nothing worse One middle aged man however who seem d to be moving around the field among the dead and wounded for benevolent purposes came to him in a way he will never forget treated our soldier kindly bound up his wounds cheer d him gave him a couple of biscuits and a drink of whiskey and water asked him if he could eat some beef This good secesh however did not change our soldier s position for it might have caused the blood to burst from the wounds clotted and stagnated Our soldier is from Pennsylvania has had a pretty severe time the wounds proved to be bad ones But he retains a good heart and is at present on the gain It is not uncommon for the men to remain on the field this way one two or even four or five days HOSPITAL SCENES AND PERSONS Letter Writing When eligible I encourage the men to write and myself when called upon write all sorts of letters for them including love letters very tender ones Almost as I reel off these memoranda I write for a new patient to his wife M de F of the seventeenth Connecticut company H has just come up February seventeenth from Windmill point and is received in ward H Armory square He is an intelligent looking man has a foreign accent black eyed and hair d a Hebraic appearance Wants a telegraphic message sent to his wife New Canaan Conn I agree to send the message but to make things sure I also sit down and write the wife a letter and despatch it to the post office immediately as he fears she will come on and he does not wish her to as he will surely get well Saturday January thirtieth Afternoon visited Campbell hospital Scene of cleaning up the ward and giving the men all clean clothes through the ward six the patients dressing or being dress d the naked upper half of the bodies the good humor and fun the shirts drawers sheets of beds c and the general fixing up for Sunday Gave J L fifty cents Wednesday February fourth Visited Armory square hospital went pretty thoroughly through wards E and D Supplied paper and envelopes to all who wish d as usual found plenty of men who needed those articles Wrote letters Saw and talk d with two or three members of the Brooklyn fourteenth regt A poor fellow in ward D with a fearful wound in a fearful condition was having some loose splinters of bone taken from the neighborhood of the wound The operation was long and one of great pain yet after it was well commenced the soldier bore it in silence He sat up propp d was much wasted had lain a long time quiet in one position not for days only but weeks a bloodless brown skinn d face with eyes full of determination belong d to a New York regiment There was an unusual cluster of surgeons medical cadets nurses c around his bed I thought the whole thing was done with tenderness and done well In one case the wife sat by the side of her husband his sickness typhoid fever pretty bad In another by the side of her son a mother she told me she had seven children and this was the youngest A fine kind healthy gentle mother good looking not very old with a cap on her head and dress d like home what a charm it gave to the whole ward I liked the woman nurse in ward E I noticed how she sat a long time by a poor fellow who just had that morning in addition to his other sickness bad hemorrhage she gently assisted him reliev d him of the blood holding a cloth to his mouth as he coughed it up he was so weak he could only just turn his head over on the pillow One young New York man with a bright handsome face had been lying several months from a most disagreeable wound receiv d at Bull Run A bullet had shot him right through the bladder hitting him front low in the belly and coming out back He had suffer d much the water came out of the wound by slow but steady quantities for many weeks so that he lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle and there were other disagreeable circumstances He was of good heart however At present comparatively comfortable had a bad throat was delighted with a stick of horehound candy I gave him with one or two other trifles PATENT OFFICE HOSPITAL February twenty three I must not let the great hospital at the Patent office pass away without some mention A few weeks ago the vast area of the second story of that noblest of Washington buildings was crowded close with rows of sick badly wounded and dying soldiers They were placed in three very large apartments I went there many times It was a strange solemn and with all its features of suffering and death a sort of fascinating sight I go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve particular cases Two of the immense apartments are fill d with high and ponderous glass cases crowded with models in miniature of every kind of utensil machine or invention it ever enter d into the mind of man to conceive and with curiosities and foreign presents Between these cases are lateral openings perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep and in these were placed the sick besides a great long double row of them up and down through the middle of the hall Many of them were very bad cases wounds and amputations Then there was a gallery running above the hall in which there were beds also It was indeed a curious scene especially at night when lit up The glass cases the beds the forms lying there the gallery above and the marble pavement under foot the suffering and the fortitude to bear it in various degrees occasionally from some the groan that could not be repress d sometimes a poor fellow dying with emaciated face and glassy eye the nurse by his side the doctor also there but no friend no relative such were the sights but lately in the Patent office The wounded have since been removed from there and it is now vacant again THE WHITE HOUSE BY MOONLIGHT February twenty fourth A spell of fine soft weather I wander about a good deal sometimes at night under the moon Tonight took a long look at the President s house The white portico the palace like tall round columns spotless as snow the walls also the tender and soft moonlight flooding the pale marble and making peculiar faint languishing shades not shadows everywhere a soft transparent hazy thin blue moon lace hanging in the air the brilliant and extra plentiful clusters of gas on and around the facade columns portico c everything so white so marbly pure and dazzling yet soft the White House of future poems and of dreams and dramas there in the soft and copious moon the gorgeous front in the trees under the lustrous flooding moon full of realty full of illusion the forms of the trees leafless silent in trunk and myriad angles of branches under the stars and sky the White House of the land and of beauty and night sentries at the gates and by the portico silent pacing there in blue overcoats stopping you not at all but eyeing you with sharp eyes whichever way you move AN ARMY HOSPITAL WARD Let me specialize a visit I made to the collection of barrack like one story edifices Campbell hospital out on the flats at the end of the then horse railway route on Seventh street There is a long building appropriated to each ward Let us go into ward six It contains to day I should judge eighty or a hundred patients half sick half wounded The edifice is nothing but boards well whitewash d inside and the usual slender framed iron bedsteads narrow and plain You walk down the central passage with a row on either side their feet towards you and their heads to the wall There are fires in large stoves and the prevailing white of the walls is reliev d by some ornaments stars circles c made of evergreens The view of the whole edifice and occupants can be taken at once for there is no partition You may hear groans or other sounds of unendurable suffering from two or three of the cots but in the main there is quiet almost a painful absence of demonstration but the pallid face the dull d eye and the moisture of the lip are demonstration enough Most of these sick or hurt are evidently young fellows from the country farmers sons and such like Look at the fine large frames the bright and broad countenances and the many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique Look at the patient and mute manner of our American wounded as they lie in such a sad collection representatives from all New England and from New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania indeed from all the States and all the cities largely from the west Most of them are entirely without friends or acquaintances here no familiar face and hardly a word of judicious sympathy or cheer through their sometimes long and tedious sickness or the pangs of aggravated wounds A CONNECTICUT CASE This young man in bed twenty five is H D B of the twenty seventh Connecticut company B His folks live at Northford near New Haven Though not more than twenty one or thereabouts he has knock d much around the world on sea and land and has seen some fighting on both When I first saw him he was very sick with no appetite He declined offers of money said he did not need anything As I was quite anxious to do something he confess d that he had a hankering for a good home made rice pudding thought he could relish it better than anything At this time his stomach was very weak The doctor whom I consulted said nourishment would do him more good than anything but things in the hospital though better than usual revolted him I soon procured B his rice pudding A Washington lady missus O C hearing his wish made the pudding herself and I took it up to him the next day He subsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days This B is a good sample of the American eastern young man the typical Yankee I took a fancy to him and gave him a nice pipe for a keepsake He receiv d afterwards a box of things from home and nothing would do but I must take dinner with him which I did and a very good one it was TWO BROOKLYN BOYS Here in this same ward are two young men from Brooklyn members of the fifty first New York I had known both the two as young lads at home so they seem near to me One of them J L lies there with an amputated arm the stump healing pretty well I saw him lying on the ground at Fredericksburgh last December all bloody just after the arm was taken off He was very phlegmatic about it munching away at a cracker in the remaining hand made no fuss He will recover and thinks and talks yet of meeting Johnny Rebs A SECESH BRAVE The grand soldiers are not comprised in those of one side any more than the other Here is a sample of an unknown southerner a lad of seventeen At the War department a few days ago I witness d a presentation of captured flags to the Secretary Among others a soldier named Gant of the one hundred and fourth Ohio volunteers presented a rebel battle flag which one of the officers stated to me was borne to the mouth of our cannon and planted there by a boy but seventeen years of age who actually endeavor d to stop the muzzle of the gun with fence rails He was kill d in the effort and the flag staff was sever d by a shot from one of our men THE WOUNDED FROM CHANCELLORSVILLE May sixty three As I write this the wounded have begun to arrive from Hooker s command from bloody Chancellorsville I was down among the first arrivals The men in charge told me the bad cases were yet to come If that is so I pity them for these are bad enough You ought to see the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here at the foot of Sixth street at night Two boat loads came about half past seven last night A little after eight it rain d a long and violent shower The pale helpless soldiers had been debark d and lay around on the wharf and neighborhood anywhere The rain was probably grateful to them at any rate they were exposed to it The few torches light up the spectacle All around on the wharf on the ground out on side places the men are lying on blankets old quilts c with bloody rags bound round heads arms and legs The attendants are few and at night few outsiders also only a few hard work d transportation men and drivers The wounded are getting to be common and people grow callous The men whatever their condition lie there and patiently wait till their turn comes to be taken up Near by the ambulances are now arriving in clusters and one after another is call d to back up and take its load Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers The men generally make little or no ado whatever their sufferings A few groans that cannot be suppress d and occasionally a scream of pain as they lift a man into the ambulance To day as I write hundreds more are expected and to morrow and the next day more and so on for many days Quite often they arrive at the rate of one thousand a day A NIGHT BATTLE OVER A WEEK SINCE May twelve There was part of the late battle at Chancellorsville second Fredericksburgh a little over a week ago Saturday Saturday night and Sunday under general Joe Hooker I would like to give just a glimpse of a moment s look in a terrible storm at sea of which a few suggestions are enough and full details impossible The fighting had been very hot during the day and after an intermission the latter part was resumed at night and kept up with furious energy till three o clock in the morning That afternoon Saturday an attack sudden and strong by Stonewall Jackson had gain d a great advantage to the southern army and broken our lines entering us like a wedge and leaving things in that position at dark But Hooker at eleven at night made a desperate push drove the secesh forces back restored his original lines and resumed his plans This night scrimmage was very exciting and afforded countless strange and fearful pictures The fighting had been general both at Chancellorsville and northeast at Fredericksburgh We hear of some poor fighting episodes skedaddling on our part I think not of it I think of the fierce bravery the general rule One corps the sixth Sedgewick s fights four dashing and bloody battles in thirty six hours retreating in great jeopardy losing largely but maintaining itself fighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances getting over the Rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth yet getting over It lost many many brave men yet it took vengeance ample vengeance But it was the tug of Saturday evening and through the night and Sunday morning I wanted to make a special note of It was largely in the woods and quite a general engagement The night was very pleasant at times the moon shining out full and clear all Nature so calm in itself the early summer grass so rich and foliage of the trees yet there the battle raging and many good fellows lying helpless with new accessions to them and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of cannon for there was an artillery contest too the red life blood oozing out from heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dew cool grass Patches of the woods take fire and several of the wounded unable to move are consumed quite large spaces are swept over burning the dead also some of the men have their hair and beards singed some burns on their faces and hands others holes burnt in their clothing The flashes of fire from the cannon the quick flaring flames and smoke and the immense roar the musketry so general the light nearly bright enough for each side to see the other the crashing tramping of men the yelling close quarters we hear the secesh yells our men cheer loudly back especially if Hooker is in sight hand to hand conflicts each side stands up to it brave determin d as demons they often charge upon us a thousand deeds are done worth to write newer greater poems on and still the woods on fire still many are not only scorch d too many unable to move are burned to death Then the camps of the wounded O heavens what scene is this is this indeed humanity these butchers shambles There are several of them There they lie in the largest in an open space in the woods from two hundred to three hundred poor fellows the groans and screams the odor of blood mixed with the fresh scent of the night the grass the trees that slaughter house O well is it their mothers their sisters cannot see them cannot conceive and never conceiv d these things One man is shot by a shell both in the arm and leg both are amputated there lie the rejected members Some have their legs blown off some bullets through the breast some indescribably horrid wounds in the face or head all mutilated sickening torn gouged out some in the abdomen some mere boys many rebels badly hurt they take their regular turns with the rest just the same as any the surgeons use them just the same Such is the camp of the wounded such a fragment a reflection afar off of the bloody scene while all over the clear large moon comes out at times softly quietly shining Amid the woods that scene of flitting souls amid the crack and crash and yelling sounds the impalpable perfume of the woods and yet the pungent stifling smoke the radiance of the moon looking from heaven at intervals so placid the sky so heavenly the clear obscure up there those buoyant upper oceans a few large placid stars beyond coming silently and languidly out and then disappearing the melancholy draperied night above around And there upon the roads the fields and in those woods that contest never one more desperate in any age or land both parties now in force masses no fancy battle no semi play but fierce and savage demons fighting there courage and scorn of death the rule exceptions almost none What history I say can ever give for who can know the mad determin d tussle of the armies in all their separate large and little squads as this each steep d from crown to toe in desperate mortal purports Who know the conflict hand to hand the many conflicts in the dark those shadowy tangled flashing moonbeam d woods the writhing groups and squads the cries the din the cracking guns and pistols the distant cannon the cheers and calls and threats and awful music of the oaths the indescribable mix the officers orders persuasions encouragements the devils fully rous d in human hearts the strong shout Charge men charge the flash of the naked sword and rolling flame and smoke And still the broken clear and clouded heaven and still again the moonlight pouring silvery soft its radiant patches over all Who paint the scene the sudden partial panic of the afternoon at dusk Who paint the irrepressible advance of the second division of the Third corps under Hooker himself suddenly order d up those rapid filing phantoms through the woods Who show what moves there in the shadows fluid and firm to save and it did save the army s name perhaps the nation as there the veterans hold the field Brave Berry falls not yet but death has mark d him soon he falls UNNAMED REMAINS THE BRAVEST SOLDIER Of scenes like these I say who writes whoe er can write the story Of many a score aye thousands north and south of unwrit heroes unknown heroisms incredible impromptu first class desperations who tells No history ever no poem sings no music sounds those bravest men of all those deeds No formal general s report nor book in the library norcolumn in the paper embalms the bravest north or south east or west Unnamed unknown remain and still remain the bravest soldiers Our manliest our boys our hardy darlings no picture gives them Likely the typic one of them standing no doubt for hundreds thousands crawls aside to some bush clump or ferny tuft on receiving his death shot there sheltering a little while soaking roots grass and soil with red blood the battle advances retreats flits from the scene sweeps by and there haply with pain and suffering yet less far less than is supposed the last lethargy winds like a serpent round him the eyes glaze in death none recks perhaps the burial squads in truce a week afterwards search not the secluded spot and there at last the Bravest Soldier crumbles in mother earth unburied and unknown SOME SPECIMEN CASES June

he answers pleasantly wants nothing he told me soon after he came about his home affairs his mother had been an invalid and he fear d to let her know his condition He died soon after she came MY PREPARATIONS FOR VISITS In my visits to the hospitals I found it was in the simple matter of personal presence and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism that I succeeded and help d more than by medical nursing or delicacies or gifts of money or anything else During the war I possess d the perfection of physical health My habit when practicable was to prepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours of from a couple to four or five hours by fortifying myself with previous rest the bath clean clothes a good meal and as cheerful an appearance as possible AMBULANCE PROCESSIONS June twenty three Sundown As I sit writing this paragraph I see a train of about thirty huge four horse wagons used as ambulances fill d with wounded passing up Fourteenth street on their way probably to Columbian Carver and Mount Pleasant hospitals This is the way the men come in now seldom in small numbers but almost always in these long sad processions Through the past winter while our army lay opposite Fredericksburg the like strings of ambulances were of frequent occurrence along Seventh street passing slowly up from the steamboat wharf with loads from Aquia creek BAD WOUNDS THE YOUNG The soldiers are nearly all young men and far more American than is generally supposed I should say nine tenths are native born Among the arrivals from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of Ohio Indiana and Illinois men As usual there are all sorts of wounds Some of the men fearfully burnt from the explosions of artillery caissons One ward has a long row of officers some with ugly hurts Yesterday was perhaps worse than usual Amputations are going on the attendants are dressing wounds As you pass by you must be on your guard where you look I saw the other day a gentlemen a visitor apparently from curiosity in one of the wards stop and turn a moment to look at an awful wound they were probing He turn d pale and in a moment more he had fainted away and fallen to the floor THE MOST INSPIRITING OF ALL WAR S SHOWS June twenty nine Just before sundown this evening a very large cavalry force went by a fine sight The men evidently had seen service First came a mounted band of sixteen bugles drums and cymbals playing wild martial tunes made my heart jump Then the principal officers then company after company with their officers at their heads making of course the main part of the cavalcade then a long train of men with led horses lots of mounted negroes with special horses and a long string of baggage wagons each drawn by four horses and then a motley rear guard It was a pronouncedly warlike and gay show the sabres clank d the men look d young and healthy and strong the electric tramping of so many horses on the hard road and the gallant bearing fine seat and bright faced appearance of a thousand and more handsome young American men were so good to see An hour later another troop went by smaller in numbers perhaps three hundred men They too look d like serviceable men campaigners used to field and fight July three This forenoon for more than an hour again long strings of cavalry several regiments very fine men and horses four or five abreast I saw them in Fourteenth street coming in town from north Several hundred extra horses some of the mares with colts trotting along Appear d to be a number of prisoners too How inspiriting always the cavalry regiments Our men are generally well mounted feel good are young gay on the saddle their blankets in a roll behind them their sabres clanking at their sides This noise and movement and the tramp of many horses hoofs has a curious effect upon one The bugles play presently you hear them afar off deaden d mix d with other noises Then just as they had all pass d a string of ambulances commenc d from the other way moving up Fourteenth street north slowly wending along bearing a large lot of wounded to the hospitals BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG July fourth The weather to day upon the whole is very fine warm but from a smart rain last night fresh enough and no dust which is a great relief for this city I saw the parade about noon Pennsylvania avenue from Fifteenth street down toward the capitol There were three regiments of infantry I suppose the ones doing patrol duty here two or three societies of Odd Fellows a lot of children in barouches and a squad of policemen A useless imposition upon the soldiers they have work enough on their backs without piling the like of this As I went down the Avenue saw a big flaring placard on the bulletin board of a newspaper office announcing Glorious Victory for the Union Army Meade had fought Lee at Gettysburg Pennsylvania yesterday and day before and repuls d him most signally taken three thousand prisoners c I afterwards saw Meade s despatch very modest and a sort of order of the day from the President himself quite religious giving thanks to the Supreme and calling on the people to do the same I walk d on to Armory hospital took along with me several bottles of blackberry and cherry syrup good and strong but innocent Went through several of the wards announc d to the soldiers the news from Meade and gave them all a good drink of the syrups with ice water quite refreshing prepar d it all myself and serv d it around Meanwhile the Washington bells are ringing their sun down peals for Fourth of July and the usual fusilades of boys pistols crackers and guns A CAVALRY CAMP I am writing this nearly sundown watching a cavalry company acting Signal service just come in through a shower making their night s camp ready on some broad vacant ground a sort of hill in full view opposite my window There are the men in their yellow striped jackets All are dismounted the freed horses stand with drooping heads and wet sides they are to be led off presently in groups to water The little wall tents and shelter tents spring up quickly I see the fires already blazing and pots and kettles over them Some among the men are driving in tent poles wielding their axes with strong slow blows I see great huddles of horses bundles of hay groups of men some with unbuckled sabres yet on their sides a few officers piles of wood the flames of the fires saddles harness c The smoke streams upward additional men arrive and dismount some drive in stakes and tie their horses to them some go with buckets for water some are chopping wood and so on July sixth A steady rain dark and thick and warm A train of six mule wagons has just pass d bearing pontoons great square end flatboats and the heavy planking for overlaying them We hear that the Potomac above here is flooded and are wondering whether Lee will be able to get back across again or whether Meade will indeed break him to pieces The cavalry camp on the hill is a ceaseless field of observation for me This forenoon there stand the horses tether d together dripping steaming chewing their hay The men emerge from their tents dripping also The fires are half quench d July tenth Still the camp opposite perhaps fifty or sixty tents Some of the men are cleaning their sabres pleasant to day some brushing boots some laying off reading writing some cooking some sleeping On long temporary cross sticks back of the tents are cavalry accoutrements blankets and overcoats are hung out to air there are the squads of horses tether d feeding continually stamping and whisking their tails to keep off flies I sit long in my third story window and look at the scene a hundred little things going on peculiar objects connected with the camp that could not be described any one of them justly without much minute drawing and coloring in words A NEW YORK SOLDIER This afternoon July twenty twod I have spent a long time with Oscar F Wilber company G one hundred and fifty fourth New York low with chronic diarrhoea and a bad wound also He asked me to read him a chapter in the New Testament I complied and ask d him what I should read He said Make your own choice I open d at the close of one of the first books of the evangelists and read the chapters describing the latter hours of Christ and the scenes at the crucifixion The poor wasted young man ask d me to read the following chapter also how Christ rose again I read very slowly for Oscar was feeble It pleased him very much yet the tears were in his eyes He ask d me if I enjoy d religion I said Perhaps not my dear in the way you mean and yet may be it is the same thing He said It is my chief reliance He talk d of death and said he did not fear it I said Why Oscar don t you think you will get well He said I may but it is not probable He spoke calmly of his condition The wound was very bad it discharg d much Then the diarrhoea had prostrated him and I felt that he was even then the same as dying He behaved very manly and affectionate The kiss I gave him as I was about leaving he return d fourfold He gave me his mother s address missus Sally D Wilber Alleghany pest office Cattaraugus county N Y I had several such interviews with him He died a few days after the one just described HOME MADE MUSIC August eighth To night as I was trying to keep cool sitting by a wounded soldier in Armory square I was attracted by some pleasant singing in an adjoining ward As my soldier was asleep I left him and entering the ward where the music was I walk d halfway down and took a seat by the cot of a young Brooklyn friend S R badly wounded in the hand at Chancellorsville and who has suffer d much but at that moment in the evening was wide awake and comparatively easy He had turn d over on his left side to get a better view of the singers but the mosquito curtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight I stept round and loop d them all up so that he had a clear show and then sat down again by him and look d and listen d The principal singer was a young lady nurse of one of the wards accompanying on a melodeon and join d by the lady nurses of other wards They sat there making a charming group with their handsome healthy faces and standing up a little behind them were some ten or fifteen of the convalescent soldiers young men nurses c with books in their hands singing Of course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at the New York opera house take a hand in yet I am not sure but I receiv d as much pleasure under the circumstances sitting there as I have had from the best Italian compositions express d by world famous performers The men lying up and down the hospital in their cots some badly wounded some never to rise thence the cots themselves with their drapery of white curtains and the shadows down the lower and upper parts of the ward then the silence of the men and the attitudes they took the whole was a sight to look around upon again and again And there sweetly rose those voices up to the high whitewash d wooden roof and pleasantly the roof sent it all back again They sang very well mostly quaint old songs and declamatory hymns to fitting tunes Here for instance My days are swiftly gliding by and I a pilgrim stranger Would not detain them as they fly those hours of toil and danger For O we stand on Jordan s strand our friends are passing over And just before the shining shore we may almost discover We ll gird our loins my brethren dear our distant home discerning Our absent Lord has left us word let every lamp be burning For O we stand on Jordan s strand our friends are passing over And just before the shining shore we may almost discover ABRAHAM LINCOLN August twelfth I see the President almost every day as I happen to live where he passes to or from his lodgings out of town He never sleeps at the White House during the hot season but has quarters at a healthy location some three miles north of the city the Soldiers home a United States military establishment I saw him this morning about eight one two coming in to business riding on Vermont avenue near L street He always has a company of twenty five or thirty cavalry with sabres drawn and held upright over their shoulders They say this guard was against his personal wish but he let his counselors have their way The party makes no great show in uniform or horses mister Lincoln on the saddle generally rides a good sized easy going gray horse is dress d in plain black somewhat rusty and dusty wears a black stiff hat and looks about as ordinary in attire c as the commonest man A lieutenant with yellow straps rides at his left and following behind two by two come the cavalry men in their yellow striped jackets They are generally going at a slow trot as that is the pace set them by the one they wait upon The sabres and accoutrements clank and the entirely unornamental cortege as it trots towards Lafayette square arouses no sensation only some curious stranger stops and gazes I see very plainly ABRAHAM LINCOLN S dark brown face with the deep cut lines the eyes always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression We have got so that we exchange bows and very cordial ones Sometimes the President goes and comes in an open barouche The cavalry always accompany him with drawn sabres Often I notice as he goes out evenings and sometimes in the morning when he returns early he turns off and halts at the large and handsome residence of the Secretary of War on K street and holds conference there If in his barouche I can see from my window he does not alight but sits in his vehicle and mister Stanton comes out to attend him Sometimes one of his sons a boy of ten or twelve accompanies him riding at his right on a pony Earlier in the summer I occasionally saw the President and his wife toward the latter part of the afternoon out in a barouche on a pleasure ride through the city missus Lincoln was dress d in complete black with a long crape veil The equipage is of the plainest kind only two horses and they nothing extra They pass d me once very close and I saw the President in the face fully as they were moving slowly and his look though abstracted happen d to be directed steadily in my eye He bow d and smiled but far beneath his smile I noticed well the expression I have alluded to None of the artists or pictures has caught the deep though subtle and indirect expression of this man s face There is something else there One of the great portrait painters of two or three centuries ago is needed HEATED TERM There has lately been much suffering here from heat we have had it upon us now eleven days I go around with an umbrella and a fan I saw two cases of sun stroke yesterday one in Pennsylvania avenue and another in Seventh street The City railroad company loses some horses every day Yet Washington is having a livelier August and is probably putting in a more energetic and satisfactory summer than ever before during its existence There is probably more human electricity more population to make it more business more light heartedness than ever before The armies that swiftly circumambiated from Fredericksburgh march d struggled fought had out their mighty clinch and hurl at Gettysburg wheel d circumambiated again return d to their ways touching us not either at their going or coming And Washington feels that she has pass d the worst perhaps feels that she is henceforth mistress So here she sits with her surrounding hills spotted with guns and is conscious of a character and identity different from what it was five or six short weeks ago and very considerably pleasanter and prouder SOLDIERS AND TALKS Soldiers soldiers soldiers you meet everywhere about the city often superb looking men though invalids dress d in worn uniforms and carrying canes or crutches I often have talks with them occasionally quite long and interesting One for instance will have been all through the peninsula under McClellan narrates to me the fights the marches the strange quick changes of that eventful campaign and gives glimpses of many things untold in any official reports or books or journals These indeed are the things that are genuine and precious The man was there has been out two years has been through a dozen fights the superfluous flesh of talking is long work d off him and he gives me little but the hard meat and sinew I find it refreshing these hardy bright intuitive American young men experienc d soldiers with all their youth The vocal play and significance moves one more than books Then there hangs something majestic about a man who has borne his part in battles especially if he is very quiet regarding it when you desire him to unbosom I am continually lost at the absence of blowing and blowers among these old young American militaires I have found some man or other who has been in every battle since the war began and have talk d with them about each one in every part of the United States and many of the engagements on the rivers and harbors too I find men here from every State in the Union without exception There are more Southerners especially border State men in the Union army than is generally supposed A I now doubt whether one can get a fair idea of what this war practically is or what genuine America is and her character without some such experience as this I am having DEATH OF A WISCONSIN OFFICER Another characteristic scene of that dark and bloody eighteen sixty three from notes of my visit to Armory square hospital one hot but pleasant summer day In ward H we approach the cot of a young lieutenant of one of the Wisconsin regiments Tread the bare board floor lightly here for the pain and panting of death are in this cot I saw the lieutenant when he was first brought here from Chancellorsville and have been with him occasionally from day to day and night to night He had been getting along pretty well till night before last when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be stopt came upon him and to day it still continues at intervals Notice that water pail by the side of the bed with a quantity of blood and bloody pieces of muslin nearly full that tells the story The poor young man is struggling painfully for breath his great dark eyes with a glaze already upon them and the choking faint but audible in his throat An attendant sits by him and will not leave him till the last yet little or nothing can be done He will die here in an hour or two without the presence of kith or kin Meantime the ordinary chat and business of six the ward a little way off goes on indifferently Some of the inmates are laughing and joking others are playing checkers or cards others are reading c I have noticed through most of the hospitals that as long as there is any chance for a man no matter how bad he may be the surgeon and nurses work hard sometimes with curious tenacity for his life doing everything and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor s orders and minister to him every minute night and day See that screen there As you advance through the dusk of early candle light a nurse will step forth on tip toe and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any noise or perhaps to come near at all Some soldier s life is flickering there suspended between recovery and death Perhaps at this moment the exhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step might shake You must retire The neighboring patients must move in their stocking feet I have been several times struck with such mark d efforts everything bent to save a life from the very grip of the destroyer But when that grip is once firmly fix d leaving no hope or chance at all the surgeon abandons the patient If it is a case where stimulus is any relief the nurse gives milk punch or brandy or whatever is wanted ad libitum There is no fuss made Not a bit of sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death bed in hospital or on the field but generally impassive indifference All is over as far as any efforts can avail it is useless to expend emotions or labors While there is a prospect they strive hard at least most surgeons do but death certain and evident they yield the field Note six mister GARFIELD In the House of Representatives April fifteen seventy nine Do gentlemen know that leaving out all the border States there were fifty regiments and seven companies of white men in our army fighting for the Union from the States that went into rebellion Do they know that from the single State of Kentucky more Union soldiers fought under our flag than Napoleon took into the battle of Waterloo more than Wellington took with all the allied armies against Napoleon Do they remember that one hundred eighty six thousand color d men fought under our flag against the rebellion and for the Union and that of that number ninety thousand were from the States which went into rebellion HOSPITALS ENSEMBLE Aug Sept and Oct sixty three I am in the habit of going to all and to Fairfax seminary Alexandria and over Long bridge to the great Convalescent camp The journals publish a regular directory of them a long list As a specimen of almost any one of the larger of these hospitals fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground on which are group d ten or twelve very large wooden barracks with perhaps a dozen or twenty and sometimes more than that number small buildings capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a thousand or fifteen hundred persons Sometimes these wooden barracks or wards each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet long are rang d in a straight row evenly fronting the street others are plann d so as to form an immense V and others again are ranged around a hollow square They make altogether a huge cluster with the additional tents extra wards for contagious diseases guard houses sutler s stores chaplain s house in the middle will probably be an edifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward surgeons principal attaches clerks c The wards are either letter d alphabetically ward G ward K or else numerically one two three c Each has its ward surgeon and corps of nurses Of course there is in the aggregate quite a muster of employes and over all the surgeon in charge Here in Washington when these army hospitals are all fill d as they have been already several times they contain a population more numerous in itself than the whole of the Washington of ten or fifteen years ago Within sight of the capitol as I write are some thirty or forty such collections at times holding from fifty to seventy thousand men Looking from any eminence and studying the topography in my rambles I use them as landmarks Through the rich August verdure of the trees see that white group of buildings off yonder in the outskirts then another cluster half a mile to the left of the first then another a mile to the right and another a mile beyond and still another between us and the first Indeed we can hardly look in any direction but these clusters are dotting the landscape and environs That little town as you might suppose it off there on the brow of a hill is indeed a town but of wounds sickness and death It is Finley hospital northeast of the city on Kendall green as it used to be call d That other is Campbell hospital Both are large establishments I have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twenty five hundred inmates Then there is Carver hospital larger still a wall d and military city regularly laid out and guarded by squads of sentries Again off east Lincoln hospital a still larger one and half a mile further Emory hospital Still sweeping the eye around down the river toward Alexandria we see to the right the locality where the Convalescent camp stands with its five eight or sometimes ten thousand inmates Even all these are but a portion The Harewood Mount Pleasant Armory square Judiciary hospitals are some of the rest and all large collections A SILENT NIGHT RAMBLE October twentieth To night after leaving the hospital at ten o clock I had been on self imposed duty some five hours pretty closely confined I wander d a long time around Washington The night was sweet very clear sufficiently cool a voluptuous halfmoon slightly golden the space near it of a transparent blue gray tinge I walk d up Pennsylvania avenue and then to Seventh street and a long while around the Patent office Somehow it look d rebukefully strong majestic there in the delicate moonlight The sky the planets the constellations all so bright so calm so expressively silent so soothing after those hospital scenes I wander d to and fro till the moist moon set long after midnight SPIRITUAL CHARACTERS AMONG THE SOLDIERS Every now and then in hospital or camp there are beings I meet specimens of unworldliness disinterestedness and animal purity and heroism perhaps some unconscious Indianian or from Ohio or Tennessee on whose birth the calmness of heaven seems to have descended and whose gradual growing up whatever the circumstances of work life or change or hardship or small or no education that attended it the power of a strange spiritual sweetness fibre and inward health have also attended Something veil d and abstracted is often a part of the manners of these beings I have met them I say not seldom in the army in camp and in the hospitals The Western regiments contain many of them They are often young men obeying the events and occasions about them marching soldiering righting foraging cooking working on farms or at some trade before the war unaware of their own nature as to that who is aware of his own nature their companions only understanding that they are different from the rest more silent something odd about them and apt to go off and meditate and muse in solitude CATTLE DROVES ABOUT WASHINGTON Among other sights are immense droves of cattle with their drivers passing through the streets of the city Some of the men have a way of leading the cattle by a peculiar call a wild pensive hoot quite musical prolong d indescribable sounding something between the cooing of a pigeon and the hoot of an owl I like to stand and look at the sight of one of these immense droves a little way off as the dust is great There are always men on horseback cracking their whips and shouting the cattle low some obstinate ox or steer attempts to escape then a lively scene the mounted men always excellent riders and on good horses dash after the recusant and wheel and turn a dozen mounted drovers their great slouch d broad brim d hats very picturesque another dozen on foot everybody cover d with dust long goads in their hands an immense drove of perhaps one thousand cattle the shouting hooting movement c HOSPITAL PERPLEXITY To add to other troubles amid the confusion of this great army of sick it is almost impossible for a stranger to find any friend or relative unless he has the patient s specific address to start upon Besides the directory printed in the newspapers here there are one or two general directories of the hospitals kept at provost s head quarters but they are nothing like complete they are never up to date and as things are with the daily streams of coming and going and changing cannot be I have known cases for instance such as a farmer coming here from northern New York to find a wounded brother faithfully hunting round for a week and then compell d to leave and go home without getting any trace of him When he got home he found a letter from the brother giving the right address DOWN AT THE FRONT CULPEPPER VA Feb sixty four Here I am FRONT pretty well down toward the extreme front Three or four days ago General S who is now in chief command I believe Meade is absent sick moved a strong force southward from camp as if intending business They went to the Rapidan there has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting but nothing of consequence The telegraphic accounts given Monday morning last make entirely too much of it I should say What General S intended we here know not but we trust in that competent commander We were somewhat excited but not so very much either on Sunday during the day and night as orders were sent out to pack up and harness and be ready to evacuate to fall back towards Washington But I was very sleepy and went to bed Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the night I went forth and found it was from the men above mention d who were returning I talk d with some of the men as usual I found them full of gayety endurance and many fine little outshows the signs of the most excellent good manliness of the world It was a curious sight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night I stood unobserv d in the darkness and watch d them long The mud was very deep The men had their usual burdens overcoats knapsacks guns and blankets Along and along they filed by me with often a laugh a song a cheerful word but never once a murmur It may have been odd but I never before so realized the majesty and reality of the American people en masse It fell upon me like a great awe The strong ranks moved neither fast nor slow They had march d seven or eight miles already through the slipping unctuous mud The brave First corps stopt here The equally brave Third corps moved on to Brandy station The famous Brooklyn fourteenth are here guarding the town You see their red legs actively moving everywhere Then they have a theatre of their own here They give musical performances nearly everything done capitally Of course the audience is a jam It is good sport to attend one of these entertainments of the fourteenth I like to look around at the soldiers and the general collection in front of the curtain more than the scene on the stage PAYING THE BOUNTIES One of the things to note here now is the arrival of the paymaster with his strong box and the payment of bounties to veterans re enlisting Major H is here to day with a small mountain of greenbacks rejoicing the hearts of the twod division of the First corps In the midst of a rickety shanty behind a little table sit the major and clerk Eldridge with the rolls before them and much moneys A re enlisted man gets in cash about two hundred dollars down and heavy instalments following as the pay days arrive one after another The show of the men crowding around is quite exhilarating I like to stand and look They feel elated their pockets full and the ensuing furlough the visit home It is a scene of sparkling eyes and flush d cheeks The soldier has many gloomy and harsh experiences and this makes up for some of them Major H is order d to pay first all the re enlisted men of the First corps their bounties and back pay and then the rest You hear the peculiar sound of the rustling of the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour through the nimble fingers of the major and my friend clerk E RUMORS CHANGES et cetera About the excitement of Sunday and the orders to be ready to start I have heard since that the said orders came from some cautious minor commander and that the high principalities knew not and thought not of any such move which is likely The rumor and fear here intimated a long circuit by Lee and flank attack on our right But I cast my eyes at the mud which was then at its deepest and palmiest condition and retired composedly to rest Still it is about time for Culpepper to have a change Authorities have chased each other here like clouds in a stormy sky Before the first Bull Run this was the rendezvous and camp of instruction of the secession troops I am stopping at the house of a lady who has witness d all the eventful changes of the war along this route of contending armies She is a widow with a family of young children and lives here with her sister in a large handsome house A number of army officers board with them VIRGINIA Dilapidated fenceless and trodden with war as Virginia is wherever I move across her surface I find myself rous d to surprise and admiration What capacity for products improvements human life nourishment and expansion Everywhere that I have been in the Old Dominion the subtle mockery of that title now such thoughts have fill d me The soil is yet far above the average of any of the northern States And how full of breadth the scenery everywhere distant mountains everywhere convenient rivers Even yet prodigal in forest woods and surely eligible for all the fruits orchards and flowers The skies and atmosphere most luscious as I feel certain from more than a year s residence in the State and movements hither and yon I should say very healthy as a general thing Then a rich and elastic quality by night and by day The sun rejoices in his strength dazzling and burning and yet to me never unpleasantly weakening It is not the panting tropical heat but invigorates The north tempers it The nights are often unsurpassable Last evening Feb eight I saw the first of the new moon the outlined old moon clear along with it the sky and air so clear such transparent hues of color it seem d to me I had never really seen the new moon before It was the thinnest cut crescent possible It hung delicate just above the sulky shadow of the Blue mountains Ah if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for this unhappy State SUMMER OF eighteen sixty four I am back again in Washington on my regular daily and nightly rounds Of course there are many specialties Dotting a ward here and there are always cases of poor fellows long suffering under obstinate wounds or weak and dishearten d from typhoid fever or the like mark d cases needing special and sympathetic nourishment These I sit down and either talk to or silently cheer them up They always like it hugely and so do I Each case has its peculiarities and needs some new adaptation I have learnt to thus conform learnt a good deal of hospital wisdom Some of the poor young chaps away from home for the first time in their lives hunger and thirst for affection this is sometimes the only thing that will reach their condition The men like to have a pencil and something to write in I have given them cheap pocket diaries and almanacs for eighteen sixty four interleav d with blank paper For reading I generally have some old pictorial magazines or story papers they are always acceptable Also the morning or evening papers of the day The best books I do not give but lend to read through the wards and then take them to others and so on they are very punctual about returning the books In these wards or on the field as I thus continue to go round I have come to adapt myself to each emergency after its kind or call however trivial however solemn every one justified and made real under its circumstances not only visits and cheering talk and little gifts not only washing and dressing wounds I have some cases where the patient is unwilling any one should do this but me but passages from the Bible expounding them prayer at the bedside explanations of doctrine c I think I see my friends smiling at this confession but I was never more in earnest in my life In camp and everywhere I was in the habit of reading or giving recitations to the men They were very fond of it and liked declamatory poetical pieces We would gather in a large group by ourselves after supper and spend the time in such readings or in talking and occasionally by an amusing game called the game of twenty questions A NEW ARMY ORGANIZATION FIT FOR AMERICA It is plain to me out of the events of the war north and south and out of all considerations that the current military theory practice rules and organization adopted from Europe from the feudal institutes with of course the modern improvements largely from the French though tacitly follow d and believ d in by the officers generally are not at all consonant with the United States nor our people nor our days What it will be I know not but I know that as entire an abnegation of the present military system and the naval too and a building up from radically different root bases and centres appropriate to us must eventually result as that our political system has resulted and become establish d different from feudal Europe and built up on itself from original perennial democratic premises We have undoubtedly in the United States the greatest military power an exhaustless intelligent brave and reliable rank and file in the world any land perhaps all lands The problem is to organize this in the manner fully appropriate to it to the principles of the republic and to get the best service out of it In the present struggle as already seen and review d probably three fourths of the losses men lives c have been sheer superfluity extravagance waste DEATH OF A HERO I wonder if I could ever convey to another to you for instance reader dear the tender and terrible realities of such cases many many happen d as the one I am now going to mention Stewart C Glover company E fifth Wisconsin was wounded May five in one of those fierce tussles of the Wilderness died May twenty one aged about twenty He was a small and beardless young man a splendid soldier in fact almost an ideal American of his age He had serv d nearly three years and would have been entitled to his discharge in a few days He was in Hancock s corps The fighting had about ceas d for the day and the general commanding the brigade rode by and call d for volunteers to bring in the wounded Glover responded among the first went out gayly but while in the act of bearing in a wounded sergeant to our lines was shot in the knee by a rebel sharpshooter consequence amputation and death He had resided with his father John Glover an aged and feeble man in Batavia Genesee county N Y but was at school in Wisconsin after the war broke out and there enlisted soon took to soldier life liked it was very manly was belov d by officers and comrades He kept a little diary like so many of the soldiers On the day of his death he wrote the following in it to day the doctor says I must die all is over with me ah so young to die On another blank leaf he pencill d to his brother dear brother Thomas I have been brave but wicked pray for me HOSPITAL SCENES INCIDENTS It is Sunday afternoon middle of summer hot and oppressive and very silent through the ward I am taking care of a critical case now lying in a half lethargy Near where I sit is a suffering rebel from the eighth Louisiana his name is Irving He has been here a long time badly wounded and lately had his leg amputated it is not doing very well Right opposite me is a sick soldier boy laid down with his clothes on sleeping looking much wasted his pallid face on his arm I see by the yellow trimming on his jacket that he is a cavalry boy I step softly over and find by his card that he is named William Cone of the first Maine cavalry and his folks live in Skowhegan Ice Cream Treat One hot day toward the middle of June I gave the inmates of Carver hospital a general ice cream treat purchasing a large quantity and under convoy of the doctor or head nurse going around personally through the wards to see to its distribution An Incident In one of the rights before Atlanta a rebel soldier of large size evidently a young man was mortally wounded top of the head so that the brains partially exuded He lived three days lying on his back on the spot where he first dropt He dug with his heel in the ground during that time a hole big enough to put in a couple of ordinary knapsacks He just lay there in the open air and with little intermission kept his heel going night and day Some of our soldiers then moved him to a house but he died in a few minutes Another After the battles at Columbia Tennessee where we repuls d about a score of vehement rebel charges they left a great many wounded on the ground mostly within our range Whenever any of these wounded attempted to move away by any means generally by crawling off our men without exception brought them down by a bullet They let none crawl away no matter what his condition A YANKEE SOLDIER As I turn d off the Avenue one cool October evening into Thirteenth street a soldier with knapsack and overcoat stood at the corner inquiring his way I found he wanted to go part of the road in my direction so we walk d on together We soon fell into conversation He was small and not very young and a tough little fellow as I judged in the evening light catching glimpses by the lamps we pass d His answers were short but clear His name was Charles Carroll he belong d to one of the Massachusetts regiments and was born in or near Lynn His parents were living but were very old There were four sons and all had enlisted Two had died of starvation and misery in the prison at Andersonville and one had been kill d in the west He only was left He was now going home and by the way he talk d I inferr d that his time was nearly out He made great calculations on being with his parents to comfort them the rest of their days UNION PRISONERS SOUTH Michael Stansbury forty eight years of age a seafaring man a southerner by birth and raising formerly captain of U S light ship Long Shoal station d at Long Shoal point Pamlico sound though a southerner a firm Union man was captur d Feb seventeen eighteen sixty three and has been nearly two years in the Confederate prisons was at one time order d releas d by Governor Vance but a rebel officer re arrested him then sent on to Richmond for exchange but instead of being exchanged was sent down as a southern citizen not a soldier to Salisbury N C where he remain d until lately when he escap d among the exchang d by assuming the name of a dead soldier and coming up via Wilmington with the rest Was about sixteen months in Salisbury Subsequent to October sixty four there were about eleven thousand Union prisoners in the stockade about one hundred of them southern unionists two hundred U S deserters During the past winter fifteen hundred of the prisoners to save their lives join d the confederacy on condition of being assign d merely to guard duty Out of the eleven thousand not more than twenty five hundred came out five hundred of these were pitiable helpless wretches the rest were in a condition to travel There were often sixty dead bodies to be buried in the morning the daily average would be about forty The regular food was a meal of corn the cob and husk ground together and sometimes once a week a ration of sorghum molasses A diminutive ration of meat might possibly come once a month not oftener In the stockade containing the eleven thousand men there was a partial show of tents not enough for two thousand A large proportion of the men lived in holes in the ground in the utmost wretchedness Some froze to death others had their hands and feet frozen The rebel guards would occasionally and on the least pretence fire into the prison from mere demonism and wantonness All the horrors that can be named starvation lassitude filth vermin despair swift loss of self respect idiocy insanity and frequent murder were there Stansbury has a wife and child living in Newbern has written to them from here is in the U S light house employ still had been home to Newbern to see his family and on his return to the ship was captured in his boat Has seen men brought there to Salisbury as hearty as you ever see in your life in a few weeks completely dead gone much of it from thinking on their condition hope all gone Has himself a hard sad strangely deaden d kind of look as of one chill d for years in the cold and dark where his good manly nature had no room to exercise itself DESERTERS Oct twenty four Saw a large squad of our own deserters over three hundred surrounded with a cordon of arm d guards marching along Pennsylvania avenue The most motley collection I ever saw all sorts of rig all sorts of hats and caps many fine looking young fellows some of them shame faced some sickly most of them dirty shirts very dirty and long worn c They tramp d along without order a huge huddling mass not in ranks I saw some of the spectators laughing but I felt like anything else but laughing These deserters are far more numerous than would be thought Almost every day I see squads of them sometimes two or three at a time with a small guard sometimes ten or twelve under a larger one I hear that desertions from the army now in the field have often averaged ten thousand a month One of the commonest sights in Washington is a squad of deserters A GLIMPSE OF WAR S HELL SCENES In one of the late movements of our troops in the valley near Upperville I think a strong force of Moseby s mounted guerillas attack d a train of wounded and the guard of cavalry convoying them The ambulances contain d about sixty wounded quite a number of them officers of rank The rebels were in strength and the capture of the train and its partial guard after a short snap was effectually accomplish d No sooner had our men surrender d the rebels instantly commenced robbing the train and murdering their prisoners even the wounded Here is the scene or a sample of it ten minutes after Among the wounded officers in the ambulances were one a lieutenant of regulars and another of higher rank These two were dragg d out on the ground on their backs and were now surrounded by the guerillas a demoniac crowd each member of which was stabbing them in different parts of their bodies One of the officers had his feet pinn d firmly to the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into the ground These two officers as afterwards found on examination had receiv d about twenty such thrusts some of them through the mouth face c The wounded had all been dragg d to give a better chance also for plunder out of their wagons some had been effectually dispatch d and their bodies were lying there lifeless and bloody Others not yet dead but horribly mutilated were moaning or groaning Of our men who surrender d most had been thus maim d or slaughter d At this instant a force of our cavalry who had been following the train at some interval charged suddenly upon the secesh captors who proceeded at once to make the best escape they could Most of them got away but we gobbled two officers and seventeen men in the very acts just described The sight was one which admitted of little discussion as may be imagined The seventeen captur d men and two officers were put under guard for the night but it was decided there and then that they should die The next morning the two officers were taken in the town separate places put in the centre of the street and shot The seventeen men were taken to an open ground a little one side They were placed in a hollow square half encompass d by two of our cavalry regiments one of which regiments had three days before found the bloody corpses of three of their men hamstrung and hung up by the heels to limbs of trees by Moseby s guerillas and the other had not long before had twelve men after surrendering shot and then hung by the neck to limbs of trees and jeering inscriptions pinn d to the breast of one of the corpses who had been a sergeant Those three and those twelve had been found I say by these environing regiments Now with revolvers they form d the grim cordon of the seventeen prisoners The latter were placed in the midst of the hollow square unfasten d and the ironical remark made to them that they were now to be given a chance for themselves A few ran for it But what use From every side the deadly pills came In a few minutes the seventeen corpses strew d the hollow square I was curious to know whether some of the Union soldiers some few some one or two at least of the youngsters did not abstain from shooting on the helpless men Not one There was no exultation very little said almost nothing yet every man there contributed his shot Multiply the above by scores aye hundreds verify it in all the forms that different circumstances individuals places could afford light it with every lurid passion the wolf s the lion s lapping thirst for blood the passionate boiling volcanoes of human revenge for comrades brothers slain with the light of burning farms and heaps of smutting smouldering black embers and in the human heart everywhere black worse embers and you have an inkling of this war GIFTS MONEY DISCRIMINATION As a very large proportion of the wounded came up from the front without a cent of money in their pockets I soon discover d that it was about the best thing I could do to raise their spirits and show them that somebody cared for them and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly interest in them to give them small sums in such cases using tact and discretion about it I am regularly supplied with funds for this purpose by good women and men in Boston Salem Providence Brooklyn and New York I provide myself with a quantity of bright new ten cent and five cent bills and when I think it incumbent I give twenty five or thirty cents or perhaps fifty cents and occasionally a still larger sum to some particular case As I have started this subject I take opportunity to ventilate the financial question My supplies altogether voluntary mostly confidential often seeming quite Providential were numerous and varied For instance there were two distant and wealthy ladies sisters who sent regularly for two years quite heavy sums enjoining that their names should be kept secret The same delicacy was indeed a frequent condition From several I had carte blanche Many were entire strangers From these sources during from two to three years in the manner described in the hospitals I bestowed as almoner for others many many thousands of dollars I learn d one thing conclusively that beneath all the ostensible greed and heartlessness of our times there is no end to the generous benevolence of men and women in the United States when once sure of their object Another thing became clear to me while cash is not amiss to bring up the rear tact and magnetic sympathy and unction are and ever will be sovereign still ITEMS FROM MY NOTE BOOKS Some of the half eras d and not over legible when made memoranda of things wanted by one patient or another will convey quite a fair idea D S G bed fifty

towels I noticed afterward he was the cleanest of the whole ward missus G lady nurse ward F wants a bottle of brandy has two patients imperatively requiring stimulus low with wounds and exhaustion I supplied her with a bottle of first rate brandy from the Christian commission rooms A CASE FROM SECOND BULL RUN Well Poor John Mahay is dead He died yesterday His was a painful and long lingering case see p twenty four ante I have been with him at times for the past fifteen months He belonged to company A one hundred and first New York and was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second Bull Run August sixty two One scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of nearly two years The bladder had been perforated by a bullet going entirely through him Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by his bedside ward E Armory square The water ran out of his eyes from the intense pain and the muscles of his face were distorted but he utter d nothing except a low groan now and then Hot moist cloths were applied and reliev d him somewhat Poor Mahay a mere boy in age but old in misfortune He never knew the love of parents was placed in infancy in one of the New York charitable institutions and subsequently bound out to a tyrannical master in Sullivan county the scars of whose cowhide and club remain d yet on his back His wound here was a most disagreeable one for he was a gentle cleanly and affectionate boy He found friends in his hospital life and indeed was a universal favorite He had quite a funeral ceremony ARMY SURGEONS AID DEFICIENCIES I must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal manliness and professional spirit and capacity generally prevailing among the surgeons many of them young men in the hospitals and the army I will not say much about the exceptions for they are few but I have met some of those few and very incompetent and airish they were I never ceas d to find the best men and the hardest and most disinterested workers among the surgeons in the hospitals They are full of genius too I have seen many hundreds of them and this is my testimony There are however serious deficiencies wastes sad want of system in the commissions contributions and in all the voluntary and a great part of the governmental nursing edibles medicines stores c I do not say surgical attendance because the surgeons cannot do more than human endurance permits Whatever puffing accounts there may be in the papers of the North this is the actual fact No thorough previous preparation no system no foresight no genius Always plenty of stores no doubt but never where they are needed and never the proper application Of all harrowing experiences none is greater than that of the days following a heavy battle Scores hundreds of the noblest men on earth uncomplaining lie helpless mangled faint alone and so bleed to death or die from exhaustion either actually untouch d at all or merely the laying of them down and leaving them when there ought to be means provided to save them THE BLUE EVERYWHERE This city its suburbs the capitol the front of the White House the places of amusement the Avenue and all the main streets swarm with soldiers this winter more than ever before Some are out from the hospitals some from the neighboring camps c One source or another they pour plenteously and make I should say the mark d feature in the human movement and costume appearance of our national city Their blue pants and overcoats are everywhere The clump of crutches is heard up the stairs of the paymasters offices and there are characteristic groups around the doors of the same often waiting long and wearily in the cold Toward the latter part of the afternoon you see the furlough d men sometimes singly sometimes in small squads making their way to the Baltimore depot At all times except early in the morning the patrol detachments are moving around especially during the earlier hours of evening examining passes and arresting all soldiers without them They do not question the one legged or men badly disabled or main d but all others are stopt They also go around evenings through the auditoriums of the theatres and make officers and all show their passes or other authority for being there A MODEL HOSPITAL Sunday January twenty ninth eighteen sixty five Have been in Armory square this afternoon The wards are very comfortable new floors and plaster walls and models of neatness I am not sure but this is a model hospital after all in important respects I found several sad cases of old lingering wounds One Delaware soldier William H Millis from Bridgeville whom I had been with after the battles of the Wilderness last May where he receiv d a very bad wound in the chest with another in the left arm and whose case was serious pneumonia had set in all last June and July I now find well enough to do light duty For three weeks at the time mention d he just hovered between life and death BOYS IN THE ARMY As I walk d home about sunset I saw in Fourteenth street a very young soldier thinly clad standing near the house I was about to enter I stopt a moment in front of the door and call d him to me I knew that an old Tennessee regiment and also an Indiana regiment were temporarily stopping in new barracks near Fourteenth street This boy I found belonged to the Tennessee regiment But I could hardly believe he carried a musket He was but fifteen years old yet had been twelve months a soldier and had borne his part in several battles even historic ones I ask d him if he did not suffer from the cold and if he had no overcoat No he did not suffer from cold and had no overcoat but could draw one whenever he wish d His father was dead and his mother living in some part of East Tennessee all the men were from that part of the country The next forenoon I saw the Tennessee and Indiana regiments marching down the Avenue My boy was with the former stepping along with the rest There were many other boys no older I stood and watch d them as they tramp d along with slow strong heavy regular steps There did not appear to be a man over thirty years of age and a large proportion were from fifteen to perhaps twenty two or twenty three They had all the look of veterans worn stain d impassive and a certain unbent lounging gait carrying in addition to their regular arms and knapsacks frequently a frying pan broom c They were all of pleasant physiognomy no refinement nor blanch d with intellect but as my eye pick d them moving along rank by rank there did not seem to be a single repulsive brutal or markedly stupid face among them BURIAL OF A LADY NURSE Here is an incident just occurr d in one of the hospitals A lady named Miss or missus Billings who has long been a practical friend of soldiers and nurse in the army and had become attached to it in a way that no one can realize but him or her who has had experience was taken sick early this winter linger d some time and finally died in the hospital It was her request that she should be buried among the soldiers and after the military method This request was fully carried out Her coffin was carried to the grave by soldiers with the usual escort buried and a salute fired over the grave This was at Annapolis a few days since FEMALE NURSES FOR SOLDIERS There are many women in one position or another among the hospitals mostly as nurses here in Washington and among the military stations quite a number of them young ladies acting as volunteers They are a help in certain ways and deserve to be mention d with respect Then it remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies under the irresistible conventions of society answer the practical requirements of nurses for soldiers Middle aged or healthy and good condition d elderly women mothers of children are always best Many of the wounded must be handled A hundred things which cannot be gainsay d must occur and must be done The presence of a good middle aged or elderly woman the magnetic touch of hands the expressive features of the mother the silent soothing of her presence her words her knowledge and privileges arrived at only through having had children are precious and final qualifications It is a natural faculty that is required it is not merely having a genteel young woman at a table in a ward One of the finest nurses I met was a red faced illiterate old Irish woman I have seen her take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms There are plenty of excellent clean old black women that would make tip top nurses SOUTHERN ESCAPEES Feb twenty three sixty five I saw a large procession of young men from the rebel army deserters they are call d but the usual meaning of the word does not apply to them passing the Avenue to day There were nearly two hundred come up yesterday by boat from James river I stood and watch d them as they shuffled along in a slow tired worn sort of way a large proportion of light hair d blonde light gray eyed young men among them Their costumes had a dirt stain d uniformity most had been originally gray some had articles of our uniform pants on one vest or coat on another I think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina boys They excited little or no attention As I stood quite close to them several good looking enough youths but O what a tale of misery their appearance told nodded or just spoke to me without doubt divining pity and fatherliness out of my face for my heart was full enough of it Several of the couples trudg d along with their arms about each other some probably brothers as if they were afraid they might somehow get separated They nearly all look d what one might call simple yet intelligent too Some had pieces of old carpet some blankets and others old bags around their shoulders Some of them here and there had fine faces still it was a procession of misery The two hundred had with them about half a dozen arm d guards Along this week I saw some such procession more or less in numbers every day as they were brought up by the boat The government does what it can for them and sends them north and west Feb twenty seven Some three or four hundred more escapees from the confederate army came up on the boat As the day has been very pleasant indeed after a long spell of bad weather I have been wandering around a good deal without any other object than to be out doors and enjoy it have met these escaped men in all directions Their apparel is the same ragged long worn motley as before described I talk d with a number of the men Some are quite bright and stylish for all their poor clothes walking with an air wearing their old head coverings on one side quite saucily I find the old unquestionable proofs as all along the past four years of the unscrupulous tyranny exercised by the secession government in conscripting the common people by absolute force everywhere and paying no attention whatever to the men s time being up keeping them in military service just the same One gigantic young fellow a Georgian at least six feet three inches high broad sized in proportion attired in the dirtiest drab well smear d rags tied with strings his trousers at the knees all strips and streamers was complacently standing eating some bread and meat He appear d contented enough Then a few minutes after I saw him slowly walking along It was plain he did not take anything to heart Feb twenty eight As I pass d the military headquarters of the city not far from the President s house I stopt to interview some of the crowd of escapees who were lounging there In appearance they were the same as previously mention d Two of them one about seventeen and the other perhaps twenty five or six I talk d with some time They were from North Carolina born and rais d there and had folks there The elder had been in the rebel service four years He was first conscripted for two years He was then kept arbitrarily in the ranks This is the case with a large proportion of the secession army There was nothing downcast in these young men s manners the younger had been soldiering about a year he was conscripted there were six brothers all the boys of the family in the army part of them as conscripts part as volunteers three had been kill d one had escaped about four months ago and now this one had got away he was a pleasant and well talking lad with the peculiar North Carolina idiom not at all disagreeable to my ears He and the elder one were of the same company and escaped together and wish d to remain together They thought of getting transportation away to Missouri and working there but were not sure it was judicious I advised them rather to go to some of the directly northern States and get farm work for the present The younger had made six dollars on the boat with some tobacco he brought he had three and a half left The elder had nothing I gave him a trifle Soon after met John Wormley ninth Alabama a West Tennessee rais d boy parents both dead had the look of one for a long time on short allowance said very little chew d tobacco at a fearful rate spitting in proportion large clear dark brown eyes very fine didn t know what to make of me told me at last he wanted much to get some clean underclothes and a pair of decent pants Didn t care about coat or hat fixings Wanted a chance to wash himself well and put on the underclothes I had the very great pleasure of helping him to accomplish all those wholesome designs March first Plenty more butternut or clay color d escapees every day About one hundred sixty came in to day a large portion South Carolinians They generally take the oath of allegiance and are sent north west or extreme south west if they wish Several of them told me that the desertions in their army of men going home leave or no leave are far more numerous than their desertions to our side I saw a very forlorn looking squad of about a hundred late this afternoon on their way to the Baltimore depot THE CAPITOL BY GAS LIGHT To night I have been wandering awhile in the capitol which is all lit up The illuminated rotunda looks fine I like to stand aside and look a long long while up at the dome it comforts me somehow The House and Senate were both in session till very late I look d in upon them but only a few moments they were hard at work on tax and appropriation bills I wander d through the long and rich corridors and apartments under the Senate an old habit of mine former winters and now more satisfaction than ever Not many persons down there occasionally a flitting figure in the distance THE INAUGURATION March fourth The President very quietly rode down to the capitol in his own carriage by himself on a sharp trot about noon either because he wish d to be on hand to sign bills or to get rid of marching in line with the absurd procession the muslin temple of liberty and pasteboard monitor I saw him on his return at three o clock after the performance was over He was in his plain two horse barouche and look d very much worn and tired the lines indeed of vast responsibilities intricate questions and demands of life and death cut deeper than ever upon his dark brown face yet all the old goodness tenderness sadness and canny shrewdness underneath the furrows I never see that man without feeling that he is one to become personally attach d to for his combination of purest heartiest tenderness and native western form of manliness By his side sat his little boy of ten years There were no soldiers only a lot of civilians on horseback with huge yellow scarfs over their shoulders riding around the carriage At the inauguration four years ago he rode down and back again surrounded by a dense mass of arm d cavalrymen eight deep with drawn sabres and there were sharpshooters station d at every corner on the route I ought to make mention of the closing levee of Saturday night last Never before was such a compact jam in front of the White House all the grounds fill d and away out to the spacious sidewalks I was there as I took a notion to go was in the rush inside with the crowd surged along the passage ways the blue and other rooms and through the great east room Crowds of country people some very funny Fine music from the Marine band off in a side place I saw mister Lincoln drest all in black with white kid gloves and a claw hammer coat receiving as in duty bound shaking hands looking very disconsolate and as if he would give anything to be somewhere else ATTITUDE OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DURING THE WAR Looking over my scraps I find I wrote the following during eighteen sixty four The happening to our America abroad as well as at home these years is indeed most strange The democratic republic has paid her today the terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the nations of the world that her union should be broken her future cut off and that she should be compell d to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great There is certainly not one government in Europe but is now watching the war in this country with the ardent prayer that the United States may be effectually split crippled and dismember d by it There is not one but would help toward that dismemberment if it dared I say such is the ardent wish to day of England and of France as governments and of all the nations of Europe as governments I think indeed it is to day the real heartfelt wish of all the nations of the world with the single exception of Mexico Mexico the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph with genuine prayer Is it not indeed strange America made up of all cheerfully from the beginning opening her arms to all the result and justifier of all of Britain Germany France and Spain all here the accepter the friend hope last resource and general house of all she who has harm d none but been bounteous to so many to millions the mother of strangers and exiles all nations should now I say be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred Are we indignant alarm d Do we feel jeopardized No help d braced concentrated rather We are all too prone to wander from ourselves to affect Europe and watch her frowns and smiles We need this hot lesson of general hatred and henceforth must never forget it Never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single government of the old world THE WEATHER DOES IT SYMPATHIZE WITH THESE TIMES Whether the rains the heat and cold and what underlies them all are affected with what affects man in masses and follow his play of passionate action strain d stronger than usual and on a larger scale than usual whether this or no it is certain that there is now and has been for twenty months or more on this American continent north many a remarkable many an unprecedented expression of the subtile world of air above us and around us There since this war and the wide and deep national agitation strange analogies different combinations a different sunlight or absence of it different products even out of the ground After every great battle a great storm Even civic events the same On Saturday last a forenoon like whirling demons dark with slanting rain full of rage and then the afternoon so calm so bathed with flooding splendor from heaven s most excellent sun with atmosphere of sweetness so clear it show d the stars long long before they were due As the President came out on the capitol portico a curious little white cloud the only one in that part of the sky appear d like a hovering bird right over him Indeed the heavens the elements all the meteorological influences have run riot for weeks past Such caprices abruptest alternation of frowns and beauty I never knew It is a common remark that as last summer was different in its spells of intense heat from any preceding it the winter just completed has been without parallel It has remain d so down to the hour I am writing Much of the daytime of the past month was sulky with leaden heaviness fog interstices of bitter cold and some insane storms But there have been samples of another description Nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty than some of the nights lately here The western star Venus in the earlier hours of evening has never been so large so clear it seems as if it told something as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity with us Americans Five or six nights since it hung close by the moon then a little past its first quarter The star was wonderful the moon like a young mother The sky dark blue the transparent night the planets the moderate west wind the elastic temperature the miracle of that great star and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west suffused the soul Then I heard slow and clear the deliberate notes of a bugle come up out of the silence sounding so good through the night s mystery no hurry but firm and faithful floating along rising falling leisurely with here and there a long drawn note the bugle well play d sounding tattoo in one of the army hospitals near here where the wounded some of them personally so dear to me are lying in their cots and many a sick boy come down to the war from Illinois Michigan Wisconsin Iowa and the rest INAUGURATION BALL March six I have been up to look at the dance and supper rooms for the inauguration ball at the Patent office and I could not help thinking what a different scene they presented to my view a while since fill d with a crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war brought in from second Bull Run Antietam and Fredericksburgh To night beautiful women perfumes the violin s sweetness the polka and the waltz then the amputation the blue face the groan the glassy eye of the dying the clotted rag the odor of wounds and blood and many a mother s son amid strangers passing away untended there for the crowd of the badly hurt was great and much for nurse to do and much for surgeon SCENE AT THE CAPITOL I must mention a strange scene at the capitol the hall of Representatives the morning of Saturday last March fourth The day just dawn d but in half darkness everything dim leaden and soaking In that dim light the members nervous from long drawn duty exhausted some asleep and many half asleep The gas light mix d with the dingy day break produced an unearthly effect The poor little sleepy stumbling pages the smell of the hall the members with heads leaning on their desks the sounds of the voices speaking with unusual intonations the general moral atmosphere also of the close of this important session the strong hope that the war is approaching its close the tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a false one the grandeur of the hall itself with its effect of vast shadows up toward the panels and spaces over the galleries all made a mark d combination In the midst of this with the suddenness of a thunderbolt burst one of the most angry and crashing storms of rain and hail ever heard It beat like a deluge on the heavy glass roof of the hall and the wind literally howl d and roar d For a moment and no wonder the nervous and sleeping Representatives were thrown into confusion The slumberers awaked with fear some started for the doors some look d up with blanch d cheeks and lips to the roof and the little pages began to cry it was a scene But it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were actually awake They recover d themselves the storm raged on beating dashing and with loud noises at times But the House went ahead with its business then I think as calmly and with as much deliberation as at any time in its career Perhaps the shock did it good One is not without impression after all amid these members of Congress of both the Houses that if the flat routine of their duties should ever be broken in upon by some great emergency involving real danger and calling for first class personal qualities those qualities would be found generally forthcoming and from men not now credited with them A YANKEE ANTIQUE March twenty seven eighteen sixty five Sergeant Calvin F Harlowe company C twenty ninth Massachusetts threed brigade first division Ninth corps a mark d sample of heroism and death some may say bravado but I say heroism of grandest oldest order in the late attack by the rebel troops and temporary capture by them of fort Steadman at night The fort was surprised at dead of night Suddenly awaken d from their sleep and rushing from their tents Harlowe with others found himself in the hands of the secesh they demanded his surrender he answer d Never while I live Of course it was useless The others surrender d the odds were too great Again he was ask d to yield this time by a rebel captain Though surrounded and quite calm he again refused call d sternly to his comrades to fight on and himself attempted to do so The rebel captain then shot him but at the same instant he shot the captain Both fell together mortally wounded Harlowe died almost instantly The rebels were driven out in a very short time The body was buried next day but soon taken up and sent home Plymouth county Mass Harlowe was only twenty two years of age was a tall slim dark hair d blue eyed young man had come out originally with the twenty ninth and that is the way he met his death after four years campaign He was in the Seven Days fight before Richmond in second Bull Run Antietam first Fredericksburgh Vicksburgh Jackson Wilderness and the campaigns following was as good a soldier as ever wore the blue and every old officer in the regiment will bear that testimony Though so young and in a common rank he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero in the books ancient or modern It was too great to say the words I surrender and so he died When I think of such things knowing them well all the vast and complicated events of the war on which history dwells and makes its volumes fall aside and for the moment at any rate I see nothing but young Calvin Harlowe s figure in the night disdaining to surrender WOUNDS AND DISEASES The war is over but the hospitals are fuller than ever from former and current cases A large majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs But there is every kind of wound in every part of the body I should say of the sick from my observation that the prevailing maladies are typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally diarrhoea catarrhal affections and bronchitis rheumatism and pneumonia These forms of sickness lead all the rest follow There are twice as many sick as there are wounded The deaths range from seven to ten per cent of those under treatment seven Note seven In the U S Surgeon General s office since there is a formal record and treatment of one hundred fifty three one hundred forty two cases of wounds by government surgeons What must have been the number unofficial indirect to say nothing of the Southern armies DEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN April sixteen sixty five I find in my notes of the time this passage on the death of Abraham Lincoln He leaves for America s history and biography so far not only its most dramatic reminiscence he leaves in my opinion the greatest best most characteristic artistic moral personality Not but that he had faults and show d them in the Presidency but honesty goodness shrewdness conscience and a new virtue unknown to other lands and hardly yet really known here but the foundation and tie of all as the future will grandly develop UNIONISM in its truest and amplest sense form d the hard pan of his character These he seal d with his life The tragic splendor of his death purging illuminating all throws round his form his head an aureole that will remain and will grow brighter through time while history lives and love of country lasts By many has this Union been help d but if one name one man must be pick d out he most of all is the conservator of it to the future He was assassinated but the Union is not assassinated ca ira One falls and another falls The soldier drops sinks like a wave but the ranks of the ocean eternally press on Death does its work obliterates a hundred a thousand President general captain private but the Nation is immortal SHERMAN S ARMY S JUBILATION ITS SUDDEN STOPPAGE When Sherman s armies long after they left Atlanta were marching through Southand North Carolina after leaving Savannah the news of Lee s capitulation having been receiv d the men never mov d a mile without from some part of the line sending up continued inspiriting shouts At intervals all day long sounded out the wild music of those peculiar army cries They would be commenc d by one regiment or brigade immediately taken up by others and at length whole corps and armies would join in these wild triumphant choruses It was one of the characteristic expressions of the western troops and became a habit serving as a relief and outlet to the men a vent for their feelings of victory returning peace c Morning noon and afternoon spontaneous for occasion or without occasion these huge strange cries differing from any other echoing through the open air for many a mile expressing youth joy wildness irrepressible strength and the ideas of advance and conquest sounded along the swamps and uplands of the South floating to the skies There never were men that kept in better spirits in danger or defeat what then could they do in victory said one of the fifteenth corps to me afterwards This exuberance continued till the armies arrived at Raleigh There the news of the President s murder was receiv d Then no more shouts or yells for a week All the marching was comparatively muffled It was very significant hardly a loud word or laugh in many of the regiments A hush and silence pervaded all NO GOOD PORTRAIT OF LINCOLN Probably the reader has seen physiognomies often old farmers sea captains and such that behind their homeliness or even ugliness held superior points so subtle yet so palpable making the real life of their faces almost as impossible to depict as a wild perfume or fruit taste or a passionate tone of the living voice and such was Lincoln s face the peculiar color the lines of it the eyes mouth expression Of technical beauty it had nothing but to the eye of a great artist it furnished a rare study a feast and fascination The current portraits are all failures most of them caricatures RELEAS D UNION PRISONERS FROM SOUTH The releas d prisoners of war are now coming up from the southern prisons I have seen a number of them The sight is worse than any sight of battle fields or any collection of wounded even the bloodiest There was as a sample one large boat load of several hundreds brought about the twenty fifth to Annapolis and out of the whole number only three individuals were able to walk from the boat The rest were carried ashore and laid down in one place or another Can those be men those little livid brown ash streak d monkey looking dwarfs are they really not mummied dwindled corpses They lay there most of them quite still but with a horrible look in their eyes and skinny lips often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth Probably no more appalling sight was ever seen on this earth There are deeds crimes that may be forgiven but this is not among them It steeps its perpetrators in blackest escapeless endless damnation Over fifty thousand have been compell d to die the death of starvation reader did you ever try to realize what starvation actually is in those prisons and in a land of plenty An indescribable meanness tyranny aggravating course of insults almost incredible was evidently the rule of treatment through all the southern military prisons The dead there are not to be pitied as much as some of the living that come from there if they can be call d living many of them are mentally imbecile and will never recuperate eight Note eight From a review of ANDERSONVILLE A STORY OF SOUTHERN MILTTARY PRISONS published serially in the Toledo Blade in eighteen seventy nine and afterwards in book form There is a deep fascination in the subject of Andersonville for that Golgotha in which lie the whitening bones of thirteen thousand gallant young men represents the dearest and costliest sacrifice of the war for the preservation of our national unity It is a type too of its class Its more than hundred hecatombs of dead represent several times that number of their brethren for whom the prison gates of Belle Isle Danville Salisbury Florence Columbia and Cahaba open d only in eternity There are few families in the North who have not at least one dear relative or friend among these sixty thousand whose sad fortune it was to end their service for the Union by lying down and dying for it in a southern prison pen The manner of their death the horrors that cluster d thickly around every moment of their existence the loyal unfaltering steadfastness with which they endured all that fate had brought them has never been adequately told It was not with them as with their comrades in the field whose every act was perform d in the presence of those whose duty it was to observe such matters and report them to the world Hidden from the view of their friends in the north by the impenetrable veil which the military operations of the rebels drew around the so called confederacy the people knew next to nothing of their career or their sufferings Thousands died there less heeded even than the hundreds who perish d on the battlefield Grant did not lose as many men kill d outright in the terrible campaign from the Wilderness to the James river forty three days of desperate fighting as died in July and August at Andersonville Nearly twice as many died in that prison as fell from the day that Grant cross d the Rapidan till he settled down in the trenches before Petersburg More than four times as many Union dead lie under the solemn soughing pines about that forlorn little village in southern Georgia than mark the course of Sherman from Chattanooga to Atlanta The nation stands aghast at the expenditure of life which attended the two bloody campaigns of eighteen sixty four which virtually crush d the confederacy but no one remembers that more Union soldiers died in the rear of the rebel lines than were kill d in the front of them The great military events which stamp d out the rebellion drew attention away from the sad drama which starvation and disease play d in those gloomy pens in the far recesses of sombre southern forests From a letter of Johnny Bouquet in N Y Tribune March twenty seven eighty one I visited at Salisbury N C the prison pen or the site of it from which nearly eleven thousand victims of southern politicians were buried being confined in a pen without shelter exposed to all the elements could do to all the disease herding animals together could create and to all the starvation and cruelty an incompetent and intense caitiff government could accomplish From the conversation and almost from the recollection of the northern people this place has dropp d but not so in the gossip of the Salisbury people nearly all of whom say that the half was never told that such was the nature of habitual outrage here that when Federal prisoners escaped the townspeople harbor d them in their barns afraid the vengeance of God would fall on them to deliver even their enemies back to such cruelty Said one old man at the Boyden House who join d in the conversation one evening There were often men buried out of that prison pen still alive I have the testimony of a surgeon that he had seen them pull d out of the dead cart with their eyes open and taking notice but too weak to lift a finger There was not the least excuse for such treatment as the confederate government had seized every sawmill in the region and could just as well have put up shelter for these prisoners as not wood being plentiful here It will be hard to make any honest man in Salisbury say that there was the slightest necessity for those prisoners having to live in old tents caves and holes half full of water Representations were made to the Davis government against the officers in charge of it but no attention was paid to them Promotion was the punishment for cruelty there The inmates were skeletons Hell could have no terrors for any man who died there except the inhuman keepers DEATH OF A PENNSYLVANIA SOLDIER Frank H Irwin company E ninety third Pennsylvania died May one sixty five My letter to his mother Dear madam No doubt you and Frank s friends have heard the sad fact of his death in hospital here through his uncle or the lady from Baltimore who took his things I have not seen them only heard of them visiting Frank I will write you a few lines as a casual friend that sat by his death bed Your son corporal Frank H Irwin was wounded near fort Fisher Virginia March twenty fifth eighteen sixty five the wound was in the left knee pretty bad He was sent up to Washington was receiv d in ward C Armory square hospital March twenty eighth the wound became worse and on the fourth of April the leg was amputated a little above the knee the operation was perform d by doctor Bliss one of the best surgeons in the army he did the whole operation himself there was a good deal of bad matter gather d the bullet was found in the knee For a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty well I visited and sat by him frequently as he was fond of having me The last ten or twelve days of April I saw that his case was critical He previously had some fever with cold spells The last week in April he was much of the time flighty but always mild and gentle He died first of May The actual cause of death was pyaemia the absorption of the matter in the system instead of its discharge Frank as far as I saw had everything requisite in surgical treatment nursing c He had watches much of the time He was so good and well behaved and affectionate I myself liked him very much I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him and soothing him and he liked to have me liked to put his arm out and lay his hand on my knee would keep it so a long while Toward the last he was more restless and flighty at night often fancied himself with his regiment by his talk sometimes seem d as if his feelings were hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent of said I never in my life was thought capable of such a thing and never was At other times he would fancy himself talking as it seem d to children or such like his relatives I suppose and giving them good advice would talk to them a long while All the time he was out of his head not one single bad word or idea escaped him It was remark d that many a man s conversation in his senses was not half as good as Frank s delirium He seem d quite willing to die he had become very weak and had suffer d a good deal and was perfectly resign d poor boy I do not know his past life but I feel as if it must have been good At any rate what I saw of him here under the most trying circumstances with a painful wound and among strangers I can say that he behaved so brave so composed and so sweet and affectionate it could not be surpass d And now like many other noble and good men after serving his country as a soldier he has yielded up his young life at the very outset in her service Such things are gloomy yet there is a text God doeth all things well the meaning of which after due time appears to the soul I thought perhaps a few words though from a stranger about your son from one who was with him at the last might be worth while for I loved the young man though I but saw him immediately to lose him I am merely a friend visiting the hospitals occasionally to cheer the wounded and sick W W THE ARMIES RETURNING May seven Sunday To day as I was walking a mile or two south of Alexandria I fell in with several large squads of the returning Western army Sherman s men as they call d themselves about a thousand in all the largest portion of them half sick some convalescents on their way to a hospital camp These fragmentary excerpts with the unmistakable Western physiognomy and idioms crawling along slowly after a great campaign blown this way as it were out of their latitude I mark d with curiosity and talk d with off and on for over an hour Here and there was one very sick but all were able to walk except some of the last who had given out and were seated on the ground faint and despondent These I tried to cheer told them the camp they were to reach was only a little way further over the hill and so got them up and started accompanying some of the worst a little way and helping them or putting them under the support of stronger comrades May twenty one Saw General Sheridan and his cavalry to day a strong attractive sight the men were mostly young a few middle aged superb looking fellows brown spare keen with well worn clothing many with pieces of water proof cloth around their shoulders hanging down They dash d along pretty fast in wide close ranks all spatter d with mud no holiday soldiers brigade after brigade I could have watch d for a week Sheridan stood on a balcony under a big tree coolly smoking a cigar His looks and manner impress d me favorably May twenty two Have been taking a walk along Pennsylvania avenue and Seventh street north The city is full of soldiers running around loose Officers everywhere of all grades All have the weatherbeaten look of practical service It is a sight I never tire of All the armies are now here or portions of them for to morrow s review You see them swarming like bees everywhere THE GRAND REVIEW For two days now the broad spaces of Pennsylvania avenue along to Treasury hill and so by detour around to the President s house and so up to Georgetown and across the aqueduct bridge have been alive with a magnificent sight the returning armies In their wide ranks stretching clear across the Avenue I watch them march or ride along at a brisk pace through two whole days infantry cavalry artillery some two hundred thousand men Some days afterwards one or two other corps and then still afterwards a good part of Sherman s immense army brought up from Charleston Savannah c WESTERN SOLDIERS May twenty six seven The streets the public buildings and grounds of Washington still swarm with soldiers from Illinois Indiana Ohio Missouri Iowa and all the Western States I am continually meeting and talking with them They often speak to me first and always show great sociability and glad to have a good interchange of chat These Western soldiers are more slow in their movements and in their intellectual quality also have no extreme alertness They are larger in size have a more serious physiognomy are continually looking at you as they pass in the street They are largely animal and handsomely so During the war I have been at times with the Fourteenth Fifteenth Seventeenth and Twentieth Corps I always feel drawn toward the men and like their personal contact when we are crowded close together as frequently these days in the street cars They all think the world of General Sherman call him old Bill or sometimes uncle Billy A SOLDIER ON LINCOLN May twenty eight As I sat by the bedside of a sick Michigan soldier in hospital to day a convalescent from the adjoining bed rose and came to me and presently we began talking He was a middleaged man belonged to the twod Virginia regiment but lived in Racine Ohio and had a family there He spoke of President Lincoln and said The war is over and many are lost And now we have lost the best the fairest the truest man in America Take him altogether he was the best man this country ever produced It was quite a while I thought very different but some time before the murder that s the way I have seen it There was deep earnestness in the soldier I found upon further talk he had known mister Lincoln personally and quite closely years before He was a veteran was now in the fifth year of his service was a cavalry man and had been in a good deal of hard fighting TWO BROTHERS ONE SOUTH ONE NORTH May twenty eight nine I staid to night a long time by the bedside of a new patient a young Baltimorean aged about nineteen years W S P twod Maryland southern very feeble right leg amputated can t sleep hardly at all has taken a great deal of morphine which as usual is costing more than it comes to Evidently very intelligent and well bred very affectionate held on to my hand and put it by his face not willing to let me leave As I was lingering soothing him in his pain he says to me suddenly I hardly think you know who I am I don t wish to impose upon you I am a rebel soldier I said I did not know that but it made no difference Visiting him daily for about two weeks after that while he lived death had mark d him and he was quite alone I loved him much always kiss d him and he did me In an adjoining ward I found his brother an officer of rank a Union soldier a brave and religious man colonel Clifton K Prentiss sixth Maryland infantry Sixth corps wounded in one of the engagements at Petersburgh April two linger d suffer d much died in Brooklyn Aug twenty sixty five It was in the same battle both were hit One was a strong Unionist the other Secesh both fought on their respective sides both badly wounded and both brought together here after a separation of four years Each died for his cause SOME SAD CASES YET May thirty one James H Williams aged twenty one threed Virginia cavalry About as mark d a case of a strong man brought low by a complication of diseases laryngitis fever debility and diarrhoea as I have ever seen has superb physique remains swarthy yet and flushed and red with fever is altogether flighty flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous and pulse pounding away with treble quickness lies a good deal of the time in a partial sleep but with low muttering and groans a sleep in which there is no rest Powerful as he is and so young he will not be able to stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and to day His throat is in a bad way tongue and lips parch d When I ask him how he feels he is able just to articulate I feel pretty bad yet old man and looks at me with his great bright eyes Father John Williams Millensport Ohio June nine ten I have been sitting late to night by the bedside of a wounded captain a special friend of mine lying with a painful fracture of left leg in one of the hospitals in a large ward partially vacant The lights were put out all but a little candle far from where I sat The full moon shone in through the windows making long slanting silvery patches on the floor All was still my friend too was silent but could not sleep so I sat there by him slowly wafting the fan and occupied with the musings that arose out of the scene the long shadowy ward the beautiful ghostly moonlight on the floor the white beds here and there an occupant with huddled form the bed clothes thrown off The hospitals have a number of cases of sun stroke and exhaustion by heat from the late reviews There are many such from the Sixth corps from the hot parade of day before yesterday Some of these shows cost the lives of scores of men Sunday Sep ten Visited Douglas and Stanton hospitals They are quite full Many of the cases are bad ones lingering wounds and old sickness There is a more than usual look of despair on the countenances of many of the men hope has left them I went through the wards talking as usual There are several here from the confederate army whom I had seen in other hospitals and they recognized me Two were in a dying condition CALHOUN S REAL MONUMENT In one of the hospital tents for special cases as I sat to day tending a new amputation I heard a couple of neighboring soldiers talking to each other from their cots One down with fever but improving had come up belated from Charleston not long before The other was what we now call an old veteran i e he was a Connecticut youth probably of less than the age of twenty five years the four last of which he had spent in active service in the war in all parts of the country The two were chatting of one thing and another The fever soldier spoke of John C Calhoun s monument which he had seen and was describing it The veteran said I have seen Calhoun s monument That you saw is not the real monument But I have seen it It is the desolated ruined south nearly the whole generation of young men between seventeen and thirty destroyed or maim d all the old families used up the rich impoverish d the plantations cover d with weeds the slaves unloos d and become the masters and the name of southerner blacken d with every shame all that is Calhoun s real monument HOSPITALS CLOSING October three There are two army hospitals now remaining I went to the largest of these Douglas and spent the afternoon and evening There are many sad cases old wounds incurable sickness and some of the wounded from the March and April battles before Richmond Few realize how sharp and bloody those closing battles were Our men exposed themselves more than usual press d ahead without urging Then the southerners fought with extra desperation Both sides knew that with the successful chasing of the rebel cabal from Richmond and the occupation of that city by the national troops the game was up The dead and wounded were unusually many Of the wounded the last lingering driblets have been brought to hospital here I find many rebel wounded here and have been extra busy to day tending to the worst cases of them with the rest Oct Nov and Dec sixty five Sundays Every Sunday of these months visited Harewood hospital out in the woods pleasant and recluse some two and a half or three miles north of the capitol The situation is healthy with broken ground grassy slopes and patches of oak woods the trees large and fine It was one of the most extensive of the hospitals now reduced to four or five partially occupied wards the numerous others being vacant In November this became the last military hospital kept up by the government all the others being closed Cases of the worst and most incurable wounds obstinate illness and of poor fellows who have no homes to go to are found here Dec ten Sunday Again spending a good part of the day at Harewood I write this about an hour before sundown I have walk d out for a few minutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the hour and scene It is a glorious warm golden sunny still afternoon The only noise is from a crowd of cawing crows on some trees three hundred yards distant Clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all directions The oak leaves are thick under the bare trees and give a strong and delicious perfume Inside the wards everything is gloomy Death is there As I enter d I was confronted by it the first thing a corpse of a poor soldier just dead of typhoid fever The attendants had just straighten d the limbs put coppers on the eyes and were laying it out The roads A great recreation the past three years has been in taking long walks out from Washington five seven perhaps ten miles and back generally with my friend Peter Doyle who is as fond of it as I am Fine moonlight nights over the perfect military roads hard and smooth or Sundays we had these delightful walks never to be forgotten The roads connecting Washington and the numerous forts around the city made one useful result at any rate out of the war TYPICAL SOLDIERS Even the typical soldiers I have been personally intimate with it seems to me if I were to make a list of them it would be like a city directory Some few only have I mention d in the foregoing pages most are dead a few yet living There is Reuben Farwell of Michigan little Mitch Benton H Wilson color bearer one hundred and eighty fifth New York Wm Stansberry Manvill Winterstein Ohio Bethuel Smith captain Simms of fifty first New York kill d at Petersburgh mine explosion captain Sam Pooley and Lieut Fred McReady same reg t Also same reg t my brother George W Whitman in active service all through four years re enlisting twice was promoted step by step several times immediately after battles lieutenant captain major and lieut colonel was in the actions at Roanoke Newbern twod Bull Run Chantilly South Mountain Antietam Fredericksburgh Vicksburgh Jackson the bloody conflicts of the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania Cold Harbor and afterwards around Petersburgh at one of these latter was taken prisoner and pass d four or five months in secesh military prisons narrowly escaping with life from a severe fever from starvation and half nakedness in the winter What a history that fifty first New York had Went out early march d fought everywhere was in storms at sea nearly wreck d storm d forts tramp d hither and yon in Virginia night and day summer of sixty two afterwards Kentucky and Mississippi re enlisted was in all the engagements and campaigns as above I strengthen and comfort myself much with the certainty that the capacity for just such regiments hundreds thousands of them is inexhaustible in the United States and that there isn t a county nor a township in the republic nor a street in any city but could turn out and on occasion would turn out lots of just such typical soldiers whenever wanted CONVULSIVENESS As I have look d over the proof sheets of the preceding pages I have once or twice fear d that my diary would prove at best but a batch of convulsively written reminiscences Well be it so They are but parts of the actual distraction heat smoke and excitement of those times The war itself with the temper of society preceding it can indeed be best described by that very word convulsiveness THREE YEARS SUMM D UP During those three years in hospital camp or field I made over six hundred visits or tours and went as I estimate counting all among from eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick as sustainer of spirit and body in some degree in time of need These visits varied from an hour or two to all day or night for with dear or critical cases I generally watch d all night Sometimes I took up my quarters in the hospital and slept or watch d there several nights in succession Those three years I consider the greatest privilege and satisfaction with all their feverish excitements and physical deprivations and lamentable sights and of course the most profound lesson of my life I can say that in my ministerings I comprehended all whoever came in my way northern or southern and slighted none It arous d and brought out and decided undream d of depths of emotion It has given me my most fervent views of the true ensemble and extent of the States While I was with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from the New England States and from New York New Jersey and Pennsylvania and from Michigan Wisconsin Ohio Indiana Illinois and all the Western States I was with more or less from all the States North and South without exception I was with many from the border States especially from Maryland and Virginia and found during those lurid years eighteen sixty two sixty three far more Union southerners especially Tennesseans than is supposed I was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded and gave them always what I had and tried to cheer them the same as any I was among the army teamsters considerably and indeed always found myself drawn to them Among the black soldiers wounded or sick and in the contraband camps I also took my way whenever in their neighborhood and did what I could for them THE MILLION DEAD TOO SUMM D UP The dead in this war there they lie strewing the fields and woods and valleys and battle fields of the south Virginia the Peninsula Malvern hill and Fair Oaks the banks of the Chickahominy the terraces of Fredericksburgh Antietam bridge the grisly ravines of Manassas the bloody promenade of the Wilderness the varieties of the strayed dead the estimate of the War department is twenty five thousand national soldiers kill d in battle and never buried at all five thousand drown d fifteen thousand inhumed by strangers or on the march in haste in hitherto unfound localities two thousand graves cover d by sand and mud by Mississippi freshets three thousand carried away by caving in of banks c Gettysburgh the West Southwest Vicksburgh Chattanooga the trenches of Petersburgh the numberless battles camps hospitals everywhere the crop reap d by the mighty

its woes its degradations filthy torments excell d those prisons the dead the dead the dead our dead or South or North ours all all all all finally dear to me or East or West Atlantic coast or Mississippi valley somewhere they crawl d to die alone in bushes low gullies or on the sides of hills there in secluded spots their skeletons bleach d bones tufts of hair buttons fragments of clothing are occasionally found yet our young men once so handsome and so joyous taken from us the son from the mother the husband from the wife the dear friend from the dear friend the clusters of camp graves in Georgia the Carolinas and in Tennessee the single graves left in the woods or by the roadside hundreds thousands obliterated the corpses floated down the rivers and caught and lodged dozens scores floated down the upper Potomac after the cavalry engagements the pursuit of Lee following Gettysburgh some lie at the bottom of the sea the general million and the special cemeteries in almost all the States the infinite dead the land entire saturated perfumed with their impalpable ashes exhalation in Nature s chemistry distill d and shall be so forever in every future grain of wheat and ear of corn and every flower that grows and every breath we draw not only Northern dead leavening Southern soil thousands aye tens of thousands of Southerners crumble to day in Northern earth And everywhere among these countless graves everywhere in the many soldier Cemeteries of the Nation there are now I believe over seventy of them as at the time in the vast trenches the depositories of slain Northern and Southern after the great battles not only where the scathing trail passed those years but radiating since in all the peaceful quarters of the land we see and ages yet may see on monuments and gravestones singly or in masses to thousands or tens of thousands the significant word UNKNOWN In some of the cemeteries nearly all the dead are unknown At Salisbury N C for instance the known are only eighty five while the unknown are twelve thousand twenty seven and eleven thousand seven hundred of these are buried in trenches A national monument has been put up here by order of Congress to mark the spot but what visible material monument can ever fittingly commemorate that spot THE REAL WAR WILL NEVER GET IN THE BOOKS And so good bye to the war I know not how it may have been or may be to others to me the main interest I found and still on recollection find in the rank and file of the armies both sides and in those specimens amid the hospitals and even the dead on the field To me the points illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities of these States in the two or three millions of American young and middle aged men North and South embodied in those armies and especially the one third or one fourth of their number stricken by wounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest were of more significance even than the political interests involved As so much of a race depends on how it faces death and how it stands personal anguish and sickness As in the glints of emotions under emergencies and the indirect traits and asides in Plutarch we get far profounder clues to the antique world than all its more formal history Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors not the official surface courteousness of the Generals not the few great battles of the Secession war and it is best they should not the real war will never get in the books In the mushy influences of current times too the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten I have at night watch d by the side of a sick man in the hospital one who could not live many hours I have seen his eyes flash and burn as he raised himself and recurr d to the cruelties on his surrender d brother and mutilations of the corpse afterward See in the preceding pages the incident at Upperville the seventeen kill d as in the description were left there on the ground After they dropt dead no one touch d them all were made sure of however The carcasses were left for the citizens to bury or not as they chose Such was the war It was not a quadrille in a ball room Its interior history will not only never be written its practicality minutia of deeds and passions will never be even suggested The actual soldier of eighteen sixty two sixty five North and South with all his ways his incredible dauntlessness habits practices tastes language his fierce friendship his appetite rankness his superb strength and animality lawless gait and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp I say will never be written perhaps must not and should not be The preceding notes may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life and into those lurid interiors never to be fully convey d to the future The hospital part of the drama from sixty one to sixty five deserves indeed to be recorded Of that many threaded drama with its sudden and strange surprises its confounding of prophecies its moments of despair the dread of foreign interference the interminable campaigns the bloody battles the mighty and cumbrous and green armies the drafts and bounties the immense money expenditure like a heavy pouring constant rain with over the whole land the last three years of the struggle an unending universal mourning wail of women parents orphans the marrow of the tragedy concentrated in those Army Hospitals it seem d sometimes as if the whole interest of the land North and South was one vast central hospital and all the rest of the affair but flanges those forming the untold and unwritten history of the war infinitely greater like life s than the few scraps and distortions that are ever told or written Think how much and of importance will be how much civic and military has already been buried in the grave in eternal darkness AN INTERREGNUM PARAGRAPH Several years now elapse before I resume my diary I continued at Washington working in the Attorney General s department through sixty six and sixty seven and some time afterward In February seventy three I was stricken down by paralysis gave up my desk and migrated to Camden New Jersey where I lived during seventy four and seventy five quite unwell but after that began to grow better commenc d going for weeks at a time even for months down in the country to a charmingly recluse and rural spot along Timber creek twelve or thirteen miles from where it enters the Delaware river Domicil d at the farm house of my friends the Staffords near by I lived half the time along this creek and its adjacent fields and lanes And it is to my life here that I perhaps owe partial recovery a sort of second wind or semi renewal of the lease of life from the prostration of eighteen seventy four seventy five If the notes of that outdoor life could only prove as glowing to you reader dear as the experience itself was to me Doubtless in the course of the following the fact of invalidism will crop out I call myself a half Paralytic these days and reverently bless the Lord it is no worse between some of the lines but I get my share of fun and healthy hours and shall try to indicate them The trick is I find to tone your wants and tastes low down enough and make much of negatives and of mere daylight and the skies NEW THEMES ENTERED UPON eighteen seventy six seventy seven I find the woods in mid May and early June my best places for composition nine Seated on logs or stumps there or resting on rails nearly all the following memoranda have been jotted down Wherever I go indeed winter or summer city or country alone at home or traveling I must take notes the ruling passion strong in age and disablement and even the approach of but I must not say it yet Then underneath the following excerpta crossing the t s and dotting the i s of certain moderate movements of late years I am fain to fancy the foundations of quite a lesson learn d After you have exhausted what there is in business politics conviviality love and so on have found that none of these finally satisfy or permanently wear what remains Nature remains to bring out from their torpid recesses the affinities of a man or woman with the open air the trees fields the changes of seasons the sun by day and the stars of heaven by night We will begin from these convictions Literature flies so high and is so hotly spiced that our notes may seem hardly more than breaths of common air or draughts of water to drink But that is part of our lesson Dear soothing healthy restoration hours after three confining years of paralysis after the long strain of the war and its wounds and death Note nine Without apology for the abrupt change of field and atmosphere after what I have put in the preceding fifty or sixty pages temporary episodes thank heaven I restore my book to the bracing and buoyant equilibrium of concrete outdoor Nature the only permanent reliance for sanity of book or human life Who knows I have it in my fancy my ambition but the pages now ensuing may carry ray of sun or smell of grass or corn or call of bird or gleam of stars by night or snow flakes falling fresh and mystic to denizen of heated city house or tired workman or workwoman or may be in sick room or prison to serve as cooling breeze or Nature s aroma to some fever d mouth or latent pulse ENTERING A LONG FARM LANE As every man has his hobby liking mine is for a real farm lane fenced by old chestnut rails gray green with dabs of moss and lichen copious weeds and briers growing in spots athwart the heaps of stray pick d stones at the fence bases irregular paths worn between and horse and cow tracks all characteristic accompaniments marking and scenting the neighborhood in their seasons apple tree blossoms in forward April pigs poultry a field of August buckwheat and in another the long flapping tassels of maize and so to the pond the expansion of the creek the secluded beautiful with young and old trees and such recesses and vistas TO THE SPRING AND BROOK So still sauntering on to the spring under the willows musical as soft clinking glasses pouring a sizeable stream thick as my neck pure and clear out from its vent where the bank arches over like a great brown shaggy eyebrow or mouth roof gurgling gurgling ceaselessly meaning saying something of course if one could only translate it always gurgling there the whole year through never giving out oceans of mint blackberries in summer choice of light and shade just the place for my July sun baths and water baths too but mainly the inimitable soft sound gurgles of it as I sit there hot afternoons How they and all grow into me day after day everything in keeping the wild just palpable perfume and the dappled leaf shadows and all the natural medicinal elemental moral influences of the spot Babble on O brook with that utterance of thine I too will express what I have gather d in my days and progress native subterranean past and now thee Spin and wind thy way I with thee a little while at any rate As I haunt thee so often season by season thou knowest reckest not me yet why be so certain who can tell but I will learn from thee and dwell on thee receive copy print from thee AN EARLY SUMMER REVEILLE Away then to loosen to unstring the divine bow so tense so long Away from curtain carpet sofa book from society from city house street and modern improvements and luxuries away to the primitive winding aforementioned wooded creek with its untrimm d bushes and turfy banks away from ligatures tight boots buttons and the whole cast iron civilized life from entourage of artificial store machine studio office parlor from tailordom and fashion s clothes from any clothes perhaps for the nonce the summer heats advancing there in those watery shaded solitudes Away thou soul let me pick thee out singly reader dear and talk in perfect freedom negligently confidentially for one day and night at least returning to the naked source life of us all to the breast of the great silent savage all acceptive Mother Alas how many of us are so sodden how many have wander d so far away that return is almost impossible But to my jottings taking them as they come from the heap without particular selection There is little consecutiveness in dates They run any time within nearly five or six years Each was carelessly pencilled in the open air at the time and place The printers will learn this to some vexation perhaps as much of their copy is from those hastily written first notes BIRDS MIGRATING AT MIDNIGHT Did you ever chance to hear the midnight flight of birds passing through the air and darkness overhead in countless armies changing their early or late summer habitat It is something not to be forgotten A friend called me up just after twelve last night to mark the peculiar noise of unusually immense flocks migrating north rather late this year In the silence shadow and delicious odor of the hour the natural perfume belonging to the night alone I thought it rare music You could hear the characteristic motion once or twice the rush of mighty wings but often a velvety rustle long drawn out sometimes quite near with continual calls and chirps and some song notes It all lasted from twelve till after three Once in a while the species was plainly distinguishable I could make out the bobolink tanager Wilson s thrush white crown d sparrow and occasionally from high in the air came the notes of the plover BUMBLE BEES May month month of swarming singing mating birds the bumble bee month month of the flowering lilac and then my own birth month As I jot this paragraph I am out just after sunrise and down towards the creek The lights perfumes melodies the blue birds grass birds and robins in every direction the noisy vocal natural concert For undertones a neighboring wood pecker tapping his tree and the distant clarion of chanticleer Then the fresh earth smells the colors the delicate drabs and thin blues of the perspective The bright green of the grass has receiv d an added tinge from the last two days mildness and moisture How the sun silently mounts in the broad clear sky on his day s journey How the warm beams bathe all and come streaming kissingly and almost hot on my face A while since the croaking of the pond frogs and the first white of the dog wood blossoms Now the golden dandelions in endless profusion spotting the ground everywhere The white cherry and pear blows the wild violets with their blue eyes looking up and saluting my feet as I saunter the wood edge the rosy blush of budding apple trees the light clear emerald hue of the wheat fields the darker green of the rye a warm elasticity pervading the air the cedar bushes profusely deck d with their little brown apples the summer fully awakening the convocation of black birds garrulous flocks of them gathering on some tree and making the hour and place noisy as I sit near Later Nature marches in procession in sections like the corps of an army All have done much for me and still do But for the last two days it has been the great wild bee the humble bee or bumble as the children call him As I walk or hobble from the farm house down to the creek I traverse the before mention d lane fenced by old rails with many splits splinters breaks holes c the choice habitat of those crooning hairy insects Up and down and by and between these rails they swarm and dart and fly in countless myriads As I wend slowly along I am often accompanied with a moving cloud of them They play a leading part in my morning midday or sunset rambles and often dominate the landscape in a way I never before thought of fill the long lane not by scores or hundreds only but by thousands Large and vivacious and swift with wonderful momentum and a loud swelling perpetual hum varied now and then by something almost like a shriek they dart to and fro in rapid flashes chasing each other and little things as they are conveying to me a new and pronounc d sense of strength beauty vitality and movement Are they in their mating season or what is the meaning of this plenitude swiftness eagerness display As I walk d I thought I was follow d by a particular swarm but upon observation I saw that it was a rapid succession of changing swarms one after another As I write I am seated under a big wild cherry tree the warm day temper d by partial clouds and a fresh breeze neither too heavy nor light and here I sit long and long envelop d in the deep musical drone of these bees flitting balancing darting to and fro about me by hundreds big fellows with light yellow jackets great glistening swelling bodies stumpy heads and gauzy wings humming their perpetual rich mellow boom Is there not a hint in it for a musical composition of which it should be the back ground some bumble bee symphony How it all nourishes lulls me in the way most needed the open air the rye fields the apple orchards The last two days have been faultless in sun breeze temperature and everything never two more perfect days and I have enjoy d them wonderfully My health is somewhat better and my spirit at peace Yet the anniversary of the saddest loss and sorrow of my life is close at hand Another jotting another perfect day forenoon from seven to nine two hours envelop d in sound of bumble bees and bird music Down in the apple trees and in a neighboring cedar were three or four russet back d thrushes each singing his best and roulading in ways I never heard surpass d Two hours I abandon myself to hearing them and indolently absorbing the scene Almost every bird I notice has a special time in the year sometimes limited to a few days when it sings its best and now is the period of these russet backs Meanwhile up and down the lane the darting droning musical bumble bees A great swarm again for my entourage as I return home moving along with me as before As I write this two or three weeks later I am sitting near the brook under a tulip tree seventy feet high thick with the fresh verdure of its young maturity a beautiful object every branch every leaf perfect From top to bottom seeking the sweet juice in the blossoms it swarms with myriads of these wild bees whose loud and steady humming makes an undertone to the whole and to my mood and the hour All of which I will bring to a close by extracting the following verses from Henry A Beers s little volume As I lay yonder in tall grass A drunken bumble bee went past Delirious with honey toddy The golden sash about his body Scarce kept it in his swollen belly Distent with honeysuckle jelly Rose liquor and the sweet pea wine Had fill d his soul with song divine Deep had he drunk the warm night through His hairy thighs were wet with dew Full many an antic he had play d While the world went round through sleep and shade Oft had he lit with thirsty lip Some flower cup s nectar d sweets to sip When on smooth petals he would slip Or over tangled stamens trip And headlong in the pollen roll d Crawl out quite dusted o er with gold Or else his heavy feet would stumble Against some bud and down he d tumble Amongst the grass there lie and grumble In low soft bass poor maudlin bumble CEDAR APPLES As I journey d to day in a light wagon ten or twelve miles through the country nothing pleas d me more in their homely beauty and novelty I had either never seen the little things to such advantage or had never noticed them before than that peculiar fruit with its profuse clear yellow dangles of inch long silk or yarn in boundless profusion spotting the dark green cedar bushes contrasting well with their bronze tufts the flossy shreds covering the knobs all over like a shock of wild hair on elfin pates On my ramble afterward down by the creek I pluck d one from its bush and shall keep it These cedar apples last only a little while however and soon crumble and fade SUMMER SIGHTS AND INDOLENCIES June tenth As I write five one two P M here by the creek nothing can exceed the quiet splendor and freshness around me We had a heavy shower with brief thunder and lightning in the middle of the day and since overhead one of those not uncommon yet indescribable skies in quality not details or forms of limpid blue with rolling silver fringed clouds and a pure dazzling sun For underlay trees in fulness of tender foliage liquid reedy long drawn notes of birds based by the fretful mewing of a querulous cat bird and the pleasant chippering shriek of two kingfishers I have been watching the latter the last half hour on their regular evening frolic over and in the stream evidently a spree of the liveliest kind They pursue each other whirling and wheeling around with many a jocund downward dip splashing the spray in jets of diamonds and then off they swoop with slanting wings and graceful flight sometimes so near me I can plainly see their dark gray feather bodies and milk white necks SUNDOWN PERFUME QUAILNOTES THE HERMIT THRUSH June nineteenth four to six one two P M Sitting alone by the creek solitude here but the scene bright and vivid enough the sun shining and quite a fresh wind blowing some heavy showers last night the grass and trees looking their best the clare obscure of different greens shadows half shadows and the dappling glimpses of the water through recesses the wild flageolet note of a quail near by the just heard fretting of some hylas down there in the pond crows cawing in the distance a drove of young hogs rooting in soft ground near the oak under which I sit some come sniffing near me and then scamper away with grunts And still the clear notes of the quail the quiver of leaf shadows over the paper as I write the sky aloft with white clouds and the sun well declining to the west the swift darting of many sand swallows coming and going their holes in a neighboring marl bank the odor of the cedar and oak so palpable as evening approaches perfume color the bronze and gold of nearly ripen d wheat clover fields with honey scent the well up maize with long and rustling leaves the great patches of thriving potatoes dusky green fleck d all over with white blossoms the old warty venerable oak above me and ever mix d with the dual notes of the quail the soughing of the wind through some near by pines As I rise for return I linger long to a delicious song epilogue is it the hermit thrush from some bushy recess off there in the swamp repeated leisurely and pensively over and over again This to the circle gambols of the swallows flying by dozens in concentric rings in the last rays of sunset like flashes of some airy wheel A JULY AFTER NOON BY THE POND The fervent heat but so much more endurable in this pure air the white and pink pond blossoms with great heart shaped leaves the glassy waters of the creek the banks with dense bushery and the picturesque beeches and shade and turf the tremulous reedy call of some bird from recesses breaking the warm indolent half voluptuous silence an occasional wasp hornet honey bee or bumble they hover near my hands or face yet annoy me not nor I them as they appear to examine find nothing and away they go the vast space of the sky overhead so clear and the buzzard up there sailing his slow whirl in majestic spirals and discs just over the surface of the pond two large slate color d dragon flies with wings of lace circling and darting and occasionally balancing themselves quite still their wings quivering all the time are they not showing off for my amusement the pond itself with the sword shaped calamus the water snakes occasionally a flitting blackbird with red dabs on his shoulders as he darts slantingly by the sounds that bring out the solitude warmth light and shade the quawk of some pond duck the crickets and grasshoppers are mute in the noon heat but I hear the song of the first cicadas then at some distance the rattle and whirr of a reaping machine as the horses draw it on a rapid walk through a rye field on the opposite side of the creek what was the yellow or light brown bird large as a young hen with short neck and long stretch d legs I just saw in flapping and awkward flight over there through the trees the prevailing delicate yet palpable spicy grassy clovery perfume to my nostrils and over all encircling all to my sight and soul the free space of the sky transparent and blue and hovering there in the west a mass of white gray fleecy clouds the sailors call shoals of mackerel the sky with silver swirls like locks of toss d hair spreading expanding a vast voiceless formless simulacrum yet may be the most real reality and formulator of everything who knows LOCUSTS AND KATY DIDS Aug twenty two Reedy monotones of locust or sounds of katydid I hear the latter at night and the other both day and night I thought the morning and evening warble of birds delightful but I find I can listen to these strange insects with just as much pleasure A single locust is now heard near noon from a tree two hundred feet off as I write a long whirring continued quite loud noise graded in distinct whirls or swinging circles increasing in strength and rapidity up to a certain point and then a fluttering quietly tapering fall Each strain is continued from one to two minutes The locust song is very appropriate to the scene gushes has meaning is masculine is like some fine old wine not sweet but far better than sweet But the katydid how shall I describe its piquant utterances One sings from a willow tree just outside my open bedroom window twenty yards distant every clear night for a fortnight past has sooth d me to sleep I rode through a piece of woods for a hundred rods the other evening and heard the katydids by myriads very curious for once but I like better my single neighbor on the tree Let me say more about the song of the locust even to repetition a long chromatic tremulous crescendo like a brass disk whirling round and round emitting wave after wave of notes beginning with a certain moderate beat or measure rapidly increasing in speed and emphasis reaching a point of great energy and significance and then quickly and gracefully dropping down and out Not the melody of the singing bird far from it the common musician might think without melody but surely having to the finer ear a harmony of its own monotonous but what a swing there is in that brassy drone round and round cymballine or like the whirling of brass quoits THE LESSON OF A TREE Sept one I should not take either the biggest or the most picturesque tree to illustrate it Here is one of my favorites now before me a fine yellow poplar quite straight perhaps ninety feet high and four thick at the butt How strong vital enduring how dumbly eloquent What suggestions of imperturbability and being as against the human trait of mere seeming Then the qualities almost emotional palpably artistic heroic of a tree so innocent and harmless yet so savage It is yet says nothing How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity all weathers this gusty temper d little whiffet man that runs indoors at a mite of rain or snow Science or rather half way science scoffs at reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad and of trees speaking But if they don t they do as well as most speaking writing poetry sermons or rather they do a great deal better I should say indeed that those old dryad reminiscences are quite as true as any and profounder than most reminiscences we get Cut this out as the quack mediciners say and keep by you Go and sit in a grove or woods with one or more of those voiceless companions and read the foregoing and think One lesson from affiliating a tree perhaps the greatest moral lesson anyhow from earth rocks animals is that same lesson of inherency of what is without the least regard to what the looker on the critic supposes or says or whether he likes or dislikes What worse what more general malady pervades each and all of us our literature education attitude toward each other even toward ourselves than a morbid trouble about seems generally temporarily seems too and no trouble at all or hardly any about the sane slow growing perennial real parts of character books friendship marriage humanity s invisible foundations and hold together As the all basis the nerve the great sympathetic the plenum within

clear beams are now thrown in many new places on the quilted seam d bronze drab lower tree trunks shadow d except at this hour now flooding their young and old columnar ruggedness with strong light unfolding to my sense new amazing features of silent shaggy charm the solid bark the expression of harmless impassiveness with many a bulge and gnarl unreck d before In the revealings of such light such exceptional hour such mood one does not wonder at the old story fables indeed why fables of people falling into love sickness with trees seiz d extatic with the mystic realism of the resistless silent strength in them strength which after all is perhaps the last completest highest beauty Trees I am familiar with here Oaks many kinds one sturdy Willows old fellow vital green bushy Catalpas five feet thick at the butt I sit Persimmons under every day Mountain ash Cedars plenty Hickories Tulip trees Liriodendron is of Maples many kinds the magnolia family I have Locusts seen it in

exhaling aroma amid a grove the Albic druids might have chosen envelop d in the warmth and light of the noonday sun and swarms ten of flitting insects with the harsh cawing of many crows a hundred rods away here I sit in solitude absorbing enjoying all The corn stack d in its cone shaped stacks russet color d and sere a large field spotted thick with scarlet gold pumpkins an adjoining one of cabbages showing well in their green and pearl mottled by much light and shade melon patches with their bulging ovals and great silver streak d ruffled broad edged leaves and many an autumn sight and sound beside the distant scream of a flock of guinea hens and pour d over all the September breeze with pensive cadence through the tree tops Another Day The ground in all directions strew d with debris from a storm Timber creek as I slowly pace its banks has ebb d low and shows reaction from the turbulent swell of the late equinoctial As I look around I take account of stock weeds and shrubs knolls paths occasional stumps some with smooth d tops several I use as seats of rest from place to place and from one I am now jotting these lines frequent wild flowers little white star shaped things or the cardinal red of the lobelia or the cherry ball seeds of the perennial rose or the many threaded vines winding up and around trunks of trees Oct one two and three Down every day in the solitude of the creek A serene autumn sun and westerly breeze to day threed as I sit here the water surface prettily moving in wind ripples before me On a stout old beech at the edge decayed and slanting almost fallen to the stream yet with life and leaves in its mossy limbs a gray squirrel exploring runs up and down flirts his tail leaps to the ground sits on his haunches upright as he sees me a Darwinian hint and then races up the tree again Oct four Cloudy and coolish signs of incipient winter Yet pleasant here the leaves thick falling the ground brown with them already rich coloring yellows of all hues pale and dark green shades from lightest to richest red all set in and toned down by the prevailing brown of the earth and gray of the sky So winter is coming and I yet in my sickness I sit here amid all these fair sights and vital influences and abandon myself to that thought with its wandering trains of speculation Note ten There is a tulip poplar within sight of Woodstown which is twenty feet around three feet from the ground four feet across about eighteen feet up the trunk which is broken off about three or four feet higher up On the south side an arm has shot out from which rise two stems each to about ninety one or ninety two feet from the ground Twenty five or more years since the cavity in the butt was large enough for and nine men at one time ate dinner therein It is supposed twelve to fifteen men could now at one time stand within its trunk The severe winds of eighteen seventy seven and eighteen seventy eight did not seem to damage it and the two stems send out yearly many blossoms scenting the air immediately about it with their sweet perfume It is entirely unprotected by other trees on a hill Woodstown N J Register April fifteen seventy nine THE SKY DAYS AND NIGHTS HAPPINESS Oct twenty A clear crispy day dry and breezy air full of oxygen Out of the sane silent beauteous miracles that envelope and fuse me trees water grass sunlight and early frost the one I am looking at most to day is the sky It has that delicate transparent blue peculiar to autumn and the only clouds are little or larger white ones giving their still and spiritual motion to the great concave All through the earlier day say from seven to eleven it keeps a pure yet vivid blue But as noon approaches the color gets lighter quite gray for two or three hours then still paler for a spell till sun down which last I watch dazzling through the interstices of a knoll of big trees darts of fire and a gorgeous show of light yellow liver color and red with a vast silver glaze askant on the water the transparent shadows shafts sparkle and vivid colors beyond all the paintings ever made I don t know what or how but it seems to me mostly owing to these skies every now and then I think while I have of course seen them every day of my life I never really saw the skies before have had this autumn some wondrously contented hours may I not say perfectly happy ones As I have read Byron just before his death told a friend that he had known but three happy hours during his whole existence Then there is the old German legend of the king s bell to the same point While I was out there by the wood that beautiful sunset through the trees I thought of Byron s and the bell story and the notion started in me that I was having a happy hour Though perhaps my best moments I never jot down when they come I cannot afford to break the charm by inditing memoranda I just abandon myself to the mood and let it float on carrying me in its placid extasy What is happiness anyhow Is this one of its hours or the like of it so impalpable a mere breath an evanescent tinge I am not sure so let me give myself the benefit of the doubt Hast Thou pellucid in Thy azure depths medicine for case like mine Ah the physical shatter and troubled spirit of me the last three years And dost Thou subtly mystically now drip it through the air invisibly upon me Night of Oct twenty eight The heavens unusually transparent the stars out by myriads the great path of the Milky Way with its branch only seen of very clear nights Jupiter setting in the west looks like a huge hap hazard splash and has a little star for companion Clothed in his white garments Into the round and clear arena slowly entered the brahmin Holding a little child by the hand Like the moon with the planet Jupiter in a cloudless night sky Old Hindu Poem Early in November At its farther end the lane already described opens into a broad grassy upland field of over twenty acres slightly sloping to the south Here I am accustom d to walk for sky views and effects either morning or sundown To day from this field my soul is calm d and expanded beyond description the whole forenoon by the clear blue arching over all cloudless nothing particular only sky and daylight Their soothing accompaniments autumn leaves the cool dry air the faint aroma crows cawing in the distance two great buzzards wheeling gracefully and slowly far up there the occasional murmur of the wind sometimes quite gently then threatening through the trees a gang of farm laborers loading cornstalks in a field in sight and the patient horses waiting COLORS A CONTRAST Such a play of colors and lights different seasons different hours of the day the lines of the far horizon where the faint tinged edge of the landscape loses itself in the sky As I slowly hobble up the lane toward day close an incomparable sunset shooting in molten sapphire and gold shaft after shaft through the ranks of the long leaved corn between me and the west Another day The rich dark green of the tulip trees and the oaks the gray of the swamp willows the dull hues of the sycamores and black walnuts the emerald of the cedars after rain and the light yellow of the beeches NOVEMBER eight seventy six The forenoon leaden and cloudy not cold or wet but indicating both As I hobble down here and sit by the silent pond how different from the excitement amid which in the cities millions of people are now waiting news of yesterday s Presidential election or receiving and discussing the result in this secluded place uncared for unknown CROWS AND CROWS Nov fourteen As I sit here by the creek resting after my walk a warm languor bathes me from the sun No sound but a cawing of crows and no motion but their black flying figures from over head reflected in the mirror of the pond below Indeed a principal feature of the scene to day is these crows their incessant cawing far or near and their countless flocks and processions moving from place to place and at times almost darkening the air with their myriads As I sit a moment writing this by the bank I see the black clear cut reflection of them far below flying through the watery looking glass by ones twos or long strings All last night I heard the noises from their great roost in a neighboring wood A WINTER DAY ON THE SEA BEACH One bright December mid day lately I spent down on the New Jersey sea shore reaching it by a little more than an hour s railroad trip over the old Camden and Atlantic I had started betimes fortified by nice strong coffee and a good breakfast cook d by the hands I love my dear sister Lou s how much better it makes the victuals taste and then assimilate strengthen you perhaps make the whole day comfortable afterwards Five or six miles at the last our track enter d a broad region of salt grass meadows intersected by lagoons and cut up everywhere by watery runs The sedgy perfume delightful to my nostrils reminded me of the mash and south bay of my native island I could have journey d contentedly till night through these flat and odorous sea prairies From half past eleven till two I was nearly all the time along the beach or in sight of the ocean listening to its hoarse murmur and inhaling the bracing and welcome breezes First a rapid five mile drive over the hard sand our carriage wheels hardly made dents in it Then after dinner as there were nearly two hours to spare I walk d off in another direction hardly met or saw a person and taking possession of what appear d to have been the reception room of an old bath house range had a broad expanse of view all to myself quaint refreshing unimpeded a dry area of sedge and Indian grass immediately before and around me space simple unornamented space Distant vessels and the far off just visible trailing smoke of an inward bound steamer more plainly ships brigs schooners in sight most of them with every sail set to the firm and steady wind The attractions fascinations there are in sea and shore How one dwells on their simplicity even vacuity What is it in us arous d by those indirections and directions That spread of waves and gray white beach salt monotonous senseless such an entire absence of art books talk elegance so indescribably comforting even this winter day grim yet so delicate looking so spiritual striking emotional impalpable depths subtler than all the poems paintings music I have ever read seen heard Yet let me be fair perhaps it is because I have read those poems and heard that music SEA SHORE FANCIES Even as a boy I had the fancy the wish to write a piece perhaps a poem about the sea shore that suggesting dividing line contact junction the solid marrying the liquid that curious lurking something as doubtless every objective form finally becomes to the subjective spirit which means far more than its mere first sight grand as that is blending the real and ideal and each made portion of the other Hours days in my Long Island youth and early manhood I haunted the shores of Rockaway or Coney island or away east to the Hamptons or Montauk Once at the latter place by the old lighthouse nothing but sea tossings in sight in every direction as far as the eye could reach I remember well I felt that I must one day write a book expressing this liquid mystic theme Afterward I recollect how it came to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary attempt the sea shore should be an invisible influence a pervading gauge and tally for me in my composition Let me give a hint here to young writers I am not sure but I have unwittingly follow d out the same rule with other powers besides sea and shores avoiding them in the way of any dead set at poetizing them as too big for formal handling quite satisfied if I could indirectly show that we have met and fused even if only once but enough that we have really absorb d each other and understand each other There is a dream a picture that for years at intervals sometimes quite long ones but surely again in time has come noiselessly up before me and I really believe fiction as it is has enter d largely into my practical life certainly into my writings and shaped and color d them It is nothing more or less than a stretch of interminable white brown sand hard and smooth and broad with the ocean perpetually grandly rolling in upon it with slow measured sweep with rustle and hiss and foam and many a thump as of low bass drums This scene this picture I say has risen before me at times for years Sometimes I wake at night and can hear and see it plainly IN MEMORY OF THOMAS PAINE Spoken at Lincoln Hall Philadelphia Sunday Jan twenty eight seventy seven for one hundred and fortieth anniversary of T P s birthday Some thirty five years ago in New York city at Tammany hall of which place I was then a frequenter I happen d to become quite well acquainted with Thomas Paine s perhaps most intimate chum and certainly his later years very frequent companion a remarkably fine old man colonel Fellows who may yet be remember d by some stray relics of that period and spot If you will allow me I will first give a description of the Colonel himself He was tall of military bearing aged about seventy eight I should think hair white as snow clean shaved on the face dress d very neatly a tail coat of blue cloth with metal buttons buff vest pantaloons of drab color and his neck breast and wrists showing the whitest of linen Under all circumstances fine manners a good but not profuse talker his wits still fully about him balanced and live and undimm d as ever 
1754_140639_000014_000005	train-clean-360	He kept pretty fair health though so old 
none	none	For employment for he was poor he had a post as constable of some of the upper courts I used to think him very picturesque on the fringe of a crowd holding a tall staff with his erect form and his superb bare thick hair d closely cropt white head The judges and young lawyers with whom he was ever a favorite and the subject of respect used to call him Aristides It was the general opinion among them that if manly rectitude and the instincts of absolute justice remain d vital anywhere about New York City Hall or Tammany they were to be found in colonel Fellows He liked young men and enjoy d to leisurely talk with them over a social glass of toddy after his day s work he on these occasions never drank but one glass and it was at reiterated meetings of this kind in old Tammany s back parlor of those days that he told me much about Thomas Paine At one of our interviews he gave me a minute account of Paine s sickness and death In short from those talks I was and am satisfied that my old friend with his mark d advantages had mentally morally and emotionally gauged the author of Common Sense and besides giving me a good portrait of his appearance and manners had taken the true measure of his interior character Paine s practical demeanor and much of his theoretical belief was a mixture of the French and English schools of a century ago and the best of both Like most old fashion d people he drank a glass or two every day but was no tippler nor intemperate let alone being a drunkard He lived simply and economically but quite well was always cheery and courteous perhaps occasionally a little blunt having very positive opinions upon politics religion and so forth That he labor d well and wisely for the States in the trying period of their parturition and in the seeds of their character there seems to me no question I dare not say how much of what our Union is owning and enjoying to day its independence its ardent belief in and substantial practice of radical human rights and the severance of its government from all ecclesiastical and superstitious dominion I dare not say how much of all this is owing to Thomas Paine but I am inclined to think a good portion of it decidedly is But I was not going either into an analysis or eulogium of the man I wanted to carry you back a generation or two and give you by indirection a moment s glance and also to ventilate a very earnest and I believe authentic opinion nay conviction of that time the fruit of the interviews I have mention d and of questioning and cross questioning clench d by my best information since that Thomas Paine had a noble personality as exhibited in presence face voice dress manner and what may be call d his atmosphere and magnetism especially the later years of his life I am sure of it Of the foul and foolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his decease the absolute fact is that as he lived a good life after its kind he died calmly and philosophically as became him He served the embryo Union with most precious service a service that every man woman and child in our thirty eight States is to some extent receiving the benefit of to day and I for one here cheerfully reverently throw my pebble on the cairn of his memory As we all know the season demands or rather will it ever be out of season that America learn to better dwell on her choicest possession the legacy of her good and faithful men that she well preserve their fame if unquestion d or if need be that she fail not to dissipate what clouds have intruded on that fame and burnish it newer truer and brighter continually A TWO HOURS ICE SAIL Feb three seventy seven From four to six P M crossing the Delaware back again at my Camden home unable to make our landing through the ice our boat stanch and strong and skilfully piloted but old and sulky and poorly minding her helm Power so important in poetry and war is also first point of all in a winter steamboat with long stretches of ice packs to tackle For over two hours we bump d and beat about the invisible ebb sluggish but irresistible often carrying us long distances against our will In the first tinge of dusk as I look d around I thought there could not be presented a more chilling arctic grim extended depressing scene Everything was yet plainly visible for miles north and south ice ice ice mostly broken but some big cakes and no clear water in sight The shores piers surfaces roofs shipping mantled with snow A faint winter vapor hung a fitting accompaniment around and over the endless whitish spread and gave it just a tinge of steel and brown Feb six As I cross home in the six P M boat again the transparent shadows are filled everywhere with leisurely falling slightly slanting curiously sparse but very large flakes of snow On the shores near and far the glow of just lit gas clusters at intervals The ice sometimes in hummocks sometimes floating fields through which our boat goes crunching The light permeated by that peculiar evening haze right after sunset which sometimes renders quite distant objects so distinctly SPRING OVERTURES RECREATIONS Feb ten The first chirping almost singing of a bird to day Then I noticed a couple of honey bees spirting and humming about the open window in the sun Feb eleven In the soft rose and pale gold of the declining light this beautiful evening I heard the first hum and preparation of awakening spring very faint whether in the earth or roots or starting of insects I know not but it was audible as I lean d on a rail I am down in my country quarters awhile and look d long at the western horizon Turning to the east Sirius as the shadows deepen d came forth in dazzling splendor And great Orion and a little to the north east the big Dipper standing on end Feb twenty A solitary and pleasant sundown hour at the pond exercising arms chest my whole body by a tough oak sapling thick as my wrist twelve feet high pulling and pushing inspiring the good air After I wrestle with the tree awhile I can feel its young sap and virtue welling up out of the ground and tingling through me from crown to toe like health s wine Then for addition and variety I launch forth in my vocalism shout declamatory pieces sentiments sorrow anger c from the stock poets or plays or inflate my lungs and sing the wild tunes and refrains I heard of the blacks down south or patriotic songs I learn d in the army I make the echoes ring I tell you As the twilight fell in a pause of these ebullitions an owl somewhere the other side of the creek sounded too oo oo oo oo soft and pensive and I fancied a little sarcastic repeated four or five times Either to applaud the negro songs or perhaps an ironical comment on the sorrow anger or style of the stock poets ONE OF THE HUMAN KINKS How is it that in all the serenity and lonesomeness of solitude away off here amid the hush of the forest alone or as I have found in prairie wilds or mountain stillness one is never entirely without the instinct of looking around I never am and others tell me the same of themselves confidentially for somebody to appear or start up out of the earth or from behind some tree or rock Is it a lingering inherited remains of man s primitive wariness from the wild animals or from his savage ancestry far back It is not at all nervousness or fear Seems as if something unknown were possibly lurking in those bushes or solitary places Nay it is quite certain there is some vital unseen presence AN AFTERNOON SCENE Feb twenty two Last night and to day rainy and thick till mid afternoon when the wind chopp d round the clouds swiftly drew off like curtains the clear appear d and with it the fairest grandest most wondrous rainbow I ever saw all complete very vivid at its earth ends spreading vast effusions of illuminated haze violet yellow drab green in all directions overhead through which the sun beam d an indescribable utterance of color and light so gorgeous yet so soft such as I had never witness d before Then its continuance a full hour pass d before the last of those earth ends disappear d The sky behind was all spread in translucent blue with many little white clouds and edges To these a sunset filling dominating the esthetic and soul senses sumptuously tenderly full I end this note by the pond just light enough to see through the evening shadows the western reflections in its water mirror surface with inverted figures of trees I hear now and then the flup of a pike leaping out and rippling the water THE GATES OPENING April six Palpable spring indeed or the indications of it I am sitting in bright sunshine at the edge of the creek the surface just rippled by the wind All is solitude morning freshness negligence For companions my two kingfishers sailing winding darting dipping sometimes capriciously separate then flying together I hear their guttural twittering again and again for awhile nothing but that peculiar sound As noon approaches other birds warm up The reedy notes of the robin and a musical passage of two parts one a clear delicious gurgle with several other birds I cannot place To which is join d yes I just hear it one low purr at intervals from some impatient hylas at the pond edge The sibilant murmur of a pretty stiff breeze now and then through the trees Then a poor little dead leaf long frost bound whirls from somewhere up aloft in one wild escaped freedom spree in space and sunlight and then dashes down to the waters which hold it closely and soon drown it out of sight The bushes and trees are yet bare but the beeches have their wrinkled yellow leaves of last season s foliage largely left frequent cedars and pines yet green and the grass not without proofs of coming fullness And over all a wonderfully fine dome of clear blue the play of light coming and going and great fleeces of white clouds swimming so silently THE COMMON EARTH THE SOIL The soil too let others pen and ink the sea the air as I sometimes try but now I feel to choose the common soil for theme naught else The brown soil here just between winter close and opening spring and vegetation the rain shower at night and the fresh smell next morning the red worms wriggling out of the ground the dead leaves the incipient grass and the latent life underneath the effort to start something already in shelter d spots some little flowers the distant emerald show of winter wheat and the rye fields the yet naked trees with clear insterstices giving prospects hidden in summer the tough fallow and the plow team and the stout boy whistling to his horses for encouragement and there the dark fat earth in long slanting stripes upturn d BIRDS AND BIRDS AND BIRDS A little later bright weather An unusual melodiousness these days last of April and first of May from the blackbirds indeed all sorts of birds darting whistling hopping or perch d on trees Never before have I seen heard or been in the midst of and got so flooded and saturated with them and their performances as this current month Such oceans such successions of them Let me make a list of those I find here Black birds plenty Meadow larks plenty Ring doves Cat birds plenty Owls Cuckoos Woodpeckers Pond snipes plenty King birds Cheewinks Crows plenty Quawks Wrens Ground robins Kingfishers Ravens Quails Gray snipes Turkey buzzards Eagles Hen hawks High holes Yellow birds Herons

voluptuous dazzle unshown hitherto this summer Mars rises early and the red sulky moon two days past her full Jupiter at night s meridian and the long curling slanted Scorpion stretching full view in the south Aretus neck d Mars walks the heavens lord paramount now all through this month I go out after supper and watch for him sometimes getting up at midnight to take another look at his unparallel d lustre I see lately an astronomer has made out through the new Washington telescope that Mars has certainly one moon perhaps two Pale and distant but near in the heavens Saturn precedes him MULLEINS AND MULLEINS Large placid mulleins as summer advances velvety in texture of a light greenish drab color growing everywhere in the fields at first earth s big rosettes in their broad leav d low cluster plants eight ten twenty leaves to a plant plentiful on the fallow twenty acre lot at the end of the lane and especially by the ridge sides of the fences then close to the ground but soon springing up leaves as broad as my hand and the lower ones twice as long so fresh and dewy in the morning stalks now four or five even seven or eight feet high The farmers I find think the mullein a mean unworthy weed but I have grown to a fondness for it Every object has its lesson enclosing the suggestion of everything else and lately I sometimes think all is concentrated for me in these hardy yellow flower d weeds As I come down the lane early in the morning I pause before their soft wool like fleece and stem and broad leaves glittering with countless diamonds Annually for three summers now they and I have silently return d together at such long intervals I stand or sit among them musing and woven with the rest of so many hours and moods of partial rehabilitation of my sane or sick spirit here as near at peace as it can be DISTANT SOUNDS The axe of the wood cutter the measured thud of a single threshing flail the crowing of chanticleer in the barn yard with invariable responses from other barn yards and the lowing of cattle but most of all or far or near the wind through the high tree tops or through low bushes laving one s face and hands so gently this balmy bright noon the coolest for a long time Sept two I will not call it sighing for to me it is always a firm sane cheery expression through a monotone giving many varieties or swift or slow or dense or delicate The wind in the patch of pine woods off there how sibilant Or at sea I can imagine it this moment tossing the waves with spirits of foam flying far and the free whistle and the scent of the salt and that vast paradox somehow with all its action and restlessness conveying a sense of eternal rest Other adjuncts But the sun and the moon here and these times As never more wonderful by day the gorgeous orb imperial so vast so ardently lovingly hot so never a more glorious moon of nights especially the last three or four The great planets too Mars never before so flaming bright so flashing large with slight yellow tinge the astronomers say is it true nearer to us than any time the past century and well up lord Jupiter a little while since close by the moon and in the west after the sun sinks voluptuous Venus now languid and shorn of her beams as if from some divine excess A SUN BATH NAKEDNESS Sunday Aug twenty seven Another day quite free from mark d prostration and pain It seems indeed as if peace and nutriment from heaven subtly filter into me as I slowly hobble down these country lanes and across fields in the good air as I sit here in solitude with Nature open voiceless mystic far removed yet palpable eloquent Nature I merge myself in the scene in the perfect day Hovering over the clear brook water I am sooth d by its soft gurgle in one place and the hoarser murmurs of its three foot fall in another Come ye disconsolate in whom any latent eligibility is left come get the sure virtues of creek shore and wood and field Two months July and August seventy seven have I absorb d them and they begin to make a new man of me Every day seclusion every day at least two or three hours of freedom bathing no talk no bonds no dress no books no manners Shall I tell you reader to what I attribute my already much restored health That I have been almost two years off and on without drugs and medicines and daily in the open air Last summer I found a particularly secluded little dell off one side by my creek originally a large dug out marl pit now abandon d fill d with bushes trees grass a group of willows a straggling bank and a spring of delicious water running right through the middle of it with two or three little cascades Here I retreated every hot day and follow it up this summer Here I realize the meaning of that old fellow who said he was seldom less alone than when alone Never before did I get so close to Nature never before did she come so close to me By old habit I pencill d down from time to time almost automatically moods sights hours tints and outlines on the spot Let me specially record the satisfaction of this current forenoon so serene and primitive so conventionally exceptional natural An hour or so after breakfast I wended my way down to the recesses of the aforesaid dell which I and certain thrushes cat birds c had all to ourselves A light south west wind was blowing through the tree tops It was just the place and time for my Adamic air bath and flesh brushing from head to foot So hanging clothes on a rail near by keeping old broadbrim straw on head and easy shoes on feet havn t I had a good time the last two hours First with the stiff elastic bristles rasping arms breast sides till they turn d scarlet then partially bathing in the clear waters of the running brook taking everything very leisurely with many rests and pauses stepping about barefooted every few minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze for unctuous mud bath to my feet a brief second and third rinsing in the crystal running waters rubbing with the fragrant towel slow negligent promenades on the turf up and down in the sun varied with occasional rests and further frictions of the bristle brush sometimes carrying my portable chair with me from place to place as my range is quite extensive here nearly a hundred rods feeling quite secure from intrusion and that indeed I am not at all nervous about if it accidentally happens As I walk d slowly over the grass the sun shone out enough to show the shadow moving with me Somehow I seem d to get identity with each and every thing around me in its condition Nature was naked and I was also It was too lazy soothing and joyous equable to speculate about Yet I might have thought somehow in this vein Perhaps the inner never lost rapport we hold with earth light air trees c is not to be realized through eyes and mind only but through the whole corporeal body which I will not have blinded or bandaged any more than the eyes Sweet sane still Nakedness in Nature ah if poor sick prurient humanity in cities might really know you once more Is not nakedness then indecent No not inherently It is your thought your sophistication your tear your respectability that is indecent There come moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear but are themselves indecent Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free exhilarating extasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible and how many thousands there are has not really known what purity is nor what faith or art or health really is Probably the whole curriculum of first class philosophy beauty heroism form illustrated by the old Hellenic race the highest height and deepest depth known to civilization in those departments came from their natural and religious idea of Nakedness Many such hours from time to time the last two summers I attribute my partial rehabilitation largely to them Some good people may think it a feeble or half crack d way of spending one s time and thinking May be it is THE OAKS AND I Sept five seventy seven I write this eleven A M shelter d under a dense oak by the bank where I have taken refuge from a sudden rain I came down here we had sulky drizzles all the morning but an hour ago a lull for the before mention d daily and simple exercise I am fond of to pull on that young hickory sapling out there to sway and yield to its tough limber upright stem haply to get into my old sinews some of its elastic fibre and clear sap I stand on the turf and take these health pulls moderately and at intervals for nearly an hour inhaling great draughts of fresh air Wandering by the creek I have three or four naturally favorable spots where I rest besides a chair I lug with me and use for more deliberate occasions At other spots convenient I have selected besides the hickory just named strong and limber boughs of beech or holly in easy reaching distance for my natural gymnasia for arms chest trunk muscles I can soon feel the sap and sinew rising through me like mercury to heat I hold on boughs or slender trees caressingly there in the sun and shade wrestle with their innocent stalwartness and know the virtue thereof passes from them into me Or may be we interchange may be the trees are more aware of it all than I ever thought But now pleasantly imprison d here under the big oak the rain dripping and the sky cover d with leaden clouds nothing but the pond on one side and the other a spread of grass spotted with the milky blossoms of the wild carrot the sound of an axe wielded at some distant wood pile yet in this dull scene as most folks would call it why am I so almost happy here and alone Why would any intrusion even from people I like spoil the charm But am I alone Doubtless there comes a time perhaps it has come to me when one feels through his whole being and pronouncedly the emotional part that identity between himself subjectively and Nature objectively which Schelling and Fichte are so fond of pressing How it is I know not but I often realize a presence here in clear moods I am certain of it and neither chemistry nor reasoning nor esthetics will give the least explanation All the past two summers it has been strengthening and nourishing my sick body and soul as never before Thanks invisible physician for thy silent delicious medicine thy day and night thy waters and thy airs the banks the grass the trees and e en the weeds A QUINTETTE While I have been kept by the rain under the shelter of my great oak perfectly dry and comfortable to the rattle of the drops all around I have pencill d off the mood of the hour in a little quintette which I will give you At vacancy with Nature Acceptive and at ease Distilling the present hour Whatever wherever it is And over the past oblivion Can you get hold of it reader dear and how do you like it anyhow THE FIRST FROST MEMS Where I was stopping I saw the first palpable frost on my sunrise walk October six all over the yet green spread a light blue gray veil giving a new show to the entire landscape I had but little time to notice it for the sun rose cloudless and mellow warm and as I returned along the lane it had turn d to glittering patches of wet As I walk I notice the bursting pods of wild cotton Indian hemp they call it here with flossy silky contents and dark red brown seeds a startled rabbit I pull a handful of the balsamic life ever lasting and stuff it down in my trowsers pocket for scent THREE YOUNG MEN S DEATHS December twenty Somehow I got thinking to day of young men s deaths not at all sadly or sentimentally but gravely realistically perhaps a little artistically Let me give the following three cases from budgets of personal memoranda which I have been turning over alone in my room and resuming and dwelling on this rainy afternoon Who is there to whom the theme does not come home Then I don t know how it may be to others but to me not only is there nothing gloomy or depressing in such cases on the contrary as reminiscences I find them soothing bracing tonic ERASTUS HASKELL I just transcribe verbatim from a letter written by myself in one of the army hospitals sixteen years ago during the secession war Washington July twenty eight eighteen sixty three Dear M I am writing this in the hospital sitting by the side of a soldier I do not expect to last many hours His fate has been a hard one he seems to be only about nineteen or twenty Erastus Haskell company K one hundred and forty first N Y has been out about a year and sick or half sick more than half that time has been down on the peninsula was detail d to go in the band as fifer boy While sick the surgeon told him to keep up with the rest probably work d and march d too long He is a shy and seems to me a very sensible boy has fine manners never complains was sick down on the peninsula in an old storehouse typhoid fever The first week this July was brought up here journey very bad no accommodations no nourishment nothing but hard jolting and exposure enough to make a well man sick these fearful journeys do the job for many arrived here July eleventh a silent dark skinn d Spanish looking youth with large very dark blue eyes peculiar looking Doctor F here made light of his sickness said he would recover soon et cetera but I thought very different and told F so repeatedly I came near quarreling with him about it from the first but he laugh d and would not listen to me About four days ago I told Doctor he would in my opinion lose the boy without doubt but F again laugh d at me The next day he changed his opinion brought the head surgeon of the post he said the boy would probably die but they would make a hard fight for him The last two days he has been lying panting for breath a pitiful sight I have been with him some every day or night since he arrived He suffers a great deal with the heat says little or nothing is flighty the last three days at times knows me always however calls me Walter sometimes calls the name over and over and over again musingly abstractedly to himself His father lives at Breesport Chemung county N Y is a mechanic with large family is a steady religious man his mother too is living I have written to them and shall write again to day Erastus has not receiv d a word from home for months As I sit here writing to you M I wish you could see the whole scene This young man lies within reach of me flat on his back his hands clasp d across his breast his thick black hair cut close he is dozing breathing hard every breath a spasm it looks so cruel He is a noble youngster I consider him past all hope Often there is no one with him for a long while I am here as much as possible WILLIAM ALCOTT fireman Camden Nov eighteen seventy four Last Monday afternoon his widow mother relatives mates of the fire department and his other friends I was one only lately it is true but our love grew fast and close the days and nights of those eight weeks by the chair of rapid decline and the bed of death gather d to the funeral of this young man who had grown up and was well known here With nothing special perhaps to record I would give a word or two to his memory He seem d to me not an inappropriate specimen in character and elements of that bulk of the average good American race that ebbs and flows perennially beneath this scum of eructations on the surface Always very quiet in manner neat in person and dress good temper d punctual and industrious at his work till he could work no longer he just lived his steady square unobtrusive life in its own humble sphere doubtless unconscious of itself Though I think there were currents of emotion and intellect undevelop d beneath far deeper than his acquaintances ever suspected or than he himself ever did He was no talker His troubles when he had any he kept to himself As there was nothing querulous about him in life he made no complaints during his last sickness He was one of those persons that while his associates never thought of attributing any particular talent or grace to him yet all insensibly really liked Billy Alcott I too loved him At last after being with him quite a good deal after hours and days of panting for breath much of the time unconscious for though the consumption that had been lurking in his system once thoroughly started made rapid progress there was still great vitality in him and indeed for four or five days he lay dying before the close late on Wednesday night Nov fourth where we surrounded his bed in silence there came a lull a longer drawn breath a pause a faint sigh another a weaker breath another sigh a pause again and just a tremble and the face of the poor wasted young man he was just twenty six fell gently over in death on my hand on the pillow CHARLES CASWELL I extract the following verbatim from a letter to me dated September twenty nine from my friend John Burroughs at Esopus on Hudson New York State S was away when your picture came attending his sick brother Charles who has since died an event that has sadden d me much Charlie was younger than S and a most attractive young fellow He work d at my father s and had done so for two years He was about the best specimen of a young country farm hand I ever knew You would have loved him He was like one of your poems With his great strength his blond hair his cheerfulness and contentment his universal good will and his silent manly ways he was a youth hard to match He was murder d by an old doctor He had typhoid fever and the old fool bled him twice He lived to wear out the fever but had not strength to rally He was out of his head nearly all the time In the morning as he died in the afternoon S was standing over him when Charlie put up his arms around S s neck and pull d his face down and kiss d him S said he knew then the end was near S stuck to him day and night to the last When I was home in August Charlie was cradling on the hill and it was a picture to see him walk through the grain All work seem d play to him He had no vices any more than Nature has and was belov d by all who knew him I have written thus to you about him for such young men belong to you he was of your kind I wish you could have known him He had the sweetness of a child and the strength and courage and readiness of a young Viking His mother and father are poor they have a rough hard farm His mother works in the field with her husband when the work presses She has had twelve children FEBRUARY DAYS February seven eighteen seventy eight Glistening sun today with slight haze warm enough and yet tart as I sit here in the open air down in my country retreat under an old cedar For two hours I have been idly wandering around the woods and pond lugging my chair picking out choice spots to sit awhile then up and slowly on again All is peace here Of course none of the summer noises or vitality to day hardly even the winter ones I amuse myself by exercising my voice in recitations and in ringing the changes on all the vocal and alphabetical sounds Not even an echo only the cawing of a solitary crow flying at some distance The pond is one bright flat spread without a ripple a vast Claude Lorraine glass in which I study the sky the light the leafless trees and an occasional crow with flapping wings flying overhead The brown fields have a few white patches of snow left Feb nine After an hour s ramble now retreating resting sitting close by the pond in a warm nook writing this shelter d from the breeze just before noon The emotional aspects and influences of Nature I too like the rest feel these modern tendencies from all the prevailing intellections literature and poems to turn everything to pathos ennui morbidity dissatisfaction death Yet how clear it is to me that those are not the born results influences of Nature at all but of one s own distorted sick or silly soul Here amid this wild free scene how healthy how joyous how clean and vigorous and sweet Mid afternoon One of my nooks is south of the barn and here I am sitting now on a log still basking in the sun shielded from the wind Near me are the cattle feeding on corn stalks Occasionally a cow or the young bull how handsome and bold he is scratches and munches the far end of the log on which I sit The fresh milky odor is quite perceptible also the perfume of hay from the barn The perpetual rustle of dry corn stalks the low sough of the wind round the barn gables the grunting of pigs the distant whistle of a locomotive and occasional crowing of chanticleers are the sounds Feb nineteen Cold and sharp last night clear and not much wind the full moon shining and a fine spread of constellations and little and big stars Sirius very bright rising early preceded by many orb d Orion glittering vast sworded and chasing with his dog The earth hard frozen and a stiff glare of ice over the pond Attracted by the calm splendor of the night I attempted a short walk but was driven back by the cold Too severe for me also at nine o clock when I came out this morning so I turn d back again But now near noon I have walk d down the lane basking all the way in the sun this farm has a pleasant southerly exposure and here I am seated under the lee of a bank close by the water There are bluebirds already flying about and I hear much chirping and twittering and two or three real songs sustain d quite awhile in the mid day brilliance and warmth There that is a true carol coming out boldly and repeatedly as if the singer meant it Then as the noon strengthens the reedy trill of the robin to my ear the most cheering of bird notes At intervals like bars and breaks out of the low murmur that in any scene however quiet is never entirely absent to a delicate ear the occasional crunch and cracking of the ice glare congeal d over the creek as it gives way to the sunbeams sometimes with low sigh sometimes with indignant obstinate tug and snort Robert Burns says in one of his letters There is scarcely any earthly object gives me more I do not know if I should call it pleasure but something which exalts me something which enraptures me than to walk in the shelter d side of a wood in a cloudy winter day and hear the stormy wind howling among the trees and raving over the plain It is my best season of devotion Some of his most characteristic poems were composed in such scenes and seasons A MEADOW LARK March sixteen Fine clear dazzling morning the sun an hour high the air just tart enough What a stamp in advance my whole day receives from the song of that meadow lark perch d on a fence stake twenty rods distant Two or three liquid simple notes repeated at intervals full of careless happiness and hope With its peculiar shimmering slow progress and rapid noiseless action of the wings it flies on a way lights on another stake and so on to another shimmering and singing many minutes SUNDOWN LIGHTS May six five P M This is the hour for strange effects in light and shade enough to make a colorist go delirious long spokes of molten silver sent horizontally through the trees now in their brightest tenderest green each leaf and branch of endless foliage a lit up miracle then lying all prone on the youthful ripe interminable grass and giving the blades not only aggregate but individual splendor in ways unknown to any other hour I have particular spots where I get these effects in their perfection One broad splash lies on the water with many a rippling twinkle offset by the rapidly deepening black green murky transparent shadows behind and at intervals all along the banks These with great shafts of horizontal fire thrown among the trees and along the grass as the sun lowers give effects more and more peculiar more and more superb unearthly rich and dazzling THOUGHTS UNDER AN OAK A DREAM June two This is the fourth day of a dark northeast storm wind and rain Day before yesterday was my birthday I have now enter d on my sixtieth year Every day of the storm protected by overshoes and a waterproof blanket I regularly come down to the pond and ensconce myself under the lee of the great oak I am here now writing these lines The dark smoke color d clouds roll in furious silence athwart the sky the soft green leaves dangle all around me the wind steadily keeps up its hoarse soothing music over my head Nature s mighty whisper Seated here in solitude I have been musing over my life connecting events dates as links of a chain neither sadly nor cheerily but somehow to day here under the oak in the rain in an unusually matter of fact spirit But my great oak sturdy vital green five feet thick at the butt I sit a great deal near or under him Then the tulip tree near by the Apollo of the woods tall and graceful yet robust and sinewy inimitable in hang of foliage and throwing out of limb as if the beauteous vital leafy creature could walk if it only would I had a sort of dream trance the other day in which I saw my favorite trees step out and promenade up down and around very curiously with a whisper from one leaning down as he pass d me We do all this on the present occasion exceptionally just for you CLOVER AND HAY PERFUME July threed fourth fifth Clear hot favorable weather has been a good summer the growth of clover and grass now generally mow d The familiar delicious perfume fills the barns and lanes As you go along you see the fields of grayish white slightly tinged with yellow the loosely stack d grain the slow moving wagons passing and farmers in the fields with stout boys pitching and loading the sheaves The corn is about beginning to tassel All over the middle and southern states the spear shaped battalia multitudinous curving flaunting long glossy dark green plumes for the great horseman earth I hear the cheery notes of my old acquaintance Tommy quail but too late for the whip poor will though I heard one solitary lingerer night before last I watch the broad majestic flight of a turkey buzzard sometimes high up sometimes low enough to see the lines of his form even his spread quills in relief against the sky Once or twice lately I have seen an eagle here at early candle light flying low AN UNKNOWN June fifteen To day I noticed a new large bird size of a nearly grown hen a haughty white bodied dark wing d hawk I suppose a hawk from his bill and general look only he had a clear loud quite musical sort of bell like call which he repeated again and again at intervals from a lofty dead tree top overhanging the water Sat there a long time and I on the opposite bank watching him Then he darted down skimming pretty close to the stream rose slowly a magnificent sight and sail d with steady wide spread wings no flapping at all up and down the pond two or three times near me in circles in clear sight as if for my delectation Once he came quite close over my head I saw plainly his hook d bill and hard restless eyes BIRD WHISTLING How much music wild simple savage doubtless but so tart sweet there is in mere whistling It is four fifths of the utterance of birds There are all sorts and styles For the last half hour now while I have been sitting here some feather d fellow away off in the bushes has been repeating over and over again what I may call a kind of throbbing whistle And now a bird about the robin size has just appear d all mulberry red flitting among the bushes head wings body deep red not very bright no song as I have heard four o clock There is a real concert going on around me a dozen different birds pitching in with a will There have been occasional rains and the growths all show its vivifying influences As I finish this seated on a log close by the pond edge much chirping and trilling in the distance and a feather d recluse in the woods near by is singing deliciously not many notes but full of music of almost human sympathy continuing for a long long while HORSE MINT Aug twenty two Not a human being and hardly the evidence of one in sight After my brief semi daily bath I sit here for a bit the brook musically brawling to the chromatic tones of a fretful cat bird somewhere off in the bushes On my walk hither two hours since through fields and the old lane I stopt to view now the sky now the mile off woods on the hill and now the apple orchards What a contrast from New York s or Philadelphia s streets Everywhere great patches of dingy blossom d horse mint wafting a spicy odor through the air especially evenings Everywhere the flowering boneset and the rose bloom of the wild bean THREE OF US July fourteen My two kingfishers still haunt the pond In the bright sun and breeze and perfect temperature of to day noon I am sitting here by one of the gurgling brooks dipping a French water pen in the limpid crystal and using it to write these lines again watching the feather d twain as they fly and sport athwart the water so close almost touching into its surface Indeed there seem to be three of us For nearly an hour I indolently look and join them while they dart and turn and take their airy gambols sometimes far up the creek disappearing for a few moments and then surely returning again and performing most of their flight within sight of me as if they knew I appreciated and absorb d their vitality spirituality faithfulness and the rapid vanishing delicate lines of moving yet quiet electricity they draw for me across the spread of the grass the trees and the blue sky While the brook babbles babbles and the shadows of the boughs dapple in the sunshine around me and the cool west by nor west wind faintly soughs in the thick bushes and tree tops Among the objects of beauty and interest now beginning to appear quite plentifully in this secluded spot I notice the humming bird the dragon fly with its wings of slate color d guaze and many varieties of beautiful and plain butterflies idly flapping among the plants and wild posies The mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves to a tall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high now studded with knobs of golden blossoms The milk weed I see a great gorgeous creature of gamboge and black lighting on one as I write is in flower with its delicate red fringe and there are profuse clusters of a feathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems I see lots of these and much else in every direction as I saunter or sit For the last half hour a bird has persistently kept up a simple sweet melodious song from the bushes I have a positive conviction that some of these birds sing and others fly and flirt about here for my special benefit DEATH OF WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT New York City Came on from West Philadelphia June thirteen in the two P M train to Jersey City and so across and to my friends mister and missus J H J and their large house large family and large hearts amid which I feel at home at peace away up on Fifth avenue near Eighty sixth street quiet breezy overlooking the dense woody fringe of the park plenty of space and sky birds chirping and air comparatively fresh and odorless Two hours before starting saw the announcement of William Cullen Bryant s funeral and felt a strong desire to attend I had known mister Bryant over thirty years ago and he had been markedly kind to me Off and on along that time for years as they pass d we met and chatted together I thought him very sociable in his way and a man to become attach d to We were both walkers and when I work d in Brooklyn he several times came over middle of afternoons and we took rambles miles long till dark out towards Bedford or Flatbush in company On these occasions he gave me clear accounts of scenes in Europe the cities looks architecture art especially Italy where he had travel d a good deal June fourteen The Funeral And so the good stainless noble old citizen and poet lies in the closed coffin there and this is his funeral A solemn impressive simple scene to spirit and senses The remarkable gathering of gray heads celebrities the finely render d anthem and other music the church dim even now at approaching noon in its light from the mellow stain d windows the pronounc d eulogy on the bard who loved Nature so fondly and sung so well her shows and seasons ending with these appropriate well known lines I gazed upon the glorious sky And the green mountains round And thought that when I came to lie At rest within the ground Twere pleasant that in flowery June When brooks send up a joyous tune And groves a cheerful sound The sexton s hand my grave to make The rich green mountain turf should break JAUNT UP THE HUDSON June twentieth On the Mary Powell enjoy d everything beyond precedent The delicious tender summer day just warm enough the constantly changing but ever beautiful panorama on both sides of the river went up near a hundred miles the high straight walls of the stony Palisades beautiful Yonkers and beautiful Irvington the never ending hills mostly in rounded lines swathed with verdure the distant turns like great shoulders in blue veils the frequent gray and brown of the tall rising rocks the river itself now narrowing now expanding the white sails of the many sloops yachts c some near some in the distance the rapid succession of handsome villages and cities our boat is a swift traveler and makes few stops the Race picturesque West Point and indeed all along the costly and often turreted mansions forever showing in some cheery light color through the woods make up the scene HAPPINESS AND RASPBERRIES June twenty one Here I am on the west bank of the Hudson eighty miles north of New York near Esopus at the handsome roomy honeysuckle and rose enbower d cottage of John Burroughs The place the perfect June days and nights leaning toward crisp and cool the hospitality of J and missus B the air the fruit especially my favorite dish currants and raspberries mixed sugar d fresh and ripe from the bushes I pick em myself the room I occupy at night the perfect bed the window giving an ample view of the Hudson and the opposite shores so wonderful toward sunset and the rolling music of the RR trains far over there the peaceful rest the early Venus heralded dawn the noiseless splash of sunrise the light and warmth indescribably glorious in which soon as the sun is well up I have a capital rubbing and rasping with the flesh brush with an extra scour on the back by Al J who is here with us all inspiriting my invalid frame with new life for the day Then after some whiffs of morning air the delicious coffee of missus B with the cream strawberries and many substantials for breakfast A SPECIMEN TRAMP FAMILY June twenty two This afternoon we went out J B Al and I on quite a drive around the country The scenery the perpetual stone fences some venerable old fellows dark spotted with lichens the many fine locust trees the runs of brawling water often over descents of rock these and lots else It is lucky the roads are first rate here as they are for it is up or down hill everywhere and sometimes steep enough B has a tip top horse strong young and both gentle and fast There is a great deal of waste land and hills on the river edge of Ulster county with a wonderful luxuriance of wild flowers and bushes and it seems to me I never saw more vitality of trees eloquent hemlocks plenty of locusts and fine maples and the balm of Gilead giving out aroma In the fields and along the road sides unusual crops of the tall stemm d wild daisy white as milk and yellow as gold We pass d quite a number of tramps singly or in couples one squad a family in a rickety one horse wagon with some baskets evidently their work and trade the man seated on a low board in front driving the gauntish woman by his side with a baby well bundled in her arms its little red feet and lower legs sticking out right towards us as we pass d and in the wagon behind we saw two or three crouching little children It was a queer taking rather sad picture If I had been alone and on foot I should have stopp d and held confab But on our return nearly two hours afterward we found them a ways further along the same road in a lonesome open spot haul d aside unhitch d and evidently going to camp for the night The freed horse was not far off quietly cropping the grass The man was busy at the wagon the boy had gather d some dry wood and was making a fire and as we went a little further we met the woman afoot I could not see her face in its great sun bonnet but somehow her figure and gait told misery terror destitution She had the rag bundled half starv d infant still in her arms and in her hands held two or three baskets which she had evidently taken to the next house for sale A little barefoot five year old girl child with fine eyes trotted behind her clutching her gown We stopp d asking about the baskets which we bought As we paid the money she kept her face hidden in the recesses of her bonnet Then as we started and stopp d again Al whose sympathies were evidently arous d went back to the camping group to get another basket He caught a look of her face and talk d with her a little Eyes voice and manner were those of a corpse animated by electricity She was quite young the man she was traveling with middle aged Poor woman what story was it out of her fortunes to account for that inexpressibly scared way those glassy eyes and that hollow voice MANHATTAN FROM THE BAY June twenty five Returned to New York last night Out to day on the waters for a sail in the wide bay southeast of Staten island a rough tossing ride and a free sight the long stretch of Sandy Hook the highlands of Navesink and the many vessels outward and inward bound We came up through the midst of all in the full sun I especially enjoy d the last hour or two A moderate sea breeze had set in yet over the city and the waters adjacent was a thin haze concealing nothing only adding to the beauty From my point of view as I write amid the soft breeze with a sea temperature surely nothing on earth of its kind can go beyond this show To the left the North river with its far vista nearer three or four war ships anchor d peacefully the Jersey side the banks of Weehawken the Palisades and the gradually receding blue lost in the distance to the right the East river the mast hemm d shores the grand obelisk like towers of the bridge one on either side in haze yet plainly defin d giant brothers twain throwing free graceful interlinking loops high across the tumbled tumultuous current below the tide is just changing to its ebb the broad water spread everywhere crowded no not crowded but thick as stars in the sky with all sorts and sizes of sail and steam vessels plying ferry boats arriving and departing coasters great ocean Dons iron black modern magnificent in size and power fill d with their incalculable value of human life and precious merchandise with here and there above all those daring careening things of grace and wonder those white and shaded swift darting fish birds I wonder if shore or sea elsewhere can outvie them ever with their slanting spars and fierce pure hawk like beauty and motion first class New York sloop or schooner yachts sailing this fine day the free sea in a good wind And rising out of the midst tall topt ship hemm d modern American yet strangely oriental V shaped Manhattan with its compact mass its spires its cloud touching edifices group d at the centre the green of the trees and all the white brown and gray of the architecture well blended as I see it under a miracle of limpid sky delicious light of heaven above and June haze on the surface below HUMAN AND HEROIC NEW YORK The general subjective view of New York and Brooklyn will not the time hasten when the two shall be municipally united in one and named Manhattan what I may call the human interior and exterior of these great seething oceanic populations as I get it in this visit is to me best of all After an absence of many years I went away at the outbreak of the secession war and have never been back to stay since again I resume with curiosity the crowds the streets I knew so well Broadway the ferries the west side of the city democratic Bowery human appearances and manners as seen in all these and along the wharves and in the perpetual travel of the horse cars or the crowded excursion steamers or in Wall and Nassau streets by day in the places of amusement at night bubbling and whirling and moving like its own environment of waters endless humanity in all phases Brooklyn also taken in for the last three weeks No need to specify minutely enough to say that making all allowances for the shadows and side streaks of a million headed city the brief total of the impressions the human qualities of these vast cities is to me comforting even heroic beyond statement Alertness generally fine physique clear eyes that look straight at you a singular combination of reticence and self possession with good nature and friendliness a prevailing range of according manners taste and intellect surely beyond any elsewhere upon earth and a palpable outcropping of that personal comradeship I look forward to as the subtlest strongest future hold of this many item d Union are not only constantly visible here in these mighty channels of men but they form the rule and average To day I should say defiant of cynics and pessimists and with a full knowledge of all their exceptions an appreciative and perceptive study of the current humanity of New York gives the directest proof yet of successful Democracy and of the solution of that paradox the eligibility of the free and fully developed individual with the paramount aggregate In old age lame and sick pondering for years on many a doubt and danger for this republic of ours fully aware of all that can be said on the other side I find in this visit to New York and the daily contact and rapport with its myriad people on the scale of the oceans and tides the best most effective medicine my soul has yet partaken the grandest physical habitat and surroundings of land and water the globe affords namely Manhattan island and Brooklyn which the future shall join in one city city of superb democracy amid superb surroundings HOURS FOR THE SOUL July twenty twod eighteen seventy eight Living down in the country again A wonderful conjunction of all that goes to make those sometime miracle hours after sunset so near and yet so far Perfect or nearly perfect days I notice are not so very uncommon but the combinations that make perfect nights are few even in a life time We have one of those perfections to night Sunset left things pretty clear the larger stars were visible soon as the shades allow d A while after eight three or four great black clouds suddenly rose seemingly from different points and sweeping with broad swirls of wind but no thunder underspread the orbs from view everywhere and indicated a violent heatstorm But without storm clouds blackness and all sped and vanish d as suddenly as they had risen and from a little after nine till eleven the atmosphere and the whole show above were in that state of exceptional clearness and glory just alluded to In the northwest turned the Great Dipper with its pointers round the Cynosure A little south of east the constellation of the Scorpion was fully up with red Antares glowing in its neck while dominating majestic Jupiter swam an hour and a half risen in the east no moon till after eleven A large part of the sky seem d just laid in great splashes of phosphorus You could look deeper in farther through than usual the orbs thick as heads of wheat in a field Not that there was any special brilliancy either nothing near as sharp as I have seen of keen winter nights but a curious general luminousness throughout to sight sense and soul The latter had much to do with it I am convinced there are hours of Nature especially of the atmosphere mornings and evenings address d to the soul Night transcends for that purpose what the proudest day can do Now indeed if never before the heavens declared the glory of God It was to the full sky of the Bible of Arabia of the prophets and of the oldest poems There in abstraction and stillness I had gone off by myself to absorb the scene to have the spell unbroken the copiousness the removedness vitality loose clear crowdedness of that stellar concave spreading overhead softly absorb d into me rising so free interminably high stretching east west north south and I though but a point in the centre below embodying all As if for the first time indeed creation noiselessly sank into and through me its placid and untellable lesson beyond O so infinitely beyond anything from art books sermons or from science old or new The spirit s hour religion s hour the visible suggestion of God in space and time now once definitely indicated if never again The untold pointed at the heavens all paved with it The Milky Way as if some superhuman symphony some ode of universal vagueness disdaining syllable and sound a flashing glance of Deity address d to the soul All silently the indescribable night and stars far off and silently THE DAWN July twenty three This morning between one and two hours before sunrise a spectacle wrought on the same background yet of quite different beauty and meaning The moon well up in the heavens and past her half is shining brightly the air and sky of that cynical clear Minerva like quality virgin cool not the weight of sentiment or mystery or passion s ecstasy indefinable not the religious sense the varied All distill d and sublimated into one of the night just described Every star now clear cut showing for just what it is there in the colorless ether The character of the heralded morning ineffably sweet and fresh and limpid but for the esthetic sense alone and for purity without sentiment I have itemized the night but dare I attempt the cloudless dawn What subtle tie is this between one s soul and the break of day Alike and yet no two nights or morning shows ever exactly alike Preceded by an immense star almost unearthly in its effusion of white splendor with two or three long unequal spoke rays of diamond radiance shedding down through the fresh morning air below an hour of this and then the sunrise THE EAST What a subject for a poem Indeed where else a more pregnant more splendid one Where one more idealistic real more subtle more sensuous delicate The East answering all lands all ages peoples touching all senses here immediate now and yet so indescribably far off such retrospect The East long stretching so losing itself the orient the gardens of Asia the womb of history and song forth issuing all those strange dim cavalcades Florid with blood pensive rapt with musings hot with passion Sultry with perfume with ample and flowing garment With sunburnt visage intense soul and glittering eyes Always the East old how incalculably old And yet here the same ours yet fresh as a rose to every morning every life to day and always will be Sept seventeen Another presentation same theme just before sunrise again a favorite hour with me The clear gray sky a faint glow in the dull liver color of the east the cool fresh odor and the moisture the cattle and horses off there grazing in the fields the star Venus again two hours high For sounds the chirping of crickets in the grass the clarion of chanticleer and the distant cawing of an early crow Quietly over the dense fringe of cedars and pines rises that dazzling red transparent disk of flame and the low sheets of white vapor roll and roll into dissolution THE MOON May eighteen I went to bed early last night but found myself waked shortly after twelve and turning awhile sleepless and mentally feverish I rose dress d myself sallied forth and walk d down the lane The full moon some three or four hours up a sprinkle of light and less light clouds just lazily moving Jupiter an hour high in the east and here and there throughout the heavens a random star appearing and disappearing So beautifully veiled and varied the air with that early summer perfume not at all damp or raw at times Luna languidly emerging in richest brightness for minutes and then partially envelop d again Far off a poor whip poor will plied his notes incessantly It was that silent time between one and three The rare nocturnal scene how soon it sooth d and pacified me Is there not something about the moon some relation or reminder which no poem or literature has yet caught In very old and primitive ballads I have come across lines or asides that suggest it After a while the clouds mostly clear d and as the moon swam on she carried shimmering and shifting delicate color effects of pellucid green and tawny vapor Let me conclude this part with an extract some writer in the Tribune May sixteen eighteen seventy eight No one ever gets tired of the moon Goddess that she is by dower of her eternal beauty she is a true woman by her tact knows the charm of being seldom seen of coming by surprise and staying but a little while never wears the same dress two nights running nor all night the same way commends herself to the matter of fact people by her usefulness and makes her uselessness adored by poets artists and all lovers in all lands lends herself to every symbolism and to every emblem is Diana s bow and Venus s mirror and Mary s throne is a sickle a scarf an eyebrow his face or her face and look d at by her or by him is the madman s hell the poet s heaven the baby s toy the philosopher s study and while her admirers follow her footsteps and hang on her lovely looks she knows how to keep her woman s secret her other side unguess d and unguessable Furthermore February nineteen eighteen eighty Just before ten P M cold and entirely clear again the show overhead bearing southwest of wonderful and crowded magnificence The moon in her third quarter the clusters of the Hyades and Pleiades with the planet Mars between in full crossing sprawl in the sky the great Egyptian X Sirius Procyon and the main stars in the constellations of the Ship the Dove and of Orion just north of east Bootes and in his knee Arcturus an hour high mounting the heaven ambitiously large and sparkling as if he meant to challenge with Sirius the stellar supremacy With the sentiment of the stars and moon such nights I get all the free margins and indefiniteness of music or poetry fused in geometry s utmost exactness STRAW COLOR D AND OTHER PSYCHES Aug four A pretty sight Where I sit in the shade a warm day the sun shining from cloudless skies the forenoon well advanc d I look over a ten acre field of luxuriant clover hay the second crop the livid ripe red blossoms and dabs of August brown thickly spotting the prevailing dark green Over all flutter myriads of light yellow butterflies mostly skimming along the surface dipping and oscillating giving a curious animation to the scene The beautiful spiritual insects straw color d Psyches Occasionally one of them leaves his mates and mounts perhaps spirally perhaps in a straight line in the air fluttering up up till literally out of sight In the lane as I came along just now I noticed one spot ten feet square or so where more than a hundred had collected holding a revel a gyration dance or butterfly good time winding and circling down and across but always keeping within the limits The little creatures have come out all of a sudden the last few days and are now very plentiful As I sit outdoors or walk I hardly look around without somewhere seeing two always two fluttering through the air in amorous dalliance Then their inimitable color their fragility peculiar motion and that strange frequent way of one leaving the crowd and mounting up up in the free ether and apparently never returning As I look over the field these yellow wings everywhere mildly sparkling many snowy blossoms of the wild carrot gracefully bending on their tall and taper stems while for sounds the distant guttural screech of a flock of guinea hens comes shrilly yet somehow musically to my ears And now a faint growl of heat thunder in the north and ever the low rising and falling wind purr from the tops of the maples and willows Aug twenty Butterflies and butterflies taking the place of the bumble bees of three months since who have quite disappear d continue to flit to and fro all sorts white yellow brown purple now and then some gorgeous fellow flashing lazily by on wings like artists palettes dabb d with every color Over the breast of the pond I notice many white ones crossing pursuing their idle capricious flight Near where I sit grows a tall stemm d weed topt with a profusion of rich scarlet blossoms on which the snowy insects alight and dally sometimes four or five of them at a time By and by a humming bird visits the same and I watch him coming and going daintily balancing and shimmering about These white butterflies give new beautiful contrasts to the pure greens of the August foliage we have had some copious rains lately and over the glistening bronze of the pond surface You can tame even such insects I have one big and handsome moth down here knows and comes to me likes me to hold him up on my extended hand Another Day later A grand twelve acre field of ripe cabbages with their prevailing hue of malachite green and floating flying over and among them in all directions myriads of these same white butterflies As I came up the lane to day I saw a living globe of the same two or three feet in diameter many scores cluster d together and rolling along in the air adhering to their ball shape six or eight feet above the ground A NIGHT REMEMBRANCE Aug twenty three nine ten A M I sit by the pond everything quiet the broad polish d surface spread before me the blue of the heavens and the white clouds reflected from it and flitting across now and then the reflection of some flying bird Last night I was down here with a friend till after midnight everything a miracle of splendor the glory of the stars and the completely rounded moon the passing clouds silver and luminous tawny now and then masses of vapory illuminated scud and silently by my side my dear friend The shades of the trees and patches of moonlight on the grass the softly blowing breeze and just palpable odor of the neighboring ripening corn the indolent and spiritual night inexpressibly rich tender suggestive something altogether to filter through one s soul and nourish and feed and soothe the memory long afterwards WILD FLOWERS This has been and is yet a great season for wild flowers oceans of them line the roads through the woods border the edges of the water runlets grow all along the old fences and are scatter d in profusion over the fields An eight petal d blossom of gold yellow clear and bright with a brown tuft in the middle nearly as large as a silver half dollar is very common yesterday on a long drive I noticed it thickly lining the borders of the brooks everywhere Then there is a beautiful weed cover d with blue flowers the blue of the old Chinese teacups treasur d by our grand aunts I am continually stopping to admire a little larger than a dime and very plentiful White however is the prevailing color The wild carrot I have spoken of also the fragrant life everlasting But there are all hues and beauties especially on the frequent tracts of half opened scrub oak and dwarf cedar hereabout wild asters of all colors Notwithstanding the frost touch the hardy little chaps maintain themselves in all their bloom The tree leaves too some of them are beginning to turn yellow or drab or dull green The deep wine color of the sumachs and gum treesis already visible and the straw color of the dog wood and beech Let me give the names of some of these perennial blossoms and friendly weeds I have made acquaintance with hereabout one season or another in my walks Wild azalea dandelions wild honeysuckle yarrow wild roses coreopsis golden rod wild pea larkspur woodbine early crocus elderberry sweet flag great patches of it poke weed creeper trumpet flower sun flower scented marjoram chamomile snakeroot violets Solomon s seal clematis sweet balm bloodroot mint great plenty swamp magnolia wild geranium milk weed wild heliotrope wild daisy plenty burdock wild chrysanthemum A CIVILITY TOO LONG NEGLECTED The foregoing reminds me of something As the individualities I would mainly portray have certainly been slighted by folks who make pictures volumes poems out of them as a faint testimonial of my own gratitude for many hours of peace and comfort in half sickness and not by any means sure but they will somehow get wind of the compliment I hereby dedicate the last half of these Specimen Days to the bees glow worms swarming millions black birds of them indescribably dragon flies strange and beautiful at night pond turtles over the pond and creek mulleins tansy peppermint water snakes moths great and little some crows splendid fellows millers mosquitoes cedars butterflies tulip trees and all other trees wasps and hornets and to the spots and memories cat birds and all other birds of those days and the creek DELAWARE RIVER DAYS AND NIGHTS April five eighteen seventy nine With the return of spring to the skies airs waters of the Delaware return the sea gulls I never tire of watching their broad and easy flight in spirals or as they oscillate with slow unflapping wings or look down with curved beak or dipping to the water after food The crows plenty enough all through the winter have vanish d with the ice Not one of them now to be seen The steamboats have again come forth bustling up handsome freshly painted for summer work the Columbia the Edwin Forrest the Republic not yet out the Reybold Nelly White the Twilight the Ariel the Warner the Perry the Taggart the Jersey Blue even the hulky old Trenton not forgetting those saucy little bull pups of the current the steamtugs But let me bunch and catalogue the affair the river itself all the way from the sea Cape island on one side and Henlopen light on the other up the broad bay north and so to Philadelphia and on further to Trenton the sights I am most familiar with as I live a good part of the time in Camden I view matters from that outlook the great arrogant black full freighted ocean steamers inward or outward bound the ample width here between the two cities intersected by Windmill island an occasional man of war sometimes a foreigner at anchor with her guns and port holes and the boats and the brown faced sailors and the regular oar strokes and the gay crowds of visiting day the frequent large and handsome three masted schooners a favorite style of marine build hereabout of late years some of them new and very jaunty with their white gray sails and yellow pine spars the sloops dashing along in a fair wind I see one now coming up under broad canvas her gaff topsail shining in the sun high and picturesque what a thing of beauty amid the sky and waters the crowded wharf slips along the city the flags of different nationalities the sturdy English cross on its ground of blood the French tricolor the banner of the great North German empire and the Italian and the Spanish colors sometimes of an afternoon the whole scene enliven d by a fleet of yachts in a half calm lazily returning from a race down at Gloucester the neat rakish revenue steamer Hamilton in mid stream with her perpendicular stripes flaunting aft and turning the eyes north the long ribands of fleecy white steam or dingy black smoke stretching far fan shaped slanting diagonally across from the Kensington or Richmond shores in the west by south west wind SCENES ON FERRY AND RIVER LAST WINTER S NIGHTS Then the Camden ferry What exhilaration change people business by day What soothing silent wondrous hours at night crossing on the boat most all to myself pacing the deck alone forward or aft What communion with the waters the air the exquisite chiaroscuro the sky and stars that speak no word nothing to the intellect yet so eloquent so communicative to the soul And the ferry men little they know how much they have been to me day and night how many spells of listlessness ennui debility they and their hardy ways have dispell d And the pilots captains Hand Walton and Giberson by day and captain Olive at night Eugene Crosby with his strong young arm so often supporting circling convoying me over the gaps of the bridge through impediments safely aboard Indeed all my ferry friends captain Frazee the superintendent Lindell Hiskey Fred Rauch Price Watson and a dozen more And the ferry itself with its queer scenes sometimes children suddenly born in the waiting houses an actual fact and more than once sometimes a masquerade party going over at night with a band of music dancing and whirling like mad on the broad deck in their fantastic dresses sometimes the astronomer mister Whitall who posts me up in points about the stars by a living lesson there and then and answering every question sometimes a prolific family group eight nine ten even twelve Yesterday as I cross d a mother father and eight children waiting in the ferry house bound westward somewhere I have mention d the crows I always watch them from the boats They play quite a part in the winter scenes on the river by day Their black splatches are seen in relief against the snow and ice everywhere at that season sometimes flying and flapping sometimes on little or larger cakes sailing up or down the stream One day the river was mostly clear only a single long ridge of broken ice making a narrow stripe by itself running along down the current for over a mile quite rapidly On this white stripe the crows were congregated hundreds of them a funny procession half mourning was the comment of some one Then the reception room for passengers waiting life illustrated thoroughly Take a March picture I jotted there two or three weeks since Afternoon about three one two o clock it begins to snow There has been a matinee performance at the theater from four one two to five comes a stream of homeward bound ladies I never knew the spacious room to present a gayer more lively scene handsome well drest Jersey women and girls scores of them streaming in for nearly an hour the bright eyes and glowing faces coming in from the air a sprinkling of snow on bonnets or dresses as they enter the five or ten minutes waiting the chatting and laughing women can have capital times among themselves with plenty of wit lunches jovial abandon Lizzie the pleasant manner d waiting room woman for sound the bell taps and steam signals of the departing boats with their rhythmic break and undertone the domestic pictures mothers with bevies of daughters a charming sight children countrymen the railroad men in their blue clothes and caps all the various characters of city and country represented or suggested Then outside some belated passenger frantically running jumping after the boat Towards six o clock the human stream gradually thickening now a pressure of vehicles drays piled railroad crates now a drove of cattle making quite an excitement the drovers with heavy sticks belaboring the steaming sides of the frighten d brutes Inside the reception room business bargains flirting love making eclaircissements proposals pleasant sober faced Phil coming in with his burden of afternoon papers or Jo or Charley who jump d in the dock last week and saved a stout lady from drowning to replenish the stove and clearing it with long crow bar poker Besides all this comedy human the river affords nutriment of a higher order Here are some of my memoranda of the past winter just as pencill d down on the spot A January Night Fine trips across the wide Delaware to night Tide pretty high and a strong ebb River a little after eight full of ice mostly broken but some large cakes making our strong timber d steamboat hum and quiver as she strikes them In the clear moonlight they spread strange unearthly silvery faintly glistening as far as I can see Bumping trembling sometimes hissing like a thousand snakes the tide procession as we wend with or through it affording a grand undertone in keeping with the scene Overhead the splendor indescribable yet something haughty almost supercilious in the night Never did I realize more latent sentiment almost passion in those silent interminable stars up there One can understand such a night why from the days of the Pharaohs or Job the dome of heaven sprinkled with planets has supplied the subtlest deepest criticism on human pride glory ambition Another Winter Night I don t know anything more filling than to be on the wide firm deck of a powerful boat a clear cool extra moonlight night crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick marbly glistening ice The whole river is now spread with it some immense cakes There is such weirdness about the scene partly the quality of the light with its tinge of blue the lunar twilight only the large stars holding their own in the radiance of the moon Temperature sharp comfortable for motion dry full of oxygen But the sense of power the steady scornful imperious urge of our strong new engine as she ploughs her way through the big and little cakes Another For two hours I cross d and recross d merely for pleasure for a still excitement Both sky and river went through several changes The first for awhile held two vast fan shaped echelons of light clouds through which the moon waded now radiating carrying with her an aureole of tawny transparent brown and now flooding the whole vast with clear vapory light green through which as through an illuminated veil she moved with measur d womanly motion Then another trip the heavens would be absolutely clear and Luna in all her effulgence The big Dipper in the north with the double star in the handle much plainer than common Then the sheeny track of light in the water dancing and rippling Such transformations such pictures and poems inimitable Another I am studying the stars under advantages as I cross tonight It is late in February and again extra clear High toward the west the Pleiades tremulous with delicate sparkle in the soft heavens Aldebaran leading the V shaped Hyades and overhead Capella and her kids Most majestic of all in full display in the high south Orion vast spread roomy chief historian of the stage with his shiny yellow rosette on his shoulder and his three kings and a little to the east Sirius calmly arrogant most wondrous single star Going late ashore I couldn t give up the beauty and soothingness of the night as I staid around or slowly wander d I heard the echoing calls of the railroad men in the West Jersey depot yard shifting and switching trains engines et cetera amid the general silence otherways and something in the acoustic quality of the air musical emotional effects never thought of before I linger d long and long listening to them Night of March eighteen seventy nine One of the calm pleasantly cool exquisitely clear and cloudless early spring nights the atmosphere again that rare vitreous blue black welcom d by astronomers Just at eight evening the scene overhead of certainly solemnest beauty never surpass d Venus nearly down in the west of a size and lustre as if trying to outshow herself before departing Teeming maternal orb I take you again to myself I am reminded of that spring preceding Abraham Lincoln s murder when I restlessly haunting the Potomac banks around Washington city watch d you off there aloof moody as myself As we walk d up and down in the dark blue so mystic As we walk d in silence the transparent shadowy night As I saw you had something to tell as you bent to me night after night As you droop from the sky low down as if to my side while the other stars all look d on As we wander d together the solemn night With departing Venus large to the last and shining even to the edge of the horizon the vast dome presents at this moment such a spectacle Mercury was visible just after sunset a rare sight Arcturus is now risen just north of east In calm glory all the stars of Orion hold the place of honor in meridian to the south with the Dog star a little to the left And now just rising Spica late low and slightly veil d Castor Regulus and the rest all shining unusually clear no Mars or Jupiter or moon till morning On the edge of the river many lamps twinkling with two or three huge chimneys a couple of miles up belching forth molten steady flames volcano like illuminating all around and sometimes an electric or calcium its Dante Inferno gleams in far shafts terrible ghastly powerful Of later May nights crossing I like to watch the fishermen s little buoy lights so pretty so dreamy like corpse candles undulating delicate and lonesome on the surface of the shadowy waters floating with the current THE FIRST SPRING DAY ON CHESTNUT STREET Winter relaxing its hold has already allow d us a foretaste of spring As I write yesterday afternoon s softness and brightness after the morning fog which gave it a better setting by contrast show d Chestnut street say between Broad and Fourth to more advantage in its various asides and all its stores and gay dress d crowds generally than for three months past I took a walk there between one and two Doubtless there were plenty of hard up folks along the pavements but nine tenths of the myriad moving human panorama to all appearance seem d flush well fed and fully provided At all events it was good to be on Chestnut street yesterday The peddlers on the sidewalk sleeve buttons three for five cents the handsome little fellow with canary bird whistles the cane men toy men toothpick men the old woman squatted in a heap on the cold stone flags with her basket of matches pins and tape the young negro mother sitting begging with her two little coffee color d twins on her lap the beauty of the cramm d conservatory of rare flowers flaunting reds yellows snowy lilies incredible orchids at the Baldwin mansion near Twelfth street the show of fine poultry beef fish at the restaurants the china stores with glass and statuettes the luscious tropical fruits the street cars plodding along with their tintinnabulating bells the fat cab looking rapidly driven one horse vehicles of the post office squeez d full of coming or going letter carriers so healthy and handsome and manly looking in their gray uniforms the costly books pictures curiosities in the windows the gigantic policemen at most of the corners will all be readily remember d and recognized as features of this principal avenue of Philadelphia Chestnut street I have discover d is not without individuality and its own points even when compared with the great promenade streets of other cities I have never been in Europe but acquired years familiar experience with New York s perhaps the world s great thoroughfare Broadway and possess to some extent a personal and saunterer s knowledge of saint Charles street in New Orleans Tremont street in Boston and the broad trottoirs of Pennsylvania avenue in Washington Of course it is a pity that Chestnut were not two or three times wider but the street any fine day shows vividness motion variety not easily to be surpass d Sparkling eyes human faces magnetism well dress d women ambulating to and fro with lots o fine things in the windows are they not about the same the civilized world over How fast the flitting figures come The mild the fierce the stony face Some bright with thoughtless smiles and some Where secret tears have left their trace A few days ago one of the six story clothing stores along here had the space inside its plate glass show window partition d into a little corral and litter d deeply with rich clover and hay I could smell the odor outside on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep full sized but young the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw I stop s long and long with the crowd to view them one lying down chewing the cud and one standing up looking out with dense fringed patient eyes Their wool of a clear tawny color with streaks of glistening black altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of dandies dollars and dry goods UP THE HUDSON TO ULSTER COUNTY April twenty three Off to New York on a little tour and visit Leaving the hospitable home like quarters of my valued friends mister and missus J H Johnston took the four P M boat bound up the Hudson one hundred miles or so Sunset and evening fine Especially enjoy d the hour after we passed Cozzens s landing the night lit by the crescent moon and Venus now swimming in tender glory and now hid by the high rocks and hills of the western shore which we hugg d close Where I spend the next ten days is in Ulster county and its neighborhood with frequent morning and evening drives observations of the river and short rambles April twenty four Noon A little more and the sun would be oppressive The bees are out gathering their bread from willows and other trees I watch them returning darting through the air or lighting on the hives their thighs covered with the yellow forage A solitary robin sings near I sit in my shirt sleeves and gaze from an open bay window on the indolent scene the thin haze the Fishkill hills in the distance off on the river a sloop with slanting mainsail and two or three little shad boats Over on the railroad opposite long freight trains sometimes weighted by cylinder tanks of petroleum thirty forty fifty cars in a string panting and rumbling along in full view but the sound soften d by distance DAYS AT J B S TURF FIRES SPRING SONGS April twenty six At sunrise the pure clear sound of the meadow lark An hour later some notes few and simple yet delicious and perfect from the bush sparrow towards noon the reedy trill of the robin To day is the fairest sweetest yet penetrating warmth a lovely veil in the air partly heat vapor and partly from the turf fires everywhere in patches on the farms A group of soft maples near by silently bursts out in crimson tips buzzing all day with busy bees The white sails of sloops and schooners glide up and down the river and long trains of cars with ponderous roll or faint bell notes almost constantly on the opposite shore The earliest wild flowers in the woods and fields spicy arbutus blue liverwort frail anemone and the pretty white blossoms of the bloodroot I launch out in slow rambles discovering them As I go along the roads I like to see the farmers fires in patches burning the dry brush turf debris How the smoke crawls along flat to the ground slanting slowly rising reaching away and at last dissipating I like its acrid smell whiffs just reaching me welcomer than French perfume The birds are plenty of any sort or of two or three sorts curiously not a sign till suddenly some warm gushing sunny April or even March day lo there they are from twig to twig or fence to fence flirting singing some mating preparing to build But most of them en passant a fortnight a month in these parts and then away As in all phases Nature keeps up her vital copious eternal procession Still plenty of the birds hang around all or most of the season now their love time and era of nest building I find flying over the river crows gulls and hawks I hear the afternoon shriek of the latter darting about preparing to nest The oriole will soon be heard here and the twanging meoeow of the cat bird also the king bird cuckoo and the warblers All along there are three peculiarly characteristic spring songs the meadow lark s so sweet so alert and remonstrating as if he said don t you see or can t you understand the cheery mellow human tones of the robin I have been trying for years to get a brief term or phrase that would identify and describe that robin call and the amorous whistle of the high hole Insects are out plentifully at midday April twenty nine As we drove lingering along the road we heard just after sundown the song of the wood thrush We stopp d without a word and listen d long The delicious notes a sweet artless voluntary simple anthem as from the flute stops of some organ wafted through the twilight echoing well to us from the perpendicular high rock where in some thick young trees recesses at the base sat the bird fill d our senses our souls MEETING A HERMIT I found in one of my rambles up the hills a real hermit living in a lonesome spot hard to get at rocky the view fine with a little patch of land two rods square A man of youngish middle age city born and raised had been to school had travel d in Europe and California I first met him once or twice on the road and pass d the time of day with some small talk then the third time he ask d me to go along a bit and rest in his hut an almost unprecedented compliment as I heard from others afterwards He was of Quaker stock I think talk d with ease and moderate freedom but did not unbosom his life or story or tragedy or whatever it was AN ULSTER COUNTY WATERFALL I jot this mem in a wild scene of woods and hills where we have come to visit a waterfall I never saw finer or more copious hemlocks many of them large some old and hoary Such a sentiment to them secretive shaggy what I call weather beaten and let alone a rich underlay of ferns yew sprouts and mosses beginning to be spotted with the early summer wild flowers Enveloping all the monotone and liquid gurgle from the hoarse impetuous copious fall the greenish tawny darkly transparent waters plunging with velocity down the rocks with patches of milk white foam a stream of hurrying amber thirty feet wide risen far back in the hills and woods now rushing with volume every hundred rods a fall and sometimes three or four in that distance A primitive forest druidical solitary and savage not ten visitors a year broken rocks everywhere shade overhead thick underfoot with leaves a just palpable wild and delicate aroma WALTER DUMONT AND HIS MEDAL As I saunter d along the high road yesterday I stopp d to watch a man near by ploughing a rough stony field with a yoke of oxen Usually there is much geeing and hawing excitement and continual noise and expletives about a job of this kind But I noticed how different how easy and wordless yet firm and sufficient the work of this young ploughman His name was Walter Dumont a farmer and son of a farmer working for their living Three years ago when the steamer Sunnyside was wreck d of a bitter icy night on the west bank here Walter went out in his boat was the first man on hand with assistance made a way through the ice to shore connected a line perform d work of first class readiness daring danger and saved numerous lives Some weeks after one evening when he was up at Esopus among the usual loafing crowd at the country store and post office there arrived the gift of an unexpected official gold medal for the quiet hero The impromptu presentation was made to him on the spot but he blush d hesitated as he took it and had nothing to say HUDSON RIVER SIGHTS It was a happy thought to build the Hudson river railroad right along the shore The grade is already made by nature you are sure of ventilation one side and you are in nobody s way I see hear the locomotives and cars rumbling roaring flaming smoking constantly away off there night and day less than a mile distant and in full view by day I like both sight and sound Express trains thunder and lighten along of freight trains most of them very long there cannot be less than a hundred a day At night far down you see the headlight approaching coming steadily on like a meteor The river at night has its special character beauties The shad fishermen go forth in their boats and pay out their nets one sitting forward rowing and one standing up aft dropping it properly marking the line with little floats bearing candles conveying as they glide over the water an indescribable sentiment and doubled brightness I like to watch the tows at night too with their twinkling lamps and hear the husky panting of the steamers or catch the sloops and schooners shadowy forms like phantoms white silent indefinite out there Then the Hudson of a clear moonlight night But there is one sight the very grandest Sometimes in the fiercest driving storm of wind rain hail or snow a great eagle will appear over the river now soaring with steady and now overbended wings always confronting the gale or perhaps cleaving into or at times literally sitting upon it It is like reading some first class natural tragedy or epic or hearing martial trumpets The splendid bird enjoys the hubbub is adjusted and equal to it finishes it so artistically His pinions just oscillating the position of his head and neck his resistless occasionally varied flight now a swirl now an upward movement the black clouds driving the angry wash below the hiss of rain the wind s piping perhaps the ice colliding grunting he tacking or jibing now as it were for a change abandoning himself to the gale moving with it with such velocity and now resuming control he comes up against it lord of the situation and the storm lord amid it of power and savage joy Sometimes as at present writing middle of sunny afternoon the old Vanderbilt steamer stalking ahead I plainly hear her rhythmic slushing paddles drawing by long hawsers an immense and varied following string an old sow and pigs the river folks call it First comes a big barge with a house built on it and spars towering over the roof then canal boats a lengthen d clustering train fasten d and link d together the one in the middle with high staff flaunting a broad and gaudy flag others with the almost invariable lines of new wash d clothes drying two sloops and a schooner aside the tow little wind and that adverse with three long dark empty barges bringing up the rear People are on the boats men lounging women in sun bonnets children stovepipes with streaming smoke TWO CITY AREAS CERTAIN HOURS NEW YORK May twenty four seventy nine Perhaps no quarters of this city I have return d again for awhile make more brilliant animated crowded spectacular human presentations these fine May afternoons than the two I am now going to describe from personal observation First that area comprising Fourteenth street especially the short range between Broadway and Fifth avenue with Union square its adjacencies and so retrostretching down Broadway for half a mile All the walks here are wide and the spaces ample and free now flooded with liquid gold from the last two hours of powerful sunshine The whole area at five o clock the days of my observations must have contain d from thirty to forty thousand finely dress d people all in motion plenty of them good looking many beautiful women often youths and children the latter in groups with their nurses the trottoirs everywhere close spread thick tangled yet no collision no trouble with masses of bright color action and tasty toilets surely the women dress better than ever before and the men do too As if New York would show these afternoons what it can do in its humanity its choicest physique and physiognomy and its countless prodigality of locomotion dry goods glitter magnetism and happiness Second also from five to seven P M the stretch of Fifth avenue all the way from the Central Park exits at Fifty ninth street down to Fourteenth especially along the high grade by Fortieth street and down the hill A Mississippi of horses and rich vehicles not by dozens and scores but hundreds and thousands the broad avenue filled and cramm d with them a moving sparkling hurrying crush for more than two miles I wonder they don t get block d but I believe they never do Altogether it is to me the marvel sight of New York I like to get in one of the Fifth avenue stages and ride up stemming the swift moving procession I doubt if London or Paris or any city in the world can show such a carriage carnival as I have seen here five or six times these beautiful May afternoons CENTRAL PARK WALKS AND TALKS May sixteen to twenty two I visit Central Park now almost every day sitting or slowly rambling or riding around The whole place presents its very best appearance this current month the full flush of the trees the plentiful white and pink of the flowering shrubs the emerald green of the grass spreading everywhere yellow dotted still with dandelions the specialty of the plentiful gray rocks peculiar to these grounds cropping out miles and miles and over all the beauty and purity three days out of four of our summer skies As I sit placidly early afternoon off against Ninetieth street the policeman C C a well form d sandy complexion d young fellow comes over and stands near me We grow quite friendly and chatty forth with He is a New Yorker born and raised and in answer to my questions tells me about the life of a New York Park policeman while he talks keeping his eyes and ears vigilantly open occasionally pausing and moving where he can get full views of the vistas of the road up and down and the spaces around The pay is two dollars forty cents a day seven days to a week the men come on and work eight hours straight ahead which is all that is required of them out of the twenty four The position has more risks than one might suppose for instance if a team or horse runs away which happens daily each man is expected not only to be prompt but to waive safety and stop wildest nag or nags do it and don t be thinking of your bones or face give the alarm whistle too so that other guards may repeat and the vehicles up and down the tracks be warn d Injuries to the men are continually happening There is much alertness and quiet strength Few appreciate I have often thought the Ulyssean capacity derring do quick readiness in emergencies practicality unwitting devotion and heroism among our American young men and working people the firemen the railroad employes the steamer and ferry men the police the conductors and drivers the whole splendid average of native stock city and country It is good work though and upon the whole the Park force members like it They see life and the excitement keeps them up There is not so much difficulty as might be supposed from tramps roughs or in keeping people off the grass The worst trouble of the regular Park employe is from malarial fever chills and the like A FINE AFTERNOON four TO six Ten thousand vehicles careering through the Park this perfect afternoon Such a show and I have seen all watch d it narrowly and at my leisure Private barouches cabs and coupes some fine horseflesh lapdogs footmen fashions foreigners cockades on hats crests on panels the full oceanic tide of New York s wealth and gentility It was an impressive rich interminable circus on a grand scale full of action and color in the beauty of the day under the clear sun and moderate breeze Family groups couples single drivers of course dresses generally elegant much style yet perhaps little or nothing even in that direction that fully justified itself Through the windows of two or three of the richest carriages I saw faces almost corpse like so ashy and listless Indeed the whole affair exhibited less of sterling America either in spirit or countenance than I had counted on from such a select mass spectacle I suppose as a proof of limitless wealth leisure and the aforesaid gentility it was tremendous Yet what I saw those hours I took two other occasions two other afternoons to watch the same scene confirms a thought that haunts me every additional glimpse I get of our top loftical general or rather exceptional phases of wealth and fashion in this country namely that they are ill at ease much too conscious cased in too many cerements and far from happy that there is nothing in them which we who are poor and plain need at all envy and that instead of the perennial smell of the grass and woods and shores their typical redolence is of soaps and essences very rare may be but suggesting the barber shop something that turns stale and musty in a few hours anyhow Perhaps the show on the horseback road was prettiest Many groups threes a favorite number some couples some singly many ladies frequently horses or parties dashing along on a full run fine riding the rule a few really first class animals As the afternoon waned the wheel d carriages grew less but the saddle riders seemed to increase They linger d long and I saw some charming forms and faces DEPARTING OF THE BIG STEAMERS May twenty five A three hours bay trip from twelve to three this afternoon accompanying the City of Brussels down as far as the Narrows in behoof of some Europe bound friends to give them a good send off Our spirited little tug the Seth Low kept close to the great black Brussels sometimes one side sometimes the other always up to her or even pressing ahead like the blooded pony accompanying the royal elephant The whole affair from the first was an animated quick passing characteristic New York scene the large good looking well dress d crowd on the wharf end men and women come to see their friends depart and bid them God speed the ship s sides swarming with passengers groups of bronze faced sailors with uniform d officers at their posts the quiet directions as she quickly unfastens and moves out prompt to a minute the emotional faces adieus and fluttering handkerchiefs and many smiles and some tears on the wharf the answering faces smiles tears and fluttering handkerchiefs from the ship what can be subtler and finer than this play of faces on such occasions in these responding crowds what go more to one s heart the proud steady noiseless cleaving of the grand oceaner down the bay we speeding by her side a few miles and then turning wheeling amid a babel of wild hurrahs shouted partings ear splitting steam whistles kissing of hands and waving of handkerchiefs This departing of the big steamers noons or afternoons there is no better medicine when one is listless or vapory I am fond of going down Wednesdays and Saturdays their more special days to watch them and the crowds on the wharves the arriving passengers the general bustle and activity the eager looks from the faces the clear toned voices a travel d foreigner a musician told me the other day she thinks an American crowd has the finest voices in the world the whole look of the great shapely black ships themselves and their groups and lined sides in the setting of our bay with the blue sky overhead Two days after the above I saw the Britannic the Donau the Helvetia and the Schiedam steam out all off for Europe a magnificent sight TWO HOURS ON THE MINNESOTA From seven to nine aboard the United States school ship Minnesota lying up the North river Captain Luce sent his gig for us about sundown to the foot of Twenty third street and receiv d us aboard with officer like hospitality and sailor heartiness There are several hundred youths on the Minnesota to be train d for efficiently manning the government navy I like the idea much and so far as I have seen to night I like the way it is carried out on this huge vessel Below on the gun deck were gather d nearly a hundred of the boys to give us some of their singing exercises with a melodeon accompaniment play d by one of their number They sang with a will The best part however was the sight of the young fellows themselves I went over among them before the singing began and talk d a few minutes informally They are from all the States I asked for the Southerners but could only find one a lad from Baltimore In age apparently they range from about fourteen years to nineteen or twenty They are all of American birth and have to pass a rigid medical examination well grown youths good flesh bright eyes looking straight at you healthy intelligent not a slouch among them nor a menial in every one the promise of a man I have been to many public aggregations of young and old and of schools and colleges in my day but I confess I have never been so near satisfied so comforted both from the fact of the school itself and the splendid proof of our country our composite race and the sample promises of its good average capacities its future as in the collection from all parts of the United States on this navy training ship Are there going to be any men there was the dry and pregnant reply of Emerson to one who had been crowding him with the rich material statistics and possibilities of some western or Pacific region May twenty six Aboard the Minnesota again Lieut Murphy kindly came for me in his boat Enjoy d specially those brief trips to and fro the sailors tann d strong so bright and able looking pulling their oars in long side swing man of war style as they row d me across I saw the boys in companies drilling with small arms had a talk with Chaplain Rawson At eleven o clock all of us gathered to breakfast around a long table in the great ward room I among the rest a genial plentiful hospitable affair every way plenty to eat and of the best became acquainted with several new officers This second visit with its observations talks two or three at random with the boys confirm d my first impressions MATURE SUMMER DAYS AND NIGHTS Aug four Forenoon as I sit under the willow shade have retreated down in the country again a little bird is leisurely dousing and flirting himself amid the brook almost within reach of me He evidently fears me not takes me for some concomitant of the neighboring earthy banks free bushery and wild weeds six p m The last three days have been perfect ones for the season four nights ago copious rains with vehement thunder and lightning I write this sitting by the creek watching my two kingfishers at their sundown sport The strong beautiful joyous creatures Their wings glisten in the slanted sunbeams as they circle and circle around occasionally dipping and dashing the water and making long stretches up and down the creek Wherever I go over fields through lanes in by places blooms the white flowering wild carrot its delicate pat of snow flakes crowning its slender stem gracefully oscillating in the breeze EXPOSITION BUILDING NEW CITY HALL RIVER TRIP PHILADELPHIA Aug twenty six Last night and to night of unsurpass d clearness after two days rain moon splendor and star splendor Being out toward the great Exposition building West Philadelphia I saw it lit up and thought I would go in There was a ball democratic but nice plenty of young couples waltzing and quadrilling music by a good string band To the sight and hearing of these to moderate strolls up and down the roomy spaces to getting off aside resting in an arm chair and looking up a long while at the grand high roof with its graceful and multitudinous work of iron rods angles gray colors plays of light and shade receding into dim outlines to absorbing in the intervals of the string band some capital voluntaries and rolling caprices from the big organ at the other end of the building to sighting a shadow d figure or group or couple of lovers every now and then passing some near or farther aisle I abandon d myself for over an hour Returning home riding down Market street in an open summer car something detain d us between Fifteenth and Broad and I got out to view better the new three fifths built marble edifice the City Hall of magnificent proportions a majestic and lovely show there in the moonlight flooded all over facades myriad silver white lines and carv d heads and mouldings with the soft dazzle silent weird beautiful well I know that never when finish d will that magnificent pile impress one as it impress d me those fifteen minutes To night since I have been long on the river I watch the C shaped Northern Crown with the star Alshacca that blazed out so suddenly alarmingly one night a few years ago The moon in her third quarter and up nearly all night And there as I look eastward my long absent Pleiades welcome again to sight For an hour I enjoy the soothing and vital scene to the low splash of waves new stars steadily noiselessly rising in the east As I cross the Delaware one of the deck hands F R tells me how a woman jump d overboard and was drown d a couple of hours since It happen d in mid channel she leap d from the forward part of the boat which went over her He saw her rise on the other side in the swift running water throw her arms and closed hands high up white hands and bare forearms in the moonlight like a flash and then she sank I found out afterwards that this young fellow had promptly jump d in swam after the poor creature and made though unsuccessfully the bravest efforts to rescue her but he didn t mention that part at all in telling me the story SWALLOWS ON THE RIVER Sept three Cloudy and wet and wind due east air without palpable fog but very heavy with moisture welcome for a change Forenoon crossing the Delaware I noticed unusual numbers of swallows in flight circling darting graceful beyond description close to the water Thick around the bows of the ferry boat as she lay tied in her slip they flew and as we went out I watch d beyond the pier heads and across the broad stream their swift winding loop ribands of motion down close to it cutting and intersecting Though I had seen swallows all my life seem d as though I never before realized their peculiar beauty and character in the landscape Some time ago for an hour in a huge old country barn watching these birds flying recall d the twenty twod book of the Odyssey where Ulysses slays the suitors bringing things to eclaircissement and Minerva swallow bodied darts up through the spaces of the hall sits high on a beam looks complacently on the show of slaughter and feels in her element exulting joyous BEGIN A LONG JAUNT WEST The following three or four months Sept to Dec seventy nine I made quite a western journey fetching up at Denver Colorado and penetrating the Rocky Mountain region enough to get a good notion of it all Left West Philadelphia after nine o clock one night middle of September in a comfortable sleeper Oblivious of the two or three hundred miles across Pennsylvania at Pittsburgh in the morning to breakfast Pretty good view of the city and Birmingham fog and damp smoke coke furnaces flames discolor d wooden houses and vast collections of coal barges Presently a bit of fine region West Virginia the Panhandle and crossing the river the Ohio By day through the latter State then Indiana and so rock d to slumber for a second night flying like lightning through Illinois IN THE SLEEPER What a fierce weird pleasure to lie in my berth at night in the luxurious palace car drawn by the mighty Baldwin embodying and filling me too full of the swiftest motion and most resistless strength It is late perhaps midnight or after distances join d like magic as we speed through Harrisburg Columbus Indianapolis The element of danger adds zest to it all On we go rumbling and flashing with our loud whinnies thrown out from time to time or trumpet blasts into the darkness Passing the homes of men the farms barns cattle the silent villages And the car itself the sleeper with curtains drawn and lights turn d down in the berths the slumberers many of them women and children as on on on we fly like lightning through the night how strangely sound and sweet they sleep They say the French Voltaire in his time designated the grand opera and a ship of war the most signal illustrations of the growth of humanity s and art s advance beyond primitive barbarism Perhaps if the witty philosopher were here these days and went in the same car with perfect bedding and feed from New York to San Francisco he would shift his type and sample to one of our American sleepers MISSOURI STATE We should have made the run of nine hundred sixty miles from Philadelphia to saint Louis in thirty six hours but we had a collision and bad locomotive smash about two thirds of the way which set us back So merely stopping over night that time in saint Louis I sped on westward As I cross d Missouri State the whole distance by the saint Louis and Kansas City Northern Railroad a fine early autumn day I thought my eyes had never looked on scenes of greater pastoral beauty For over two hundred miles successive rolling prairies agriculturally perfect view d by Pennsylvania and New Jersey eyes and dotted here and there with fine timber Yet fine as the land is it isn t the finest portion there is a bed of impervious clay and hard pan beneath this section that holds water too firmly drowns the land in wet weather and bakes it in dry as a cynical farmer told me South are some richer tracts though perhaps the beauty spots of the State are the northwestern counties Altogether I am clear now and from what I have seen and learn d since that Missouri in climate soil relative situation wheat grass mines railroads and every important materialistic respect stands in the front rank of the Union Of Missouri averaged politically and socially I have heard all sorts of talk some pretty severe but I should have no fear myself of getting along safely and comfortably anywhere among the Missourians They raise a good deal of tobacco You see at this time quantities of the light greenish gray leaves pulled and hanging out to dry on temporary frameworks or rows of sticks Looks much like the mullein familiar to eastern eyes LAWRENCE AND TOPEKA KANSAS We thought of stopping in Kansas City but when we got there we found a train ready and a crowd of hospitable Kansians to take us on to Lawrence to which I proceeded I shall not soon forget my good days in L in company with Judge Usher and his sons especially John and Linton true westerners of the noblest type Nor the similar days in Topeka Nor the brotherly kindness of my RR friends there and the city and State officials Lawrence and Topeka are large bustling half rural handsome cities I took two or three long drives about the latter drawn by a spirited team over smooth roads THE PRAIRIES and an Undeliver d Speech At a large popular meeting at Topeka the Kansas State Silver Wedding fifteen or twenty thousand people I had been erroneously bill d to deliver a poem As I seem d to be made much of and wanted to be good natured I hastily pencill d out the following little speech Unfortunately or fortunately I had such a good time and rest and talk and dinner with the U boys that I let the hours slip away and didn t drive over to the meeting and speak my piece But here it is just the same My friends your bills announce me as giving a poem but I have no poem have composed none for this occasion And I can honestly say I am now glad of it Under these skies resplendent in September beauty amid the peculiar landscape you are used to but which is new to me these interminable and stately prairies in the freedom and vigor and sane enthusiasm of this perfect western air and autumn sunshine it seems to me a poem would be almost an impertinence But if you care to have a word from me I should speak it about these very prairies they impress me most of all the objective shows I see or have seen on this my first real visit to the West As I have roll d rapidly hither for more than a thousand miles through fair Ohio through bread raising Indiana and Illinois through ample Missouri that contains and raises everything as I have partially explor d your charming city during the last two days and standing on Oread hill by the university have launch d my view across broad expanses of living green in every direction I have again been most impress d I say and shall remain for the rest of my life most impress d with that feature of the topography of your western central world that vast Something stretching out on its own unbounded scale unconfined which there is in these prairies combining the real and ideal and beautiful as dreams I wonder indeed if the people of this continental inland West know how much of first class art they have in these prairies how original and all your own how much of the influences of a character for your future humanity broad patriotic heroic and new how entirely they tally on land the grandeur and superb monotony of the skies of heaven and the ocean with its waters how freeing soothing nourishing they are to the soul Then is it not subtly they who have given us our leading modern Americans Lincoln and Grant vast spread average men their foregrounds of character altogether practical and real yet to those who have eyes to see with finest backgrounds of the ideal towering high as any And do we not see in them foreshadowings of the future races that shall fill these prairies Not but what the Yankee and Atlantic States and every other part Texas and the States flanking the south east and the Gulf of Mexico the Pacific shore empire the Territories and Lakes and the Canada line the day is not yet but it will come including Canada entire are equally and integrally and indissolubly this Nation the sine qua non of the human political and commercial New World But this favor d central area of in round numbers two thousand miles square seems fated to be the home both of what I would call America s distinctive ideas and distinctive realities ON TO DENVER A FRONTIER INCIDENT The jaunt of five or six hundred miles from Topeka to Denver took me through a variety of country but all unmistakably prolific western American and on the largest scale For a long distance we follow the line of the Kansas river I like better the old name Kaw a stretch of very rich dark soil famed for its wheat and call d the Golden Belt then plains and plains hour after hour Ellsworth county the centre of the State where I must stop a moment to tell a characteristic story of early days scene the very spot where I am passing time eighteen sixty eight In a scrimmage at some public gathering in the town A had shot B quite badly but had not kill d him The sober men of Ellsworth conferr d with one another and decided that A deserv d punishment As they wished to set a good example and establish their reputation the reverse of a Lynching town they open an informal court and bring both men before them for deliberate trial Soon as this trial begins the wounded man is led forward to give his testimony Seeing his enemy in durance and unarm d B walks suddenly up in a fury and shoots A through the head shoots him dead The court is instantly adjourn d and its unanimous members without a word of debate walk the murderer B out wounded as he is and hang him In due time we reach Denver which city I fall in love with from the first and have that feeling confirm d the longer I stay there One of my pleasantest days was a jaunt via Platte canon to Leadville AN HOUR ON KENOSHA SUMMIT Jottings from the Rocky Mountains mostly pencill d during a day s trip over the South Park RR returning from Leadville and especially the hour we were detain d much to my satisfaction at Kenosha summit As afternoon advances novelties far reaching splendors accumulate under the bright sun in this pure air But I had better commence with the day The confronting of Platte canon just at dawn after a ten miles ride in early darkness on the rail from Denver the seasonable stoppage at the entrance of the canon and good breakfast of eggs trout and nice griddle cakes then as we travel on and get well in the gorge all the wonders beauty savage power of the scene the wild stream of water from sources of snows brawling continually in sight one side the dazzling sun and the morning lights on the rocks such turns and grades in the track squirming around corners or up and down hills far glimpses of a hundred peaks titanic necklaces stretching north and south the huge rightly named Dome rock and as we dash along others similar simple monolithic elephantine AN EGOTISTICAL FIND I have found the law of my own poems was the unspoken but more and more decided feeling that came to me as I pass d hour after hour amid all this grim yet joyous elemental abandon this plenitude of material entire absence of art untrammel d play of primitive Nature the chasm the gorge the crystal mountain stream repeated scores hundreds of miles the broad handling and absolute uncrampedness the fantastic forms bathed in transparent browns faint reds and grays towering sometimes a thousand sometimes two or three thousand feet high at their tops now and then huge masses pois d and mixing with the clouds with only their outlines hazed in misty lilac visible In Nature s grandest shows says an old Dutch writer an ecclesiastic amid the ocean s depth if so might be or countless worlds rolling above at night a man thinks of them weighs all not for themselves or the abstract but with reference to his own personality and how they may affect him or color his destinies NEW SENSES NEW JOYS We follow the stream of amber and bronze brawling along its bed with its frequent cascades and snow white foam Through the canon we fly mountains not only each side but seemingly till we get near right in front of us every rood a new view flashing and each flash defying description on the almost perpendicular sides clinging pines cedars spruces crimson sumach bushes spots of wild grass but dominating all those towering rocks rocks rocks bathed in delicate vari colors with the clear sky of autumn overhead New senses new joys seem develop d Talk as you like a typical Rocky Mountain canon or a limitless sea like stretch of the great Kansas or Colorado plains under favoring circumstances tallies perhaps expresses certainly awakes those grandest and subtlest element emotions in the human soul that all the marble temples and sculptures from Phidias to Thorwaldsen all paintings poems reminiscences or even music probably never can STEAM POWER TELEGRAPHS et cetera I get out on a ten minutes stoppage at Deer creek to enjoy the unequal d combination of hill stone and wood As we speed again the yellow granite in the sunshine with natural spires minarets castellated perches far aloft then long stretches of straight upright palisades rhinoceros color then gamboge and tinted chromos Ever the best of my pleasures the cool fresh Colorado atmosphere yet sufficiently warm Signs of man s restless advent and pioneerage hard as Nature s face is deserted dug outs by dozens in the side hills the scantling hut the telegraph pole the smoke of some impromptu chimney or outdoor fire at intervals little settlements of log houses or parties of surveyors or telegraph builders with their comfortable tents Once a canvas office where you could send a message by electricity anywhere around the world Yes pronounc d signs of the man of latest dates dauntlessly grappling with these grisliest shows of the old kosmos At several places steam saw mills with their piles of logs and boards and the pipes puffing Occasionally Platte canon expanding into a grassy flat of a few acres At one such place toward the end where we stop and I get out to stretch my legs as I look skyward or rather mountain topward a huge hawk or eagle a rare sight here is idly soaring balancing along the ether now sinking low and coming quite near and then up again in stately languid circles then higher higher slanting to the north and gradually out of sight AMERICA S BACK BONE I jot these lines literally at Kenosha summit where we return afternoon and take a long rest ten thousand feet above sea level At this immense height the South Park stretches fifty miles before me Mountainous chains and peaks in every variety of perspective every hue of vista fringe the view in nearer or middle or far dim distance or fade on the horizon We have now reach d penetrated the Rockies Hayden calls it the Front Range for a hundred miles or so and though these chains spread away in every direction specially north and south thousands and thousands farther I have seen specimens of the utmost of them and know henceforth at least what they are and what they look like Not themselves alone for they typify stretches and areas of half the globe are in fact the vertebrae or back bone of our hemisphere As the anatomists say a man is only a spine topp d footed breasted and radiated so the whole Western world is in a sense but an expansion of these mountains In South America they are the Andes in Central America and Mexico the Cordilleras and in our States they go under different names in California the Coast and Cascade ranges thence more eastwardly the Sierra Nevadas but mainly and more centrally here the Rocky Mountains proper with many an elevation such as Lincoln s Grey s Harvard s Yale s Long s and Pike s peaks all over fourteen thousand feet high East the highest peaks of the Alleghanies the Adirondacks the Catskills and the White Mountains range from two thousand to five thousand five hundred feet only Mount Washington in the latter six thousand three hundred feet THE PARKS In the midst of all here lie such beautiful contrasts as the sunken basins of the North Middle and South Parks the latter I am now on one side of and overlooking each the size of a large level almost quandrangular grassy western county wall d in by walls of hills and each park the source of a river The ones I specify are the largest in Colorado but the whole of that State and of Wyoming Utah Nevada and western California through their sierras and ravines are copiously mark d by similar spreads and openings many of the small ones of paradisiac loveliness and perfection with their offsets of mountains streams atmosphere and hues beyond compare ART FEATURES Talk I say again of going to Europe of visiting the ruins of feudal castles or Coliseum remains or kings palaces when you can come here The alternations one gets too after the Illinois and Kansas prairies of a thousand miles smooth and easy areas of the corn and wheat of ten million democratic farms in the future here start up in every conceivable presentation of shape these non utilitarian piles coping the skies emanating a beauty terror power more than Dante or Angelo ever knew Yes I think the chyle of not only poetry and painting but oratory and even the metaphysics and music fit for the New World before being finally assimilated need first and feeding visits here Mountain streams The spiritual contrast and etheriality of the whole region consist largely to me in its never absent peculiar streams the snows of inaccessible upper areas melting and running down through the gorges continually Nothing like the water of pastoral plains or creeks with wooded banks and turf or anything of the kind elsewhere The shapes that element takes in the shows of the globe cannot be fully understood by an artist until he has studied these unique rivulets Aerial effects But perhaps as I gaze around me the rarest sight of all is in atmospheric hues The prairies as I cross d them in my journey hither and these mountains and parks seem to me to afford new lights and shades Everywhere the aerial gradations and sky effects inimitable nowhere else such perspectives such transparent lilacs and grays I can conceive of some superior landscape painter some fine colorist after sketching awhile out here discarding all his previous work delightful to stock exhibition amateurs as muddy raw and artificial Near one s eye ranges an infinite variety high up the bare whitey brown above timber line in certain spots afar patches of snow any time of year no trees no flowers no birds at those chilling altitudes As I write I see the Snowy Range through the blue mist beautiful and far off I plainly see the patches of snow DENVER IMPRESSIONS Through the long lingering half light of the most superb of evenings we return d to Denver where I staid several days leisurely exploring receiving impressions with which I may as well taper off this memorandum itemizing what I saw there The best was the men three fourths of them large able calm alert American And cash why they create it here Out in the smelting works the biggest and most improv d ones for the precious metals in the world I saw long rows of vats pans cover d by bubbling boiling water and fill d with pure silver four or five inches thick many thousand dollars worth in a pan The foreman who was showing me shovel d it carelessly up with a little wooden shovel as one might toss beans Then large silver bricks worth two thousand dollars a brick dozens of piles twenty in a pile In one place in the mountains at a mining camp I had a few days before seen rough bullion on the ground in the open air like the confectioner s pyramids at some swell dinner in New York Such a sweet morsel to roll over with a poor author s pen and ink and appropriate to slip in here that the silver product of Colorado and Utah with the gold product of California New Mexico Nevada and Dakota foots up an addition to the world s coin of considerably over a hundred millions every year A city this Denver well laid out Laramie street and fifteenth and sixteenth and Champa streets with others particularly fine some with tall storehouses of stone or iron and windows of plate glass all the streets with little canals of mountain water running along the sides plenty of people business modernness yet not without a certain racy wild smack all its own A place of fast horses many mares with their colts and I saw lots of big greyhounds for antelope hunting Now and then groups of miners some just come in some starting out very picturesque One of the papers here interview d me and reported me as saying off hand I have lived in or visited all the great cities on the Atlantic third of the republic Boston Brooklyn with its hills New Orleans Baltimore stately Washington broad Philadelphia teeming Cincinnati and Chicago and for thirty years in that wonder wash d by hurried and glittering tides my own New York not only the New World s but the world s city but newcomer to Denver as I am and threading its streets breathing its air warm d by its sunshine and having what there is of its human as well as aerial ozone flash d upon me now for only three or four days I am very much like a man feels sometimes toward certain people he meets with and warms to and hardly knows why I too can hardly tell why but as I enter d the city in the slight haze of a late September afternoon and have breath d its air and slept well o nights and have roam d or rode leisurely and watch d the comers and goers at the hotels and absorb d the climatic magnetism of this curiously attractive region there has steadily grown upon me a feeling of affection for the spot which sudden as it is has become so definite and strong that I must put it on record So much for my feeling toward the Queen city of the plains and peaks where she sits in her delicious rare atmosphere over five thousand feet above sea level irrigated by mountain streams one way looking east over the prairies for a thousand miles and having the other westward in constant view by day draped in their violet haze mountain tops innumerable Yes I fell in love with Denver and even felt a wish to spend my declining and dying days there I TURN SOUTH AND THEN EAST AGAIN Leave Denver at eight A M by the Rio Grande RR going south Mountains constantly in sight in the apparently near distance veil d slightly but still clear and very grand their cones colors sides distinct against the sky hundreds it seem d thousands interminable necklaces of them their tops and slopes hazed more or less slightly in that blue gray under the autumn sun for over a hundred miles the most spiritual show of objective Nature I ever beheld or ever thought possible Occasionally the light strengthens making a contrast of yellow tinged silver on one side with dark and shaded gray on the other I took a long look at Pike s peak and was a little disappointed I suppose I had expected something stunning Our view over plains to the left stretches amply with corrals here and there the frequent cactus and wild sage and herds of cattle feeding Thus about one hundred twenty miles to Pueblo At that town we board the comfortable and well equipt Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe RR now striking east UNFULFILLED WANTS THE ARKANSAS RIVER I had wanted to go to the Yellowstone river region wanted specially to see the National Park and the geysers and the hoodoo or goblin land of that country indeed hesitated a little at Pueblo the turning point wanted to thread the Veta pass wanted to go over the Santa Fe trail away southwestward to New Mexico but turn d and set my face eastward leaving behind me whetting glimpse tastes of southeastern Colorado Pueblo Bald mountain the Spanish peaks Sangre de Christos Mile Shoe curve which my veteran friend on the locomotive told me was the boss railroad curve of the universe fort Garland on the plains Veta and the three great peaks of the Sierra Blancas The Arkansas river plays quite a part in the whole of this region I see it or its high cut rocky northern shore for miles and cross and recross it frequently as it winds and squirms like a snake The plains vary here even more than usual sometimes a long sterile stretch of scores of miles then green fertile and grassy an equal length Some very large herds of sheep One wants new words in writing about these plains and all the inland American West the terms far large vast c are insufficient A SILENT LITTLE FOLLOWER THE COREOPSIS Here I must say a word about a little follower present even now before my eyes I have been accompanied on my whole journey from Barnegat to Pike s peak by a pleasant floricultural friend or rather millions of friends nothing more or less than a hardy little yellow five petal d September and October wild flower growing I think everywhere in the middle and northern United States I had seen it on the Hudson and over Long Island and along the banks of the Delaware and through New Jersey as years ago up the Connecticut and one fall by Lake Champlain This trip it follow d me regularly with its slender stem and eyes of gold from Cape May to the Kaw valley and so through the canons and to these plains In Missouri I saw immense fields all bright with it Toward western Illinois I woke up one morning in the sleeper and the first thing when I drew the curtain of my berth and look d out was its pretty countenance and bending neck Sept twenty fifth Early morning still going east after we leave Sterling Kansas where I stopp d a day and night The sun up about half an hour nothing can be fresher or more beautiful than this time this region I see quite a field of my yellow flower in full bloom At intervals dots of nice two story houses as we ride swiftly by Over the immense area flat as a floor visible for twenty miles in every direction in the clear air a prevalence of autumn drab and reddish tawny herbage sparse stacks of hay and enclosures breaking the landscape as we rumble by flocks of prairie hens starting up Between Sterling and Florence a fine country Remembrances to E L my old young soldier friend of war times and his wife and boy at S THE PRAIRIES AND GREAT PLAINS IN POETRY After traveling Illinois Missouri Kansas and Colorado Grand as is the thought that doubtless the child is already born who will see a hundred millions of people the most prosperous and advanc d of the world inhabiting these Prairies the great Plains and the valley of the Mississippi I could not help thinking it would be grander still to see all those inimitable American areas fused in the alembic of a perfect poem or other esthetic work entirely western fresh and limitless altogether our own without a trace or taste of Europe s soil reminiscence technical letter or spirit My days and nights as I travel here what an exhilaration not the air alone and the sense of vastness but every local sight and feature Everywhere something characteristic the cactuses pinks buffalo grass wild sage the receding perspective and the far circle line of the horizon all times of day especially forenoon the clear pure cool rarefied nutriment for the lungs previously quite unknown the black patches and streaks left by surface conflagrations the deep plough d furrow of the fire guard the slanting snow racks built all along to shield the railroad from winter drifts the prairie dogs and the herds of antelope the curious dry rivers occasionally a dug out or corral Fort Riley and Fort Wallace those towns of the northern plains like ships on the sea Eagle Tail Coyote Cheyenne Agate Monotony Kit Carson with ever the ant hill and the buffalo wallow ever the herds of cattle and the cow boys cow punchers to me a strangely interesting class bright eyed as hawks with their swarthy complexions and their broad brimm d hats apparently always on horseback with loose arms slightly raised and swinging as they ride THE SPANISH PEAKS EVENING ON THE PLAINS Between Pueblo and Bent s fort southward in a clear afternoon sun spell I catch exceptionally good glimpses of the Spanish peaks We are in southeastern Colorado pass immense herds of cattle as our first class locomotive rushes us along two or three times crossing the Arkansas which we follow many miles and of which river I get fine views sometimes for quite a distance its stony upright not very high palisade banks and then its muddy flats We pass Fort Lyon lots of adobie houses limitless pasturage appropriately fleck d with those herds of cattle in due time the declining sun in the west a sky of limpid pearl over all and so evening on the great plains A calm pensive boundless landscape the perpendicular rocks of the north Arkansas hued in twilight a thin line of violet on the southwestern horizon the palpable coolness and slight aroma a belated cow boy with some unruly member of his herd an emigrant wagon toiling yet a little further the horses slow and tired two men apparently father and son jogging along on foot and around all the indescribable chiaroscuro and sentiment profounder than anything at sea athwart these endless wilds AMERICA S CHARACTERISTIC LANDSCAPE Speaking generally as to the capacity and sure future destiny of that plain and prairie area larger than any European kingdom it is the inexhaustible land of wheat maize wool flax coal iron beef and pork butter and cheese apples and grapes land of ten million virgin farms to the eye at present wild and unproductive yet experts say that upon it when irrigated may easily be grown enough wheat to feed the world Then as to scenery giving my own thought and feeling while I know the standard claim is that Yosemite Niagara falls the upper Yellowstone and the like afford the greatest natural shows I am not so sure but the Prairies and the Plains while less stunning at first sight last longer fill the esthetic sense fuller precede all the rest and make North America s characteristic landscape Indeed through the whole of this journey with all its shows and varieties what most impress d me and will longest remain with me are these same prairies Day after day and night after night to my eyes to all my senses the esthetic one most of all they silently and broadly unfolded Even their simplest statistics are sublime EARTH S MOST IMPORTANT STREAM The valley of the Mississippi river and its tributaries this stream and its adjuncts involve a big part of the question comprehends more than twelve hundred thousand square miles the greater part prairies It is by far the most important stream on the globe and would seem to have been marked out by design slow flowing from north to south through a dozen climates all fitted for man s healthy occupancy its outlet unfrozen all the year and its line forming a safe cheap continental avenue for commerce and passage from the north temperate to the torrid zone Not even the mighty Amazon though larger in volume on its line of east and west not the Nile in Africa nor the Danube in Europe nor the three great rivers of China compare with it Only the Mediterranean sea has play d some such part in history and all through the past as the Mississippi is destined to play in the future By its demesnes water d and welded by its branches the Missouri the Ohio the Arkansas the Red the Yazoo the saint Francis and others it already compacts twenty five millions of people not merely the most peaceful and money making but the most restless and warlike on earth Its valley or reach is rapidly concentrating the political power of the American Union One almost thinks it is the Union or soon will be Take it out with its radiations and what would be left From the car windows through Indiana Illinois Missouri or stopping some days along the Topeka and Santa Fe road in southern Kansas and indeed wherever I went hundreds and thousands of miles through this region my eyes feasted on primitive and rich meadows some of them partially inhabited but far immensely far more untouch d unbroken and much of it more lovely and fertile in its unplough d innocence than the fair and valuable fields of New York s Pennsylvania s Maryland s or Virginia s richest farms PRAIRIE ANALOGIES THE TREE QUESTION The word Prairie is French and means literally meadow The cosmical analogies of our North American plains are the Steppes of Asia the Pampas and Llanos of South America and perhaps the Saharas of Africa Some think the plains have been originally lake beds others attribute the absence of forests to the fires that almost annually sweep over them the cause in vulgar estimation of Indian summer The tree question will soon become a grave one Although the Atlantic slope the Rocky mountain region and the southern portion of the Mississippi valley are well wooded there are here stretches of hundreds and thousands of miles where either not a tree grows or often useless destruction has prevail d and the matter of the cultivation and spread of forests may well be press d upon thinkers who look to the coming generations of the prairie States MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LITERATURE Lying by one rainy day in Missouri to rest after quite a long exploration first trying a big volume I found there of Milton Young Gray Beattie and Collins but giving it up for a bad job enjoying however for awhile as often before the reading of Walter Scott s poems Lay of the Last Minstrel Marmion and so on I stopp d and laid down the book and ponder d the thought of a poetry that should in due time express and supply the teeming region I was in the midst of and have briefly touch d upon One s mind needs but a moment s deliberation anywhere in the United States to see clearly enough that all the prevalent book and library poets either as imported from Great Britain or follow d and doppel gang d here are foreign to our States copiously as they are read by us all But to fully understand not only how absolutely in opposition to our times and lands and how little and cramp d and what anachronisms and absurdities many of their pages are for American purposes one must dwell or travel awhile in Missouri Kansas and Colorado and get rapport with their people and country Will the day ever come no matter how long deferr d when those models and lay figures from the British islands and even the precious traditions of the classics will be reminiscences studies only The pure breath primitiveness boundless prodigality and amplitude strange mixture of delicacy and power of continence of real and ideal and of all original and first class elements of these prairies the Rocky mountains and of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers will they ever appear in and in some sort form a standard for our poetry and art I sometimes think that even the ambition of my friend Joaquin Miller to put them in and illustrate them places him ahead of the whole crowd Not long ago I was down New York bay on a steamer watching the sunset over the dark green heights of Navesink and viewing all that inimitable spread of shore shipping and sea around Sandy Hook But an intervening week or two and my eyes catch the shadowy outlines of the Spanish peaks In the more than two thousand miles between though of infinite and paradoxical variety a curious and absolute fusion is doubtless steadily annealing compacting identifying all But subtler and wider and more solid to produce such compaction than the laws of the States or the common ground of Congress or the Supreme Court or the grim welding of our national wars or the steel ties of railroads or all the kneading and fusing processes of our material and business history past or present would in my opinion be a great throbbing vital imaginative work or series of works or literature in constructing which the Plains the Prairies and the Mississippi river with the demesnes of its varied and ample valley should be the concrete background and America s humanity passions struggles hopes there and now an eclaircissement as it is and is to be on the stage of the New World of all Time s hitherto drama of war romance and evolution should furnish the lambent fire the ideal AN INTERVIEWER S ITEM Oct seventeen seventy nine To day one of the newspapers of saint Louis prints the following informal remarks of mine on American especially Western literature We called on mister Whitman yesterday and after a somewhat desultory conversation abruptly asked him Do you think we are to have a distinctively American literature It seems to me said he that our work at present is to lay the foundations of a great nation in products in agriculture in commerce in networks of intercommunication and in all that relates to the comforts of vast masses of men and families with freedom of speech ecclesiasticism c These we have founded and are carrying out on a grander scale than ever hitherto and Ohio Illinois Indiana Missouri Kansas and Colorado seem to me to be the seat and field of these very facts and ideas Materialistic prosperity in all its varied forms with those other points that I mentioned intercommunication and freedom are first to be attended to When those have their results and get settled then a literature worthy of us will begin to be defined Our American superiority and vitality are in the bulk of our people not in a gentry like the old world The greatness of our army during the secession war was in the rank and file and so with the nation Other lands have their vitality in a few a class but we have it in the bulk of the people Our leading men are not of much account and never have been but the average of the people is immense beyond all history Sometimes I think in all departments literature and art included that will be the way our superiority will exhibit itself We will not have great individuals or great leaders but a great average bulk unprecedentedly great THE WOMEN OF THE WEST Kansas City I am not so well satisfied with what I see of the women of the prairie cities I am writing this where I sit leisurely in a store in Main street Kansas City a streaming crowd on the sidewalks flowing by The ladies and the same in Denver are all fashionably drest and have the look of gentility in face manner and action but they do not have either in physique or the mentality appropriate to them any high native originality of spirit or body as the men certainly have appropriate to them They are intellectual and fashionable but dyspeptic looking and generally doll like their ambition evidently is to copy their eastern sisters Something far different and in advance must appear to tally and complete the superb masculinity of the west and maintain and continue it THE SILENT GENERAL Sept twenty eight seventy nine So General Grant after circumambiating the world has arrived home again landed in San Francisco yesterday from the ship City of Tokio from Japan What a man he is what a history what an illustration his life of the capacities of that American individuality common to us all Cynical critics are wondering what the people can see in Grant to make such a hubbub about They aver and it is no doubt true that he has hardly the average of our day s literary and scholastic culture and absolutely no pronounc d genius or conventional eminence of any sort Correct but he proves how an average western farmer mechanic boatman carried by tides of circumstances perhaps caprices into a position of incredible military or civic responsibilities history has presented none more trying no born monarch s no mark more shining for attack or envy may steer his way fitly and steadily through them all carrying the country and himself with credit year after year command over a million armed men fight more than fifty pitch d battles rule for eight years a land larger than all the kingdoms of Europe combined and then retiring quietly with a cigar in his mouth make the promenade of the whole world through its courts and coteries and kings and czars and mikados and splendidest glitters and etiquettes as phlegmatically as he ever walk d the portico of a Missouri hotel after dinner I say all this is what people like and I am sure I like it Seems to me it transcends Plutarch How those old Greeks indeed would have seized on him A mere plain man no art no poetry only practical sense ability to do or try his best to do what devolv d upon him A common trader money maker tanner farmer of Illinois general for the republic in its terrific struggle with itself in the war of attempted secession President following a task of peace more difficult than the war itself nothing heroic as the authorities put it and yet the greatest hero The gods the destinies seem to have concentrated upon him PRESIDENT HAYES S SPEECHES Sept thirty I see President Hayes has come out West passing quite informally from point to point with his wife and a small cortege of big officers receiving ovations and making daily and sometimes double daily addresses to the people To these addresses all impromptu and some would call them ephemeral I feel to devote a memorandum They are shrewd good natur d face to face speeches on easy topics not too deep but they give me some revised ideas of oratory of a new opportune theory and practice of that art quite changed from the classic rules and adapted to our days our occasions to American democracy and to the swarming populations of the West I hear them criticised as wanting in dignity but to me they are just what they should be considering all the circumstances who they come from and who they are address d to Underneath his objects are to compact and fraternize the States encourage their materialistic and industrial development soothe and expand their self poise and tie all and each with resistless double ties not only of inter trade barter but human comradeship From Kansas City I went on to saint Louis where I remain d nearly three months with my brother T J W and my dear nieces saint LOUIS MEMORANDA Oct Nov and Dec seventy nine The points of saint Louis are its position its absolute wealth the long accumulations of time and trade solid riches probably a higher average thereof than any city the unrivall d amplitude of its well laid out environage of broad plateaus for future expansion and the great State of which it is the head It fuses northern and southern qualities perhaps native and foreign ones to perfection rendezvous the whole stretch of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and its American electricity goes well with its German phlegm Fourth Fifth and Third streets are store streets showy modern metropolitan with hurrying crowds vehicles horse cars hubbub plenty of people rich goods plate glass windows iron fronts often five or six stories high You can purchase anything in saint Louis in most of the big western cities for the matter of that just as readily and cheaply as in the Atlantic marts Often in going about the town you see reminders of old even decay d civilization The water of the west in some places is not good but they make it up here by plenty of very fair wine and inexhaustible quantities of the best beer in the world There are immense establishments for slaughtering beef and pork and I saw flocks of sheep five thousand in a flock In Kansas City I had visited a packing establishment that kills and packs an average of twenty five hundred hogs a day the whole year round for export Another in Atchison Kansas same extent others nearly equal elsewhere And just as big ones here NIGHTS ON THE MISSISSIPPI Oct twenty ninth thirtieth and thirty first Wonderfully fine with the full harvest moon dazzling and silvery I have haunted the river every night lately where I could get a look at the bridge by moonlight It is indeed a structure of perfection and beauty unsurpassable and I never tire of it The river at present is very low I noticed to day it had much more of a blue clear look than usual I hear the slight ripples the air is fresh and cool and the view up or down wonderfully clear in the moonlight I am out pretty late it is so fascinating dreamy The cool night air all the influences the silence with those far off eternal stars do me good I have been quite ill of late And so well near the centre of our national demesne these night views of the Mississippi UPON OUR OWN LAND Always after supper take a walk half a mile long says an old proverb dryly adding and if convenient let it be upon your own land I wonder does any other nation but ours afford opportunity for such a jaunt as this Indeed has any previous period afforded it No one I discover begins to know the real geographic democratic indissoluble American Union in the present or suspect it in the future until he explores these Central States and dwells awhile observantly on their prairies or amid their busy towns and the mighty father of waters A ride of two or three thousand miles on one s own land with hardly a disconnection could certainly be had in no other place than the United States and at no period before this If you want to see what the railroad is and how civilization and progress date from it how it is the conqueror of crude nature which it turns to man s use both on small scales and on the largest come hither to inland America I return d home east Jan five eighteen eighty having travers d to and fro and across ten thousand miles and more I soon resumed my seclusions down in the woods or by the creek or gaddings about cities and an occasional disquisition as will be seen following EDGAR POE S SIGNIFICANCE Jan one eighty In diagnosing this disease called humanity to assume for the nonce what seems a chief mood of the personality and writings of my subject I have thought that poets somewhere or other on the list present the most mark d indications Comprehending artists in a mass musicians painters actors and so on and considering each and all of them as radiations or flanges of that furious whirling wheel poetry the centre and axis of the whole where else indeed may we so well investigate the causes growths tally marks of the time the age s matter and malady By common consent there is nothing better for man or woman than a perfect and noble life morally without flaw happily balanced in activity physically sound and pure giving its due proportion and no more to the sympathetic the human emotional element a life in all these unhasting unresting untiring to the end And yet there is another shape of personality dearer far to the artist sense which likes the play of strongest lights and shades where the perfect character the good the heroic although never attain d is never lost sight of but through failures sorrows temporary downfalls is return d to again and again and while often violated is passionately adhered to as long as mind muscles voice obey the power we call volition This sort of personality we see more or less in Burns Byron Schiller and George Sand But we do not see it in Edgar Poe All this is the result of reading at intervals the last three days a new volume of his poems I took it on my rambles down by the pond and by degrees read it all through there While to the character first outlined the service Poe renders is certainly that entire contrast and contradiction which is next best to fully exemplifying it Almost without the first sign of moral principle or of the concrete or its heroisms or the simpler affections of the heart Poe s verses illustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty with the rhyming art to excess an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal themes a demoniac undertone behind every page and by final judgment probably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature brilliant and dazzling but with no heat There is an indescribable magnetism about the poet s life and reminiscences as well as the poems To one who could work out their subtle retracing and retrospect the latter would make a close tally no doubt between the author s birth and antecedents his childhood and youth his physique his so call d education his studies and associates the literary and social Baltimore Richmond Philadelphia and New York of those times not only the places and circumstances in themselves but often very often in a strange spurning of and reaction from them all The following from a report in the Washington Star of November sixteen eighteen seventy five may afford those who care for it something further of my point of view toward this interesting figure and influence of our era There occurr d about that date in Baltimore a public reburial of Poe s remains and dedication of a monument over the grave Being in Washington on a visit at the time the old gray went over to Baltimore and though ill from paralysis consented to hobble up and silently take a seat on the platform but refused to make any speech saying I have felt a strong impulse to come over and be here to day myself in memory of Poe which I have obey d but not the slightest impulse to make a speech which my dear friends must also be obeyed In an informal circle however in conversation after the ceremonies Whitman said For a long while and until lately I had a distaste for Poe s writings I wanted and still want for poetry the clear sun shining and fresh air blowing the strength and power of health not of delirium even amid the stormiest passions with always the background of the eternal moralities Non complying with these requirements Poe s genius has yet conquer d a special recognition for itself and I too have come to fully admit it and appreciate it and him In a dream I once had I saw a vessel on the sea at midnight in a storm It was no great full rigg d ship nor majestic steamer steering firmly through the gale but seem d one of those superb little schooner yachts I had often seen lying anchor d rocking so jauntily in the waters around New York or up Long Island sound now flying uncontroll d with torn sails and broken spars through the wild sleet and winds and waves of the night On the deck was a slender slight beautiful figure a dim man apparently enjoying all the terror the murk and the dislocation of which he was the centre and the victim That figure of my lurid dream might stand for Edgar Poe his spirit his fortunes and his poems themselves all lurid dreams Much more may be said but I most desired to exploit the idea put at the beginning By its popular poets the calibres of an age the weak spots of its embankments its sub currents often more significant than the biggest surface ones are unerringly indicated The lush and the weird that have taken such extraordinary possession of Nineteenth century verse lovers what mean they The inevitable tendency of poetic culture to morbidity abnormal beauty the sickliness of all technical thought or refinement in itself the abnegation of the perennial and democratic concretes at first hand the body the earth and sea sex and the like and the substitution of something for them at second or third hand what bearings have they on current pathological study BEETHOVEN S SEPTETTE Feb eleven eighty At a good concert to night in the foyer of the opera house Philadelphia the band a small but first rate one Never did music more sink into and soothe and fill me never so prove its soul rousing power its impossibility of statement Especially in the rendering of one of Beethoven s master septettes by the well chosen and perfectly combined instruments violins viola clarionet horn cello and contrabass was I carried away seeing absorbing many wonders Dainty abandon sometimes as if Nature laughing on a hillside in the sunshine serious and firm monotonies as of winds a horn sounding through the tangle of the forest and the dying echoes soothing floating of waves but presently rising in surges angrily lashing muttering heavy piercing peals of laughter for interstices now and then weird as Nature herself is in certain moods but mainly spontaneous easy careless often the sentiment of the postures of naked children playing or sleeping It did me good even to watch the violinists drawing their bows so masterly every motion a study I allow d myself as I sometimes do to wander out of myself The conceit came to me of a copious grove of singing birds and in their midst a simple harmonic duo two human souls steadily asserting their own pensiveness joyousness A HINT OF WILD NATURE Feb thirteen As I was crossing the Delaware to day saw a large flock of wild geese right overhead not very high up ranged in V shape in relief against the noon clouds of light smoke color Had a capital though momentary view of them and then of their course on and on southeast till gradually fading my eyesight yet first rate for the open air and its distances but I use glasses for reading Queer thoughts melted into me the two or three minutes or less seeing these creatures cleaving the sky the spacious airy realm even the prevailing smoke gray color everywhere no sun shining the waters below the rapid flight of the birds appearing just for a minute flashing to me such a hint of the whole spread of Nature with her eternal unsophisticated freshness her never visited recesses of sea sky shore and then disappearing in the distance LOAFING IN THE WOODS March eight I write this down in the country again but in a new spot seated on a log in the woods warm sunny midday Have been loafing here deep among the trees shafts of tall pines oak hickory with a thick undergrowth of laurels and grapevines the ground cover d everywhere by debris dead leaves breakage moss everything solitary ancient grim Paths such as they are leading hither and yon how made I know not for nobody seems to come here nor man nor cattle kind Temperature to day about sixty the wind through the pine tops I sit and listen to its hoarse sighing above and to the stillness long and long varied by aimless rambles in the old roads and paths and by exercise pulls at the young saplings to keep my joints from getting stiff Blue birds robins meadow larks begin to appear Next day ninth A snowstorm in the morning and continuing most of the day But I took a walk over two hours the same woods and paths amid the falling flakes No wind yet the musical low murmur through the pines quite pronounced curious like waterfalls now still d now pouring again All the senses sight sound smell delicately gratified Every snowflake lay where it fell on the evergreens holly trees laurels c the multitudinous leaves and branches piled bulging white defined by edge lines of emerald the tall straight columns of the plentiful bronze topt pines a slight resinous odor blending with that of the snow For there is a scent to everything even the snow if you can only detect it no two places hardly any two hours anywhere exactly alike How different the odor of noon from midnight or winter from summer or a windy spell from a still one A CONTRALTO VOICE May nine Sunday Visit this evening to my friends the J s good supper to which I did justice lively chat with missus J and I and J As I sat out front on the walk afterward in the evening air the church choir and organ on the corner opposite gave Luther s hymn Ein feste berg very finely The air was borne by a rich contralto For nearly half an hour there in the dark there was a good string of English stanzas came the music firm and unhurried with long pauses The full silver star beams of Lyra rose silently over the church s dim roof ridge Vari color d lights from the stain d glass windows broke through the tree shadows And under all under the Northern Crown up there and in the fresh breeze below and the chiaroscuro of the night that liquid full contralto SEEING NIAGARA TO ADVANTAGE June four eighty For really seizing a great picture or book or piece of music or architecture or grand scenery or perhaps for the first time even the common sunshine or landscape or may be even the mystery of identity most curious mystery of all there comes some lucky five minutes of a man s life set amid a fortuitous concurrence of circumstances and bringing in a brief flash the culmination of years of reading and travel and thought The present case about two o clock this afternoon gave me Niagara its superb severity of action and color and majestic grouping in one short indescribable show We were very slowly crossing the Suspension bridge not a full stop anywhere but next to it the day clear sunny still and I out on the platform The falls were in plain view about a mile off but very distinct and no roar hardly a murmur The river tumbling green and white far below me the dark high banks the plentiful umbrage many bronze cedars in shadow and tempering and arching all the immense materiality a clear sky overhead with a few white clouds limpid spiritual silent Brief and as quiet as brief that picture a remembrance always afterwards Such are the things indeed I lay away with my life s rare and blessed bits of hours reminiscent past the wild sea storm I once saw one winter day off Fire island the elder Booth in Richard that famous night forty years ago in the old Bowery or Alboni in the children s scene in Norma or night views I remember on the field after battles in Virginia or the peculiar sentiment of moonlight and stars over the great Plains western Kansas or scooting up New York bay with a stiff breeze and a good yacht off Navesink With these I say I henceforth place that view that afternoon that combination complete that five minutes perfect absorption of Niagara not the great majestic gem alone by itself but set complete in all its varied full indispensable surroundings JAUNTING TO CANADA To go back a little I left Philadelphia ninth and Green streets at eight o clock P M June three on a first class sleeper by the Lehigh Valley North Pennsylvania route through Bethlehem Wilkesbarre Waverly and so by Erie on through Corning to Hornellsville where we arrived at eight morning and had a bounteous breakfast I must say I never put in such a good night on any railroad track smooth firm the minimum of jolting and all the swiftness compatible with safety So without change to Buffalo and thence to Clifton where we arrived early afternoon then on to London Ontario Canada in four more less than twenty two hours altogether I am domiciled at the hospitable house of my friends doctor and missus Bucke in the ample and charming garden and lawns of the asylum SUNDAY WITH THE INSANE June six Went over to the religious services Episcopal main Insane asylum held in a lofty good sized hall third story Plain boards whitewash plenty of cheap chairs no ornament or color yet all scrupulously clean and sweet Some three hundred persons present mostly patients Everything the prayers a short sermon the firm orotund voice of the minister and most of all beyond any portraying or suggesting that audience deeply impress d me I was furnish d with an arm chair near the pulpit and sat facing the motley yet perfectly well behaved and orderly congregation The quaint dresses and bonnets of some of the women several very old and gray here and there like the heads in old pictures O the looks that came from those faces There were two or three I shall probably never forget Nothing at all markedly repulsive or hideous strange enough I did not see one such Our common humanity mine and yours everywhere The same old blood the same red running blood yet behind most an inferr d arriere of such storms such wrecks such mysteries fires love wrong greed for wealth religious problems crosses mirror d from those crazed faces yet now temporarily so calm like still waters all the woes and sad happenings of life and death now from every one the devotional element radiating was it not indeed the peace of God that passeth all understanding strange as it may sound I can only say that I took long and searching eyesweeps as I sat there and it seem d so rousing unprecedented thoughts problems unanswerable A very fair choir and melodeon accompaniment They sang Lead kindly light after the sermon Many join d in the beautiful hymn to which the minister read the introductory text In the daytime also He led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire Then the words Lead kindly light amid the encircling gloom Lead thou me on The night is dark and I am far from home Lead thou me on Keep thou my feet I do not ask to see The distant scene one step enough for me I was not ever thus nor pray d that thou Should saint lead me on I lov d to choose and see my path but now Lead thou me on I loved the garish day and spite of fears Pride ruled my will remember not past years A couple of days after I went to the Refractory building under special charge of doctor Beemer and through the wards pretty thoroughly both the men s and women s I have since made many other visits of the kind through the asylum and around among the detach d cottages As far as I could see this is among the most advanced perfected and kindly and rationally carried on of all its kind in America It is a town in itself with many buildings and a thousand inhabitants I learn that Canada and especially this ample and populous province Ontario has the very best and plentiest benevolent institutions in all departments REMINISCENCE OF ELIAS HICKS June eight To day a letter from missus E S L Detroit accompanied in a little post office roll by a rare old engraved head of Elias Hicks from a portrait in oil by Henry Inman painted for J V S must have been sixty years or more ago in New York among the rest the following excerpt about E H in the letter I have listen d to his preaching so often when a child and sat with my mother at social gatherings where he was the centre and every one so pleas d and stirr d by his conversation I hear that you contemplate writing or speaking about him and I wonder d whether you had a picture of him As I am the owner of two I send you one GRAND NATIVE GROWTH In a few days I go to lake Huron and may have something to say of that region and people From what I already see I should say the young native population of Canada was growing up forming a hardy democratic intelligent radically sound and just as American good natured and individualistic race as the average range of best specimens among us As among us too I please myself by considering that this element though it may not be the majority promises to be the leaven which must eventually leaven the whole lump A ZOLLVEREIN BETWEEN THE U S AND CANADA Some of the more liberal of the presses here are discussing the question of a zollverein between the United States and Canada It is proposed to form a union for commercial purposes to altogether abolish the frontier tariff line with its double sets of custom house officials now existing between the two countries and to agree upon one tariff for both the proceeds of this tariff to be divided between the two governments on the basis of population It is said that a large proportion of the merchants of Canada are in favor of this step as they believe it would materially add to the business of the country by removing the restrictions that now exist on trade between Canada and the States Those persons who are opposed to the measure believe that it would increase the material welfare or the country but it would loosen the bonds between Canada and England and this sentiment overrides the desire for commercial prosperity Whether the sentiment can continue to bear the strain put upon it is a question It is thought by many that commercial considerations must in the end prevail It seems also to be generally agreed that such a zollverein or common customs union would bring practically more benefits to the Canadian provinces than to the United States It seems to me a certainty of time sooner or later that Canada shall form two or three grand States equal and independent with the rest of the American Union The saint Lawrence and lakes are not for a frontier line but a grand interior or mid channel THE saint LAWRENCE LINE August twenty Premising that my three or four months in Canada were intended among the rest as an exploration of the line of the saint Lawrence from lake Superior to the sea the engineers here insist upon considering it as one stream over two thousand miles long including lakes and Niagara and all that I have only partially carried out my programme but for the seven or eight hundred miles so far fulfill d I find that the Canada question is absolutely control d by this vast water line with its first class features and points of trade humanity and many more here I am writing this nearly a thousand miles north of my Philadelphia starting point by way of Montreal and Quebec in the midst of regions that go to a further extreme of grimness wildness of beauty and a sort of still and pagan scaredness while yet Christian inhabitable and partially fertile than perhaps any other on earth The weather remains perfect some might call it a little cool but I wear my old gray overcoat and find it just right The days are full of sunbeams and oxygen Most of the forenoons and afternoons I am on the forward deck of the steamer THE SAVAGE SAGUENAY Up these black waters over a hundred miles always strong deep hundreds of feet sometimes thousands ever with high rocky hills for banks green and gray at times a little like some parts of the Hudson but much more pronounc d and defiant The hills rise higher keep their ranks more unbroken The river is straighter and of more resolute flow and its hue though dark as ink exquisitely polish d and sheeny under the August sun Different indeed this Saguenay from all other rivers different effects a bolder more vehement play of lights and shades Of a rare charm of singleness and simplicity Like the organ chant at midnight from the old Spanish convent in Favorita one strain only simple and monotonous and unornamented but indescribably penetrating and grand and masterful Great place for echoes while our steamer was tied at the wharf at Tadousac taj oo sac waiting the escape pipe letting off steam I was sure I heard a band at the hotel up in the rocks could even make out some of the tunes Only when our pipe stopp d I knew what caused it Then at cape Eternity and Trinity rock the pilot with his whistle producing similar marvellous results echoes indescribably weird as we lay off in the still bay under their shadows CAPES ETERNITY AND TRINITY But the great haughty silent capes themselves I doubt if any crack points or hills or historic places of note or anything of the kind elsewhere in the world outvies these objects I write while I am before them face to face They are very simple they do not startle at least they did not me but they linger in one s memory forever They are placed very near each other side by side each a mountain rising flush out of the Saguenay A good thrower could throw a stone on each in passing at least it seems so Then they are as distinct in form as a perfect physical man or a perfect physical woman Cape Eternity is bare rising as just said sheer out of the water rugged and grim yet with an indescribable beauty nearly two thousand feet high Trinity rock even a little higher also rising flush top rounded like a great head with close cut verdure of hair I consider myself well repaid for coming my thousand miles to get the sight and memory of the unrivall d duo They have stirr d me more profoundly than anything of the kind I have yet seen If Europe or Asia had them we should certainly hear of them in all sorts of sent back poems rhapsodies c a dozen times a year through our papers and magazines CHICOUTIMI AND HA HA BAY No indeed life and travel and memory have offer d and will preserve to me no deeper cut incidents panorama or sights to cheer my soul than these at Chicoutimi and Ha ha bay and my days and nights up and down this fascinating savage river the rounded mountains some bare and gray some dull red some draped close all over with matted green verdure or vines the ample calm eternal rocks everywhere the long streaks of motley foam a milk white curd on the glistening breast of the stream the little two masted schooner dingy yellow with patch d sails set wing and wing nearing us coming saucily up the water with a couple of swarthy black hair d men aboard the strong shades falling on the light gray or yellow outlines of the hills all through the forenoon as we steam within gunshot of them while ever the pure and delicate sky spreads over all And the splendid sunsets and the sights of evening the same old stars relatively a little different I see so far north Arcturus and Lyra and the Eagle and great Jupiter like a silver globe and the constellation of the Scorpion Then northern lights nearly every night THE INHABITANTS GOOD LIVING Grim and rocky and black water d as the demesne hereabout is however you must not think genial humanity and comfort and good living are not to be met Before I began this memorandum I made a first rate breakfast of sea trout finishing off with wild raspberries I find smiles and courtesy everywhere physiognomies in general curiously like those in the United States I was astonish d to find the same resemblance all through the province of Quebec In general the inhabitants of this rugged country Charlevoix Chicoutimi and Tadousac counties and lake saint John region a simple hardy population lumbering trapping furs boating fishing berry picking and a little farming I was watching a group of young boatmen eating their early dinner nothing but an immense loaf of bread had apparently been the size of a bushel measure from which they cut chunks with a jack knife Must be a tremendous winter country this when the solid frost and ice fully set in CEDAR PLUMS LIKE NAMES Back again in Camden and down in Jersey One time I thought of naming this collection Cedar Plums Like which I still fancy wouldn t have been a bad name nor inappropriate A melange of loafing looking hobbling sitting traveling a little thinking thrown in for salt but very little not only summer but all seasons not only days but nights some literary meditations books authors examined Carlyle Poe Emerson tried always under my cedar tree in the open air and never in the library mostly the scenes everybody sees but some of my own caprices meditations egotism truly an open air and mainly summer formation singly or in clusters wild and free and somewhat acrid indeed more like cedar plums than you might guess at first glance But do you know what they are To city man or some sweet parlor lady I now talk As you go along roads or barrens or across country anywhere through these States middle eastern western or southern you will see certain seasons of the year the thick woolly tufts of the cedar mottled with bunches of china blue berries about as big as fox grapes But first a special word for the tree itself everybody knows that the cedar is a healthy cheap democratic wood streak d red and white an evergreen that it is not a cultivated tree that it keeps away moths that it grows inland or seaboard all climates hot or cold any soil in fact rather prefers sand and bleak side spots content if the plough the fertilizer and the trimming axe will but keep away and let it alone After a long rain when everything looks bright often have I stopt in my wood saunters south or north or far west to take in its dusky green wash d clean and sweet and speck d copiously with its fruit of clear hardy blue The wood of the cedar is of use but what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums A question impossible to answer satisfactorily True some of the herb doctors give them for stomachic affections but the remedy is as bad as the disease Then in my rambles down in Camden county I once found an old crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy She show d as I was told afterward a sort of infatuation for them and every year placed and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room They had a strange charm on her uneasy head and effected docility and peace She was harmless and lived near by with her well off married daughter Whether there is any connection between those bunches and being out of one s wits I cannot say but I myself entertain a weakness for them Indeed I love the cedar anyhow its naked ruggedness its just palpable odor so different from the perfumer s best its silence its equable acceptance of winter s cold and summer s heat of rain or drouth its shelter to me from those at times its associations well I never could explain why I love anybody or anything The service I now specially owe to the cedar is while I cast around for a name for my proposed collection hesitating puzzled after rejecting a long long string I lift my eyes and lo the very term I want At any rate I go no further I tire in the search I take what some invisible kind spirit has put before me Besides who shall say there is not affinity enough between at least the bundle of sticks that produced many of these pieces or granulations and those blue berries their uselessness growing wild a certain aroma of Nature I would so like to have in my pages the thin soil whence they come their content in being let alone their stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions this latter the nearest dearest trait affinity of all Then reader dear in conclusion as to the point of the name for the present collection let us be satisfied to have a name something to identify and bind it together to concrete all its vegetable mineral personal memoranda abrupt raids of criticism crude gossip of philosophy varied sands and clumps without bothering ourselves because certain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under their own name with entire fitness or amiability It is a profound vexatious never explicable matter this of names I have been exercised deeply about it my whole life eleven After all of which the name Cedar Plums Like got its nose put out of joint but I cannot afford to throw away what I pencill d down the lane there under the shelter of my old friend one warm October noon Besides it wouldn t be civil to the cedar tree Note eleven In the pocket of my receptacle book I find a list of suggested and rejected names for this volume or parts of it

Vestibules Types and Semi Tones Scintilla at sixty and after Oddments Sand Drifts Sands on the Shores of sixty four Again and Again DEATH OF THOMAS CARLYLE Feb ten eighty one And so the flame of the lamp after long wasting and flickering has gone out entirely As a representative author a literary figure no man else will bequeath to the future more significant hints of our stormy era its fierce paradoxes its din and its struggling parturition periods than Carlyle He belongs to our own branch of the stock too neither Latin nor Greek but altogether Gothic Rugged mountainous volcanic he was himself more a French revolution than any of his volumes In some respects so far in the Nineteenth century the best equipt keenest mind even from the college point of view of all Britain only he had an ailing body Dyspepsia is to be traced in every page and now and then fills the page One may include among the lessons of his life even though that life stretch d to amazing length how behind the tally of genius and morals stands the stomach and gives a sort of casting vote Two conflicting agonistic elements seem to have contended in the man sometimes pulling him different ways like wild horses He was a cautious conservative Scotchman fully aware what a foetid gas bag much of modern radicalism is but then his great heart demanded reform demanded change often terribly at odds with his scornful brain No author ever put so much wailing and despair into his books sometimes palpable oftener latent He reminds me of that passage in Young s poems where as death presses closer and closer for his prey the soul rushes hither and thither appealing shrieking berating to escape the general doom Of short comings even positive blur spots from an American point of view he had serious share Not for his merely literary merit though that was great not as maker of books but as launching into the self complacent atmosphere of our days a rasping questioning dislocating agitation and shock is Carlyle s final value It is time the English speaking peoples had some true idea about the verteber of genius namely power As if they must always have it cut and bias d to the fashion like a lady s cloak What a needed service he performs How he shakes our comfortable reading circles with a touch of the old Hebraic anger and prophecy and indeed it is just the same Not Isaiah himself more scornful more threatening The crown of pride the drunkards of Ephraim shall be trodden under feet And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower The word prophecy is much misused it seems narrow d to prediction merely That is not the main sense of the Hebrew word translated prophet it means one whose mind bubbles up and pours forth as a fountain from inner divine spontaneities revealing God Prediction is a very minor part of prophecy The great matter is to reveal and outpour the God like suggestions pressing for birth in the soul This is briefly the doctrine of the Friends or Quakers Then the simplicity and amid ostensible frailty the towering strength of this man a hardy oak knot you could never wear out an old farmer dress d in brown clothes and not handsome his very foibles fascinating Who cares that he wrote about doctor Francia and Shooting Niagara and the Nigger Question and didn t at all admire our United States I doubt if he ever thought or said half as bad words about us as we deserve How he splashes like leviathan in the seas of modern literature and politics Doubtless respecting the latter one needs first to realize from actual observation the squalor vice and doggedness ingrain d in the bulk population of the British islands with the red tape the fatuity the flunkeyism everywhere to understand the last meaning in his pages Accordingly though he was no chartist or radical I consider Carlyle s by far the most indignant comment or protest anent the fruits of feudalism to day in Great Britain the increasing poverty and degradation of the homeless landless twenty millions while a few thousands or rather a few hundreds possess the entire soil the money and the fat berths Trade and shipping and clubs and culture and prestige and guns and a fine select class of gentry and aristocracy with every modern improvement cannot begin to salve or defend such stupendous hoggishness The way to test how much he has left his country were to consider or try to consider for a moment the array of British thought the resultant ensemble of the last fifty years as existing to day but with Carlyle left out It would be like an army with no artillery The show were still a gay and rich one Byron Scott Tennyson and many more horsemen and rapid infantry and banners flying but the last heavy roar so dear to the ear of the train d soldier and that settles fate and victory would be lacking For the last three years we in America have had transmitted glimpses of a thin bodied lonesome wifeless childless very old man lying on a sofa kept out of bed by indomitable will but of late never well enough to take the open air I have noted this news from time to time in brief descriptions in the papers A week ago I read such an item just before I started out for my customary evening stroll between eight and nine In the fine cold night unusually clear Feb five eighty one as I walk d some open grounds adjacent the condition of Carlyle and his approaching perhaps even then actual death filled me with thoughts eluding statement and curiously blending with the scene The planet Venus an hour high in the west with all her volume and lustre recover d she has been shorn and languid for nearly a year including an additional sentiment I never noticed before not merely voluptuous Paphian steeping fascinating now with calm commanding seriousness and hauteur the Milo Venus now Upward to the zenith Jupiter Saturn and the moon past her quarter trailing in procession with the Pleiades following and the constellation Taurus and red Aldebaran Not a cloud in heaven Orion strode through the southeast with his glittering belt and a trifle below hung the sun of the night Sirius Every star dilated more vitreous nearer than usual Not as in some clear nights when the larger stars entirely outshine the rest Every little star or cluster just as distinctly visible and just as nigh Berenice s hair showing every gem and new ones To the northeast and north the Sickle the Goat and kids Cassiopeia Castor and Pollux and the two Dippers While through the whole of this silent indescribable show inclosing and bathing my whole receptivity ran the thought of Carlyle dying To soothe and spiritualize and as far as may be solve the mysteries of death and genius consider them under the stars at midnight And now that he has gone hence can it be that Thomas Carlyle soon to chemically dissolve in ashes and by winds remains an identity still In ways perhaps eluding all the statements lore and speculations of ten thousand years eluding all possible statements to mortal sense does he yet exist a definite vital being a spirit an individual perhaps now wafted in space among those stellar systems which suggestive and limitless as they are merely edge more limitless far more suggestive systems I have no doubt of it In silence of a fine night such questions are answer d to the soul the best answers that can be given With me too when depress d by some specially sad event or tearing problem I wait till I go out under the stars for the last voiceless satisfaction CARLYLE FROM AMERICAN POINTS OF VIEW Later Thoughts and Jottings There is surely at present an inexplicable rapport all the more piquant from its contradictoriness between that deceas d author and our United States of America no matter whether it lasts or not thirteen As we Westerners assume definite shape and result in formations and fruitage unknown before it is curious with what a new sense our eyes turn to representative outgrowths of crises and personages in the Old World Beyond question since Carlyle s death and the publication of Froude s memoirs not only the interest in his books but every personal bit regarding the famous Scotchman his dyspepsia his buffetings his parentage his paragon of a wife his career in Edinburgh in the lonesome nest on Craigenputtock moor and then so many years in London is probably wider and livelier to day in this country than in his own land Whether I succeed or no I too reaching across the Atlantic and taking the man s dark fortune telling of humanity and politics would offset it all such is the fancy that comes to me by a far more profound horoscope casting of those themes G F Hegel s fourteen First about a chance a never fulfill d vacuity of this pale cast of thought this British Hamlet from Cheyne row more puzzling than the Danish one with his contrivances for settling the broken and spavin d joints of the world s government especially its democratic dislocation Carlyle s grim fate was cast to live and dwell in and largely embody the parturition agony and qualms of the old order amid crowded accumulations of ghastly morbidity giving birth to the new But conceive of him or his parents before him coming to America recuperated by the cheering realities and activity of our people and country growing up and delving face to face resolutely among us here especially at the West inhaling and exhaling our limitless air and eligibilities devoting his mind to the theories and developments of this Republic amid its practical facts as exemplified in Kansas Missouri Illinois Tennessee or Louisiana I say facts and face to face confrontings so different from books and all those quiddities and mere reports in the libraries upon which the man it was wittily said of him at the age of thirty that there was no one in Scotland who had glean d so much and seen so little almost wholly fed and which even his sturdy and vital mind but reflected at best Something of the sort narrowly escaped happening In eighteen thirty five after more than a dozen years of trial and non success the author of Sartor Resartus removing to London very poor a confirmed hypochondriac Sartor universally scoffed at no literary prospects ahead deliberately settled on one last casting throw of the literary dice resolv d to compose and launch forth a book on the subject of the French Revolution and if that won no higher guerdon or prize than hitherto to sternly abandon the trade of author forever and emigrate for good to America But the venture turn d out a lucky one and there was no emigration Carlyle s work in the sphere of literature as he commenced and carried it out is the same in one or two leading respects that Immanuel Kant s was in speculative philosophy But the Scotchman had none of the stomachic phlegm and never perturb d placidity of the Konigsberg sage and did not like the latter understand his own limits and stop when he got to the end of them He clears away jungle and poisonvines and underbrush at any rate hacks valiantly at them smiting hip and thigh Kant did the like in his sphere and it was all he profess d to do his labors have left the ground fully prepared ever since and greater service was probably never perform d by mortal man But the pang and hiatus of Carlyle seem to me to consist in the evidence everywhere that amid a whirl of fog and fury and cross purposes he firmly believ d he had a clue to the medication of the world s ills and that his bounden mission was to exploit it fifteen There were two anchors or sheet anchors for steadying as a last resort the Carlylean ship One will be specified presently The other perhaps the main was only to be found in some mark d form of personal force an extreme degree of competent urge and will a man or men born to command Probably there ran through every vein and current of the Scotchman s blood something that warm d up to this kind of trait and character above aught else in the world and which makes him in my opinion the chief celebrater and promulger of it in literature more than Plutarch more than Shakspere The great masses of humanity stand for nothing at least nothing but nebulous raw material only the big planets and shining suns for him To ideas almost invariably languid or cold a number one forceful personality was sure to rouse his eulogistic passion and savage joy In such case even the standard of duty hereinafter rais d was to be instantly lower d and vail d All that is comprehended under the terms republicanism and democracy were distasteful to him from the first and as he grew older they became hateful and contemptible For an undoubtedly candid and penetrating faculty such as his the bearings he persistently ignored were marvellous For instance the promise nay certainty of the democratic principle to each and every State of the current world not so much of helping it to perfect legislators and executives but as the only effectual method for surely however slowly training people on a large scale toward voluntarily ruling and managing themselves the ultimate aim of political and all other development to gradually reduce the fact of governing to its minimum and to subject all its staffs and their doings to the telescopes and microscopes of committees and parties and greatest of all to afford not stagnation and obedient content which went well enough with the feudalism and ecclesiasticism of the antique and medieval world but a vast and sane and recurrent ebb and tide action for those floods of the great deep that have henceforth palpably burst forever their old bounds seem never to have enter d Carlyle s thought It was splendid how he refus d any compromise to the last He was curiously antique In that harsh picturesque most potent voice and figure one seems to be carried back from the present of the British islands more than two thousand years to the range between Jerusalem and Tarsus His fullest best biographer justly says of him He was a teacher and a prophet in the Jewish sense of the word The prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah have become a part of the permanent spiritual inheritance of mankind because events proved that they had interpreted correctly the sign of their own times and their prophecies were fulfill d Carlyle like them believ d that he had a special message to deliver to the present age Whether he was correct in that belief and whether his message was a true message remains to be seen He has told us that our most cherish d ideas of political liberty with their kindred corollaries are mere illusions and that the progress which has seem d to go along with them is a progress towards anarchy and social dissolution If he was wrong he has misused his powers The principles of his teachings are false He has offer d himself as a guide upon a road of which he had no knowledge and his own desire for himself would be the speediest oblivion both of his person and his works If on the other hand he has been right if like his great predecessors he has read truly the tendencies of this modern age of ours and his teaching is authenticated by facts then Carlyle too will take his place among the inspired seers To which I add an amendment that under no circumstances and no matter how completely time and events disprove his lurid vaticinations should the English speaking world forget this man nor fail to hold in honor his unsurpass d conscience his unique method and his honest fame Never were convictions more earnest and genuine Never was there less of a flunkey or temporizer Never had political progressivism a foe it could more heartily respect The second main point of Carlyle s utterance was the idea of duty being done It is simply a new codicil if it be particularly new which is by no means certain on the time honor d bequest of dynasticism the mould eaten rules of legitimacy and kings He seems to have been impatient sometimes to madness when reminded by persons who thought at least as deeply as himself that this formula though precious is rather a vague one and that there are many other considerations to a philosophical estimate of each and every department either Altogether I don t know anything more amazing than these persistent strides and throbbings so far through our Nineteenth century of perhaps its biggest sharpest and most erudite brain in defiance and discontent with everything contemptuously ignoring either from constitutional inaptitude ignorance itself or more likely because he demanded a definite cure all here and now the only solace and solvent to be had There is apart from mere intellect in the make up of every superior human identity in its moral completeness considered as ensemble not for that moral alone but for the whole being including physique a wondrous something that realizes without argument frequently without what is called education though I think it the goal and apex of all education deserving the name an intuition of the absolute balance in time and space of the whole of this multifarious mad chaos of fraud frivolity hoggishness this revel of fools and incredible make believe and general unsettledness we call the world a soul sight of that divine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of things all history and time and all events however trivial however momentous like a leash d dog in the hand of the hunter Such soul sight and root centre for the mind mere optimism explains only the surface or fringe of it Carlyle was mostly perhaps entirely without He seems instead to have been haunted in the play of his mental action by a spectre never entirely laid from first to last Greek scholars I believe find the same mocking and fantastic apparition attending Aristophanes his comedies the spectre of world destruction How largest triumph or failure in human life in war or peace may depend on some little hidden centrality hardly more than a drop of blood a pulse beat or a breath of air It is certain that all these weighty matters democracy in America Carlyleism and the temperament for deepest political or literary exploration turn on a simple point in speculative philosophy The most profound theme that can occupy the mind of man the problem on whose solution science art the bases and pursuits of nations and everything else including intelligent human happiness here to day eighteen eighty two New York Texas California the same as all times all lands subtly and finally resting depends for competent outset and argument is doubtless involved in the query What is the fusing explanation and tie what the relation between the radical democratic Me the human identity of understanding emotions spirit c on the one side of and with the conservative Not Me the whole of the material objective universe and laws with what is behind them in time and space on the other side Immanuel Kant though he explain d or partially explain d as may be said the laws of the human understanding left this question an open one Schelling s answer or suggestion of answer is and very valuable and important as far as it goes that the same general and particular intelligence passion even the standards of right and wrong which exist in a conscious and formulated state in man exist in an unconscious state or in perceptible analogies throughout the entire universe of external Nature in all its objects large or small and all its movements and processes thus making the impalpable human mind and concrete nature notwithstanding their duality and separation convertible and in centrality and essence one But G F Hegel s fuller statement of the matter probably remains the last best word that has been said upon it up to date Substantially adopting the scheme just epitomized he so carries it out and fortifies it and merges everything in it with certain serious gaps now for the first time fill d that it becomes a coherent metaphysical system and substantial answer as far as there can be any answer to the foregoing question a system which while I distinctly admit that the brain of the future may add to revise and even entirely reconstruct at any rate beams forth to day in its entirety illuminating the thought of the universe and satisfying the mystery thereof to the human mind with a more consoling scientific assurance than any yet According to Hegel the whole earth an old nucleus thought as in the Vedas and no doubt before but never hitherto brought so absolutely to the front fully surcharged with modern scientism and facts and made the sole entrance to each and all with its infinite variety the past the surroundings of to day or what may happen in the future the contrarieties of material with spiritual and of natural with artificial are all to the eye of the ensemblist but necessary sides and unfoldings different steps or links in the endless process of Creative thought which amid numberless apparent failures and contradictions is held together by central and never broken unity not contradictions or failures at all but radiations of one consistent and eternal purpose the whole mass of everything steadily unerringly tending and flowing toward the permanent utile and morale as rivers to oceans As life is the whole law and incessant effort of the visible universe and death only the other or invisible side of the same so the utile so truth so health are the continuous immutable laws of the moral universe and vice and disease with all their perturbations are but transient even if ever so prevalent expressions To politics throughout Hegel applies the like catholic standard and faith Not any one party or any one form of government is absolutely and exclusively true Truth consists in the just relations of objects to each other A majority or democracy may rule as outrageously and do as great harm as an oligarchy or despotism though far less likely to do so But the great evil is either a violation of the relations just referr d to or of the moral law The specious the unjust the cruel and what is called the unnatural though not only permitted but in a certain sense like shade to light inevitable in the divine scheme are by the whole constitution of that scheme partial inconsistent temporary and though having ever so great an ostensible majority are certainly destin d to failures after causing great suffering Theology Hegel translates into science sixteen All apparent contradictions in the statement of the Deific nature by different ages nations churches points of view are but fractional and imperfect expressions of one essential unity from which they all proceed crude endeavors or distorted parts to be regarded both as distinct and united In short to put it in our own form or summing up that thinker or analyzer or overlooker who by an inscrutable combination of train d wisdom and natural intuition most fully accepts in perfect faith the moral unity and sanity of the creative scheme in history science and all life and time present and future is both the truest cosmical devotee or religioso and the profoundest philosopher While he who by the spell of himself and his circumstance sees darkness and despair in the sum of the workings of God s providence and who in that denies or prevaricates is no matter how much piety plays on his lips the most radical sinner and infidel I am the more assured in recounting Hegel a little freely here seventeen not only for offsetting the Carlylean letter and spirit cutting it out all and several from the very roots and below the roots but to counterpoise since the late death and deserv d apotheosis of Darwin the tenets of the evolutionists Unspeakably precious as those are to biology and henceforth indispensable to a right aim and estimate in study they neither comprise or explain everything and the last word or whisper still remains to be breathed after the utmost of those claims floating high and forever above them all and above technical metaphysics While the contributions which German Kant and Fichte and Schelling and Hegel have bequeath d to humanity and which English Darwin has also in his field are indispensable to the erudition of America s future I should say that in all of them and the best of them when compared with the lightning flashes and flights of the old prophets and exaltes the spiritual poets and poetry of all lands as in the Hebrew Bible there seems to be nay certainly is something lacking something cold a failure to satisfy the deepest emotions of the soul a want of living glow fondness warmth which the old exaltes and poets supply and which the keenest modern philosophers so far do not Upon the whole and for our purposes this man s name certainly belongs on the list with the just specified first class moral physicians of our current era and with Emerson and two or three others though his prescription is drastic and perhaps destructive while theirs is assimilating normal and tonic Feudal at the core and mental offspring and radiation of feudalism as are his books they afford ever valuable lessons and affinities to democratic America Nations or individuals we surely learn deepest from unlikeness from a sincere opponent from the light thrown even scornfully on dangerous spots and liabilities Michel Angelo invoked heaven s special protection against his friends and affectionate flatterers palpable foes he could manage for himself In many particulars Carlyle was indeed as Froude terms him one of those far off Hebraic utterers a new Micah or Habbakuk His words at times bubble forth with abysmic inspiration Always precious such men as precious now as any time His rude rasping taunting contradictory tones what ones are more wanted amid the supple polish d money worshipping Jesus and Judas equalizing suffrage sovereignty echoes of current America He has lit up our Nineteenth century with the light of a powerful penetrating and perfectly honest intellect of the first class turn d on British and European politics social life literature and representative personages thoroughly dissatisfied with all and mercilessly exposing the illness of all But while he announces the malady and scolds and raves about it he himself born and bred in the same atmosphere is a mark d illustration of it Notes thirteen It will be difficult for the future judging by his books personal dissympathies c to account for the deep hold this author has taken on the present age and the way he has color d its method and thought I am certainly at a loss to account for it all as affecting myself But there could be no view or even partial picture of the middle and latter part of our Nineteenth century that did not markedly include Thomas Carlyle In his case as so many others literary productions works of art personal identities events there has been an impalpable something more effective than the palpable Then I find no better text it is always important to have a definite special even oppositional living man to start from for sending out certain speculations and comparisons for home use Let us see what they amount to those reactionary doctrines fears scornful analyses of democracy even from the most erudite and sincere mind of Europe fourteen Not the least mentionable part of the case a streak it may be of that humor with which history and fate love to contrast their gravity is that although neither of my great authorities during their lives consider d the United States worthy of serious mention all the principal works of both might not inappropriately be this day collected and bound up under the conspicuous title Speculations for the use of North America and Democracy there with the relations of the same to Metaphysics including Lessons and Warnings encouragements too and of the vastest from the Old World to the New fifteen I hope I shall not myself fall into the error I charge upon him of prescribing a specific for indispensable evils My utmost pretension is probably but to offset that old claim of the exclusively curative power of first class individual men as leaders and rulers by the claims and general movement and result of ideas Something of the latter kind seems to me the distinctive theory of America of democracy and of the modern or rather I should say it is democracy and is the modern sixteen I am much indebted to J Gostick s abstract seventeen I have deliberately repeated it all not only in offset to Carlyle s everlurking pessimism and world decadence but as presenting the most thoroughly American points of view I know In my opinion the above formulas of Hegel are an essential and crowning justification of New World democracy in the creative realms of time and space There is that about them which only the vastness the multiplicity and the vitality of America would seem able to comprehend to give scope and illustration to or to be fit for or even originate It is strange to me that they were born in Germany or in the old world at all While a Carlyle I should say is quite the legitimate European product to be expected A COUPLE OF OLD FRIENDS A COLERIDGE BIT Latter April Have run down in my country haunt for a couple of days and am spending them by the pond I had already discover d my kingfisher here but only one the mate not here yet This fine bright morning down by the creek he has come out for a spree circling flirting chirping at a round rate While I am writing these lines he is disporting himself in scoots and rings over the wider parts of the pond into whose surface he dashes once or twice making a loud souse the spray flying in the sun beautiful I see his white and dark gray plumage and peculiar shape plainly as he has deign d to come very near me The noble graceful bird Now he is sitting on the limb of an old tree high up bending over the water seems to be looking at me while I memorandize I almost fancy he knows me Three days later My second kingfisher is here with his or her mate I saw the two together flying and whirling around I had heard in the distance what I thought was the clear rasping staccato of the birds several times already but I couldn t be sure the notes came from both until I saw them together To day at noon they appear d but apparently either on business or for a little limited exercise only No wild frolic now full of free fun and motion up and down for an hour Doubtless now they have cares duties incubation responsibilities The frolics are deferr d till summer close I don t know as I can finish to day s memorandum better than with Coleridge s lines curiously appropriate in more ways than one All Nature seems at work slugs leave their lair The bees are stirring birds are on the wing And winter slumbering in the open air Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring And I the while the sole unbusy thing Nor honey make nor pair nor build nor sing A WEEK S VISIT TO BOSTON May one eighty one Seems as if all the ways and means of American travel to day had been settled not only with reference to speed and directness but for the comfort of women children invalids and old fellows like me I went on by a through train that runs daily from Washington to the Yankee metropolis without change You get in a sleeping car soon after dark in Philadelphia and after ruminating an hour or two have your bed made up if you like draw the curtains and go to sleep in it fly on through Jersey to New York hear in your half slumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or two are unconsciously toted from Jersey City by a midnight steamer around the Battery and under the big bridge to the track of the New Haven road resume your flight eastward and early the next morning you wake up in Boston All of which was my experience I wanted to go to the Revere house A tall unknown gentleman a fellow passenger on his way to Newport he told me I had just chatted a few moments before with him assisted me out through the depot crowd procured a hack put me in it with my traveling bag saying smilingly and quietly Now I want you to let this be my ride paid the driver and before I could remonstrate bow d himself off The occasion of my jaunt I suppose I had better say here was for a public reading of the death of Abraham Lincoln essay on the sixteenth anniversary of that tragedy which reading duly came off night of April fifteen Then I linger d a week in Boston felt pretty well the mood propitious my paralysis lull d went around everywhere and saw all that was to be seen especially human beings Boston s immense material growth commerce finance commission stores the plethora of goods the crowded streets and sidewalks made of course the first surprising show In my trip out West last year I thought the wand of future prosperity future empire must soon surely be wielded by saint Louis Chicago beautiful Denver perhaps San Francisco but I see the said wand stretch d out just as decidedly in Boston with just as much certainty of staying evidences of copious capital indeed no centre of the New World ahead of it half the big railroads in the West are built with Yankees money and they take the dividends Old Boston with its zigzag streets and multitudinous angles crush up a sheet of letter paper in your hand throw it down stamp it flat and that is a map of old Boston new Boston with its miles upon miles of large and costly houses Beacon street Commonwealth avenue and a hundred others But the best new departures and expansions of Boston and of all the cities of New England are in another direction THE BOSTON OF TO DAY In the letters we get from doctor Schliemann interesting but fishy about his excavations there in the far off Homeric area I notice cities ruins c as he digs them out of their graves are certain to be in layers that is to say upon the foundation of an old concern very far down indeed is always another city or set of ruins and upon that another superadded and sometimes upon that still another each representing either a long or rapid stage of growth and development different from its predecessor but unerringly growing out of and resting on it In the moral emotional heroic and human growths the main of a race in my opinion something of this kind has certainly taken place in Boston The New England metropolis of to day may be described as sunny there is something else that makes warmth mastering even winds and meteorologies though those are not to be sneez d at joyous receptive full of ardor sparkle a certain element of yearning magnificently tolerant yet not to be fool d fond of good eating and drinking costly in costume as its purse can buy and all through its best average of houses streets people that subtle something generally thought to be climate but it is not it is something indefinable in the race the turn of its development which effuses behind the whirl of animation study business a happy and joyous public spirit as distinguish d from a sluggish and saturnine one Makes me think of the glints we get as in Symonds s books of the jolly old Greek cities Indeed there is a good deal of the Hellenic in B and the people are getting handsomer too padded out with freer motions and with color in their faces I never saw although this is not Greek so many fine looking gray hair d women At my lecture I caught myself pausing more than once to look at them plentiful everywhere through the audience healthy and wifely and motherly and wonderfully charming and beautiful I think such as no time or land but ours could show MY TRIBUTE TO FOUR POETS April sixteen A short but pleasant visit to Longfellow I am not one of the calling kind but as the author of Evangeline kindly took the trouble to come and see me three years ago in Camden where I was ill I felt not only the impulse of my own pleasure on that occasion but a duty He was the only particular eminence I called on in Boston and I shall not soon forget his lit up face and glowing warmth and courtesy in the modes of what is called the old school And now just here I feel the impulse to interpolate something about the mighty four who stamp this first American century with its birthmarks of poetic literature In a late magazine one of my reviewers who ought to know better speaks of my attitude of contempt and scorn and intolerance toward the leading poets of my deriding them and preaching their uselessness If anybody cares to know what I think and have long thought and avow d about them I am entirely willing to propound I can t imagine any better luck befalling these States for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from Emerson Longfellow Bryant and Whittier Emerson to me stands unmistakably at the head but for the others I am at a loss where to give any precedence Each illustrious each rounded each distinctive Emerson for his sweet vital tasting melody rhym d philosophy and poems as amber clear as the honey of the wild bee he loves to sing Longfellow for rich color graceful forms and incidents all that makes life beautiful and love refined competing with the singers of Europe on their own ground and with one exception better and finer work than that of any of them Bryant pulsing the first interior verse throbs of a mighty world bard of the river and the wood ever conveying a taste of open air with scents as from hayfields grapes birch borders always lurkingly fond of threnodies beginning and ending his long career with chants of death with here and there through all poems or passages of poems touching the highest universal truths enthusiasms duties morals as grim and eternal if not as stormy and fateful as anything in Eschylus While in Whittier with his special themes his outcropping love of heroism and war for all his Quakerdom his verses at times like the measur d step of Cromwell s old veterans in Whittier lives the zeal the moral energy that founded New England the splendid rectitude and ardor of Luther Milton George Fox I must not dare not say the wilfulness and narrowness though doubtless the world needs now and always will need almost above all just such narrowness and wilfulness MILLET S PICTURES LAST ITEMS April eighteen Went out three or four miles to the house of Quincy Shaw to see a collection of J F Millet s pictures Two rapt hours Never before have I been so penetrated by this kind of expression I stood long and long before the Sower I believe what the picture men designate the first Sower as the artist executed a second copy and a third and some think improved in each But I doubt it There is something in this that could hardly be caught again a sublime murkiness and original pent fury Besides this masterpiece there were many others I shall never forget the simple evening scene Watering the Cow all inimitable all perfect as pictures works of mere art and then it seem d to me with that last impalpable ethic purpose from the artist most likely unconscious to himself which I am always looking for To me all of them told the full story of what went before and necessitated the great French revolution the long precedent crushing of the masses of a heroic people into the earth in abject poverty hunger every right denied humanity attempted to be put back for generations yet Nature s force titanic here the stronger and hardier for that repression waiting terribly to break forth revengeful the pressure on the dykes and the bursting at last the storming of the Bastile the execution of the king and queen the tempest of massacres and blood Yet who can wonder Could we wish humanity different Could we wish the people made of wood or stone Or that there be no justice in destiny or time The true France base of all the rest is certainly in these pictures I comprehend Field People Reposing the Diggers and the Angelus in this opinion Some folks always think of the French as a small race five or five and a half feet high and ever frivolous and smirking Nothing of the sort The bulk of the personnel of France before the revolution was large sized serious industrious as now and simple The revolution and Napoleon s wars dwarf d the standard of human size but it will come up again If for nothing else I should dwell on my brief Boston visit for opening to me the new world of Millet s pictures Will America ever have such an artist out of her own gestation body soul Sunday April seventeen An hour and a half late this afternoon in silence and half light in the great nave of Memorial hall Cambridge the walls thickly cover d

from the sea the sun shining the sedge odor the noise of the surf a mixture of hissing and booming the milk white crest curling I had a leisurely bath and naked ramble as of old on the warm gray shore sands my companions off in a oat in deeper water I shouting to them Jupiter s menaces against the gods from Pope s Homer July twenty eight to Long Branch eight one two A M on the steamer Plymouth Rock foot of twenty threed street New York for Long Branch Another fine day fine sights the shores the shipping and bay everything comforting to the body and spirit of me I find the human and objective atmosphere of New York city and Brooklyn more affiliative to me than any other An hour later Still on the steamer now sniffing the salt very plainly the long pulsating swash as our boat steams seaward the hills of Navesink and many passing vessels the air the best part of all At Long Branch the bulk of the day stopt at a good hotel took all very leisurely had an excellent dinner and then drove for over two hours about the place especially Ocean avenue the finest drive one can imagine seven or eight miles right along the beach In all directions costly villas palaces millionaires but few among them I opine like my friend George W Childs whose personal integrity generosity unaffected simplicity go beyond all worldly wealth HOT WEATHER NEW YORK August In the big city awhile Even the height of the dog days there is a good deal of fun about New York if you only avoid fluster and take all the buoyant wholesomeness that offers More comfort too than most folks think A middle aged man with plenty of money in his pocket tells me that he has been off for a month to all the swell places has disburs d a small fortune has been hot and out of kilter everywhere and has return d home and lived in New York city the last two weeks quite contented and happy People forget when it is hot here it is generally hotter still in other places New York is so situated with the great ozonic brine on both sides it comprises the most favorable health chances in the world If only the suffocating crowding of some of its tenement houses could be broken up I find I never sufficiently realized how beautiful are the upper two thirds of Manhattan island I am stopping at Mott Haven and have been familiar now for ten days with the region above One hundredth street and along the Harlem river and Washington heights Am dwelling a few days with my friends mister and missus J H J and a merry houseful of young ladies Am putting the last touches on the printer s copy of my new volume of Leaves of Grass the completed book at last Work at it two or three hours and then go down and loaf along the Harlem river have just had a good spell of this recreation The sun sufficiently veil d a soft south breeze the river full of small or large shells light taper boats darting up and down some singly now and then long ones with six or eight young fellows practicing very inspiriting sights Two fine yachts lie anchor d off the shore I linger long enjoying the sundown the glow the streak d sky the heights distances shadows Aug ten As I haltingly ramble an hour or two this forenoon by the more secluded parts of the shore or sit under an old cedar half way up the hill the city near in view many young parties gather to bathe or swim squads of boys generally twos or threes some larger ones along the sand bottom or off an old pier close by A peculiar and pretty carnival at its height a hundred lads or young men very democratic but all decent behaving The laughter voices calls re responses the springing

so bright the dark green shadow of the hills the other side the amber rolling waves changing as the tide comes in to a trans parent tea color the frequent splash of the playful boys sousing the glittering drops sparkling and the good western breeze blowing CUSTER S LAST RALLY Went to day to see this just finish d painting by John Mulvany who has been out in far Dakota on the spot at the forts and among the frontiersmen soldiers and Indians for the last two years on purpose to sketch it in from reality or the best that could be got of it Sat for over an hour before the picture completely absorb d in the first view A vast canvas I should say twenty or twenty two feet by twelve all crowded and yet not crowded conveying such a vivid play of color it takes a little time to get used to it There are no tricks there is no throwing of shades in masses it is all at first painfully real overwhelming needs good nerves to look at it Forty or fifty figures perhaps more in full finish and detail in the mid ground with three times that number or more through the rest swarms upon swarms of savage Sioux in their war bonnets frantic mostly on ponies driving through the background through the smoke like a hurricane of demons A dozen of the figures are wonderful Altogether a western autochthonic phase of America the frontiers culminating typical deadly heroic to the uttermost nothing in the books like it nothing in Homer nothing in Shakspere more grim and sublime than either all native all our own and all a fact A great lot of muscular tan faced men brought to bay under terrible circumstances death ahold of them yet every man undaunted not one losing his head wringing out every cent of the pay before they sell their lives Custer his hair cut short stands in the middle with dilated eye and extended arm aiming a huge cavalry pistol Captain Cook is there partially wounded blood on the white handkerchief around his head aiming his carbine coolly half kneeling his body was afterwards found close by Custer s The slaughter d or half slaughter d horses for breastworks make a peculiar feature Two dead Indians herculean lie in the foreground clutching their Winchester rifles very characteristic The many soldiers their faces and attitudes the carbines the broad brimm d western hats the powder smoke in puffs the dying horses with their rolling eyes almost human in their agony the clouds of war bonneted Sioux in the background the figures of Custer and Cook with indeed the whole scene dreadful yet with an attraction and beauty that will remain in my memory With all its color and fierce action a certain Greek continence pervades it A sunny sky and clear light envelop all There is an almost entire absence of the stock traits of European war pictures The physiognomy of the work is realistic and Western I only saw it for an hour or so but it needs to be seen many times needs to be studied over and over again I could look on such a work at brief intervals all my life without tiring it is very tonic to me then it has an ethic purpose below all as all great art must have The artist said the sending of the picture abroad probably to London had been talk d of I advised him if it went abroad to take it to Paris I think they might appreciate it there nay they certainly would Then I would like to show Messieur Crapeau that some things can be done in America as well as others SOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES MEMORIES Aug sixteen Chalk a big mark for today was one of the sayings of an old sportsman friend of mine when he had had unusually good luck come home thoroughly tired but with satisfactory results of fish or birds Well to day might warrant such a mark for me Everything propitious from the start An hour s fresh stimulation coming down ten miles of Manhattan island by railroad and eight o clock stage Then an excellent breakfast at Pfaff s restaurant twenty fourth street Our host himself an old friend of mine quickly appear d on the scene to welcome me and bring up the news and first opening a big fat bottle of the best wine in the cellar talk about ante bellum times fifty nine and sixty and the jovial suppers at his then Broadway place near Bleecker street Ah the friends and names and frequenters those times that place Most are dead Ada Clare Wilkins Daisy Sheppard O Brien Henry Clapp Stanley Mullin Wood Brougham Arnold all gone And there Pfaff and I sitting opposite each other at the little table gave a remembrance to them in a style they would have themselves fully confirm d namely big brimming fill d up champagne glasses drain d in abstracted silence very leisurely to the last drop Pfaff is a generous German restaurateur silent stout jolly and I should say the best selecter of champagne in America A DISCOVERY OF OLD AGE Perhaps the best is always cumulative One s eating and drinking one wants fresh and for the nonce right off and have done with it but I would not give a straw for that person or poem or friend or city or work of art that was not more grateful the second time than the first and more still the third Nay I do not believe any grandest eligibility ever comes forth at first In my own experience persons poems places characters I discover the best hardly ever at first no absolute rule about it however sometimes suddenly bursting forth or stealthily opening to me perhaps after years of unwitting familiarity unappreciation usage A VISIT AT THE LAST TO R W EMERSON Concord Mass Out here on a visit elastic mellow Indian summery weather Came to day from Boston a pleasant ride of forty minutes by steam through Somerville Belmont Waltham Stony Brook and other lively towns convoy d by my friend F B Sanborn and to his ample house and the kindness and hospitality of missus S and their fine family Am writing this under the shade of some old hickories and elms just after four P M on the porch within a stone s throw of the Concord river Off against me across stream on a meadow and side hill haymakers are gathering and wagoning in probably their second or third crop The spread of emerald green and brown the knolls the score or two of little haycocks dotting the meadow the loaded up wagons the patient horses the slow strong action of the men and pitchforks all in the just waning afternoon with patches of yellow sun sheen mottled by long shadows a cricket shrilly chirping herald of the dusk a boat with two figures noiselessly gliding along the little river passing under the stone bridge arch the slight settling haze of aerial moisture the sky and the peacefulness expanding in all directions and overhead fill and soothe me Same Evening Never had I a better piece of luck befall me a long and blessed evening with Emerson in a way I couldn t have wish d better or different For nearly two hours he has been placidly sitting where I could see his face in the best light near me missus S s back parlor well fill d with people neighbors many fresh and charming faces women mostly young but some old My friend A B Alcott and his daughter Louisa were there early A good deal of talk the subject Henry Thoreau some new glints of his life and fortunes with letters to and from him one of the best by Margaret Fuller others by Horace Greeley Channing c one from Thoreau himself most quaint and interesting No doubt I seem d very stupid to the roomful of company taking hardly any part in the conversation but I had my own pail to milk in as the Swiss proverb puts it My seat and the relative arrangement were such that without being rude or anything of the kind I could just look squarely at E which I did a good part of the two hours On entering he had spoken very briefly and politely to several of the company then settled himself in his chair a trifle push d back and though a listener and apparently an alert one remain d silent through the whole talk and discussion A lady friend quietly took a seat next him to give special attention A good color in his face eyes clear with the well known expression of sweetness and the old clear peering aspect quite the same Next Day Several hours at E s house and dinner there An old familiar house he has been in it thirty five years with surroundings furnishment roominess and plain elegance and fullness signifying democratic ease sufficient opulence and an admirable old fashioned simplicity modern luxury with its mere sumptuousness and affectation either touch d lightly upon or ignored altogether Dinner the same Of course the best of the occasion Sunday September eighteen eighty one was the sight of E himself As just said a healthy color in the cheeks and good light in the eyes cheery expression and just the amount of talking that best suited namely a word or short phrase only where needed and almost always with a smile Besides Emerson himself missus E with their daughter Ellen the son Edward and his wife with my friend F S and missus S and others relatives and intimates missus Emerson resuming the subject of the evening before I sat next to her gave me further and fuller information about Thoreau who years ago during mister E s absence in Europe had lived for some time in the family by invitation OTHER CONCORD NOTATIONS Though the evening at mister and missus Sanborn s and the memorable family dinner at mister and missus Emerson s have most pleasantly and permanently fill d my memory I must not slight other notations of Concord I went to the old Manse walk d through the ancient garden enter d the rooms noted the quaintness the unkempt grass and bushes the little panes in the windows the low ceilings the spicy smell the creepers embowering the light Went to the Concord battle ground which is close by scann d French s statue the Minute Man read Emerson s poetic inscription on the base linger d a long while on the bridge and stopp d by the grave of the unnamed British soldiers buried there the day after the fight in April seventy five Then riding on thanks to my friend Miss M and her spirited white ponies she driving them a half hour at Hawthorne s and Thoreau s graves I got out and went up of course on foot and stood a long while and ponder d They lie close together in a pleasant wooded spot well up the cemetery hill Sleepy Hollow The flat surface of the first was densely cover d by myrtle with a border of arbor vitae and the other had a brown headstone moderately elaborate with inscriptions By Henry s side lies his brother John of whom much was expected but he died young Then to Walden pond that beautiful embower d sheet of water and spent over an hour there On the spot in the woods where Thoreau had his solitary house is now quite a cairn of stones to mark the place I too carried one and deposited on the heap As we drove back saw the School of Philosophy but it was shut up and I would not have it open d for me Near by stopp d at the house of W T Harris the Hegelian who came out and we had a pleasant chat while I sat in the wagon I shall not soon forget those Concord drives and especially that charming Sunday forenoon one with my friend Miss M and the white ponies BOSTON COMMON MORE OF EMERSON Oct ten thirteen I spend a good deal of time on the Common these delicious days and nights every mid day from eleven point thirty to about one and almost every sunset another hour I know all the big trees especially the old elms along Tremont and Beacon streets and have come to a sociable silent understanding with most of them in the sunlit air yet crispy cool enough as I saunter along the wide unpaved walks Up and down this breadth by Beacon street between these same old elms I walk d for two hours of a bright sharp February mid day twenty one years ago with Emerson then in his prime keen physically and morally magnetic arm d at every point and when he chose wielding the emotional just as well as the intellectual During those two hours he was the talker and I the listener It was an argument statement reconnoitring review attack and pressing home like an army corps in order artillery cavalry infantry of all that could be said against that part and a main part in the construction of my poems Children of Adam More precious than gold to me that dissertion it afforded me ever after this strange and paradoxical lesson each point of E s statement was unanswerable no judge s charge ever more complete or convincing I could never hear the points better put and then I felt down in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all and pursue my own way What have you to say then to such things said E pausing in conclusion Only that while I can t answer them at all I feel more settled than ever to adhere to my own theory and exemplify it was my candid response Whereupon we went and had a good dinner at the American House And thenceforward I never waver d or was touch d with qualms as I confess I had been two or three times before AN OSSIANIC NIGHT DEAREST FRIENDS Nov eighty one Again back in Camden As I cross the Delaware in long trips tonight between nine and eleven the scene overhead is a peculiar one swift sheets of flitting vapor gauze follow d by dense clouds throwing an inky pall on everything Then a spell of that transparent steel gray black sky I have noticed under similar circumstances on which the moon would beam for a few moments with calm lustre throwing down a broad dazzle of highway on the waters then the mists careering again All silently yet driven as if by the furies they sweep along sometimes quite thin sometimes thicker a real Ossianic night amid the whirl absent or dead friends the old the past somehow tenderly suggested while the Gael strains chant themselves from the mists Be thy soul blest O Carril in the midst of thy eddying winds O that thou wouldst come to my hall when I am alone by night And thou dost come my friend I hear often thy light hand on my harp when it hangs on the distant wall and the feeble sound touches my ear Why dost thou not speak to me in my grief and tell me when I shall behold my friends But thou passest away in thy murmuring blast the wind whistles through the gray hairs of Ossian But most of all those changes of moon and sheets of hurrying vapor and black clouds with the sense of rapid action in weird silence recall the far back Erse belief that such above were the preparations for receiving the wraiths of just slain warriors We sat that night in Selma round the strength of the shell The wind was abroad in the oaks The spirit of the mountain roar d The blast came rustling through the hall and gently touch d my harp The sound was mournful and low like the song of the tomb Fingal heard it the first The crowded sighs of his bosom rose Some of my heroes are low said the gray hair d king of Morven I hear the sound of death on the harp Ossian touch the trembling string Bid the sorrow rise that their spirits may fly with joy to Morven s woody hills I touch d the harp before the king the sound was mournful and low Bend forward from your clouds I said ghosts of my fathers bend Lay by the red terror of your course Receive the falling chief whether he comes from a distant land or rises from the rolling sea Let his robe of mist be near his spear that is form d of a cloud Place a half extinguish d meteor by his side in the form of a hero s sword And oh let his countenance be lovely that his friends may delight in his presence Bend from your clouds I said ghosts of my fathers bend Such was my song in Selma to the lightly trembling harp How or why I know not just at the moment but I too muse and think of my best friends in their distant homes of William O Connor of Maurice Bucke of John Burroughs and of missus Gilchrist friends of my soul stanchest friends of my other soul my poems ONLY A NEW FERRY BOAT Jan twelve eighty two Such a show as the Delaware presented an hour before sundown yesterday evening all along between Philadelphia and Camden is worth weaving into an item It was full tide a fair breeze from the southwest the water of a pale tawny color and just enough motion to make things frolicsome and lively Add to these an approaching sunset of unusual splendor a broad tumble of clouds with much golden haze and profusion of beaming shaft and dazzle In the midst of all in the clear drab of the afternoon light there steam d up the river the large new boat the Wenonah as pretty an object as you could wish to see lightly and swiftly skimming along all trim and white cover d with flags transparent red and blue streaming out in the breeze Only a new ferry boat and yet in its fitness comparable with the prettiest product of Nature s cunning and rivaling it High up in the transparent ether gracefully balanced and circled four or five great sea hawks while here below amid the pomp and picturesqueness of sky and river swam this creation of artificial beauty and motion and power in its way no less perfect DEATH OF LONGFELLOW Camden April eighty two I have just return d from an old forest haunt where I love to go occasionally away from parlors pavements and the newspapers and magazines and where of a clear forenoon deep in the shade of pines and cedars and a tangle of old laurel trees and vines the news of Longfellow s death first reach d me For want of anything better let me lightly twine a sprig of the sweet ground ivy trailing so plentifully through the dead leaves at my feet with reflections of that half hour alone there in the silence and lay it as my contribution on the dead bard s grave Longfellow in his voluminous works seems to me not only to be eminent in the style and forms of poetical expression that mark the present age an idiosyncrasy almost a sickness of verbal melody but to bring what is always dearest as poetry to the general human heart and taste and probably must be so in the nature of things He is certainly the sort of bard and counteractant most needed for our materialistic self assertive money worshipping Anglo Saxon races and especially for the present age in America an age tyrannically regulated with reference to the manufacturer the merchant the financier the politician and the day workman for whom and among whom he comes as the poet of melody courtesy deference poet of the mellow twilight of the past in Italy Germany Spain and in Northern Europe poet of all sympathetic gentleness and universal poet of women and young people I should have to think long if I were ask d to name the man who has done more and in more valuable directions for America I doubt if there ever was before such a fine intuitive judge and selecter of poems His translations of many German and Scandinavian pieces are said to be better than the vernaculars He does not urge or lash His influence is like good drink or air He is not tepid either but always vital with flavor motion grace He strikes a splendid average and does not sing exceptional passions or humanity s jagged escapades He is not revolutionary brings nothing offensive or new does not deal hard blows On the contrary his songs soothe and heal or if they excite it is a healthy and agreeable excitement His very anger is gentle is at second hand as in the Quadroon Girl and the Witnesses There is no undue element of pensiveness in Longfellow s strains Even in the early translation the Manrique the movement is as of strong and steady wind or tide holding up and buoying Death is not avoided through his many themes but there is something almost winning in his original verses and renderings on that dread subject as closing the Happiest Land dispute And then the landlord s daughter Up to heaven rais d her hand And said Ye may no more contend There lies the happiest land To the ungracious complaint charge of his want of racy nativity and special originality I shall only say that America and the world may well be reverently thankful can never be thankful enough for any such singing bird vouchsafed out of the centuries without asking that the notes be different from those of other songsters adding what I have heard Longfellow himself say that ere the New World can be worthily original and announce herself and her own heroes she must be well saturated with the originality of others and respectfully consider the heroes that lived before Agamemnon STARTING NEWSPAPERS

1647-140649-0063	train-other-500	Nature seems to look on all fixed up poetry and art as something almost impertinent Thus I went on years following various seasons and areas spinning forth my thought beneath the night and stars

none	none	 divine original concrete COLLECT ONE OR TWO INDEX ITEMS Though the ensuing COLLECT and preceding SPECIMEN DAYS are both largely from memoranda already existing the hurried peremptory needs of copy for the printers already referr d to the musicians story of a composer up in a garret rushing the middle body and last of his score together while the fiddlers are playing the first parts down in the concert room of this haste while quite willing to get the consequent stimulus of life and motion I am sure there must have resulted sundry technical errors If any are too glaring they will be corrected in a future edition A special word about PIECES IN EARLY YOUTH at the end On jaunts over Long Island as boy and young fellow nearly half a century ago I heard of or came across in my own experience characters true occurrences incidents which I tried my prentice hand at recording I was then quite an abolitionist and advocate of the temperance and anti capital punishment causes and publish d during occasional visits to New York city A majority of the sketches appear d first in the Democratic Review others in the Columbian Magazine or the American Review of that period My serious wish were to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp d in oblivion but to avoid the annoyance of their surreptitious issue as lately announced from outsiders I have with some qualms tack d them on here A Dough Face Song came out first in the Evening Post Blood Money and Wounded in the House of Friends in the Tribune Poetry To day in America c first appear d under the name of The Poetry of the Future in The North American Review for February eighteen eighty one A Memorandum at a Venture in same periodical some time afterward Several of the convalescent out door scenes and literary items preceding originally appear d in the fortnightly Critic of New York DEMOCRATIC VISTAS As the greatest lessons of Nature through the universe are perhaps the lessons of variety and freedom the same present the greatest lessons also in New World politics and progress If a man were ask d for instance the distinctive points contrasting modern European and American political and other life with the old Asiatic cultus as lingering bequeath d yet in China and Turkey he might find the amount of them in John Stuart Mill s profound essay on Liberty in the future where he demands two main constituents or sub strata for a truly grand nationality first a large variety of character and twod full play for human nature to expand itself in numberless and even conflicting directions seems to be for general humanity much like the influences that make up in their limitless field that perennial health action of the air we call the weather an infinite number of currents and forces and contributions and temperatures and cross purposes whose ceaseless play of counterpart upon counterpart brings constant restoration and vitality With this thought and not for itself alone but all it necessitates and draws after it let me begin my speculations America filling the present with greatest deeds and problems cheerfully accepting the past including feudalism as indeed the present is but the legitimate birth of the past including feudalism counts as I reckon for her justification and success for who as yet dare claim success almost entirely on the future Nor is that hope unwarranted To day ahead though dimly yet we see in vistas a copious sane gigantic offspring For our New World I consider far less important for what it has done or what it is than for results to come Sole among nationalities these States have assumed the task to put in forms of lasting power and practicality on areas of amplitude rivaling the operations of the physical kosmos the moral political speculations of ages long long deferr d the democratic republican principle and the theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards and self reliance Who else indeed except the United States in history so far have accepted in unwitting faith and as we now see stand act upon and go security for these things But preluding no longer let me strike the key note of the following strain First premising that though the passages of it have been written at widely different times it is in fact a collection of memoranda perhaps for future designers comprehenders and though it may be open to the charge of one part contradicting another for there are opposite sides to the great question of democracy as to every great question I feel the parts harmoniously blended in my own realization and convictions and present them to be read only in such oneness each page and each claim and assertion modified and temper d by the others Bear in mind too that they are not the result of studying up in political economy but of the ordinary sense observing wandering among men these States these stirring years of war and peace I will not gloss over the appaling dangers of universal suffrage in the United States In fact it is to admit and face these dangers I am writing To him or her within whose thought rages the battle advancing retreating between democracy s convictions aspirations and the people s crudeness vice caprices I mainly write this essay I shall use the words America and democracy as convertible terms Not an ordinary one is the issue The United States are destined either to surmount the gorgeous history of feudalism or else prove the most tremendous failure of time Not the least doubtful am I on any prospects of their material success The triumphant future of their business geographic and productive departments on larger scales and in more varieties than ever is certain In those respects the republic must soon if she does not already outstrip all examples hitherto afforded and dominate the world twenty Admitting all this with the priceless value of our political institutions general suffrage and fully acknowledging the latest widest opening of the doors I say that far deeper than these what finally and only is to make of our western world a nationality superior to any hither known and out topping the past must be vigorous yet unsuspected Literatures perfect personalities and sociologies original transcendental and expressing what in highest sense are not yet express d at all democracy and the modern With these and out of these I promulge new races of Teachers and of perfect Women indispensable to endow the birth stock of a New World For feudalism caste the ecclesiastic traditions though palpably retreating from political institutions still hold essentially by their spirit even in this country entire possession of the more important fields indeed the very subsoil of education and of social standards and literature I say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art poems schools theology displacing all that exists or that has been produced anywhere in the past under opposite influences It is curious to me that while so many voices pens minds in the press lecture rooms in our Congress c are discussing intellectual topics pecuniary dangers legislative problems the suffrage tariff and labor questions and the various business and benevolent needs of America with propositions remedies often worth deep attention there is one need a hiatus the profoundest that no eye seems to perceive no voice to state Our fundamental want to day in the United States with closest amplest reference to present conditions and to the future is of a class and the clear idea of a class of native authors literatuses far different far higher in grade than any yet known sacerdotal modern fit to cope with our occasions lands permeating the whole mass of American mentality taste belief breathing into it a new breath of life giving it decision affecting politics far more than the popular superficial suffrage with results inside and underneath the elections of Presidents or Congresses radiating begetting appropriate teachers schools manners and as its grandest result accomplishing what neither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto accomplish d and without which this nation will no more stand permanently soundly than a house will stand without a substratum a religious and moral character beneath the political and productive and intellectual bases of the States For know you not dear earnest reader that the people of our land may all read and write and may all possess the right to vote and yet the main things may be entirely lacking and this to suggest them View d to day from a point of view sufficiently over arching the problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and religious and is to be finally met and treated by literature The priest departs the divine literatus comes Never was anything more wanted than to day and here in the States the poet of the modern is wanted or the great literatus of the modern At all times perhaps the central point in any nation and that whence it is itself really sway d the most and whence it sways others is its national literature especially its archetypal poems Above all previous lands a great original literature is surely to become the justification and reliance in some respects the sole reliance of American democracy Few are aware how the great literature penetrates all gives hue to all shapes aggregates and individuals and after subtle ways with irresistible power constructs sustains demolishes at will Why tower in reminiscence above all the nations of the earth two special lands petty in themselves yet inexpressibly gigantic beautiful columnar Immortal Judah lives and Greece immortal lives in a couple of poems Nearer than this It is not generally realized but it is true as the genius of Greece and all the sociology personality politics and religion of those wonderful states resided in their literature or esthetics that what was afterwards the main support of European chivalry the feudal ecclesiastical dynastic world over there forming its osseous structure holding it together for hundreds thousands of years preserving its flesh and bloom giving it form decision rounding it out and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious blood breed belief and intuitions of men that it still prevails powerful to this day in defiance of the mighty changes of time was its literature permeating to the very marrow especially that major part its enchanting songs ballads and poems twenty one To the ostent of the senses and eyes I know the influences which stamp the world s history are wars uprisings or downfalls of dynasties changeful movements of trade important inventions navigation military or civil governments advent of powerful personalities conquerors et cetera These of course play their part yet it may be a single new thought imagination abstract principle even literary style fit for the time put in shape by some great literatus and projected among mankind may duly cause changes growths removals greater than the longest and bloodiest war or the most stupendous merely political dynastic or commercial overturn In short as though it may not be realized it is strictly true that a few first class poets philosophs and authors have substantially settled and given status to the entire religion education law sociology c of the hitherto civilized world by tinging and often creating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen such also must stamp and more than ever stamp the interior and real democratic construction of this American continent to day and days to come Remember also this fact of difference that while through the antique and through the mediaeval ages highest thoughts and ideals realized themselves and their expression made its way by other arts as much as or even more than by technical literature not open to the mass of persons or even to the majority of eminent persons such literature in our day and for current purposes is not only more eligible than all the other arts put together but has become the only general means of morally influencing the world Painting sculpture and the dramatic theatre it would seem no longer play an indispensable or even important part in the workings and mediumship of intellect utility or even high esthetics Architecture remains doubtless with capacities and a real future Then music the combiner nothing more spiritual nothing more sensuous a god yet completely human advances prevails holds highest place supplying in certain wants and quarters what nothing else could supply Yet in the civilization of to day it is undeniable that over all the arts literature dominates serves beyond all shapes the character of church and school or at any rate is capable of doing so Including the literature of science its scope is indeed unparallel d Before proceeding further it were perhaps well to discriminate on certain points Literature tills its crops in many fields and some may flourish while others lag What I say in these Vistas has its main bearing on imaginative literature especially poetry the stock of all In the department of science and the specialty of journalism there appear in these States promises perhaps fulfilments of highest earnestness reality and life These of course are modern But in the region of imaginative spinal and essential attributes something equivalent to creation is for our age and lands imperatively demanded For not only is it not enough that the new blood new frame of democracy shall be vivified and held together merely by political means superficial suffrage legislation c but it is clear to me that unless it goes deeper gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in men s hearts emotions and belief as in their days feudalism or ecclesiasticism and inaugurates its own perennial sources welling from the centre forever its strength will be defective its growth doubtful and its main charm wanting I suggest therefore the possibility should some two or three really original American poets perhaps artists or lecturers arise mounting the horizon like planets stars of the first magnitude that from their eminence fusing contributions races far localities c together they would give more compaction and more moral identity the quality to day most needed to these States than all its Constitutions legislative and judicial ties and all its hitherto political warlike or materialistic experiences As for instance there could hardly happen anything that would more serve the States with all their variety of origins their diverse climes cities standards c than possessing an aggregate of heroes characters exploits sufferings prosperity or misfortune glory or disgrace common to all typical of all no less but even greater would it be to possess the aggregation of a cluster of mighty poets artists teachers fit for us national expressers comprehending and effusing for the men and women of the States what is universal native common to all inland and seaboard northern and southern The historians say of ancient Greece with her ever jealous autonomies cities and states that the only positive unity she ever own d or receiv d was the sad unity of a common subjection at the last to foreign conquerors Subjection aggregation of that sort is impossible to America but the fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors and the lack of a common skeleton knitting all close continually haunts me Or if it does not nothing is plainer than the need a long period to come of a fusion of the States into the only reliable identity the moral and artistic one For I say the true nationality of the States the genuine union when we come to a moral crisis is and is to be after all neither the written law nor as is generally supposed either self interest or common pecuniary or material objects but the fervid and tremendous IDEA melting everything else with resistless heat and solving all lesser and definite distinctions in vast indefinite spiritual emotional power It may be claim d and I admit the weight of the claim that common and general worldly prosperity and a populace well to do and with all life s material comforts is the main thing and is enough It may be argued that our republic is in performance really enacting to day the grandest arts poems c by beating up the wilderness into fertile farms and in her railroads ships machinery c And it may be ask d Are these not better indeed for America than any utterances even of greatest rhapsode artist or literatus I too hail those achievements with pride and joy then answer that the soul of man will not with such only nay not with such at all be finally satisfied but needs what standing on these and on all things as the feet stand on the ground is address d to the loftiest to itself alone Out of such considerations such truths arises for treatment in these Vistas the important question of character of an American stock personality with literatures and arts for outlets and return expressions and of course to correspond within outlines common to all To these the main affair the thinkers of the United States in general so acute have either given feeblest attention or have remain d and remain in a state of somnolence For my part I would alarm and caution even the political and business reader and to the utmost extent against the prevailing delusion that the establishment of free political institutions and plentiful intellectual smartness with general good order physical plenty industry c desirable and precious advantages as they all are do of themselves determine and yield to our experiment of democracy the fruitage of success With such advantages at present fully or almost fully possess d the Union just issued victorious from the struggle with the only foes it need ever fear namely those within itself the interior ones and with unprecedented materialistic advancement society in these States is canker d crude superstitious and rotten Political or law made society is and private or voluntary society is also In any vigor the element of the moral conscience the most important the verteber to State or man seems to me either entirely lacking or seriously enfeebled or ungrown I say we had best look our times and lands searchingly in the face like a physician diagnosing some deep disease Never was there perhaps more hollowness at heart than at present and here in the United States Genuine belief seems to have left us The underlying principles of the States are not honestly believ d in for all this hectic glow and these melo dramatic screamings nor is humanity itself believ d in What penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask The spectacle is appaling We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout The men believe not in the women nor the women in the men A scornful superciliousness rules in literature The aim of all the litterateurs is to find something to make fun of A lot of churches sects c the most dismal phantasms I know usurp the name of religion Conversation is a mass of badinage From deceit in the spirit the mother of all false deeds the offspring is already incalculable An acute and candid person in the revenue department in Washington who is led by the course of his employment to regularly visit the cities north south and west to investigate frauds has talk d much with me about his discoveries The depravity of the business classes of our country is not less than has been supposed but infinitely greater The official services of America national state and municipal in all their branches and departments except the judiciary are saturated in corruption bribery falsehood mal administration and the judiciary is tainted The great cities reek with respectable as much as non respectable robbery and scoundrelism In fashionable life flippancy tepid amours weak infidelism small aims or no aims at all only to kill time In business this all devouring modern word business the one sole object is by any means pecuniary gain The magician s serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents and money making is our magician s serpent remaining today sole master of the field The best class we show is but a mob of fashionably dress d speculators and vulgarians True indeed behind this fantastic farce enacted on the visible stage of society solid things and stupendous labors are to be discover d existing crudely and going on in the background to advance and tell themselves in time Yet the truths are none the less terrible I say that our New World democracy however great a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs in materialistic development products and in a certain highly deceptive superficial popular intellectuality is so far an almost complete failure in its social aspects and in really grand religious moral literary and esthetic results In vain do we march with unprecedented strides to empire so colossal outvying the antique beyond Alexander s beyond the proudest sway of Rome In vain have we annex d Texas California Alaska and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba It is as if we were somehow being endow d with a vast and more and more thoroughly appointed body and then left with little or no soul Let me illustrate further as I write with current observations localities c The subject is important and will bear repetition After an absence I am now again September eighteen seventy in New York city and Brooklyn on a few weeks vacation The splendor picturesqueness and oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities the unsurpass d situation rivers and bay sparkling sea tides costly and lofty new buildings facades of marble and iron of original grandeur and elegance of design with the masses of gay color the preponderance of white and blue the flags flying the endless ships the tumultuous streets Broadway the heavy low musical roar hardly ever intermitted even at night the jobbers houses the rich shops the wharves the great Central Park and the Brooklyn Park of hills as I wander among them this beautiful fall weather musing watching absorbing the assemblages of the citizens in their groups conversations trades evening amusements or along the by quarters these I say and the like of these completely satisfy my senses of power fulness motion c and give me through such senses and appetites and through my esthetic conscience a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment Always and more and more as I cross the East and North rivers the ferries or with the pilots in their pilot houses or pass an hour in Wall street or the gold exchange I realize if we must admit such partialisms that not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open air in her storms the shows of night and day the mountains forests seas but in the artificial the work of man too is equally great in this profusion of teeming humanity in these ingenuities streets goods houses ships these hurrying feverish electric crowds of men their complicated business genius not least among the geniuses and all this mighty many threaded wealth and industry concentrated here But sternly discarding shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of the general superficial effect coming down to what is of the only real importance Personalities and examining minutely we question we ask Are there indeed men here worthy the name Are there athletes Are there perfect women to match the generous material luxuriance Is there a pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners Are there crops of fine youths and majestic old persons Are there arts worthy freedom and a rich people Is there a great moral and religious civilization the only justification of a great material one Confess that to severe eyes using the moral microscope upon humanity a sort of dry and flat Sahara appears these cities crowded with petty grotesques malformations phantoms playing meaningless antics Confess that everywhere in shop street church theatre bar room official chair are pervading flippancy and vulgarity low cunning infidelity everywhere the youth puny impudent foppish prematurely ripe everywhere an abnormal libidinousness unhealthy forms male female painted padded dyed chignon d muddy complexions bad blood the capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceas d shallow notions of beauty with a range of manners or rather lack of manners considering the advantages enjoy d probably the meanest to be seen in the world twenty two Of all this and these lamentable conditions to breathe into them the breath recuperative of sane and heroic life I say a new founded literature not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces or pander to what is called taste not only to amuse pass away time celebrate the beautiful the refined the past or exhibit technical rhythmic or grammatical dexterity but a literature underlying life religious consistent with science handling the elements and forces with competent power teaching and training men and as perhaps the most precious of its results achieving the entire redemption of woman out of these incredible holds and webs of silliness millinery and every kind of dyspeptic depletion and thus insuring to the States a strong and sweet Female Race a race of perfect Mothers is what is needed And now in the full conception of these facts and points and all that they infer pro and con with yet unshaken faith in the elements of the American masses the composites of both sexes and even consider d as individuals and ever recognizing in them the broadest bases of the best literary and esthetic appreciation I proceed with my speculations Vistas First let us see what we can make out of a brief general sentimental consideration of political democracy and whence it has arisen with regard to some of its current features as an aggregate and as the basic structure of our future literature and authorship We shall it is true quickly and continually find the origin idea of the singleness of man individualism asserting itself and cropping forth even from the opposite ideas But the mass or lump character for imperative reasons is to be ever carefully weigh d borne in mind and provided for Only from it and from its proper regulation and potency comes the other comes the chance of individualism The two are contradictory but our task is to reconcile them twenty three The political history of the past may be summ d up as having grown out of what underlies the words order safety caste and especially out of the need of some prompt deciding authority and of cohesion at all cost Leaping time we come to the period within the memory of people now living when as from some lair where they had slumber d long accumulating wrath sprang up and are yet active seventeen ninety and on eyen to the present eighteen seventy those noisy eructations destructive iconoclasms a fierce sense of wrongs amid which moves the form well known in modern history in the old world stain d with much blood and mark d by savage reactionary clamors and demands These bear mostly as on one inclosing point of need For after the rest is said after the many time honor d and really true things for subordination experience rights of property c have been listen d to and acquiesced in after the valuable and well settled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn d over and exhausted it remains to bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that Something a man is last precious consolation of the drudging poor standing apart from all else divine in his own right and a woman in hers sole and untouchable by any canons of authority or any rule derived from precedent state safety the acts of legislatures or even from what is called religion modesty or art The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant doings of our immediately preceding three centuries and has been the political genesis and life of America Advancing visibly it still more advances invisibly Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of society as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations of the world we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself even in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation this image of completeness in separatism of individual personal dignity of a single person either male or female characterized in the main not from extrinsic acquirements or position but in the pride of himself or herself alone and as an eventual conclusion and summing up or else the entire scheme of things is aimless a cheat a crash the simple idea that the last best dependence is to be upon humanity itself and its own inherent normal fullgrown qualities without any superstitious support whatever This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate For it is mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a strong generalization consolidation As it is to give the best vitality and freedom to the rights of the States every bit as important as the right of nationality the union that we insist on the identity of the Union at all hazards The purpose of democracy supplanting old belief in the necessary absoluteness of establish d dynastic rulership temporal ecclesiastical and scholastic as furnishing the only security against chaos crime and ignorance is through many transmigrations and amid endless ridicules arguments and ostensible failures to illustrate at all hazards this doctrine or theory that man properly train d in sanest highest freedom may and must become a law and series of laws unto himself surrounding and providing for not only his own personal control but all his relations to other individuals and to the State and that while other theories as in the past histories of nations have proved wise enough and indispensable perhaps for their conditions this as matters now stand in our civilized world is the only scheme worth working from as warranting results like those of Nature s laws reliable when once establish d to carry on themselves The argument of the matter is extensive and we admit by no means all on one side What we shall offer will be far far from sufficient But while leaving unsaid much that should properly even prepare the way for the treatment of this many sided question of political liberty equality or republicanism leaving the whole history and consideration of the feudal plan and its products embodying humanity its politics and civilization through the retrospect of past time which plan and products indeed make up all of the past and a large part of the present leaving unanswer d at least by any specific and local answer many a well wrought argument and instance and many a conscientious declamatory cry and warning as very lately from an eminent and venerable person abroad twenty four things problems full of doubt dread suspense not new to me but old occupiers of many an anxious hour in city s din or night s silence we still may give a page or so whose drift is opportune Time alone can finally answer these things But as a substitute in passing let us even if fragmentarily throw forth a short direct or indirect suggestion of the premises of that other plan in the new spirit under the new forms started here in our America As to the political section of Democracy which introduces and breaks ground for further and vaster sections few probably are the minds even in these republican States that fully comprehend the aptness of that phrase THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE which we inherit from the lips of Abraham Lincoln a formula whose verbal shape is homely wit but whose scope includes both the totality and all minutiae of the lesson The People Like our huge earth itself which to ordinary scansion is full of vulgar contradictions and offence man viewed in the lump displeases and is a constant puzzle and affront to the merely educated classes The rare cosmical artist mind lit with the Infinite alone confronts his manifold and oceanic qualities but taste intelligence and culture so called have been against the masses and remain so There is plenty of glamour about the most damnable crimes and hoggish meannesses special and general of the feudal and dynastic world over there with its personnel of lords and queens and courts so well dress d and so handsome But the People are ungrammatical untidy and their sins gaunt and ill bred Literature strictly consider d has never recognized the People and whatever may be said does not to day Speaking generally the tendencies of literature as hitherto pursued have been to make mostly critical and querulous men It seems as if so far there were some natural repugnance between a literary and professional life and the rude rank spirit of the democracies There is in later literature a treatment of benevolence a charity business rife enough it is true but I know nothing more rare even in this country than a fit scientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People of their measureless wealth of latent power and capacity their vast artistic contrasts of lights and shades with in America their entire reliability in emergencies and a certain breadth of historic grandeur of peace or war far surpassing all the vaunted samples of book heroes or any haut ton coteries in all the records of the world The movements of the late secession war and their results to any sense that studies well and comprehends them show that popular democracy whatever its faults and dangers practically justifies itself beyond the proudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts Probably no future age can know but I well know how the gist of this fiercest and most resolute of the world s war like contentions resided exclusively in the unnamed unknown rank and file and how the brunt of its labor of death was to all essential purposes volunteer d The People of their own choice fighting dying for their own idea insolently attack d by the secession slave power and its very existence imperil d Descending to detail entering any of the armies and mixing with the private soldiers we see and have seen august spectacles We have seen the alacrity with which the American born populace the peaceablest and most good natured race in the world and the most personally independent and intelligent and the least fitted to submit to the irksomeness and exasperation of regimental discipline sprang at the first tap of the drum to arms not for gain nor even glory nor to repel invasion but for an emblem a mere abstraction for the life the safety of the flag We have seen the unequal d docility and obedience of these soldiers We have seen them tried long and long by hopelessness mismanagement and by defeat have seen the incredible slaughter toward or through which the armies as at first Fredericksburg and afterward at the Wilderness still unhesitatingly obey d orders to advance We have seen them in trench or crouching behind breastwork or tramping in deep mud or amid pouring rain or thick falling snow or under forced marches in hottest summer as on the road to get to Gettysburg vast suffocating swarms divisions corps with every single man so grimed and black with sweat and dust his own mother would not have known him his clothes all dirty stain d and torn with sour accumulated sweat for perfume many a comrade perhaps a brother sun struck staggering out dying by the roadside of exhaustion yet the great bulk bearing steadily on cheery enough hollow bellied from hunger but sinewy with unconquerable resolution We have seen this race proved by wholesale by drearier yet more fearful tests the wound the amputation the shatter d face or limb the slow hot fever long impatient anchorage in bed and all the forms of maiming operation and disease Alas America have we seen though only in her early youth already to hospital brought There have we watch d these soldiers many of them only boys in years mark d their decorum their religious nature and fortitude and their sweet affection Wholesale truly For at the front and through the camps in countless tents stood the regimental brigade and division hospitals while everywhere amid the land in or near cities rose clusters of huge white wash d crowded one story wooden barracks and there ruled agony with bitter scourge yet seldom brought a cry and there stalk d death by day and night along the narrow aisles between the rows of cots or by the blankets on the ground and touch d lightly many a poor sufferer often with blessed welcome touch I know not whether I shall be understood but I realize that it is finally from what I learn d personally mixing in such scenes that I am now penning these pages One night in the gloomiest period of the war in the Patent office hospital in Washington city as I stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier who lay conscious of quick approaching death yet perfectly calm and with noble spiritual manner the veteran surgeon turning aside said to me that though he had witness d many many deaths of soldiers and had been a worker at Bull Run Antietam Fredericksburg c he had not seen yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror My own observation fully bears out the remark What have we here if not towering above all talk and argument the plentifully supplied last needed proof of democracy in its personalities Curiously enough too the proof on this point comes I should say every bit as much from the south as from the north Although I have spoken only of the latter yet I deliberately include all Grand common stock to me the accomplish d and convincing growth prophetic of the future proof undeniable to sharpest sense of perfect beauty tenderness and pluck that never feudal lord nor Greek nor Roman breed yet rival d Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of the American races north or south to one who has been through the war in the great army hospitals Meantime general humanity for to that we return as for our purposes what it really is to bear in mind has always in every department been full of perverse maleficence and is so yet In downcast hours the soul thinks it always will be but soon recovers from such sickly moods I myself see clearly enough the crude defective streaks in all the strata of the common people the specimens and vast collections of the ignorant the credulous the unfit and uncouth the incapable and the very low and poor The eminent person just mention d sneeringly asks whether we expect to elevate and improve a nation s politics by absorbing such morbid collections and qualities therein The point is a formidable one and there will doubtless always be numbers of solid and reflective citizens who will never get over it Our answer is general and is involved in the scope and letter of this essay We believe the ulterior object of political and all other government having of course provided for the police the safety of life property and for the basic statute and common law and their administration always first in order to be among the rest not merely to rule to repress disorder c but to develop to open up to cultivation to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly outcroppage and of that aspiration for independence and the pride and self respect latent in all characters Or if there be exceptions we cannot fixing our eyes on them alone make theirs the rule for all I say the mission of government henceforth in civilized lands is not repression alone and not Authority alone not even of law nor by that favorite standard of the eminent writer the rule of the best men the born heroes and captains of the race as if such ever or one time out of a hundred get into the big places elective or dynastic but higher than the highest arbitrary rule to train communities through all their grades beginning with individuals and ending there again to rule themselves What Christ appear d for in the moral spiritual field for human kind namely that in respect to the absolute soul there is in the possession of such by each single individual something so transcendent so incapable of gradations like life that to that extent it places all beings on a common level utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect virtue station or any height or lowliness whatever is tallied in like manner in this other field by democracy s rule that men the nation as a common aggregate of living identities affording in each a separate and complete subject for freedom worldly thrift and happiness and for a fair chance for growth and for protection in citizenship c must to the political extent of the suffrage or vote if no further be placed in each and in the whole on one broad primary universal common platform The purpose is not altogether direct perhaps it is more indirect For it is not that democracy is of exhaustive account in itself Perhaps indeed it is like Nature of no account in itself It is that as we see it is the best perhaps only fit and full means formulater general caller forth trainer for the million not for grand material personalities only but for immortal souls To be a voter with the rest is not so much and this like every institute will have its imperfections But to become an enfranchised man and now impediments removed to stand and start without humiliation and equal with the rest to commence or have the road clear d to commence the grand experiment of development whose end perhaps requiring several generations may be the forming of a full grown man or woman that is something To ballast the State is also secured and in our times is to be secured in no other way We do not at any rate I do not put it either on the ground that the People the masses even the best of them are in their latent or exhibited qualities essentially sensible and good nor on the ground of their rights but that good or bad rights or no rights the democratic formula is the only safe and preservative one for coming times We endow the masses with the suffrage for their own sake no doubt then perhaps still more from another point of view for community s sake Leaving the rest to the sentimentalists we present freedom as sufficient in its scientific aspect cold as ice reasoning deductive clear and passionless as crystal Democracy too is law and of the strictest amplest kind Many suppose and often in its own ranks the error that it means a throwing aside of law and running riot But briefly it is the superior law not alone that of physical force the body which adding to it supersedes with that of the spirit Law is the unshakable order of the universe forever and the law over all and law of laws is the law of successions that of the superior law in time gradually supplanting and overwhelming the inferior one While for myself I would cheerfully agree first covenanting that the formative tendencies shall be administer d in favor or at least not against it and that this reservation be closely construed that until the individual or community show due signs or be so minor and fractional as not to endanger the State the condition of authoritative tutelage may continue and self government must abide its time Nor is the esthetic point always an important one without fascination for highest aiming souls The common ambition strains for elevations to become some privileged exclusive The master sees greatness and health in being part of the mass nothing will do as well as common ground Would you have in yourself the divine vast general law Then merge yourself in it And topping democracy this most alluring record that it alone can bind and ever seeks to bind all nations all men of however various and distant lands into a brotherhood a family It is the old yet ever modern dream of earth out of her eldest and her youngest her fond philosophers and poets Not that half only individualism which isolates There is another half which is adhesiveness or love that fuses ties and aggregates making the races comrades and fraternizing all Both are to be vitalized by religion sole worthiest elevator of man or State breathing into the proud material tissues the breath of life For I say at the core of democracy finally is the religious element All the religions old and new are there Nor may the scheme step forth clothed in resplendent beauty and command till these bearing the best the latest fruit the spiritual shall fully appear A portion of our pages we might indite with reference toward Europe especially the British part of it more than our own land perhaps not absolutely needed for the home reader But the whole question hangs together and fastens and links all peoples The liberalist of to day has this advantage over antique or mediaeval times that his doctrine seeks not only to individualize but to universalize The great word Solidarity has arisen Of all dangers to a nation as things exist in our day there can be no greater one than having certain portions of the people set off from the rest by a line drawn they not privileged as others but degraded humiliated made of no account Much quackery teems of course even on democracy s side yet does not really affect the orbic quality of the matter To work in if we may so term it and justify God his divine aggregate the People or the veritable horn d and sharp tail d Devil his aggregate if there be who convulsively insist upon it this I say is what democracy is for and this is what our America means and is doing may I not say has done If not she means nothing more and does nothing more than any other land And as by virtue of its kosmical antiseptic power Nature s stomach is fully strong enough not only to digest the morbific matter always presented not to be turn d aside and perhaps indeed intuitively gravitating thither but even to change such contributions into nutriment for highest use and life so American democracy s That is the lesson we these days send over to European lands by every western breeze And truly whatever may be said in the way of abstract argument for or against the theory of a wider democratizing of institutions in any civilized country much trouble might well be saved to all European lands by recognizing this palpable fact for a palpable fact it is that some form of such democratizing is about the only resource now left That or chronic dissatisfaction continued mutterings which grow annually louder and louder till in due course and pretty swiftly in most cases the inevitable crisis crash dynastic ruin Anything worthy to be call d statesmanship in the Old World I should say among the advanced students adepts or men of any brains does not debate to day whether to hold on attempting to lean back and monarchize or to look forward and democratize but how and in what degree and part most prudently to democratize The eager and often inconsiderate appeals of reformers and revolutionists are indispensable to counterbalance the inertness and fossilism making so large a part of human institutions The latter will always take care of themselves the danger being that they rapidly tend to ossify us The former is to be treated with indulgence and even with respect As circulation to air so is agitation and a plentiful degree of speculative license to political and moral sanity Indirectly but surely goodness virtue law of the very best follow freedom These to democracy are what the keel is to the ship or saltness to the ocean The true gravitation hold of liberalism in the United States will be a more universal ownership of property general homesteads general comfort a vast intertwining reticulation of wealth As the human frame or indeed any object in this manifold universe is best kept together by the simple miracle of its own cohesion and the necessity exercise and profit thereof so a great and varied nationality occupying millions of square miles were firmest held and knit by the principle of the safety and endurance of the aggregate of its middling property owners So that from another point of view ungracious as it may sound and a paradox after what we have been saying democracy looks with suspicious ill satisfied eye upon the very poor the ignorant and on those out of business She asks for men and women with occupations well off owners of houses and acres and with cash in the bank and with some cravings for literature too and must have them and hastens to make them Luckily the seed is already well sown and has taken ineradicable root twenty five Huge and mighty are our days our republican lands and most in their rapid shiftings their changes all in the interest of the cause As I write this particular passage November eighteen sixty eight the din of disputation rages around me Acrid the temper of the parties vital the pending questions Congress convenes the President sends his message reconstruction is still in abeyance the nomination and the contest for the twenty first Presidentiad draw close with loudest threat and bustle Of these and all the like of these the eventuations I know not but well I know that behind them and whatever their eventuations the vital things remain safe and certain and all the needed work goes on Time with soon or later superciliousness disposes of Presidents Congressmen party platforms and such Anon it clears the stage of each and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day and at and after which with precious golden exceptions once or twice in a century all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in a burial vault and no one bothers himself the least bit about it afterward But the People ever remain tendencies continue and all the idiocratic transfers in unbroken chain go on In a few years the dominion heart of America will be far inland toward the west Our future national capital may not be where the present one is It is possible nay likely that in less than fifty years it will migrate a thousand or two miles will be re founded and every thing belonging to it made on a different plan original far more superb The main social political spine character of the States will probably run along the Ohio Missouri and Mississippi rivers and west and north of them including Canada Those regions with the group of powerful brothers toward the Pacific destined to the mastership of that sea and its countless paradises of islands will compact and settle the traits of America with all the old retain d but more expanded grafted on newer hardier purely native stock A giant growth composite from the rest getting their contribution absorbing it to make it more illustrious From the north intellect the sun of things also the idea of unswayable justice anchor amid the last the wildest tempests From the south the living soul the animus of good and bad haughtily admitting no demonstration but its own While from the west itself comes solid personality with blood and brawn and the deep quality of all accepting fusion Political democracy as it exists and practically works in America with all its threatening evils supplies a training school for making first class men It is life s gymnasium not of good only but of all We try often though we fall back often A brave delight fit for freedom s athletes fills these arenas and fully satisfies out of the action in them irrespective of success Whatever we do not attain we at any rate attain the experiences of the fight the hardening of the strong campaign and throb with currents of attempt at least Time is ample Let the victors come after us Not for nothing does evil play its part among us Judging from the main portions of the history of the world so far justice is always in jeopardy peace walks amid hourly pitfalls and of slavery misery meanness the craft of tyrants and the credulity of the populace in some of their protean forms no voice can at any time say They are not The clouds break a little and the sun shines out but soon and certain the lowering darkness falls again as if to last forever Yet is there an immortal courage and prophecy in every sane soul that cannot must not under any circumstances capitulate Vive the attack the perennial assault Vive the unpopular cause the spirit that audaciously aims the never abandon d efforts pursued the same amid opposing proofs and precedents Once before the war alas I dare not say how many times the mood has come I too was fill d with doubt and gloom A foreigner an acute and good man had impressively said to me that day putting in form indeed my own observations I have travel d much in the United States and watch d their politicians and listen d to the speeches of the candidates and read the journals and gone into the public houses and heard the unguarded talk of men And I have found your vaunted America honeycomb d from top to toe with infidelism even to itself and its own programme I have mark d the brazen hell faces of secession and slavery gazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways I have everywhere found primarily thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to offices and sometimes filling the offices themselves I have found the north just as full of bad stuff as the south Of the holders of public office in the Nation or the States or their municipalities I have found that not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection of the outsiders the people but all have been nominated and put through by little or large caucuses of the politicians and have got in by corrupt rings and electioneering not capacity or desert I have noticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the helpless supple jacks of comparatively few politicians And I have noticed more and more the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the government and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes Sad serious deep truths Yet are there other still deeper amply confronting dominating truths Over those politicians and great and little rings and over all their insolence and wiles and over the powerfulest parties looms a power too sluggish maybe but ever holding decisions and decrees in hand ready with stern process to execute them as soon as plainly needed and at times indeed summarily crushing to atoms the mightiest parties even in the hour of their pride In saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what at first sight they appear Though it is no doubt important who is elected governor mayor or legislator and full of dismay when incompetent or vile ones get elected as they sometimes do there are other quieter contingencies infinitely more important Shams c will always be the show like ocean s scum enough if waters deep and clear make up the rest Enough that while the piled embroider d shoddy gaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye the hidden warp and weft are genuine and will wear forever Enough in short that the race the land which could raise such as the late rebellion could also put it down The average man of a land at last only is important He in these States remains immortal owner and boss deriving good uses somehow out of any sort of servant in office even the basest certain universal requisites and their settled regularity and protection being first secured a nation like ours in a sort of geological formation state trying continually new experiments choosing new delegations is not served by the best men only but sometimes more by those that provoke it by the combats they arouse Thus national rage fury discussions c better than content Thus also the warning signals invaluable for after times What is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated and doubtless long shall see the popular judgment taking the successful candidates on trial in the offices standing off as it were and observing them and their doings for a while and always giving finally the fit exactly due reward I think after all the sublimest part of political history and its culmination is currently issuing from the American people I know nothing grander better exercise better digestion more positive proof of the past the triumphant result of faith in human kind than a well contested American national election Then still the thought returns like the thread passage in overtures giving the key and echo to these pages When I pass to and fro different latitudes different seasons beholding the crowds of the great cities New York Boston Philadelphia Cincinnati Chicago saint Louis San Francisco New Orleans Baltimore when I mix with these interminable swarms of alert turbulent good natured independent citizens mechanics clerks young persons at the idea of this mass of men so fresh and free so loving and so proud a singular awe falls upon me I feel with dejection and amazement that among our geniuses and talented writers or speakers few or none have yet really spoken to this people created a single image making work for them or absorb d the central spirit and the idiosyncrasies which are theirs and which thus in highest ranges so far remain entirely uncelebrated unexpress d Dominion strong is the body s dominion stronger is the mind s What has fill d and fills to day our intellect our fancy furnishing the standards therein is yet foreign The great poems Shakspere included are poisonous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people the life blood of democracy The models of our literature as we get it from other lands ultra marine have had their birth in courts and bask d and grown in castle sunshine all smells of princes favors Of workers of a certain sort we have indeed plenty contributing after their kind many elegant many learn d all complacent But touch d by the national test or tried by the standards of democratic personality they wither to ashes I say I have not seen a single writer artist lecturer or what not that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect and active pervading underlying will and typic aspiration of the land in a spirit kindred to itself Do you call those genteel little creatures American poets Do you term that perpetual pistareen paste pot work American art American drama taste verse I think I hear echoed as from some mountain top afar in the west the scornful laugh of the Genius of these States Democracy in silence biding its time ponders its own ideals not of literature and art only not of men only but of women The idea of the women of America extricated from this daze this fossil and unhealthy air which hangs about the word lady develop d raised to become the robust equals workers and it may be even practical and political deciders with the men greater than man we may admit through their divine maternity always their towering emblematical attribute but great at any rate as man in all departments or rather capable of being so soon as they realize it and can bring themselves to give up toys and fictions and launch forth as men do amid real independent stormy life Then as towards our thought s finale and in that overarching the true scholar s lesson we have to say there can be no complete or epical presentation of democracy in the aggregate or anything like it at this day because its doctrines will only be effectually incarnated in any one branch when in all their spirit is at the root and centre Far far indeed stretch in distance our Vistas How much is still to be disentangled freed How long it takes to make this American world see that it is in itself the final authority and reliance Did you too O friend suppose democracy was only for elections for politics and for a party name I say democracy is only of use there that it may pass on and come to its flower and fruits in manners in the highest forms of interaction between men and their beliefs in religion literature colleges and schools democracy in all public and private life and in the army and navy twenty six I have intimated that as a paramount scheme it has yet few or no full realizers and believers I do not see either that it owes any serious thanks to noted propagandists or champions or has been essentially help d though often harm d by them It has been and is carried on by all the moral forces and by trade finance machinery intercommunications and in fact by all the developments of history and can no more be stopp d than the tides or the earth in its orbit Doubtless also it resides crude and latent well down in the hearts of the fair average of the American born people mainly in the agricultural regions But it is not yet there or anywhere the fully receiv d the fervid the absolute faith I submit therefore that the fruition of democracy on aught like a grand scale resides altogether in the future As under any profound and comprehensive view of the gorgeous composite feudal world we see in it through the long ages and cycles of ages the results of a deep integral human and divine principle or fountain from which issued laws ecclesia manners institutes costumes personalities poems hitherto unequall d faithfully partaking of their source and indeed only arising either to betoken it or to furnish parts of that varied flowing display whose centre was one and absolute so long ages hence shall the due historian or critic make at least an equal retrospect an equal history for the democratic principle It too must be adorn d credited with its results then when it with imperial power through amplest time has dominated mankind has been the source and test of all the moral esthetic social political and religious expressions and institutes of the civilized world has begotten them in spirit and in form and has carried them to its own unprecedented heights has had it is possible monastics and ascetics more numerous more devout than the monks and priests of all previous creeds has sway d the ages with a breadth and rectitude tallying Nature s own has fashion d systematized and triumphantly finish d and carried out in its own interest and with unparallel d success a new earth and a new man Thus we presume to write as it were upon things that exist not and travel by maps yet unmade and a blank But the throes of birth are upon us and we have something of this advantage in seasons of strong formations doubts suspense for then the afflatus of such themes haply may fall upon us more or less and then hot from surrounding war and revolution our speech though without polish d coherence and a failure by the standard called criticism comes forth real at least as the lightnings And may be we these days have too our own reward for there are yet some in all lands worthy to be so encouraged Though not for us the joy of entering at the last the conquer d city not ours the chance ever to see with our own eyes the peerless power and splendid eclat of the democratic principle arriv d at meridian filling the world with effulgence and majesty far beyond those of past history s kings or all dynastic sway there is yet to whoever is eligible among us the prophetic vision the joy of being toss d in the brave turmoil of these times the promulgation and the path obedient lowly reverent to the voice the gesture of the god or holy ghost which others see not hear not with the proud consciousness that amid whatever clouds seductions or heart wearying postponements we have never deserted never despair d never abandon d the faith So much contributed to be conn d well to help prepare and brace our edifice our plann d Idea we still proceed to give it in another of its aspects perhaps the main the high facade of all For to democracy the leveler the unyielding principle of the average is surely join d another principle equally unyielding closely tracking the first indispensable to it opposite as the sexes are opposite and whose existence confronting and ever modifying the other often clashing paradoxical yet neither of highest avail without the other plainly supplies to these grand cosmic politics of ours and to the launch d forth mortal dangers of republicanism to day or any day the counterpart and offset whereby Nature restrains the deadly original relentlessness of all her first class laws This second principle is individuality the pride and centripetal isolation of a human being in himself identity personalism Whatever the name its acceptance and thorough infusion through the organizations of political commonalty now shooting Aurora like about the world are of utmost importance as the principle itself is needed for very life s sake It forms in a sort or is to form the compensating balance wheel of the successful working machinery of aggregate America And if we think of it what does civilization itself rest upon and what object has it with its religions arts schools c but rich luxuriant varied personalism To that all bends and it is because toward such result democracy alone on anything like Nature s scale breaks up the limitless fallows of humankind and plants the seed and gives fair play that its claims now precede the rest The literature songs esthetics c of a country are of importance principally because they furnish the materials and suggestions of personality for the women and men of that country and enforce them in a thousand effective ways twenty seven As the topmost claim of a strong consolidating of the nationality of these States is that only by such powerful compaction can the separate States secure that full and free swing within their spheres which is becoming to them each after its kind so will individuality with unimpeded branchings flourish best under imperial republican forms Assuming Democracy to be at present in its embryo condition and that the only large and satisfactory justification of it resides in the future mainly through the copious production of perfect characters among the people and through the advent of a sane and pervading religiousness it is with regard to the atmosphere and spaciousness fit for such characters and of certain nutriment and cartoon draftings proper for them and indicating them for New World purposes that I continue the present statement an exploration as of new ground wherein like other primitive surveyors I must do the best I can leaving it to those who come after me to do much better The service in fact if any must be to break a sort of first path or track no matter how rude and ungeometrical We have frequently printed the word Democracy Yet I cannot too often repeat that it is a word the real gist of which still sleeps quite unawaken d notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests out of which its syllables have come from pen or tongue It is a great word whose history I suppose remains unwritten because that history has yet to be enacted It is in some sort younger brother of another great and often used word Nature whose history also waits unwritten As I perceive the tendencies of our day in the States and I entirely respect them are toward those vast and sweeping movements influences moral and physical of humanity now and always current over the planet on the scale of the impulses of the elements Then it is also good to reduce the whole matter to the consideration of a single self a man a woman on permanent grounds Even for the treatment of the universal in politics metaphysics or anything sooner or later we come down to one single solitary soul There is in sanest hours a consciousness a thought that rises independent lifted out from all else calm like the stars shining eternal This is the thought of identity yours for you whoever you are as mine for me Miracle of miracles beyond statement most spiritual and vaguest of earth s dreams yet hardest basic fact and only entrance to all facts In such devout hours in the midst of the significant wonders of heaven and earth significant only because of the Me in the centre creeds conventions fall away and become of no account before this simple idea Under the luminousness of real vision it alone takes possession takes value Like the shadowy dwarf in the fable once liberated and look d upon it expands over the whole earth and spreads to the roof of heaven The quality of BEING in the object s self according to its own central idea and purpose and of growing therefrom and thereto not criticism by other standards and adjustments thereto is the lesson of Nature True the full man wisely gathers culls absorbs but if engaged disproportionately in that he slights or overlays the precious idiocrasy and special nativity and intention that he is the man s self the main thing is a failure however wide his general cultivation Thus in our times refinement and delicatesse are not only attended to sufficiently but threaten to eat us up like a cancer Already the democratic genius watches ill pleased these tendencies Provision for a little healthy rudeness savage virtue justification of what one has in one s self whatever it is is demanded Negative qualities even deficiencies would be a relief Singleness and normal simplicity and separation amid this more and more complex more and more artificialized state of society how pensively we yearn for them how we would welcome their return In some such direction then at any rate enough to preserve the balance we feel called upon to throw what weight we can not for absolute reasons but current ones To prune gather trim conform and ever cram and stuff and be genteel and proper is the pressure of our days While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this we perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what is demanded to serve a half starved and barbarous nation or set of nations but what is most applicable most pertinent for numerous congeries of conventional over corpulent societies already becoming stifled and rotten with flatulent infidelistic literature and polite conformity and art In addition to establish d sciences we suggest a science as it were of healthy average personalism on original universal grounds the object of which should be to raise up and supply through the States a copious race of superb American men and women cheerful religious ahead of any yet known America has yet morally and artistically originated nothing She seems singularly unaware that the models of persons books manners c appropriate for former conditions and for European lands are but exiles and exotics here No current of her life as shown on the surfaces of what is authoritatively called her society accepts or runs into social or esthetic democracy but all the currents set squarely against it Never in the Old World was thoroughly upholster d exterior appearance and show mental and other built entirely on the idea of caste and on the sufficiency of mere outside acquisition never were glibness verbal intellect more the test the emulation more loftily elevated as head and sample than they are on the surface of our republican States this day The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods The word of the modern say these voices is the word Culture We find ourselves abruptly in close quarters with the enemy This word Culture or what it has come to represent involves by contrast our whole theme and has been indeed the spur urging us to engagement Certain questions arise As now taught accepted and carried out are not the processes of culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious infidels who believe in nothing Shall a man lose himself in countless masses of adjustments and be so shaped with reference to this that and the other that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him are reduced and clipp d away like the bordering of box in a garden You can cultivate corn and roses and orchards but who shall cultivate the mountain peaks the ocean and the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds Lastly is the readily given reply that culture only seeks to help systematize and put in attitude the elements of fertility and power a conclusive reply I do not so much object to the name or word but I should certainly insist for the purposes of these States on a radical change of category in the distribution of precedence I should demand a programme of culture drawn out not for a single class alone or for the parlors or lecture rooms but with an eye to practical life the west the working men the facts of farms and jack planes and engineers and of the broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata and with reference to the perfect equality of women and of a grand and powerful motherhood I should demand of this programme or theory a scope generous enough to include the widest human area It must have for its spinal meaning the formation of a typical personality of character eligible to the uses of the high average of men and not restricted by conditions ineligible to the masses The best culture will always be that of the manly and courageous instincts and loving perceptions and of self respect aiming to form over this continent an idiocrasy of universalism which true child of America will bring joy to its mother returning to her in her own spirit recruiting myriads of offspring able natural perceptive tolerant devout believers in her America and with some definite instinct why and for what she has arisen most vast most formidable of historic births and is now and here with wonderful step journeying through Time The problem as it seems to me presented to the New World is under permanent law and order and after preserving cohesion ensemble individuality at all hazards to vitalize man s free play of special Personalism recognizing in it something that calls ever more to be consider d fed and adopted as the substratum for the best that belongs to us government indeed is for it including the new esthetics of our future To formulate beyond this present vagueness to help line and put before us the species or a specimen of the species of the democratic ethnology of the future is a work toward which the genius of our land with peculiar encouragement invites her well wishers Already certain limnings more or less grotesque more or less fading and watery have appear d We too repressing doubts and qualms will try our hand Attempting then however crudely a basic model or portrait of personality for general use for the manliness of the States and doubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive for all and toned low enough we should prepare the canvas well beforehand Parentage must consider itself in advance Will the time hasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a science and the noblest science To our model a clear blooded strong fibred physique is indispensable the questions of food drink air exercise assimilation digestion can never be intermitted Out of these we descry a well begotten selfhood in youth fresh ardent emotional aspiring full of adventure at maturity brave perceptive under control neither too talkative nor too reticent neither flippant nor sombre of the bodily figure the movements easy the complexion showing the best blood somewhat flush d breast expanded an erect attitude a voice whose sound outvies music eyes of calm and steady gaze yet capable also of flashing and a general presence that holds its own in the company of the highest For it is native personality and that alone that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals or in any distinguish d collection with aplomb and not culture or any knowledge or intellect whatever With regard to the mental educational part of our model enlargement of intellect stores of cephalic knowledge c the concentration thitherward of all the customs of our age especially in America is so overweening and provides so fully for that part that important and necessary as it is it really needs nothing from us here except indeed a phrase of warning and restraint Manners costumes too though important we need not dwell upon here Like beauty grace of motion c they are results Causes original things being attended to the right manners unerringly follow Much is said among artists of the grand style as if it were a thing by itself When a man artist or whoever has health pride acuteness noble aspirations he has the motive elements of the grandest style The rest is but manipulation yet that is no small matter Leaving still unspecified several sterling parts of any model fit for the future personality of America I must not fail again and ever to pronounce myself on one probably the least attended to in modern times a hiatus indeed threatening its gloomiest consequences after us I mean the simple unsophisticated Conscience the primary moral element If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of darkest dread respecting the America of our hopes I should have to point to this particular I should demand the invariable application to individuality this day and any day of that old ever true plumb rule of persons eras nations Our triumphant modern civilizee with his all schooling and his wondrous appliances will still show himself but an amputation while this deficiency remains Beyond assuming a more hopeful tone the vertebration of the manly and womanly personalism of our western world can only be and is indeed to be I hope its all penetrating Religiousness The ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of individuality and is a result that no organization or church can ever achieve As history is poorly retain d by what the technists call history and is not given out from their pages except the learner has in himself the sense of the well wrapt never yet written perhaps impossible to be written history so Religion although casually arrested and after a fashion preserv d in the churches and creeds does not depend at all upon them but is a part of the identified soul which when greatest knows not bibles in the old way but in new ways the identified soul which can really confront Religion when it extricates itself entirely from the churches and not before Personalism fuses this and favors it I should say indeed that only in the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the spirituality of religion positively come forth at all Only here and on such terms the meditation the devout ecstasy the soaring flight Only here communion with the mysteries the eternal problems whence whither Alone and identity and the mood and the soul emerges and all statements churches sermons melt away like vapors Alone and silent thought and awe and aspiration and then the interior consciousness like a hitherto unseen inscription in magic ink beams out its wondrous lines to the sense Bibles may convey and priests expound but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one s isolated Self to enter the pure ether of veneration reach the divine levels and commune with the unutterable To practically enter into politics is an important part of American personalism To every young man north and south earnestly studying these things I should here as an offset to what I have said in former pages now also say that may be to views of very largest scope after all perhaps the political perhaps the literary and sociological America goes best about its development its own way sometimes to temporary sight appaling enough It is the fashion among dillettants and fops perhaps I myself am not guiltless to decry the whole formulation of the active politics of America as beyond redemption and to be carefully kept away from See you that you do not fall into this error America it may be is doing very well upon the whole notwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders these half brain d nominees the many ignorant ballots and many elected failures and blatherers It is the dillettants and all who shirk their duty who are not doing well As for you I advise you to enter more strongly yet into politics I advise every young man to do so Always inform yourself always do the best you can always vote Disengage yourself from parties They have been useful and to some extent remain so but the floating uncommitted electors farmers clerks mechanics the masters of parties watching aloof inclining victory this side or that side such are the ones most needed present and future For America if eligible at all to downfall and ruin is eligible within herself not without for I see clearly that the combined foreign world could not beat her down But these savage wolfish parties alarm me Owning no law but their own will more and more combative less and less tolerant of the idea of ensemble and of equal brotherhood the perfect equality of the States the ever overarching American ideas it behooves you to convey yourself implicitly to no party nor submit blindly to their dictators but steadily hold yourself judge and master over all of them So much hastily toss d together and leaving far more unsaid for an ideal or intimations of an ideal toward American manhood But the other sex in our land requires at least a basis of suggestion I have seen a young American woman one of a large family of daughters who some years since migrated from her meagre country home to one of the northern cities to gain her own support She soon became an expert seamstress but finding the employment too confining for health and comfort she went boldly to work for others to house keep cook clean c After trying several places she fell upon one where she was suited She has told me that she finds nothing degrading in her position it is not inconsistent with personal dignity self respect and the respect of others She confers benefits and receives them She has good health her presence itself is healthy and bracing her character is unstain d she has made herself understood and preserves her independence and has been able to help her parents and educate and get places for her sisters and her course of life is not without opportunities for mental improvement and of much quiet uncosting happiness and love I have seen another woman who from taste and necessity conjoin d has gone into practical affairs carries on a mechanical business partly works at it herself dashes out more and more into real hardy life is not abash d by the coarseness of the contact knows how to be firm and silent at the same time holds her own with unvarying coolness and decorum and will compare any day with superior carpenters farmers and even boatmen and drivers For all that she has not lost the charm of the womanly nature but preserves and bears it fully though through such rugged presentation Then there is the wife of a mechanic mother of two children a woman of merely passable English education but of fine wit with all her sex s grace and intuitions who exhibits indeed such a noble female personality that I am fain to record it here Never abnegating her own proper independence but always genially preserving it and what belongs to it cooking washing child nursing house tending she beams sunshine out of all these duties and makes them illustrious Physiologically sweet and sound loving work practical she yet knows that there are intervals however few devoted to recreation music leisure hospitality and affords such intervals Whatever she does and wherever she is that charm that indescribable perfume of genuine womanhood attends her goes with her exhales from her which belongs of right to all the sex and is or ought to be the invariable atmosphere and common aureola of old as well as young My dear mother once described to me a resplendent person down on Long Island whom she knew in early days She was known by the name of the Peacemaker She was well toward eighty years old of happy and sunny temperament had always lived on a farm and was very neighborly sensible and discreet an invariable and welcom d favorite especially with young married women She had numerous children and grandchildren She was uneducated but possess d a native dignity She had come to be a tacitly agreed upon domestic regulator judge settler of difficulties shepherdess and reconciler in the land She was a sight to draw near and look upon with her large figure her profuse snow white hair uncoil d by any head dress or cap dark eyes clear complexion sweet breath and peculiar personal magnetism The foregoing portraits I admit are frightfully out of line from these imported models of womanly personality the stock feminine characters of the current novelists or of the foreign court poems Ophelias Enids princesses or ladies of one thing or another which fill the envying dreams of so many poor girls and are accepted by our men too as supreme ideals of feminine excellence to be sought after But I present mine just for a change Then there are mutterings we will not now stop to heed them here but they must be heeded of something more revolutionary The day is coming when the deep questions of woman s entrance amid the arenas of practical life politics the suffrage c will not only be argued all around us but may be put to decision and real experiment Of course in these States for both man and woman we must entirely recast the types of highest personality from what the oriental feudal ecclesiastical worlds bequeath us and which yet possess the imaginative and esthetic fields of the United States pictorial and melodramatic not without use as studies but making sad work and forming a strange anachronism upon the scenes and exigencies around us Of course the old undying elements remain The task is to successfully adjust them to new combinations our own days Nor is this so incredible I can conceive a community to day and here in which on a sufficient scale the perfect personalities without noise meet say in some pleasant western settlement or town where a couple of hundred best men and women of ordinary worldly status have by luck been drawn together with nothing extra of genius or wealth but virtuous chaste industrious cheerful resolute friendly and devout I can conceive such a community organized in running order powers judiciously delegated farming building trade courts mails schools elections all attended to and then the rest of life the main thing freely branching and blossoming in each individual and bearing golden fruit I can see there in every young and old man after his kind and in every woman after hers a true personality develop d exercised proportionately in body mind and spirit I can imagine this case as one not necessarily rare or difficult but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and general requirements of our times And I can realize in it the culmination of something better than any stereotyped eclat of history or poems Perhaps unsung undramatized unput in essays or biographies perhaps even some such community already exists in Ohio Illinois Missouri or somewhere practically fulfilling itself and thus outvying in cheapest vulgar life all that has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures In short and to sum up America betaking herself to formative action as it is about time for more solid achievement and less windy promise must for her purposes cease to recognize a theory of character grown of feudal aristocracies or form d by merely literary standards or from any ultramarine full dress formulas of culture polish caste c and must sternly promulgate her own new standard yet old enough and accepting the old the perennial elements and combining them into groups unities appropriate to the modern the democratic the west and to the practical occasions and needs of our own cities and of the agricultural regions Ever the most precious in the common Ever the fresh breeze of field or hill or lake is more than any palpitation of fans though of ivory and redolent with perfume and the air is more than the costliest perfumes And now for fear of mistake we may not intermit to beg our absolution from all that genuinely is or goes along with even Culture Pardon us venerable shade if we have seem d to speak lightly of your office The whole civilization of the earth we know is yours with all the glory and the light thereof It is indeed in your own spirit and seeking to tally the loftiest teachings of it that we aim these poor utterances For you too mighty minister know that there is something greater than you namely the fresh eternal qualities of Being From them and by them as you at your best we too evoke the last the needed help to vitalize our country and our days Thus we pronounce not so much against the principle of culture we only supervise it and promulge along with it as deep perhaps a deeper principle As we have shown the New World including in itself the all leveling aggregate of democracy we show it also including the all varied all permitting all free theorem of individuality and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied framework or platform broad enough for all eligible to every farmer and mechanic to the female equally with the male a towering selfhood not physically perfect only not satisfied with the mere mind s and learning s stores but religious possessing the idea of the infinite rudder and compass sure amid this troublous voyage o er darkest wildest wave through stormiest wind of man s or nation s progress realizing above the rest that known humanity in deepest sense is fair adhesion to itself for purposes beyond and that finally the personality of mortal life is most important with reference to the immortal the unknown the spiritual the only permanently real which as the ocean waits for and receives the rivers waits for us each and all Much is there yet demanding line and outline in our Vistas not only on these topics but others quite unwritten Indeed we could talk the matter and expand it through lifetime But it is necessary to return to our original premises In view of them we have again pointedly to confess that all the objective grandeurs of the world for highest purposes yield themselves up and depend on mentality alone Here and here only all balances all rests For the mind which alone builds the permanent edifice haughtily builds it to itself By it with what follows it are convey d to mortal sense the culminations of the materialistic the known and a prophecy of the unknown To take expression to incarnate to endow a literature with grand and archetypal models to fill with pride and love the utmost capacity and to achieve spiritual meanings and suggest the future these and these only satisfy the soul We must not say one word against real materials but the wise know that they do not become real till touched by emotions the mind Did we call the latter imponderable Ah let us rather proclaim that the slightest song tune the countless ephemera of passions arous d by orators and tale tellers are more dense more weighty than the engines there in the great factories or the granite blocks in their foundations Approaching thus the momentous spaces and considering with reference to a new and greater personalism the needs and possibilities of American imaginative literature through the medium light of what we have already broach d it will at once be appreciated that a vast gulf of difference separates the present accepted condition of these spaces inclusive of what is floating in them from any condition adjusted to or fit for the world the America there sought to be indicated and the copious races of complete men and women along these Vistas crudely outlined It is in some sort no less a difference than lies between that long continued nebular state and vagueness of the astronomical worlds compared with the subsequent state the definitely form d worlds themselves duly compacted clustering in systems hung up there chandeliers of the universe beholding and mutually lit by each other s lights serving for ground of all substantial foothold all vulgar uses yet serving still more as an undying chain and echelon of spiritual proofs and shows A boundless field to fill A new creation with needed orbic works launch d forth to revolve in free and lawful circuits to move self poised through the ether and shine like heaven s own suns With such and nothing less we suggest that New World literature fit to rise upon cohere and signalize in time these States What however do we more definitely mean by New World literature Are we not doing well enough here already Are not the United States this day busily using working more printer s type more presses than any other country uttering and absorbing more publications than any other Do not our publishers fatten quicker and deeper helping themselves under shelter of a delusive and sneaking law or rather absence of law to most of their forage poetical pictorial historical romantic even comic without money and without price and fiercely resisting the timidest proposal to pay for it Many will come under this delusion but my purpose is to dispel it I say that a nation may hold and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print journals magazines novels library books poetry c such as the States to day possess and circulate of unquestionable aid and value hundreds of new volumes annually composed and brought out here respectable enough indeed unsurpass d in smartness and erudition with further hundreds or rather millions as by free forage or theft aforemention d also thrown into the market and yet all the while the said nation land strictly speaking may possess no literature at all Repeating our inquiry what then do we mean by real literature especially the democratic literature of the future Hard questions to meet The clues are inferential and turn us to the past At best we can only offer suggestions comparisons circuits It must still be reiterated as for the purpose of these memoranda the deep lesson of history and time that all else in the contributions of a nation or age through its politics materials heroic personalities military eclat c remains crude and defers in any close and thorough going estimate until vitalized by national original archetypes in literature They only put the nation in form finally tell anything prove complete anything perpetuate anything Without doubt some of the richest and most powerful and populous communities of the antique world and some of the grandest personalities and events have to after and present times left themselves entirely unbequeath d Doubtless greater than any that have come down to us were among those lands heroisms persons that have not come down to us at all even by name date or location Others have arrived safely as from voyages over wide century stretching seas The little ships the miracles that have buoy d them and by incredible chances safely convey d them or the best of them their meaning and essence overlong wastes darkness lethargy ignorance c have been a few inscriptions a few immortal compositions small in size yet compassing what measureless values of reminiscence contemporary portraitures manners idioms and beliefs with deepest inference hint and thought to tie and touch forever the old new body and the old new soul These and still these bearing the freight so dear dearer than pride dearer than love All the best experience of humanity folded saved freighted to us here Some of these tiny ships we call Old and New Testament Homer Eschylus Plato Juvenal c Precious minims I think if we were forced to choose rather than have you and the likes of you and what belongs to and has grown of you blotted out and gone we could better afford appaling as that would be to lose all actual ships this day fasten d by wharf or floating on wave and see them with all their cargoes scuttled and sent to the bottom Gather d by geniuses of city race or age and put by them in highest of art s forms namely the literary form the peculiar combinations and the outshows of that city age or race its particular modes of the universal attributes and passions its faiths heroes lovers and gods wars traditions struggles crimes emotions joys or the subtle spirit of these having been pass d on to us to illumine our own selfhood and its experiences what they supply indispensable and highest if taken away nothing else in all the world s boundless store houses could make up to us or ever again return For us along the great highways of time those monuments stand those forms of majesty and beauty For us those beacons burn through all the nights Unknown Egyptians graving hieroglyphs Hindus with hymn and apothegm and endless epic Hebrew prophet with spirituality as in flashes of lightning conscience like red hot iron plaintive songs and screams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement Christ with bent head brooding love and peace like a dove Greek creating eternal shapes of physical and esthetic proportion Roman lord of satire the sword and the codex of the figures some far off and veil d others nearer and visible Dante stalking with lean form nothing but fibre not a grain of superfluous flesh Angelo and the great painters architects musicians rich Shakspere luxuriant as the sun artist and singer of feudalism in its sunset with all the gorgeous colors owner thereof and using them at will and so to such as German Kant and Hegel where they though near us leaping over the ages sit again impassive imperturbable like the Egyptian gods Of these and the like of these is it too much indeed to return to our favorite figure and view them as orbs and systems of orbs moving in free paths in the spaces of that other heaven the kosmic intellect the soul Ye powerful and resplendent ones ye were in your atmospheres grown not for America but rather for her foes the feudal and the old while our genius is democratic and modern Yet could ye indeed but breathe your breath of life into our New World s nostrils not to enslave us as now but for our needs to breed a spirit like your own perhaps dare we to say it to dominate even destroy what you yourselves have left On your plane and no less but even higher and wider must we mete and measure for to day and here I demand races of orbic bards with unconditional uncompromising sway Come forth sweet democratic despots of the west By points like these we in reflection token what we mean by any land s or people s genuine literature And thus compared and tested judging amid the influence of loftiest products only what do our current copious fields of print covering in manifold forms the United States better for an analogy present than as in certain regions of the sea those spreading undulating masses of squid through which the whale swimming with head half out feeds Not but that doubtless our current so called literature like an endless supply of small coin performs a certain service and may be too the service needed for the time the preparation service as children learn to spell Everybody reads and truly nearly everybody writes either books or for the magazines or journals The matter has magnitude too after a sort But is it really advancing or has it advanced for a long while There is something impressive about the huge editions of the dailies and weeklies the mountain stacks of white paper piled in the press vaults and the proud crashing ten cylinder presses which I can stand and watch any time by the half hour Then though the States in the field of imagination present not a single first class work not a single great literatus the main objects to amuse to titillate to pass away time to circulate the news and rumors of news to rhyme and read rhyme are yet attain d and on a scale of infinity To day in books in the rivalry of writers especially novelists success so call d is for him or her who strikes the mean flat average the sensational appetite for stimulus incident persiflage c and depicts to the common calibre sensual exterior life To such or the luckiest of them as we see the audiences are limitless and profitable but they cease presently While this day or any day to workmen portraying interior or spiritual life the audiences were limited and often laggard but they last forever Compared with the past our modern science soars and our journals serve but ideal and even ordinary romantic literature does not I think substantially advance Behold the prolific brood of the contemporary novel magazine tale theatre play c The same endless thread of tangled and superlative love story inherited apparently from the Amadises and Palmerins of the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth centuries over there in Europe The costumes and associations brought down to date the seasoning hotter and more varied the dragons and ogres left out but the thing I should say has not advanced is just as sensational just as strain d remains about the same nor more nor less What is the reason our time our lands that we see no fresh local courage sanity of our own the Mississippi stalwart Western men real mental and physical facts Southerners c in the body of our literature especially the poetic part of it But always instead a parcel of dandies and ennuyees dapper little gentlemen from abroad who flood us with their thin sentiment of parlors parasols piano songs tinkling rhymes the five hundredth importation or whimpering and crying about something chasing one aborted conceit after another and forever occupied in dyspeptic amours with dyspeptic women While current and novel the grandest events and revolutions and stormiest passions of history are crossing to day with unparallel d rapidity and magnificence over the stages of our own and all the continents offering new materials opening new vistas with largest needs inviting the daring launching forth of conceptions in literature inspired by them soaring in highest regions serving art in its highest which is only the other name for serving God and serving humanity where is the man of letters where is the book with any nobler aim than to follow in the old track repeat what has been said before and as its utmost triumph sell well and be erudite or elegant Mark the roads the processes through which these States have arrived standing easy henceforth ever equal ever compact in their range to day European adventures the most antique Asiatic or African old history miracles romances Rather our own unquestion d facts They hasten incredible blazing bright as fire From the deeds and days of Columbus down to the present and including the present and especially the late secession war when I con them I feel every leaf like stopping to see if I have not made a mistake and fall n on the splendid figments of some dream But it is no dream We stand live move in the huge flow of our age s materialism in its spirituality We have had founded for us the most positive of lands The founders have pass d to other spheres but what are these terrible duties they have left us Their politics the United States have in my opinion with all their faults already substantially establish d for good on their own native sound long vista d principles never to be overturn d offering a sure basis for all the rest With that their future religious forms sociology literature teachers schools costumes c are of course to make a compact whole uniform on tallying principles For how can we remain divided contradicting ourselves this way twenty eight I say we can only attain harmony and stability by consulting ensemble and the ethic purports and faithfully building upon them For the New World indeed after two grand stages of preparation strata I perceive that now a third stage being ready for and without which the other two were useless with unmistakable signs appears The First stage was the planning and putting on record the political foundation rights of immense masses of people indeed all people in the organization of republican National State and municipal governments all constructed with reference to each and each to all This is the American programme not for classes but for universal man and is embodied in the compacts of the Declaration of Independence and as it began and has now grown with its amendments the Federal Constitution and in the State governments with all their interiors and with general suffrage those having the sense not only of what is in themselves but that their certain several things started planted hundreds of others in the same direction duly arise and follow The Second stage relates to material prosperity wealth produce labor saving machines iron cotton local State and continental railways intercommunication and trade with all lands steamships mining general employment organization of great cities cheap appliances for comfort numberless technical schools books newspapers a currency for money circulation c The Third stage rising out of the previous ones to make them and all illustrious I now for one promulge announcing a native expression spirit getting into form adult and through mentality for these States self contain d different from others more expansive more rich and free to be evidenced by original authors and poets to come by American personalities plenty of them male and female traversing the States none excepted and by native superber tableaux and growths of language songs operas orations lectures architecture and by a sublime and serious Religious Democracy sternly taking command dissolving the old sloughing off surfaces and from its own interior and vital principles reconstructing democratizing society For America type of progress and of essential faith in man above all his errors and wickedness few suspect how deep how deep it really strikes The world evidently supposes and we have evidently supposed so too that the States are merely to achieve the equal franchise an elective government to inaugurate the respectability of labor and become a nation of practical operatives law abiding orderly and well off Yes those are indeed parts of the task of America but they not only do not exhaust the progressive conception but rather arise teeming with it as the mediums of deeper higher progress Daughter of a physical revolution mother of the true revolutions which are of the interior life and of the arts For so long as the spirit is not changed any change of appearance is of no avail The old men I remember as a boy were always talking of American independence What is independence Freedom from all laws or bonds except those of one s own being control d by the universal ones To lands to man to woman what is there at last to each but the inherent soul nativity idiocrasy free highest poised soaring its own flight following out itself At present these States in their theology and social standards of greater importance than their political institutions are entirely held possession of by foreign lands We see the sons and daughters of the New World ignorant of its genius not yet inaugurating the native the universal and the near still importing the distant the partial and the dead We see London Paris Italy not original superb as where they belong but second hand here where they do not belong We see the shreds of Hebrews Romans Greeks but where on her own soil do we see in any faithful highest proud expression America herself I sometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house Not but that in one sense and a very grand one good theology good art or good literature has certain features shared in common The combination fraternizes ties the races is in many particulars under laws applicable indifferently to all irrespective of climate or date and from whatever source appeals to emotions pride love spirituality common to human kind Nevertheless they touch a man closest perhaps only actually touch him even in these in their expression through autochthonic lights and shades flavors fondnesses aversions specific incidents illustrations out of his own nationality geography surroundings antecedents c The spirit and the form are one and depend far more on association identity and place than is supposed Subtly interwoven with the materiality and personality of a land a race Teuton Turk Californian or what not there is always something I can hardly tell what it is history but describes the results of it it is the same as the untellable look of some human faces Nature too in her stolid forms is full of it but to most it is there a secret This something is rooted in the invisible roots the profoundest meanings of that place race or nationality and to absorb and again effuse it uttering words and products as from its midst and carrying it into highest regions is the work or a main part of the work of any country s true author poet historian lecturer and perhaps even priest and philosoph Here and here only are the foundations for our really valuable and permanent verse drama c But at present judged by any higher scale than that which finds the chief ends of existence to be to feverishly make money during one half of it and by some amusement or perhaps foreign travel flippantly kill time the other half and consider d with reference to purposes of patriotism health a noble personality religion and the democratic adjustments all these swarms of poems literary magazines dramatic plays resultant so far from American intellect and the formation of our best ideas are useless and a mockery They strengthen and nourish no one express nothing characteristic give decision and purpose to no one and suffice only the lowest level of vacant minds Of what is called the drama or dramatic presentation in the United States as now put forth at the theatres I should say it deserves to be treated with the same gravity and on a par with the questions of ornamental confectionery at public dinners or the arrangement of curtains and hangings in a ball room nor more nor less Of the other I will not insult the reader s intelligence once really entering into the atmosphere of these Vistas by supposing it necessary to show in detail why the copious dribble either of our little or well known rhymesters does not fulfil in any respect the needs and august occasions of this land America demands a poetry that is bold modern and all surrounding and kosmical as she is herself It must in no respect ignore science or the modern but inspire itself with science and the modern It must bend its vision toward the future more than the past Like America it must extricate itself from even the greatest models of the past and while courteous to them must have entire faith in itself and the products of its own democratic spirit only Like her it must place in the van and hold up at all hazards the banner of the divine pride of man in himself the radical foundation of the new religion Long enough have the People been listening to poems in which common humanity deferential bends low humiliated acknowledging superiors But America listens to no such poems Erect inflated and fully self esteeming be the chant and then America will listen with pleased ears Nor may the genuine gold the gems when brought to light at last be probably usher d forth from any of the quarters currently counted on To day doubtless the infant genius of American poetic expression eluding those highly refined imported and gilt edged themes and sentimental and butterfly flights pleasant to orthodox publishers causing tender spasms in the coteries and warranted not to chafe the sensitive cuticle of the most exquisitely artificial gossamer delicacy lies sleeping far away happily unrecognized and uninjur d by the coteries the art writers the talkers and critics of the saloons or the lecturers in the colleges lies sleeping aside unrecking itself in some western idiom or native Michigan or Tennessee repartee or stumpspeech or in Kentucky or Georgia or the Carolinas or in some slang or local song or allusion of the Manhattan Boston Philadelphia or Baltimore mechanic or up in the Maine woods or off in the hut of the California miner or crossing the Rocky mountains or along the Pacific railroad or on the breasts of the young farmers of the northwest or Canada or boatmen of the lakes Rude and coarse nursing beds these but only from such beginnings and stocks indigenous here may haply arrive be grafted and sprout in time flowers of genuine American aroma and fruits truly and fully our own I say it were a standing disgrace to these States I say it were a disgrace to any nation distinguish d above others by the variety and vastness of its territories its materials its inventive activity and the splendid practicality of its people not to rise and soar above others also in its original styles in literature and art and its own supply of intellectual and esthetic masterpieces archetypal and consistent with itself I know not a land except ours that has not to some extent however small made its title clear The Scotch have their born ballads subtly expressing their past and present and expressing character The Irish have theirs England Italy France Spain theirs What has America With exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic lyric tale tune picture et cetera in the Four Years War with indeed I sometimes think the richest masses of material ever afforded a nation more variegated and on a larger scale the first sign of proportionate native imaginative Soul and first class works to match is I cannot too often repeat so far wanting Long ere the second centennial arrives there will be some forty to fifty great States among them Canada and Cuba When the present century closes our population will be sixty or seventy millions The Pacific will be ours and the Atlantic mainly ours There will be daily electric communication with every part of the globe What an age What a land Where elsewhere one so great The individuality of one nation must then as always lead the world Can there be any doubt who the leader ought to be Bear in mind though that nothing less than the mightiest original non subordinated SOUL has ever really gloriously led or ever can lead This Soul its other name in these Vistas is LITERATURE In fond fancy leaping those hundred years ahead let us survey America s works poems philosophies fulfilling prophecies and giving form and decision to best ideals Much that is now undream d of we might then perhaps see establish d luxuriantly cropping forth richness vigor of letters and of artistic expression in whose products character will be a main requirement and not merely erudition or elegance Intense and loving comradeship the personal and passionate attachment of man to man which hard to define underlies the lessons and ideals of the profound saviours of every land and age and which seems to promise when thoroughly develop d cultivated and recognized in manners and literature the most substantial hope and safety of the future of these States will then be fully express d twenty nine A strong fibred joyousness and faith and the sense of health al fresco may well enter into the preparation of future noble American authorship Part of the test of a great literatus shall be the absence in him of the idea of the covert the lurid the maleficent the devil the grim estimates inherited from the Puritans hell natural depravity and the like The great literatus will be known among the rest by his cheerful simplicity his adherence to natural standards his limitless faith in God his reverence and by the absence in him of doubt ennui burlesque persiflage or any strain d and temporary fashion Nor must I fail again and yet again to clinch reiterate more plainly still O that indeed such survey as we fancy may show in time this part completed also the lofty aim surely the proudest and the purest in whose service the future literatus of whatever field may gladly labor As we have intimated offsetting the material civilization of our race our nationality its wealth territories factories population products trade and military and naval strength and breathing breath of life into all these and more must be its moral civilization the formulation expression and aidancy whereof is the very highest height of literature The climax of this loftiest range of civilization rising above all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth intellect power and art as such above even theology and religious fervor is to be its development from the eternal bases and the fit expression of absolute Conscience moral soundness Justice Even in religious fervor there is a touch of animal heat But moral conscientiousness crystalline without flaw not Godlike only entirely human awes and enchants forever Great is emotional love even in the order of the rational universe But if we must make gradations I am clear there is something greater Power love veneration products genius esthetics tried by subtlest comparisons analyses and in serenest moods somewhere fail somehow become vain Then noiseless withflowing steps the lord the sun the last ideal comes By the names right justice truth we suggest but do not describe it To the world of men it remains a dream an idea as they call it But no dream is it to the wise but the proudest almost only solid lasting thing of all Its analogy in the material universe is what holds together this world and every object upon it and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe Its lack and the persistent shirking of it as in life sociology literature politics business and even sermonizing these times or any times still leaves the abysm the mortal flaw and smutch mocking civilization to day with all its unquestion d triumphs and all the civilization so far known thirty Present literature while magnificently fulfilling certain popular demands with plenteous knowledge and verbal smartness is profoundly sophisticated insane and its very joy is morbid It needs tally and express Nature and the spirit of Nature and to know and obey the standards I say the question of Nature largely consider d involves the questions of the esthetic the emotional and the religious and involves happiness A fitly born and bred race growing up in right conditions of out door as much as in door harmony activity and development would probably from and in those conditions find it enough merely to live and would in their relations to the sky air water trees c and to the countless common shows and in the fact of life itself discover and achieve happiness with Being suffused night and day by wholesome extasy surpassing all the pleasures that wealth amusement and even gratified intellect erudition or the sense of art can give In the prophetic literature of these States the reader of my speculations will miss their principal stress unless he allows well for the point that a new Literature perhaps a new Metaphysics certainly a new Poetry are to be in my opinion the only sure and worthy supports and expressions of the American Democracy Nature true Nature and the true idea of Nature long absent must above all become fully restored enlarged and must furnish the pervading atmosphere to poems and the test of all high literary and esthetic compositions I do not mean the smooth walks trimm d hedges poseys and nightingales of the English poets but the whole orb with its geologic history the kosmos carrying fire and snow that rolls through the illimitable areas light as a feather though weighing billions of tons Furthermore as by what we now partially call Nature is intended at most only what is entertainable by the physical conscience the sense of matter and of good animal health on these it must be distinctly accumulated incorporated that man comprehending these has in towering superaddition the moral and spiritual consciences indicating his destination beyond the ostensible the mortal To the heights of such estimate of Nature indeed ascending we proceed to make observations for our Vistas breathing rarest air What is I believe called Idealism seems to me to suggest guarding against extravagance and ever modified even by its opposite the course of inquiry and desert of favor for our New World metaphysics their foundation of and in literature giving hue to all thirty one The elevating and etherealizing ideas of the unknown and of unreality must be brought forward with authority as they are the legitimate heirs of the known and of reality and at least as great as their parents Fearless of scoffing and of the ostent let us take our stand our ground and never desert it to confront the growing excess and arrogance of realism To the cry now victorious the cry of sense science flesh incomes farms merchandise logic intellect demonstrations solid perpetuities buildings of brick and iron or even the facts of the shows of trees earth rocks c fear not my brethren my sisters to sound out with equally determin d voice that conviction brooding within the recesses of every envision d soul illusions apparitions figments all True we must not condemn the show neither absolutely deny it for the indispensability of its meanings but how clearly we see that migrate in soul to what we can already conceive of superior and spiritual points of view and palpable as it seems under present relations it all and several might nay certainly would fall apart and vanish I hail with joy the oceanic variegated intense practical energy the demand for facts even the business materialism of the current age our States But we to the age or land in which these things movements stopping at themselves do not tend to ideas As fuel to flame and flame to the heavens so must wealth science materialism even this democracy of which we make so much unerringly feed the highest mind the soul Infinitude the flight fathomless the mystery Man so diminutive dilates beyond the sensible universe competes with outcopes space and time meditating even one great idea Thus and thus only does a human being his spirit ascend above and justify objective Nature which probably nothing in itself is incredibly and divinely serviceable indispensable real here And as the purport of objective Nature is doubtless folded hidden somewhere here as somewhere here is what this globe and its manifold forms and the light of day and night s darkness and life itself with all its experiences are for it is here the great literature especially verse must get its inspiration and throbbing blood Then may we attain to a poetry worthy the immortal soul of man and widen while absorbing materials and in their own sense the shows of Nature will above all have both directly and indirectly a freeing fluidizing expanding religious character exulting with science fructifying the moral elements and stimulating aspirations and meditations on the unknown The process so far is indirect and peculiar and though it may be suggested cannot be defined Observing rapport and with intuition the shows and forms presented by Nature the sensuous luxuriance the beautiful in living men and women the actual play of passions in history and life and above all from those developments either in Nature or human personality in which power dearest of all to the sense of the artist transacts itself out of these and seizing what is in them the poet the esthetic worker in any field by the divine magic of his genius projects them their analogies by curious removes indirections in literature and art No useless attempt to repeat the material creation by daguerreotyping the exact likeness by mortal mental means This is the image making faculty coping with material creation and rivaling almost triumphing over it This alone when all the other parts of a specimen of literature or art are ready and waiting can breathe into it the breath of life and endow it with identity The true question to ask says the librarian of Congress in a paper read before the Social Science Convention at New York October eighteen sixty nine The true question to ask respecting a book is has it help d any human soul This is the hint statement not only of the great literatus his book but of every great artist It may be that all works of art are to be first tried by their art qualities their image forming talent and their dramatic pictorial plot constructing euphonious and other talents Then whenever claiming to be first class works they are to be strictly and sternly tried by their foundation in and radiation in the highest sense and always indirectly of the ethic principles and eligibility to free arouse dilate As within the purposes of the Kosmos and vivifying all meteorology and all the congeries of the mineral vegetable and animal worlds all the physical growth and development of man and all the history of the race in politics religions wars c there is a moral purpose a visible or invisible intention certainly underlying all its results and proof needing to be patiently waited for needing intuition faith idiosyncrasy to its realization which many and especially the intellectual do not have so in the product or congeries of the product of the greatest literatus This is the last profoundest measure and test of a first class literary or esthetic achievement and when understood and put in force must fain I say lead to works books nobler than any hitherto known Lo Nature the only complete actual poem existing calmly in the divine scheme containing all content careless of the criticisms of a day or these endless and wordy chatterers And lo to the consciousness of the soul the permanent identity the thought the something before which the magnitude even of democracy art literature c dwindles becomes partial measurable something that fully satisfies which those do not That something is the All and the idea of All with the accompanying idea of eternity and of itself the soul buoyant indestructible sailing space forever visiting every region as a ship the sea And again lo the pulsations in all matter all spirit throbbing forever the eternal beats eternal systole and diastole of life in things wherefrom I feel and know that death is not the ending as was thought but rather the real beginning and that nothing ever is or can be lost nor ever die nor soul nor matter In the future of these States must arise poets immenser far and make great poems of death The poems of life are great but there must be the poems of the purports of life not only in itself but beyond itself I have eulogized Homer the sacred bards of Jewry Eschylus Juvenal Shakspere c and acknowledged their inestimable value But with perhaps the exception in some not all respects of the second mention d I say there must for future and democratic purposes appear poets dare I to say so of higher class even than any of those poets not only possess d of the religious fire and abandon of Isaiah luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer or for proud characters as in Shakspere but consistent with the Hegelian formulas and consistent with modern science America needs and the world needs a class of bards who will now and ever so link and tally the rational physical being of man with the ensembles of time and space and with this vast and multiform show Nature surrounding him ever tantalizing him equally a part and yet not a part of him as to essentially harmonize satisfy and put at rest Faith very old now scared away by science must be restored brought back by the same power that caused her departure restored with new sway deeper wider higher than ever Surely this universal ennui this coward fear this shuddering at death these low degrading views are not always to rule the spirit pervading future society as it has the past and does the present What the Roman Lucretius sought most nobly yet all too blindly negatively to do for his age and its successors must be done positively by some great coming literatus especially poet who while remaining fully poet will absorb whatever science indicates with spiritualism and out of them and out of his own genius will compose the great poem of death Then will man indeed confront Nature and confront time and space both with science and con amore and take his right place prepared for life master of fortune and misfortune And then that which was long wanted will be supplied and the ship that had it not before in all her voyages will have an anchor There are still other standards suggestions for products of high literatuses That which really balances and conserves the social and political world is not so much legislation police treaties and dread of punishment as the latent eternal intuitional sense in humanity of fairness manliness decorum c Indeed this perennial regulation control and oversight by self suppliance is sine qua non to democracy and a highest widest aim of democratic literature may well be to bring forth cultivate brace and strengthen this sense in individuals and society A strong mastership of the general inferior self by the superior self is to be aided secured indirectly but surely by the literatus in his works shaping for individual or aggregate democracy a great passionate body in and along with which goes a great masterful spirit And still providing for contingencies I fain confront the fact the need of powerful native philosophs and orators and bards these States as rallying points to come in times of danger and to fend off ruin and defection For history is long long long Shift and turn the combinations of the statement as we may the problem of the future of America is in certain respects as dark as it is vast Pride competition segregation vicious wilfulness and license beyond example brood already upon us Unwieldy and immense who shall hold in behemoth who bridle leviathan Flaunt it as we choose athwart and over the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty and dreadful threatening gloom It is useless to deny it Democracy grows rankly up the thickest noxious deadliest plants and fruits of all brings worse and worse invaders needs newer larger stronger keener compensations and compellers Our lands embracing so much embracing indeed the whole rejecting none hold in their breast that flame also capable of consuming themselves consuming us all Short as the span of our national life has been already have death and downfall crowded close upon us and will again crowd close no doubt even if warded off Ages to come may never know but I know how narrowly during the late secession war and more than once and more than twice or thrice our Nationality wherein bound up as in a ship in a storm depended and yet depend all our best life all hope all value just grazed just by a hair escaped destruction Alas to think of them the agony and bloody sweat of certain of those hours those cruel sharp suspended crises Even to day amid these whirls incredible flippancy and blind fury of parties infidelity entire lack of first class captains and leaders added to the plentiful meanness and vulgarity of the ostensible masses that problem the labor question beginning to open like a yawning gulf rapidly widening every year what prospect have we We sail a dangerous sea of seething currents cross and under currents vortices all so dark untried and whither shall we turn It seems as if the Almighty had spread before this nation charts of imperial destinies dazzling as the sun yet with many a deep intestine difficulty and human aggregate of cankerous imperfection saying lo the roads the only plans of development long and varied with all terrible balks and ebullitions You said in your soul I will be empire of empires overshadowing all else past and present putting the history of Old World dynasties conquests behind me as of no

more sacred cause to day demands and shall supply in a New World to larger grander work more than the counterpart and tally of them Arrived now definitely at an apex for these Vistas I confess that the promulgation and belief in such a class or institution a new and greater literatus order its possibility nay certainty underlies these entire speculations and that the rest the other parts as superstructures are all founded upon it It really seems to me the condition not only of our future national and democratic development but of our perpetuation In the highly artificial and materialistic bases of modern civilization with the corresponding arrangements and methods of living the force infusion of intellect alone the depraving influences of riches just as much as poverty the absence of all high ideals in character with the long series of tendencies shapings which few are strong enough to resist and which now seem with steam engine speed to be everywhere turning out the generations of humanity like uniform iron castings all of which as compared with the feudal ages we can yet do nothing better than accept make the best of and even welcome upon the whole for their oceanic practical grandeur and their restless wholesale kneading of the masses I say of all this tremendous and dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in the United States with the results as already seen accumulating and reaching far into the future that they must either be confronted and met by at least an equally subtle and tremendous force infusion for purposes of spiritualization for the pure conscience for genuine esthetics and for absolute and primal manliness and womanliness or else our modern civilization with all its improvements is in vain and we are on the road to a destiny a status equivalent in its real world to that of the fabled damned Prospecting thus the coming unsped days and that new order in them marking the endless train of exercise

third hand We see that the real interest of this people of ours in the theology history poetry politics and personal models of the past the British islands for instance and indeed all the past is not necessarily to mould ourselves or our literature upon them but to attain fuller more definite comparisons warnings and the insight to ourselves our own present and our own far grander different future

lands needs to be re written re sung re stated in terms consistent with the institution of these States and to come in range and obedient uniformity with them We see as in the universes of the material kosmos after meteorological vegetable and animal cycles man at last arises born through them to prove them concentrate them to turn upon them with wonder and love to command them adorn them and carry them upward into superior realms so out of the series of the preceding social and political universes now arise these States We see that while many were supposing things establish d and completed really the grandest things always remain and discover that the work of the New World is not ended but only fairly begun We see our land America her literature esthetics c as substantially

Union has expanded into over four millions and a half fifteen times larger than that of Great Britain and France combined with a shore line including Alaska equal to the entire circumference of the earth and with a domain within these lines far wider than that of the Romans in their proudest days of conquest and renown With a river lake and coastwise commerce estimated at over two thousand millions of dollars per year with a railway traffic of four to six thousand millions per year and the annual domestic exchanges of the country running up to nearly ten thousand millions per year with over two thousand millions of dollars invested in manufacturing mechanical and mining industry with over five hundred millions of acres of land in actual occupancy valued with their appurtenances at over seven thousand millions of dollars and producing annually crops valued at over three thousand millions of dollars with a realm which if the density of Belgium s population were possible would be vast enough to include all the present inhabitants of the world and with equal rights guaranteed to even the poorest and humblest of our forty millions of people we can with a manly pride akin to that which distinguish d the palmiest days of Rome claim c c c Vice President Colfax s Speech July four eighteen seventy LATER London Times Weekly June twenty three eighty two The wonderful wealth producing power of the United States defies and sets at naught the grave drawbacks of a mischievous protective tariff and has already obliterated almost wholly the traces of the greatest of modern civil wars What is especially remarkable in the present development of American energy and success is its wide and equable distribution North and south east and west on the shores of the Atlantic and the Pacific along the chain of the great lakes in the valley of the Mississippi and on the coasts of the gulf of Mexico the creation of wealth and the increase of population are signally exhibited It is quite true as has been shown by the recent apportionment of population in the House of Representatives that some sections of the Union have advanced relatively to the rest in an extraordinary and unexpected degree But this does not imply that the States which have gain d no additional representatives or have actually lost some have been stationary or have receded The fact is that the present tide of prosperity has risen so high that it has overflow d all barriers and has fill d up the back waters and establish d something like an approach to uniform success twenty one See for hereditaments specimens Walter Scott s Border Minstrelsy Percy s collection Ellis s early English Metrical Romances the European continental poems of Walter of Aquitania and the Nibelungen of pagan stock but monkish feudal redaction the history of the Troubadours by Fauriel even the far back cumbrous old Hindu epics as indicating the Asian eggs out of which European chivalry was hatch d Ticknor s chapters on the Cid and on the Spanish poems and poets of Calderon s time Then always and of course as the superbest poetic culmination expression of feudalism the Shaksperean dramas in the attitudes dialogue characters c of the princes lords and gentlemen the pervading atmosphere the implied and express d standard of manners the high port and proud stomach the regal embroidery of style c twenty two Of these rapidly sketch d hiatuses the two which seem to me most serious are for one the condition absence or perhaps the singular abeyance of moral conscientious fibre all through American society and for another the appaling depletion of women in their powers of sane athletic maternity their crowning attribute and ever making the woman in loftiest spheres superior to the man I have sometimes thought indeed that the sole avenue and means of a reconstructed sociology depended primarily on a new birth elevation expansion invigoration of woman affording for races to come as the conditions that antedate birth are indispensable a perfect motherhood Great great indeed far greater than they know is the sphere of women But doubtless the question of such new sociology all goes together includes many varied and complex influences and premises and the man as well as the woman and the woman as well as the man twenty three The question hinted here is one which time only can answer Must not the virtue of modern Individualism continually enlarging usurping all seriously affect perhaps keep down entirely in America the like of the ancient virtue of Patriotism the fervid and absorbing love of general country I have no doubt myself that the two will merge and will mutually profit and brace each other and that from them a greater product a third will arise But I feel that at present they and their oppositions form a serious problem and paradox in the United States twenty four SHOOTING NIAGARA I was at first roused to much anger and abuse by this essay from mister Carlyle so insulting to the theory of America but happening to think afterwards how I had more than once been in the like mood during which his essay was evidently cast and seen persons and things in the same light indeed some might say there are signs of the same feeling in these Vistas I have since read it again not only as a study expressing as it does certain judgments from the highest feudal point of view but have read it with respect as coming from an earnest soul and as contributing certain sharp cutting metallic grains which if not gold or silver may be good hard honest iron twenty five For fear of mistake I may as well distinctly specify as cheerfully included in the model and standard of these Vistas a practical stirring worldly money making even materialistic character It is undeniable that our farms stores offices dry goods coal and groceries enginery cash accounts trades earnings markets c should be attended to in earnest and actively pursued just as if they had a real and permanent existence I perceive clearly that the extreme business energy and this almost maniacal appetite for wealth prevalent in the United States are parts of amelioration and progress indispensably needed to prepare the very results I demand My theory includes riches and the getting of riches and the amplest products power activity inventions movements c Upon them as upon substrata I raise the edifice design d in these Vistas twenty six The whole present system of the officering and personnel of the army and navy of these States and the spirit and letter of their trebly aristocratic rules and regulations is a monstrous exotic a nuisance and revolt and belong here just as much as orders of nobility or the Pope s council of cardinals I say if the present theory of our army and navy is sensible and true then the rest of America is an unmitigated fraud twenty seven A After the rest is satiated all interest culminates in the field of persons and never flags there Accordingly in this field have the great poets and literatuses signally toil d They too in all ages all lands have been creators fashioning making types of men and women as Adam and Eve are made in the divine fable Behold shaped bred by orientalism feudalism through their long growth and culmination and breeding back in return when shall we have an equal series typical of democracy behold commencing in primal Asia apparently formulated in what beginning we know in the gods of the mythologies and coming down thence a few samples out of the countless product bequeath d to the moderns bequeath d to America as studies For the men Yudishtura Rama Arjuna Solomon most of the Old and New Testament characters Achilles Ulysses Theseus Prometheus Hercules Aeneas Plutarch s heroes the Merlin of Celtic bards the Cid Arthur and his knights Siegfried and Hagen in the Nibelungen Roland and Oliver Roustam in the Shah Nemah and so on to Milton s Satan Cervantes Don Quixote Shakspere s Hamlet Richard II Lear Marc Antony c and the modern Faust These I say are models combined adjusted to other standards than America s but of priceless value to her and hers Among women the goddesses of the Egyptian Indian and Greek mythologies certain Bible characters especially the Holy Mother Cleopatra Penelope the portraits of Brunhelde and Chriemhilde in the Nibelungen Oriana Una c the modern Consuelo Walter Scott s Jeanie and Effie Deans c c Yet woman portray d or outlin d at her best or as perfect human mother does not hitherto it seems to me fully appear in literature twenty eight Note to day an instructive curious spectacle and conflict Science twin in its fields of Democracy in its Science testing absolutely all thoughts all works has already burst well upon the world a sun mounting most illuminating most glorious surely never again to set But against it deeply entrench d holding possession yet remains not only through the churches and schools but by imaginative literature and unregenerate poetry the fossil theology of the mythic materialistic superstitious untaught and credulous fable loving primitive ages of humanity twenty nine It is to the development identification and general prevalence of that fervid comradeship the adhesive love at least rivaling the amative love hitherto possessing imaginative literature if not going beyond it that I look for the counterbalance and offset of our materialistic and vulgar American democracy and for the spiritualization thereof Many will say it is a dream and will not follow my inferences but I confidently expect a time when there will be seen running like a half hid warp through all the myriad audible and visible worldly interests of America threads of manly friendship fond and loving pure and sweet strong and life long carried to degrees hitherto unknown not only giving tone to individual character and making it unprecedently emotional muscular heroic and refined but having the deepest relations to general politics I say democracy infers such loving comradeship as its most inevitable twin or counterpart without which it will be incomplete in vain and incapable of perpetuating itself thirty I am reminded as I write that out of this very conscience or idea of conscience of intense moral right and in its name and strain d construction the worst fanaticisms wars persecutions murders c have yet in all lands in the past been broach d and have come to their devilish fruition Much is to be said but I may say here and in response that side by side with the unflagging stimulation of the elements of religion and conscience must henceforth move with equal sway science absolute reason and the general proportionate development of the whole man These scientific facts deductions are divine too precious counted parts of moral civilization and with physical health indispensable to it to prevent fanaticism For abstract religion I perceive is easily led astray ever credulous and is capable of devouring remorseless like fire and flame Conscience too isolated from all else and from the emotional nature may but attain the beauty and purity of glacial snowy ice We want for these States for the general character a cheerful religious fervor endued with the ever present modifications of the human emotions friendship benevolence with a fair field for scientific inquiry the right of individual judgment and always the cooling influences of material Nature thirty one The culmination and fruit of literary artistic expression and its final fields of pleasure for the human soul are in metaphysics including the mysteries of the spiritual world the soul itself and the question of the immortal continuation of our identity In all ages the mind of man has brought up here and always will Here at least of whatever race or era we stand on common ground Applause too is unanimous antique or modern Those authors who work well in this field though their reward instead of a handsome percentage or royalty may be but simply the laurel crown of the victors in the great Olympic games will be dearest to humanity and their works however esthetically defective will be treasur d forever The altitude of literature and poetry has always been religion and always will be The Indian Vedas the Nackas of Zoroaster the Tal mud of the Jews the Old Testament the Gospel of Christ and his disciples Plato s works the Koran of Mohammed the Edda of Snorro and so on toward our own day to Swedenborg and to the invaluable contributions of Leibnitz Kant and Hegel these with such poems only in which while singing well of persons and events of the passions of man and the shows of the material universe the religious tone the consciousness of mystery the recognition of the future of the unknown of Deity over and under all and of the divine purpose are never absent but indirectly give tone to all exhibit literature s real heights and elevations towering up like the great mountains of the earth Standing on this ground the last the highest only permanent ground and sternly criticising from it all works either of the literary or any art we have peremptorily to dismiss every pretensive production however fine its esthetic or intellectual points which violates or ignores or even does not celebrate the central divine idea of All suffusing universe of eternal trains of purpose in the development by however slow degrees of the physical moral and spiritual kosmos I say he has studied meditated to no profit whatever may be his mere erudition who has not absorbed this simple consciousness and faith It is not entirely new but it is for Democracy to elaborate it and look to build upon and expand from it with uncompromising reliance Above the doors of teaching the inscription is to appear Though little or nothing can be absolutely known perceiv d except from a point of view which is evanescent yet we know at least one permanency that Time and Space in the will of God furnish successive chains completions of material births and beginnings solve all discrepancies fears and doubts and eventually fulfil happiness and that the prophecy of those births namely spiritual results throws the true arch over all teaching all science The local considerations of sin disease deformity ignorance death c and their measurement by the superficial mind and ordinary legislation and theology are to be met by science boldly accepting promulging this faith and planting the seeds of superber laws of the explication of the physical universe through the spiritual and clearing the way for a religion sweet and unimpugnable alike to little child or great savan ORIGINS OF ATTEMPTED SECESSION Not the whole matter but some side facts worth conning to day and any day I consider the war of attempted secession eighteen sixty sixty five not as a struggle of two distinct and separate peoples but a conflict often happening and very fierce between the passions and paradoxes of one and the same identity perhaps the only terms on which that identity could really become fused homogeneous and lasting The origin and conditions out of which it arose are full of lessons full of warnings yet to the Republic and always will be The underlying and principal of those origins are yet singularly ignored The Northern States were really just as responsible for that war in its precedents foundations instigations as the South Let me try to give my view From the age of twenty one to forty eighteen forty sixty I was interested in the political movements of the land not so much as a participant but as an observer and a regular voter at the elections I think I was conversant with the springs of action and their workings not only in New York city and Brooklyn but understood them in the whole country as I had made leisurely tours through all the middle States and partially through the western and southern and down to New Orleans in which city I resided for some time I was there at the close of the Mexican war saw and talk d with General Taylor and the other generals and officers who were feted and detain d several days on their return victorious from that expedition Of course many and very contradictory things specialties developments constitutional views c went to make up the origin of the war but the most significant general fact can be best indicated and stated as follows For twenty five years previous to the outbreak the controling Democratic nominating conventions of our Republic starting from their primaries in wards or districts and so expanding to counties powerful cities States and to the great Presidential nominating conventions were getting to represent and be composed of more and more putrid and dangerous materials Let me give a schedule or list of one of these representative conventions for a long time before and inclusive of that which nominated Buchanan Remember they had come to be the fountains and tissues of the American body politic forming as it were the whole blood legislation office holding c One of these conventions from eighteen forty to sixty exhibited a spectacle such as could never be seen except in our own age and in these States The members who composed it were seven eighths of them the meanest kind of bawling and blowing office holders office seekers pimps malignants conspirators murderers fancy men custom house clerks contractors kept editors spaniels well train d to carry and fetch jobbers infidels disunionists terrorists mail riflers slave catchers pushers of slavery creatures of the President creatures of would be Presidents spies bribers compromisers lobbyers sponges ruin d sports expell d gamblers policy backers monte dealers duellists carriers of conceal d weapons deaf men pimpled men scarr d inside with vile disease gaudy outside with gold chains made from the people s money and harlots money twisted together crawling serpentine men the lousy combings and born freedom sellers of the earth And whence came they From back yards and bar rooms from out of the custom houses marshals offices post offices and gambling hells from the President s house the jail the station house from unnamed by places where devilish disunion was hatch d at midnight from political hearses and from the coffins inside and from the shrouds inside of the coffins from the tumors and abscesses of the land from the skeletons and skulls in the vaults of the federal almshouses and from the running sores of the great cities Such I say form d or absolutely controll d the forming of the entire personnel the atmosphere nutriment and chyle of our municipal State and National politics substantially permeating handling deciding and wielding everything legislation nominations elections public sentiment c while the great masses of the people farmers mechanics and traders were helpless in their gripe These conditions were mostly prevalent in the north and west and especially in New York and Philadelphia cities and the southern leaders bad enough but of a far higher order struck hands and affiliated with and used them Is it strange that a thunder storm follow d such morbid and stifling cloud strata I say then that what as just outlined heralded and made the ground ready for secession revolt ought to be held up through all the future as the most instructive lesson in American political history the most significant warning and beacon light to coming generations I say that the sixteenth seventeenth and eighteenth terms of the American Presidency have shown that the villainy and shallowness of rulers back d by the machinery of great parties are just as eligible to these States as to any foreign despotism kingdom or empire there is not a bit of difference History is to record those three Presidentiads and especially the administrations of Fillmore and Buchanan as so far our topmost warning and shame Never were publicly display d more deform d mediocre snivelling unreliable false hearted men Never were these States so insulted and attempted to be betray d All the main purposes for which the government was establish d were openly denied The perfect equality of slavery with freedom was flauntingly preach d in the north nay the superiority of slavery The slave trade was proposed to be renew d Everywhere frowns and misunderstandings everywhere exasperations and humiliations The slavery contest is settled and the war is long over yet do not those putrid conditions too many of them still exist still result in diseases fevers wounds not of war and army hospitals but the wounds and diseases of peace Out of those generic influences mainly in New York Pennsylvania Ohio c arose the attempt at disunion To philosophical examination the malignant fever of that war shows its embryonic sources and the original nourishment of its life and growth in the north I say secession below the surface originated and was brought to maturity in the free States I allude to the score of years preceding eighteen sixty My deliberate opinion is now that if at the opening of the contest the abstract duality question of slavery and quiet could have been submitted to a direct popular vote as against their opposite they would have triumphantly carried the day in a majority of the northern States in the large cities leading off with New York and Philadelphia by tremendous majorities The events of sixty one amazed everybody north and south and burst all prophecies and calculations like bubbles But even then and during the whole war the stern fact remains that not only did the north put it down but the secession cause had numerically just as many sympathizers in the free as in the rebel States As to slavery abstractly and practically its idea and the determination to establish and expand it especially in the new territories the future America it is too common I repeat to identify it exclusively with the south In fact down to the opening of the war the whole country had about an equal hand in it The north had at least been just as guilty if not more guilty and the east and west had The former Presidents and Congresses had been guilty the governors and legislatures of every northern State had been guilty and the mayors of New York and other northern cities had all been guilty their hands were all stain d And as the conflict took decided shape it is hard to tell which class the leading southern or northern disunionists was more stunn d and disappointed at the non action of the free State secession element so largely existing and counted on by those leaders both sections So much for that point and for the north As to the inception and direct instigation of the war in the south itself I shall not attempt interiors or complications Behind all the idea that it was from a resolute and arrogant determination on the part of the extreme slaveholders the Calhounites to carry the States rights portion of the constitutional compact to its farthest verge and nationalize slavery or else disrupt the Union and found a new empire with slavery for its corner stone was and is undoubtedly the true theory If successful this attempt might I am not sure but it might have destroy d not only our American republic in anything like first class proportions in itself and its prestige but for ages at least the cause of Liberty and Equality everywhere and would have been the greatest triumph of reaction and the severest blow to political and every other freedom possible to conceive Its worst result would have inured to the southern States themselves That our national democratic experiment principle and machinery could triumphantly sustain such a shock and that the Constitution could weather it like a ship a storm and come out of it as sound and whole as before is by far the most signal proof yet of the stability of that experiment Democracy and of those principles and that Constitution Of the war itself we know in the ostent what has been done The numbers of the dead and wounded can be told or approximated the debt posted and put on record the material events narrated c Meantime elections go on laws are pass d political parties struggle issue their platforms c just the same as before But immensest results not only in politics but in literature poems and sociology are doubtless waiting yet unform d in the future How long they will wait I cannot tell The pageant of history s retrospect shows us ages since all Europe marching on the crusades those arm d uprisings of the people stirr d by a mere idea to grandest attempt and when once baffled in it returning at intervals twice thrice and again An unsurpass d series of revolutionary events influences Yet it took over two hundred years for the seeds of the crusades to germinate before beginning even to sprout Two hundred years they lay sleeping not dead but dormant in the ground Then out of them unerringly arts travel navigation politics literature freedom the spirit of adventure inquiry all arose grew and steadily sped on to what we see at present Far back there that huge agitation struggle of the crusades stands as undoubtedly the embryo the start of the high preeminence of experiment civilization and enterprise which the European nations have since sustain d and of which these States are the heirs Another illustration history is full of them although the war itself the victory of the Union and the relations of our equal States present features of which there are no precedents in the past The conquest of England eight centuries ago by the Franco Normans the obliteration of the old in many respects so needing obliteration the Domesday Book and the repartition of the land the old impedimenta removed even by blood and ruthless violence and a new progressive genesis establish d new seeds sown time has proved plain enough that bitter as they were all these were the most salutary series of revolutions that could possibly have happen d Out of them and by them mainly have come out of Albic Roman and Saxon England and without them could not have come not only the England of the five hundred years down to the present and of the present but these States Nor except for that terrible dislocation and overturn would these States as they are exist to day It is certain to me that the United States by virtue of that war and its results and through that and them only are now ready to enter and must certainly enter upon their genuine career in history as no more torn and divided in their spinal requisites but a great homogeneous Nation free States all a moral and political unity in variety such as Nature shows in her grandest physical works and as much greater than any mere work of Nature as the moral and political the work of man his mind his soul are in their loftiest sense greater than the merely physical Out of that war not only has the nationality of the States escaped from being strangled but more than any of the rest and in my opinion more than the north itself the vital heart and breath of the south have escaped as from the pressure of a general nightmare and are henceforth to enter on a life development and active freedom whose realities are certain in the future notwithstanding all the southern vexations of the hour a development which could not possibly have been achiev d on any less terms or by any other means than that grim lesson or something equivalent to it And I predict that the south is yet to outstrip the north PREFACES TO LEAVES OF GRASS PREFACE eighteen fifty five To first issue of Leaves of Grass Brooklyn N Y America does not repel the past or what the past has produced under its forms or amid other politics or the idea of castes or the old religions accepts the lesson with calmness is not impatient because the slough still sticks to opinions and manners in literature while the life which served its requirements has passed into the new life of the new forms perceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating and sleeping rooms of the house perceives that it waits a little while in the door that it was fittest for its days that its action has descended to the stalwart and well shaped heir who approaches and that he shall be fittest for his days The Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature The United States themselves are essentially the greatest poem In the history of the earth hitherto the largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler largeness and stir Here at last is something in the doings of man that corresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night Here is action untied from strings necessarily blind to particulars and details magnificently moving in masses Here is the hospitality which for ever indicates heroes Here the performance disdaining the trivial unapproach d in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings and the push of its perspective spreads with crampless and flowing breadth and showers its prolific and splendid extravagance One sees it must indeed own the riches of the summer and winter and need never be bankrupt while corn grows from the ground or the orchards drop apples or the bays contain fish or men beget children upon women Other states indicate themselves in their deputies but the genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges or churches or parlors nor even in its newspapers or inventors but always most in the common people south north west east in all its States through all its mighty amplitude The largeness of the nation however were monstrous without a corresponding largeness and generosity of the spirit of the citizen Not swarming states nor streets and steamships nor prosperous business nor farms nor capital nor learning may suffice for the ideal of man nor suffice the poet No reminiscences may suffice either A live nation can always cut a deep mark and can have the best authority the cheapest namely from its own soul This is the sum of the profitable uses of individuals or states and of present action and grandeur and of the subjects of poets As if it were necessary to trot back generation after generation to the eastern records As if the beauty and sacredness of the demonstrable must fall behind that of the mythical As if men do not make their mark out of any times As if the opening of the western continent by discovery and what has transpired in North and South America were less than the small theatre of the antique or the aimless sleep walking of the middle ages The pride of the United States leaves the wealth and finesse of the cities and all returns of commerce and agriculture and all the magnitude of geography or shows of exterior victory to enjoy the sight and realization of full sized men or one full sized man unconquerable and simple The American poets are to enclose old and new for America is the race of races The expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and new It is to be indirect and not direct or descriptive or epic Its quality goes through these to much more Let the age and wars of other nations be chanted and their eras and characters be illustrated and that finish the verse Not so the great psalm of the republic Here the theme is creative and has vista Whatever stagnates in the flat of custom or obedience or legislation the great poet never stagnates Obedience does not master him he masters it High up out of reach he stands turning a concentrated light he turns the pivot with his finger he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands and easily overtakes and envelopes them The time straying toward infidelity and confections and persiflage he withholds by steady faith Faith is the antiseptic of the soul it pervades the common people and preserves them they never give up believing and expecting and trusting There is that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate person that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive genius The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be just as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist The power to destroy or remould is freely used by the greatest poet but seldom the power of attack What is past is past If he does not expose superior models and prove himself by every step he takes he is not what is wanted The presence of the great poet conquers not parleying or struggling or any prepared attempts Now he has passed that way see after him There is not left any vestige of despair or misanthropy or cunning or exclusiveness or the ignominy of a nativity or color or delusion of hell or the necessity of hell and no man thenceforward shall be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin The greatest poet hardly knows pettiness or triviality If he breathes into anything that was before thought small it dilates with the grandeur and life of the universe He is a seer he is individual he is complete in himself the others are as good as he only he sees it and they do not He is not one of the chorus he does not stop for any regulation he is the president of regulation What the eyesight does to the rest he does to the rest Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight The other senses corroborate themselves but this is removed from any proof but its own and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world A single glance of it mocks all the investigations of man and all the instruments and books of the earth and all reasoning What is marvellous what is unlikely what is impossible or baseless or vague after you have once just open d the space of a peach pit and given audience to far and near and to the sunset and had all things enter with electric swiftness softly and duly without confusion or jostling or jam The land and sea the animals fishes and birds the sky of heaven and the orbs the forests mountains and rivers are not small themes but folks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity which always attach to dumb real objects they expect him to indicate the path between reality and their souls Men and women perceive the beauty well enough probably as well as he The passionate tenacity of hunters woodmen early risers cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields the love of healthy women for the manly form seafaring persons drivers of horses the passion for light and the open air all is an old varied sign of the unfailing perception of beauty and of a residence of the poetic in out door people They can never be assisted by poets to perceive some may but they never can The poetic quality is not marshal d in rhyme or uniformity or abstract addresses to things nor in melancholy complaints or good precepts but is the life of these and much else and is in the soul The profit of rhyme is that it drops seeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme and of uniformity that it conveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight The rhyme and uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws and bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a bush and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges and melons and pears and shed the perfume impalpable to form The fluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or recitations are not independent but dependent All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain If the greatnesses are in conjunction in a man or woman it is enough the fact will prevail through the universe but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will not prevail Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is lost This is what you shall do Love the earth and sun and the animals despise riches give alms to every one that asks stand up for the stupid and crazy devote your income and labor to others hate tyrants argue not concerning God have patience and indulgence toward the people take off your hat to nothing known or unknown or to any man or number of men go freely with powerful uneducated persons and with the young and with the mothers of families re examine all you have been told in school or church or in any book and dismiss whatever insults your own soul and your very flesh shall be a great poem and have the richest fluency not only in its words but in the silent lines of its lips and face and between the lashes of your eyes and in every motion and joint of your body The poet shall not spend his time in unneeded work He shall know that the ground is already plough d and manured others may not know it but he shall He shall go directly to the creation His trust shall master the trust of everything he touches and shall master all attachment The known universe has one complete lover and that is the greatest poet He consumes an eternal passion and is indifferent which chance happens and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune and persuades daily and hourly his delicious pay What balks or breaks others is fuel for his burning progress to contact and amorous joy Other proportions of the reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his proportions All expected from heaven or from the highest he is rapport with in the sight of the daybreak or the scenes of the winter woods or the presence of children playing or with his arm round the neck of a man or woman His love above all love has leisure and expanse he leaves room ahead of himself He is no irresolute or suspicious lover he is sure he scorns intervals His experience and the showers and thrills are not for nothing Nothing can jar him suffering and darkness cannot death and fear cannot To him complaint and jealousy and envy are corpses buried and rotten in the earth he saw them buried The sea is not surer of the shore or the shore of the sea than he is the fruition of his love and of all perfection and beauty The fruition of beauty is no chance of miss or hit it is as inevitable as life it is exact and plumb as gravitation From the eyesight proceeds another eyesight and from the hearing proceeds another hearing and from the voice proceeds another voice eternally curious of the harmony of things with man These understand the law of perfection in masses and floods that it is profuse and impartial that there is not a minute of the light or dark nor an acre of the earth and sea without it nor any direction of the sky nor any trade or employment nor any turn of events This is the reason that about the proper expression of beauty there is precision and balance One part does not need to be thrust above another The best singer is not the one who has the most lithe and powerful organ The pleasure of poems is not in them that take the handsomest measure and sound Without effort and without exposing in the least how it is done the greatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and scenes and persons some more and some less to bear on your individual character as you hear or read To do this well is to compete with the laws that pursue and follow Time What is the purpose must surely be there and the clue of it must be there and the faintest indication is the indication of the best and then becomes the clearest indication Past and present and future are not disjoin d but join d The greatest poet forms the consistence of what is to be from what has been and is He drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their feet He says to the past Rise and walk before me that I may realize you He learns the lesson he places himself where the future becomes present The greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays over character and scenes and passions he finally ascends and finishes all he exhibits the pinnacles that no man can tell what they are for or what is beyond he glows a moment on the extremest verge He is most wonderful in his last half hidden smile or frown by that flash of the moment of parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terrified afterward for many years The greatest poet does not moralize or make applications of morals he knows the soul The soul has that measureless pride which consists in never acknowledging any lessons or deductions but its own But it has sympathy as measureless as its pride and the one balances the other and neither can stretch too far while it stretches in company with the other The inmost secrets of art sleep with the twain The greatest poet has lain close betwixt both and they are vital in his style and thoughts The art of art the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity Nothing is better than simplicity nothing can make up for excess or for the lack of definiteness To carry on the heave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects their articulations are powers neither common nor very uncommon But to speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the movements of animals and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees in the woods and grass by the roadside is the flawless triumph of art If you have look d on him who has achiev d it you have look d on one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times You shall not contemplate the flight of the gray gull over the bay or the mettlesome action of the blood horse or the tall leaning of sunflowers on their stalk or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven or the appearance of the moon afterward with any more satisfaction than you shall contemplate him The great poet has less a mark d style and is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or diminution and is the free channel of himself He swears to his art I will not be meddlesome I will not have in my writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains I will have nothing hang in the way not the richest curtains What I tell I tell for precisely what it is Let who may exalt or startle or fascinate or soothe I will have purposes as health or heat or snow has and be as regardless of observation What I experience or portray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition You shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me The old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved by their unconstraint A heroic person walks at his ease through and out of that custom or precedent or authority that suits him not Of the traits of the brotherhood of first class writers savans musicians inventors and artists nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing from new free forms In the need of poems philosophy politics mechanism science behavior the craft of art an appropriate native grand opera shipcraft or any craft he is greatest for ever and ever who contributes the greatest original practical example The cleanest expression is that which finds no sphere worthy of itself and makes one The messages of great poems to each man and woman are Come to us on equal terms only then can you understand us We are no better than you what we inclose you inclose what we enjoy you may enjoy Did you suppose there could be only one Supreme We affirm there can be unnumber d Supremes and that one does not countervail another any more than one eyesight countervails another and that men can be good or grand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them What do you think is the grandeur of storms and dismemberments and the deadliest battles and wrecks and the wildest fury of the elements and the power of the sea and the motion of Nature and the throes of human desires and dignity and hate and love It is that something in the soul which says Rage on whirl on I tread master here and everywhere Master of the spasms of the sky and of the shatter of the sea Master of nature and passion and death and of all terror and all pain The American bards shall be mark d for generosity and affection and for encouraging competitors They shall be Kosmos without monopoly or secrecy glad to pass anything to any one hungry for equals night and day They shall not be careful of riches and privilege they shall be riches and privilege they shall perceive who the most affluent man is The most affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees by equivalents out of the stronger wealth of himself The American bard shall delineate no class of persons nor one or two out of the strata of interests nor love most nor truth most nor the soul most nor the body most and not be for the Eastern States more than the Western or the Northern States more than the Southern Exact science and its practical movements are no checks on the greatest poet but always his encouragement and support The outset and remembrance are there there the arms that lifted him first and braced him best there he returns after all his goings and comings The sailor and traveler the anatomist chemist astronomer geologist phrenologist spiritualist mathematician historian and lexicographer are not poets but they are the lawgivers of poets and their construction underlies the structure of every perfect poem No matter what rises or is utter d they sent the seed of the conception of it of them and by them stand the visible proofs of souls If there shall be love and content between the father and the son and if the greatness of the son is the exuding of the greatness of the father there shall be love between the poet and the man of demonstrable science In the beauty of poems are henceforth the tuft and final applause of science Great is the faith of the flush of knowledge and of the investigation of the depths of qualities and things Cleaving and circling here swells the soul of the poet yet is president of itself always The depths are fathomless and therefore calm The innocence and nakedness are resumed they are neither modest nor immodest The whole theory of the supernatural and all that was twined with it or educed out of it departs as a dream What has ever happen d what happens and whatever may or shall happen the vital laws inclose all They are sufficient for any case and for all cases none to be hurried or retarded any special miracle of affairs or persons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme where every motion and every spear of grass and the frames and spirits of men and women and all that concerns them are unspeakably perfect miracles all referring to all and each distinct and in its place It is also not consistent with the reality of the soul to admit that there is anything in the known universe more divine than men and women Men and women and the earth and all upon it are to be taken as they are and the investigation of their past and present and future shall be unintermitted and shall be done with perfect candor Upon this basis philosophy speculates ever looking towards the poet ever regarding the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness never inconsistent with what is clear to the senses and to the soul For the eternal tendencies of all toward happiness make the only point of sane philosophy Whatever comprehends less than that whatever is less than the laws of light and of astronomical motion or less than the laws that follow the thief the liar the glutton and the drunkard through this life and doubtless afterward or less than vast stretches of time or the slow formation of density or the patient upheaving of strata is of no account Whatever would put God in a poem or system of philosophy as contending against some being or influence is also of no account Sanity and ensemble characterize the great master spoilt in one principle all is spoilt The great master has nothing to do with miracles He sees health for himself in being one of the mass he sees the hiatus in singular eminence To the perfect shape comes common ground To be under the general law is great for that is to correspond with it The master knows that he is unspeakably great and that all are unspeakably great that nothing for instance is greater than to conceive children and bring them up well that to be is just as great as to perceive or tell In the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is indispensable Liberty takes the adherence of heroes wherever man and woman exist but never takes any adherence or welcome from the rest more than from poets They are the voice and exposition of liberty They out of ages are worthy the grand idea to them it is confided and they must sustain it Nothing has precedence of it and nothing can warp or degrade it As the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real body and in the pleasure of things they possess the superiority of genuineness over all fiction and romance As they emit themselves facts are shower d over with light the daylight is lit with more volatile light the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many fold Each precise object or condition or combination or process exhibits a beauty the multiplication table its old age its the carpenter s trade its the grand opera its the huge hull d clean shap d New York clipper at sea under steam or full sail gleams with unmatch d beauty the American circles and large harmonies of government gleam with theirs and the commonest definite intentions and actions with theirs The poets of the kosmos advance through all interpositions and coverings and turmoils and stratagems to first principles They are of use they dissolve poverty from its need and riches from its conceit You large proprietor they say shall not realize or perceive more than any one else The owner of the library is not he who holds a legal title to it having bought and paid for it Any one and every one is owner of the library indeed he or she alone is owner who can read the same through all the varieties of tongues and subjects and styles and in whom they enter with ease and make supple and powerful and rich and large These American States strong and healthy and accomplish d shall receive no pleasure from violations of natural models and must not permit them In paintings or mouldings or carvings in mineral or wood or in the illustrations of books or newspapers or in the patterns of woven stuffs or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes or to put upon cornices or monuments or on the prows or sterns of ships or to put anywhere before the human eye indoors or out that which distorts honest shapes or which creates unearthly beings or places or contingencies is a nuisance and revolt Of the human form especially it is so great it must never be made ridiculous Of ornaments to a work nothing outre can be allow d but those ornaments can be allow d that conform to the perfect facts of the open air and that flow out of the nature of the work and come irrepressibly from it and are necessary to the completion of the work Most works are most beautiful without ornament Exaggerations will be revenged in human physiology Clean and vigorous children are jetted and conceiv d only in those communities where the models of natural forms are public every day Great genius and the people of these States must never be demean d to romances As soon as histories are properly told no more need of romances The great poets are to be known by the absence in them of tricks and by the justification of perfect personal candor All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor Henceforth let no man of us lie for we have seen that openness wins the inner and outer world and that there is no single exception and that never since our earth gather d itself in a mass have deceit or subterfuge or prevarication attracted its smallest particle or the faintest tinge of a shade and that through the enveloping wealth and rank of a state or the whole republic of states a sneak or sly person shall be discover d and despised and that the soul has never once been fool d and never can be fool d and thrift without the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid puff and there never grew up in any of the continents of the globe nor upon any planet or satellite nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes nor at any time during the changes of life nor in any stretch of abeyance or action of vitality nor in any process of formation or reformation anywhere a being whose instinct hated the truth Extreme caution or prudence the soundest organic health large hope and comparison and fondness for women and children large alimentiveness and destuctiveness and causality with a perfect sense of the oneness of nature and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs are called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of the greatest poet from his birth out of his mother s womb and from her birth out of her mother s Caution seldom goes far enough It has been thought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to solid gains and did well for himself and for his family and completed a lawful life without debt or crime The greatest poet sees and admits these economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep but has higher notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives a few slight attentions at the latch of the gate The premises of the prudence of life are not the hospitality of it or the ripeness and harvest of it Beyond the independence of a little sum laid aside for burial money and of a few clap boards around and shingles overhead on a lot of American soil own d and the easy dollars that supply the year s plain clothing and meals the melancholy prudence of the abandonment of such a great being as a man is to the toss and pallor of years of money making with all their scorching days and icy nights and all their stifling deceits and underhand dodgings or infinitesimals of parlors or shameless stuffing while others starve and all the loss of the bloom and odor of the earth and of the flowers and atmosphere and of the sea and of the true taste of the women and men you pass or have to do with in youth or middle age and the issuing sickness and desperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naivety even if you have achiev d a secure ten thousand a year or election to Congress or the Governorship and the ghastly chatter of a death without serenity or majesty is the great fraud upon modern civilization and forethought blotching the surface and system which civilization undeniably drafts and moistening with tears the immense features it spreads and spreads with such velocity before the reach d kisses of the soul Ever the right explanation remains to be made about prudence The prudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the most esteem d life appears too faint for the eye to observe at all when little and large alike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable for immortality What is the wisdom that fills the thinness of a year or seventy or eighty years to the wisdom spaced out by ages and coming back at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents and the clear faces of wedding guests as far as you can look in every direction running gaily toward you Only the soul is of itself all else has reference to what ensues All that a person does or thinks is of consequence Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be anything else than the profoundest reason whether it brings argument to hand or no No specification is necessary to add or subtract or divide is in vain Little or big learn d or unlearn d white or black legal or illegal sick or well from the first inspiration down the windpipe to the last expiration out of it all that a male or female does that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure profit to him or her in the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever The prudence of the greatest poet answers at last the craving and glut of the soul puts off nothing permits no let up for its own case or any case has no particular sabbath or judgment day divides not the living from the dead or the righteous from the unrighteous is satisfied with the present matches every thought or act by its correlative and knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement The direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to day If he does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic tides if he be not himself the age transfigur d and if to him is not open d the eternity which gives similitude to all periods and locations and processes and animate and inanimate forms and which is the bond of time and rises up from its inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness in the swimming shapes of to day and is held by the ductile anchors of life and makes the present spot the passage from what was to what shall be and commits itself to the representation of this wave of an hour and this one of the sixty beautiful children of the wave let him merge in the general run and wait his development Still the final test of poems or any character or work remains The prescient poet projects himself centuries ahead and judges performer or performance after the changes of time Does it live through them Does it still hold on untired Will the same style and the direction of genius to similar points be satisfactory now Have the marches of tens and hundreds and thousands of years made willing detours to the right hand and the left hand for his sake Is he beloved long and long after he is buried Does the young man think often of him and the young woman think often of him and do the middleaged and the old think of him A great poem is for ages and ages in common and for all degrees and complexions and all departments and sects and for a woman as much as a man and a man as much as a woman A great poem is no finish to a man or woman but rather a beginning Has any one fancied he could sit at last under some due authority and rest satisfied with explanations and realize and be content and full To no such terminus does the greatest poet bring he brings neither cessation nor shelter d fatness and ease The touch of him like Nature tells in action Whom he takes he takes with firm sure grasp into live regions previously unattain d thenceforward is no rest they see the space and ineffable sheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums Now there shall be a man cohered out of tumult and chaos the elder encourages the younger and shows him how they two shall launch off fearlessly together till the new world fits an orbit for itself and looks unabash d on the lesser orbits of the stars and sweeps through the ceaseless rings and shall never be quiet again There will soon be no more priests Their work is done A new order shall arise and they shall be the priests of man and every man shall be his own priest They shall find their inspiration in real objects to day symptoms of the past and future They shall not deign to defend immortality or God or the perfection of things or liberty or the exquisite beauty and reality of the soul They shall arise in America and be responded to from the remainder of the earth The English language befriends the grand American expression it is brawny enough and limber and full enough On the tough stock of a race who through all change of circumstance was never without the idea of political liberty which is the animus of all liberty it has attracted the terms of daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues It is the powerful language of resistance it is the dialect of common sense It is the speech of the proud and melancholy races and of all who aspire It is the chosen tongue to express growth faith self esteem freedom justice equality friendliness amplitude prudence decision and courage It is the medium that shall wellnigh express the inexpressible No great literature nor any like style of behavior or oratory or social intercourse or household arrangements or public institutions or the treatment by bosses of employ d people nor executive detail or detail of the army and navy nor spirit of legislation or courts or police or tuition or architecture or songs or amusements can long elude the jealous and passionate instinct of American standards Whether or no the sign appears from the mouths of the people it throbs a live interrogation in every freeman s and freewoman s heart after that which passes by or this built to remain Is it uniform with my country Are its disposals without ignominious distinctions Is it for the ever growing communes of brothers and lovers large well united proud beyond the old models generous beyond all models Is it something grown fresh out of the fields or drawn from the sea for use to me to day here I know that what answers for me an American in Texas Ohio Canada must answer for any individual or nation that serves for a part of my materials Does this answer Is it for the nursing of the young of the republic Does it solve readily with the sweet milk of the nipples of the breasts of the Mother of Many Children America prepares with Composure and good will for the visitors that have sent word It is not intellect that is to be their warrant and welcome The talented the artist the ingenious the editor the statesman the erudite are not unappreciated they fall in their place and do their work The soul of the nation also does its work It rejects none it permits all Only toward the like of itself will it advance half way An individual is as superb as a nation when he has the qualities which make a superb nation The soul of the largest and wealthiest and proudest nation may well go half way to meet that of its poets PREFACE eighteen seventy two To As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free Now Thou Mother with thy Equal Brood in permanent edition The impetus and ideas urging me for some years past to an utterance or attempt at utterance of New World songs and an epic of Democracy having already had their publish d expression as well as I can expect to give it in Leaves of Grass the present and any future pieces from me are really but the surplusage forming after that volume or the wake eddying behind it I fulfill d in that an imperious conviction and the commands of my nature as total and irresistible as those which make the sea flow or the globe revolve But of this supplementary volume I confess I am not so certain Having from early manhood abandon d the business pursuits and applications usual in my time and country and obediently yielded myself up ever since to the impetus mention d and to the work of expressing those ideas it may be that mere habit has got dominion of me when there is no real need of saying anything further But what is life but an experiment and mortality but an exercise with reference to results beyond And so shall my poems be If incomplete here and superfluous there n importe the earnest trial and persistent exploration shall at least be mine and other success failing shall be success enough I have been more anxious anyhow to suggest the songs of vital endeavor and manly evolution and furnish something for races of outdoor athletes than to make perfect rhymes or reign in the parlors I ventur d from the beginning my own way taking chances and would keep on venturing I will therefore not conceal from any persons known or unknown to me who take an interest in the matter that I have the ambition of devoting yet a few years to poetic composition The mighty present age To absorb and express in poetry anything of it of its world America cities and States the years the events of our Nineteeth century the rapidity of movement the violent contrasts fluctuations of light and shade of hope and fear the entire revolution made by science in the poetic method these great new underlying facts and new ideas rushing and spreading everywhere truly a mighty age As if in some colossal drama acted again like those of old under the open sun the Nations of our time and all the characteristics of Civilization seem hurrying stalking across flitting from wing to wing gathering closing up toward some long prepared most tremendous denouement Not to conclude the infinite scenas of the race s life and toil and happiness and sorrow but haply that the boards be clear d from oldest worst incumbrances accumulations and Man resume the eternal play anew and under happier freer auspices To me the United States are important because in this colossal drama they are unquestionably designated for the leading parts for many a century to come In them history and humanity seem to seek to culminate Our broad areas are even now the busy theatre of plots passions interests and suspended problems compared to which the intrigues of the past of Europe the wars of dynasties the scope of kings and kingdoms and even the development of peoples as hitherto exhibit scales of measurement comparatively narrow and trivial And on these areas of ours as on a stage sooner or later something like an eclairissement of all the past civilization of Europe and Asia is probably to be evolved The leading parts Not to be acted emulated here by us again that role till now foremost in history not to become a conqueror nation or to achieve the glory of mere military or diplomatic or commercial superiority but to become the grand producing land of nobler men and women of copious races cheerful healthy tolerant free to become the most friendly nation the United States indeed the modern composite nation form d from all with room for all welcoming all immigrants accepting the work of our own interior development as the work fitly filling ages and ages to come the leading nation of peace but neither ignorant nor incapable of being the leading nation of war not the man s nation only but the woman s nation a land of splendid mothers daughters sisters wives Our America to day I consider in many respects as but indeed a vast seething mass of materials ampler better worse also than previously known eligible to be used to carry towards its crowning stage and build for good the great ideal nationality of the future the nation of the body and the soul thirty two no limit here to land help opportunities mines products demands supplies et cetera with I think our political organization National State and Municipal permanently establish d as far ahead as we can calculate but so far no social literary religious or esthetic organizations consistent with our politics or becoming to us which organizations can only come in time through great democratic ideas religion through science which now like a new sunrise ascending begins to illuminate all and through our own begotten poets and literatuses The moral of a late well written book on civilization seems to be that the only real foundation walls and bases and also sine qua non afterward of true and full civilization is the eligibility and certainty of boundless products for feeding clothing sheltering everybody perennial fountains of physical and domestic comfort with intercommunication and with civil and ecclesiastical freedom and that then the esthetic and mental business will take care of itself Well the United States have establish d this basis and upon scales of extent variety vitality and continuity rivaling those of Nature and have now to proceed to build an edifice upon it I say this edifice is only to be fitly built by new literatures especially the poetic I say a modern image making creation is indispensable to fuse and express the modern political and scientific creations and then the trinity will be complete When I commenced years ago elaborating the plan of my poems and continued turning over that plan and shifting it in my mind through many years from the age of twenty eight to thirty five experimenting much and writing and abandoning much one deep purpose underlay the others and has underlain it and its execution ever since and that has been the religious purpose Amid many changes and a formulation taking far different shape from what I at first supposed this basic purpose has never been departed from in the composition of my verses Not of course to exhibit itself in the old ways as in writing hymns or psalms with an eye to the church pew or to express conventional pietism or the sickly yearnings of devotees but in new ways and aiming at the widest sub bases and inclusions of humanity and tallying the fresh air of sea and land I will see said I to myself whether there is not for my purposes as poet a religion and a sound religious germenancy in the average human race at least in their modern development in the United States and in the hardy common fiber and native yearnings and elements deeper and larger and affording more profitable returns than all mere sects or churches as boundless joyous and vital as Nature itself a germenancy that has too long been unencouraged unsung almost unknown With science the old theology of the East long in its dotage begins evidently to die and disappear But to my mind science and may be such will prove its principal service as evidently prepares the way for One indescribably grander Time s young but perfect offspring the new theology heir of the West lusty and loving and wondrous beautiful For America and for today just the same as any day the supreme and final science is the science of God what we call science being only its minister as Democracy is or shall be also And a poet of America I said must fill himself with such thoughts and chant his best out of them And as those were the convictions and aims for good or bad of Leaves of Grass they are no less the intention of this volume As there can be in my opinion no sane and complete personality nor any grand and electric nationality without the stock element of religion imbuing all the other elements like heat in chemistry invisible itself but the life of all visible life so there can be no poetry worthy the name without that element behind all The time has certainly come to begin to discharge the idea of religion in the United States from mere ecclesiasticism and from Sundays and churches and church going and assign it to that general position chiefest most indispensable most exhilarating to which the others are to be adjusted inside of all human character and education and affairs The people especially the young men and women of America must begin to learn that religion like poetry is something far far different from what they supposed It is indeed too important to the power and perpetuity of the New World to be consign d any longer to the churches old or new Catholic or Protestant Saint this or Saint that It must be consign d henceforth to democracy en masse and to literature It must enter into the poems of the nation It must make the nation The Four Years War is over and in the peaceful strong exciting fresh occasions of to day and of the future that strange sad war is hurrying even now to be forgotten The camp the drill the lines of sentries the prisons the hospitals ah the hospitals all have passed away all seem now like a dream A new race a young and lusty generation already sweeps in with oceanic currents obliterating the war and all its scars its mounded graves and all its reminiscences of hatred conflict death So let It be obliterated I say the life of the present and the future makes undeniable demands upon us each and all south north east west To help put the United States even if only in imagination hand in hand in one unbroken circle in a chant to rouse them to the unprecedented grandeur of the part they are to play and are even now playing to the thought of their great future and the attitude conform d to it especially their great esthetic moral scientific future of which their vulgar material and political present is but as the preparatory tuning of instruments by an orchestra these as hitherto are still for me among my hopes ambitions Leaves of Grass already publish d is in its intentions the song of a great composite democratic individual male or female And following on and amplifying the same purpose I suppose I have in my mind to run through the chants of this volume if ever completed the thread voice more or less audible of an aggregated inseparable unprecedented vast composite electric democratic nationality Purposing then to still fill out from time to time through years to come the following volume unless prevented I conclude this preface to the first instalment of it pencil d in the open air on my fifty third birth day by wafting to you dear reader whoever you are from amid the fresh scent of the grass the pleasant coolness of the forenoon breeze the lights and shades of tree boughs silently dappling and playing around me and the notes of the cat bird for undertone and accompaniment my true good will and love W W Washington D C May thirty one eighteen seventy two Note thirty two The problems of the achievements of this crowning stage through future first class National Singers Orators Artists and others of creating in literature an imaginative New World the correspondent and counterpart of the current Scientific and Political New Worlds and the perhaps distant but still delightful prospect for our children if not in our own day of delivering America and indeed all Christian lands everywhere from the thin moribund and watery but appallingly extensive nuisance of conventional poetry by putting something really alive and substantial in its place I have undertaken to grapple with and argue in the preceding Democratic Vistas PREFACE eighteen seventy six To the two volume Centennial Edition of Leaves of Grass and Two Rivulets At the eleventh hour under grave illness I gather up the pieces of prose and poetry left over since publishing a while since my first and main volume Leaves or Grass pieces here some new some old nearly all of them sombre as many are making this almost death s book composed in by gone atmospheres of perfect health and preceded by the freshest collection the little Two Rivulets now send them out embodied in the present melange partly as my contribution and outpouring to celebrate in some sort the feature of the time the first centennial of our New World nationality and then as chyle and nutriment to that moral indissoluble union equally representing all and the mother of many coming centennials And e en for flush and proof of our America for reminder just as much or more in moods of towering pride and joy I keep my special chants of death and immortality thirty three to stamp the coloring finish of all present and past For terminus and temperer to all they were originally written and that shall be their office at the last For some reason not explainable or definite to my own mind yet secretly pleasing and satisfactory to it I have not hesitated to embody in and run through the volume two altogether distinct veins or strata politics for one and for the other the pensive thought of immortality Thus too the prose and poetic the dual forms of the present book The volume therefore after its minor episodes probably divides into these two at first sight far diverse veins of topic and treatment Three points in especial have become very dear to me and all through I seek to make them again and again in many forms and repetitions as will be seen one That the true growth characteristics of the democracy of the New World are henceforth to radiate in superior literary artistic and religious expressions far more than in its republican forms universal suffrage and frequent elections though these are unspeakably important two That the vital political mission of the United States is to practically solve and settle the problem of two sets of rights the fusion thorough compatibility and junction of individual State prerogatives with the indispensable necessity of centrality and Oneness the national identity power the sovereign Union relentless permanently comprising all and over all and in that never yielding an inch then threed Do we not amid a general malaria of fogs and vapors our day unmistakably see two pillars of promise with grandest indestructible indications one that the morbid facts of American politics and society everywhere are but passing incidents and flanges of our unbounded impetus of growth weeds annuals of the rank rich soil not central enduring perennial things The other that all the hitherto experience of the States their first century has been but preparation adolescence and that this Union is only now and henceforth i e since the secession war to enter on its full democratic career Of the whole poems and prose not attending at all to chronological order and with original dates and passing allusions in the heat and impression of the hour left shuffled in and undisturb d the chants of Leaves of Grass my former volume yet serve as the indispensable deep soil or basis out of which and out of which only could come the roots and stems more definitely indicated by these later pages While that volume radiates physiology alone the present one though of the like origin in the main more palpably doubtless shows the pathology which was pretty sure to come in time from the other In that former and main volume composed in the flush of my health and strength from the age of thirty to fifty years I dwelt on birth and life clothing my ideas in pictures days transactions of my time to give them positive place identity saturating them with that vehemence of pride and audacity of freedom necessary to loosen the mind of still to be form d America from the accumulated folds the superstitions and all the long tenacious and stifling anti democratic authorities of the Asiatic and European past my enclosing purport being to express above all artificial regulation and aid the eternal bodily composite cumulative natural character of one s self thirty four Estimating the American Union as so far and for some time to come in its yet formative condition I bequeath poems and essays as nutriment and influences to help truly assimilate and harden and especially to furnish something toward what the States most need of all and which seems to me yet quite unsupplied in literature namely to show them or begin to show them themselves distinctively and what they are for For though perhaps the main points of all ages and nations are points of resemblance and even while granting evolution are substantially the same there are some vital things in which this Republic as to its individualities and as a compacted Nation is to specially stand forth and culminate modern humanity And these are the very things it least morally and mentally knows though curiously enough it is at the same time faithfully acting upon them I count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the United States different from though founded on the past that I have always invoked that future and surrounded myself with it before or while singing my songs As ever all tends to followings America too is a prophecy What even of the best and most successful would be justified by itself alone by the present or the material ostent alone Of men or States few realize how much they live in the future That rising like pinnacles gives its main significance to all You and I are doing to day Without it there were little meaning in lands or poems little purport in human lives All ages all Nations and States have been such prophecies But where any former ones with prophecy so broad so clear as our times our lands as those of the West Without being a scientist I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions of the great savants and experimentalists of our time and of the last hundred years and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my verse for purposes beyond Following the modern spirit the real poems of the present ever solidifying and expanding into the future must vocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has invested man and the universe all that is called creation and must henceforth launch humanity into new orbits consonant with that vastness splendor and reality unknown to the old poems like new systems of orbs balanced upon themselves revolving in limitless space more subtle than the stars Poetry so largely hitherto and even at present wedded to children s tales and to mere amorousness upholstery and superficial rhyme will have to accept and while not denying the past nor the themes of the past will be revivified by this tremendous innovation the kosmic spirit which must henceforth in my opinion be the background and underlying impetus more or less visible of all first class songs Only for me at any rate in all my prose and poetry joyfully accepting modern science and loyally following it without the slightest hesitation there remains ever recognized still a higher flight a higher fact the eternal soul of man of all else too the spiritual the religious which it is to be the greatest office of scientism in my opinion and of future poetry also to free from fables crudities and superstitions and launch forth in renew d faith and scope a hundred fold To me the worlds of religiousness of the conception of the divine and of the ideal though mainly latent are just as absolute in humanity and the universe as the world of chemistry or anything in the objective worlds To me The prophet and the bard Shall yet maintain themselves in higher circles yet Shall mediate to the modern to democracy interpret yet to them God and eidolons To me the crown of savantism is to be that it surely opens the way for a more splendid theology and for ampler and diviner songs No year nor even century will settle this There is a phase of the real lurking behind the real which it is all for There is also in the intellect of man in time far in prospective recesses a judgment a last appellate court which will settle it In certain parts in these flights or attempting to depict or suggest them I have not been afraid of the charge of obscurity in either of my two volumes because human thought poetry or melody must leave dim escapes and outlets must possess a certain fluid aerial character akin to space itself obscure to those of little or no imagination but indispensable to the highest purposes Poetic style when address d to the soul is less definite form outline sculpture and becomes vista music half tints and even less than half tints True it may be architecture but again it may be the forest wild wood or the best effect thereof at twilight the waving oaks and cedars in the wind and the impalpable odor Finally as I have lived in fresh lands inchoate and in a revolutionary age future founding I have felt to identify the points of that age these lands in my recitatives altogether in my own way Thus my form has strictly grown from my purports and facts and is the analogy of them Within my time the United States have emerged from nebulous vagueness and suspense to full orbic though varied decision have done the deeds and achiev d the triumphs of half a score of centuries and are henceforth to enter upon their real history the way being now i e since the result of the secession war clear d of death threatening impedimenta and the free areas around and ahead of us assured and certain which were not so before the past century being but preparations trial voyages and experiments of the ship before her starting out upon deep water In estimating my volumes the world s current times and deeds and their spirit must be first profoundly estimated Out of the hundred years just ending seventeen seventy six eighteen seventy six with their genesis of inevitable wilful events and new experiments and introductions and many unprecedented things of war and peace to be realized better perhaps only realized at the remove of a century hence out of that stretch of time and especially out of the immediately preceding twenty five years eighteen fifty seventy five with all their rapid changes innovations and audacious movements and bearing their own inevitable wilful birth marks the experiments of my poems too have found genesis W W Notes thirty three PASSAGE TO INDIA As in some ancient legend play to close the plot and the hero s career there is a farewell gathering on ship s deck and on shore a loosing of hawsers and ties a spreading of sails to the wind a starting out on unknown seas to fetch up no one knows whither to return no more and the curtain falls and there is the end of it so I have reserv d that poem with its cluster to finish and explain much that without them would not be explain d and to take leave and escape for good from all that has preceded them Then probably Passage to India and its cluster are but freer vent and fuller expression to what from the first and so on throughout more or less lurks in my writings underneath every page every line everywhere I am not sure but the last inclosing sublimation of race or poem is what it thinks of death After the rest has been comprehended and said even the grandest after those contributions to mightiest nationality or to sweetest song or to the best personalism male or female have been glean d from the rich and varied themes of tangible life and have been fully accepted and sung and the pervading fact of visible existence with the duty it devolves is rounded and apparently completed it still remains to be really completed by suffusing through the whole and several that other pervading invisible fact so large a part is it not the largest part of life here combining the rest and furnishing for person or State the only permanent and unitary meaning to all even the meanest life consistently with the dignity of the universe in Time As from the eligibility to this thought and the cheerful conquest of this fact flash forth the first distinctive proofs of the soul so to me extending it only a little further the ultimate Democratic purports the ethereal and spiritual ones are to concentrate here and as fixed stars radiate hence For in my opinion it is no less than this idea of immortality above all other ideas that is to enter into and vivify and give crowning religious stamp to democracy in the New World It was originally my intention after chanting in Leaves of Grass the songs of the body and existence to then compose a further equally needed volume based on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation which enveloping all precedents make the unseen soul govern absolutely at last I meant while in a sort continuing the theme of my first chants to shift the slides and exhibit the problem and paradox of the same ardent and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of the resistless gravitation of spiritual law and with cheerful face estimating death not at all as the cessation but as somehow what I feel it must be the entrance upon by far the greatest part of existence and something that life is at least as much for as it is for itself But the full construction of such a work is beyond my powers and must remain for some bard in the future The physical and the sensuous in themselves or in their immediate continuations retain holds upon me which I think are never entirely releas d and those holds I have not only not denied but hardly wish d to weaken Meanwhile not entirely to give the go by to my original plan and far more to avoid a mark d hiatus in it than to entirely fulfil it I end my books with thoughts or radiations from thoughts on death immortality and a free entrance into the spiritual world In those thoughts in a sort I make the first steps or studies toward the mighty theme from the point of view necessitated by my foregoing poems and by modern science In them I also seek to set the key stone to my democracy s enduring arch I recollate them now for the press in order to partially occupy and offset days of strange sickness and the heaviest affliction and bereavement of my life and I fondly please myself with the notion of leaving that cluster to you O unknown reader of the future as something to remember me by more especially than all else Written in former days of perfect health little did I think the pieces had the purport that now under present circumstances opens to me As I write these lines May thirty one eighteen seventy five it is again early summer again my birth day now my fifty sixth Amid the outside beauty and freshness the sunlight and verdure of the delightful season O how different the moral atmosphere amid which I now revise this Volume from the jocund influence surrounding the growth and advent of Leaves of Grass I occupy myself arranging these pages for publication still envelopt in thoughts of the death two years since of my dear Mother the most perfect and magnetic character the rarest combination of practical moral and spiritual and the least selfish of all and any I have ever known and by me O so much the most deeply loved and also under the physical affliction of a tedious attack of paralysis obstinately lingering and keeping its hold upon me and quite suspending all bodily activity and comfort Under these influences therefore I still feel to keep Passage to India for last words even to this centennial dithyramb Not as in antiquity at highest festival of Egypt the noisome skeleton of death was sent on exhibition to the revelers for zest and shadow to the occasion s joy and light but as the marble statue of the normal Greeks at Elis suggesting death in the form of a beautiful and perfect young man with closed eyes leaning on an inverted torch emblem of rest and aspiration after action of crown and point which all lives and poems should steadily have reference to namely the justified and noble termination of our identity this grade of it and outlet preparation to another grade thirty four Namely a character making most of common and normal elements to the superstructure of which not only the precious accumulations of the learning and experiences of the Old World and the settled social and municipal necessities and current requirements so long a building shall still faithfully contribute but which at its foundations and carried up thence and receiving its impetus from the democratic spirit and accepting its gauge in all departments from the democratic formulas shall again directly be vitalized by the perennial influences of Nature at first hand and the old heroic stamina of Nature the strong air of prairie and mountain the dash of the briny sea the primary antiseptics of the passions in all their fullest heat and potency of courage rankness amativeness and of immense pride Not to lose at all therefore the benefits of artificial progress and civilization but to re occupy for Western tenancy the oldest though ever fresh fields and reap from them the savage and sane nourishment indispensable to a hardy nation and the absence of which threatening to become worse and worse is the most serious lack and defect to day of our New World literature Not but what the brawn of Leaves of Grass is I hope thoroughly spiritualized everywhere for final estimate but from the very subjects the direct effect is a sense of the life as it should be of flesh and blood and physical urge and animalism While there are other themes and plenty of abstract thoughts and poems in the volume while I have put in it passing and rapid but actual glimpses of the great struggle between the nation and the slave power eighteen sixty one sixty five as the fierce and bloody panorama of that contest unroll d itself while the whole book indeed revolves around that four years war which as I was in the midst of it becomes in Drum Taps pivotal to the rest entire and here and there before and afterward not a few episodes and speculations that namely to make a type portrait for living active worldly healthy personality objective as well as subjective joyful and potent and modern and free distinctively for the use of the United States male and female through the long future has been I say my general object Probably indeed the whole of these varied songs and all my writings both volumes only ring changes in some sort on the ejaculation How vast how eligible how joyful how real is a human being himself or herself Though from no definite plan at the time I see now that I have unconsciously sought by indirections at least as much as directions to express the whirls and rapid growth and intensity of the United States the prevailing tendency and events of the Nineteenth century and largely the spirit of the whole current world my time for I feel that I have partaken of that spirit as I have been deeply interested in all those events the closing of long stretch d eras and ages and illustrated in the history of the United States the opening of larger ones The death of President Lincoln for instance fitly historically closes in the civilization of feudalism many old influences drops on them suddenly a vast gloomy as it were separating curtain Since I have been ill eighteen seventy three seventy four seventy five mostly without serious pain and with plenty of time and frequent inclination to judge my poems never composed with eye on the book market nor for fame nor for any pecuniary profit I have felt temporary depression more than once for fear that in Leaves of Grass the moral parts were not sufficiently pronounced But in my clearest and calmest moods I have realized that as those Leaves all and several surely prepare the way for and necessitate morals and are adjusted to them just the same as Nature does and is they are what consistently with my plan they must and probably should be In a certain sense while the Moral is the purport and last intelligence of all Nature there is absolutely nothing of the moral in the works or laws or shows of Nature Those only lead inevitably to it begin and necessitate it Then I meant Leaves of Grass as publish d to be the Poem of average Identity of yours whoever you are now reading these lines A man is not greatest as victor in war nor inventor or explorer nor even in science or in his intellectual or artistic capacity or exemplar in some vast benevolence To the highest democratic view man is most acceptable in living well the practical life and lot which happens to him as ordinary farmer sea farer mechanic clerk laborer or driver upon and from which position as a central basis or pedestal while performing its labors and his duties as citizen son husband father and employ d person he preserves his physique ascends developing radiating himself in other regions and especially where and when greatest of all and nobler than the proudest mere genius or magnate in any field he fully realizes the conscience the spiritual the divine faculty cultivated well exemplified in all his deeds and words through life uncompromising to the end a flight loftier than any of Homer s or Shakspere s broader than all poems and bibles namely Nature s own and in the midst of it Yourself your own Identity body and soul All serves helps but in the centre of all absorbing all giving for your purpose the only meaning and vitality to all master or mistress of all under the law stands Yourself To sing the Song of that law of average Identity and of Yourself consistently with the divine law of the universal is a main intention of those Leaves Something more may be added for while I am about it I would make a full confession I also sent out Leaves of Grass to arouse and set flowing in men s and women s hearts young and old endless streams of living pulsating love and friendship directly from them to myself now and ever To this terrible irrepressible yearning surely more or less down underneath in most human souls this never satisfied appetite for sympathy and this boundless offering of sympathy this universal democratic comradeship this old eternal yet ever new interchange of adhesiveness so fitly emblematic of America I have given in that book undisguisedly declaredly the openest expression Besides important as they are in my purpose as emotional expressions for humanity the special meaning of the Calamus cluster of Leaves of Grass and more or less running through the book and cropping out in Drum Taps mainly resides in its political significance In my opinion it is by a fervent accepted development of comradeship the beautiful and sane affection of man for man latent in all the young fellows north and south east and west it is by this I say and by what goes directly and indirectly along with it that the United States of the future I cannot too often repeat are to be most effectually welded together intercalated anneal d into a living union Then for enclosing clue of all it is imperatively and ever to be borne in mind that Leaves of Grass entire is not to be construed as an intellectual or scholastic effort or poem mainly but more as a radical utterance out of the Emotions and the Physique an utterance adjusted to perhaps born of Democracy and the Modern in its very nature regardless of the old conventions and under the great laws following only its own impulses POETRY TO DAY IN AMERICA SHAKSPERE THE FUTURE Strange as it may seem the topmost proof of a race is its own born poetry The presence of that or the absence each tells its story As the flowering rose or lily as the ripened fruit to a tree the apple or the peach no matter how fine the trunk or copious or rich the branches and foliage here waits sine qua non at last The stamp of entire and finished greatness to any nation to the American Republic among the rest must be sternly withheld till it has put what it stands for in the blossom of original first class poems No imitations will do And though no esthetik worthy the present condition or future certainties of the New World seems to have been outlined in men s minds or has been generally called for or thought needed I am clear that until the United States have just such definite and native expressers in the highest artistic fields their mere political geographical wealth forming and even intellectual eminence however astonishing and predominant will constitute but a more and more expanded and well appointed body and perhaps brain with little or no soul Sugar coat the grim truth as we may and ward off with outward plausible words denials explanations to the mental inward perception of the land this blank is plain a barren void exists For the meanings and maturer purposes of these States are not the constructing of a new world of politics merely and physical comforts for the million but even more determinedly in range with science and the modern of a new world of democratic sociology and imaginative literature If the latter were not establish d for the States to form their only permanent tie and hold the first named would be of little avail With the poems of a first class land are twined as weft with warp its types of personal character of individuality peculiar native its own physiognomy man s and woman s its own shapes forms and manners fully justified under the eternal laws of all forms all manners all times The hour has come for democracy in America to inaugurate itself in the two directions specified autochthonic poems and personalities born expressers of itself its spirit alone to radiate in subtle ways not only in art but the practical and familiar in the transactions between employers and employed persons in business and wages and sternly in the army and navy and revolutionizing them I find nowhere a scope profound enough and radical and objective enough either for aggregates or individuals The thought and identity of a poetry in America to fill and worthily fill the great void and enhance these aims electrifying all and several involves the essence and integral facts real and spiritual of the whole land the whole body What the great sympathetic is to the congeries of bones joints heart fluids nervous system and vitality constituting launching forth in time and space a human being aye an immortal soul such relation and no less holds true poetry to the single personality or to the nation Here our thirty eight States stand to day the children of past precedents and young as they are heirs of a very old estate One or two points we will consider out of the myriads presenting themselves The feudalism of the British Islands illustrated by Shakspere and by his legitimate followers Walter Scott and Alfred Tennyson with all its tyrannies superstitions evils had most superb and heroic permeating veins poems manners even its errors fascinating It almost seems as if only that feudalism in Europe like slavery in our own South could outcrop types of tallest noblest personal character yet strength and devotion and love better than elsewhere invincible courage generosity aspiration the spines of all Here is where Shakspere and the others I have named perform a service incalculably precious to our America Politics literature and everything else centers at last in perfect personnel as democracy is to find the same as the rest and here feudalism is unrival d here the rich and highest rising lessons it bequeaths us a mass of foreign nutriment which we are to work over and popularize and enlarge and present again in our own growths Still there are pretty grave and anxious drawbacks jeopardies fears Let us give some reflections on the subject a little fluctuating but starting from one central thought and returning there again Two or three curious results may plow up As in the astronomical laws the very power that would seem most deadly and destructive turns out to be latently conservative of longest vastest future births and lives We will for once briefly examine the just named authors solely from a Western point of view It may be indeed that we shall use the sun of English literature and the brightest current stars of his system mainly as pegs to hang some cogitations on for home inspection As depicter and dramatist of the passions at their stormiest outstretch though ranking high Shakspere spanning the arch wide enough is equaled by several and excelled by the best old Greeks as Eschylus But in portraying mediaeval European lords and barons the arrogant port so dear to the inmost human heart pride pride dearest perhaps of all touching us too of the States closest of all closer than love he stands alone and I do not wonder he so witches the world From first to last also Walter Scott and Tennyson like Shakspere exhale that principle of caste which we Americans have come on earth to destroy Jefferson s verdict on the Waverley novels was that they turned and condensed brilliant but entirely false lights and glamours over the lords ladies and aristocratic institutes of Europe with all their measureless infamies and then left the bulk of the suffering down trodden people contemptuously in the shade Without stopping to answer this hornet stinging criticism or to repay any part of the debt of thanks I owe in common with every American to the noblest healthiest cheeriest romancer that ever lived I pass on to Tennyson his works Poetry here of a very high perhaps the highest order of verbal melody exquisitely clean and pure and almost always perfumed like the tuberose to an extreme of sweetness sometimes not however but even then a camellia of the hot house never a common flower the verse of inside elegance and high life and yet preserving amid all its super delicatesse a smack of outdoors and outdoor folk The old Norman lordhood quality here too crossed with that Saxon fiber from which twain the best current stock of England springs poetry that revels above all things in traditions of knights and chivalry and deeds of derring do The odor of English social life in its highest range a melancholy affectionate very manly but dainty breed pervading the pages like an invisible scent the idleness the traditions the mannerisms the stately ennui the yearning of love like a spinal marrow inside of all the costumes brocade and satin the old houses and furniture solid oak no mere veneering the moldy secrets everywhere the verdure the ivy on the walls the moat the English landscape outside the buzzing fly in the sun inside the window pane Never one democratic page nay not a line not a word never free and naive poetry but involved labored quite sophisticated even when the theme is ever so simple or rustic a shell a bit of sedge the commonest love passage between a lad and lass the handling of the rhyme all showing the scholar and conventional gentleman showing the laureate too the attache of the throne and most excellent too nothing better through the volumes than the dedication to the Queen at the beginning and the other fine dedication these to his memory Prince Albert s preceding Idylls of the King Such for an off hand summary of the mighty three that now by the women men and young folk of the fifty millions given these States by their late census have been and are more read than all others put together We hear it said both of Tennyson and another current leading literary illustrator of Great Britain Carlyle as of Victor Hugo in France that not one of them is personally friendly or admirant toward America indeed quite the reverse N importe That they and more good minds than theirs cannot span the vast revolutionary arch thrown by the United States over the centuries fixed in the present launched to the endless future that they cannot stomach the high life below stairs coloring all our poetic and genteel social status so far the measureless viciousness of the great radical Republic with its ruffianly nominations and elections its loud ill pitched voice utterly regardless whether the verb agrees with the nominative its fights errors eructations repulsions dishonesties audacities those fearful and varied and long continued storm and stress stages so offensive to the well regulated college bred mind wherewith Nature history and time block out nationalities more powerful than the past and to upturn it and press on to the future that they cannot understand and fathom all this I say is it to be wondered at Fortunately the gestation of our thirty eight empires and plenty more to come proceeds on its course on scales of area and velocity immense and absolute as the globe and like the globe itself quite oblivious even of great poets and thinkers But we can by no means afford to be oblivious of them The same of feudalism its castles courts etiquettes personalities However they or the spirits of them hovering in the air might scowl and glower at such removes as current Kansas or Kentucky life and forms the latter may by no means repudiate or leave out the former Allowing all the evil that it did we get here and today a balance of good out of its reminiscence almost beyond price Am I content then that the general interior chyle of our republic should be supplied and nourish d by wholesale from foreign and antagonistic sources such as these Let me answer that question briefly Years ago I thought Americans ought to strike out separate and have expressions of their own in highest literature I think so still and more decidedly than ever But those convictions are now strongly temper d by some additional points perhaps the results of advancing age or the reflection of invalidism I see that this world of the West as part of all fuses inseparably with the East and with all as time does the ever new yet old old human race the same subject continued as the novels of our grandfathers had it for chapter heads If we are not to hospitably receive and complete the inaugurations of the old civilizations and change their small scale to the largest broadest scale what on earth are we for The currents of practical business in America the rude coarse tussling facts of our lives and all their daily experiences need just the precipitation and tincture of this entirely different fancy world of lulling contrasting even feudalistic anti republican poetry and romance On the enormous outgrowth of our unloos d individualities and the rank self assertion of humanity here may well fall these grace persuading recherche influences We first require that individuals and communities shall be free then surely comes a time when it is requisite that they shall not be too free Although to such results in the future I look mainly for a great poetry native to us these importations till then will have to be accepted such as they are and thankful they are no worse The inmost spiritual currents of the present time curiously revenge and check their own compell d tendency to democracy and absorption in it by mark d leanings to the past by reminiscences in poems plots operas novels to a far off contrary deceased world as if they dreaded the great vulgar gulf tides of to day Then what has been fifty centuries growing working in and accepted as crowns and apices for our kind is not going to be pulled down and discarded in a hurry It is perhaps time we paid our respects directly to the honorable party the real object of these preambles But we must make reconnaissance a little further still Not the least part of our lesson were to realize the curiosity and interest of friendly foreign experts thirty five and how our situation looks to them American poetry says the London Times thirty six is the poetry of apt pupils but it is afflicted from first to last with a fatal want of raciness Bryant has been long passed as a poet by Professor Longfellow but in Longfellow with all his scholarly grace and tender feeling the defect is more apparent than it was in Bryant mister Lowell can overflow with American humor when politics inspire his muse but in the realm of pure poetry he is no more American than a Newdigate prize man Joaquin Miller s verse has fluency and movement and harmony but as for the thought his songs of the sierras might as well have been written in Holland Unless in a certain very slight contingency the Times says American verse from its earliest to its latest stages seems an exotic with an exuberance of gorgeous blossom but no principle of reproduction That is the very note and test of its inherent want Great poets are tortured and massacred by having their flowers of fancy gathered and gummed down in the hortus siccus of an anthology American poets show better in an anthology than in the collected volumes of their works Like their audience they have been unable to resist the attraction of the vast orbit of English literature They may talk of the primeval forest but it would generally be very hard from internal evidence to detect that they were writing on the banks of the Hudson rather than on those of the Thames In fact they have caught the English tone and air and mood only too faithfully and are accepted by the superficially cultivated English intelligence as readily as if they were English born Americans themselves confess to a certain disappointment that a literary curiosity and intelligence so diffused as in the United States have not taken up English literature at the point at which America has received it and carried it forward and developed it with an independent energy But like reader like poet Both show the effects of having come into an estate they have not earned A nation of readers has required of its poets a diction and symmetry of form equal to that of an old literature like that of Great Britain which is also theirs No ruggedness however racy would be tolerated by circles which however superficial their culture read Byron and Tennyson The English critic though a gentleman and a scholar and friendly withal is evidently not altogether satisfied perhaps he is jealous and winds up by saying For the English language to have been enriched with a national poetry which was not English but American would have been a treasure beyond price With which as whet and foil we shall proceed to ventilate more definitely certain no doubt willful opinions Leaving unnoticed at present the great masterpieces of the antique or anything from the middle ages the prevailing flow of poetry for the last fifty or eighty years and now at its height has been and is like the music an expression of mere surface melody within narrow limits and yet to give it its due perfectly satisfying to the demands of the ear of wondrous charm of smooth and easy delivery and the triumph of technical art Above all things it is fractional and select It shrinks with aversion from the sturdy the universal and the democratic The poetry of the future a phrase open to sharp criticism and not satisfactory to me but significant and I will use it the poetry of the future aims at the free expression of emotion which means far far more than appears at first and to arouse and initiate more than to define or finish Like all modern tendencies it has direct or indirect reference continually to the reader to you or me to the central identity of everything the mighty Ego Byron s was a vehement dash with plenty of impatient democracy but lurid and introverted amid all its magnetism not at all the fitting lasting song of a grand secure free sunny race It is more akin likewise to outside life and landscape returning mainly to the antique feeling real sun and gale and woods and shores to the elements themselves not sitting at ease in parlor or library listening to a good tale of them told in good rhyme Character a feature far above style or polish a feature not absent at any time but now first brought to the fore gives predominant stamp to advancing poetry Its born sister music already responds to the same influences The music of the present Wagner s Gounod s even the later Verdi s all tends toward this free expression of poetic emotion and demands a vocalism totally unlike that required for Rossini s splendid roulades or Bellini s suave melodies Is there not even now indeed an evolution a departure from the masters Venerable and unsurpassable after their kind as are the old works and always unspeakably precious as studies for Americans more than any other people is it too much to say that by the shifted combinations of the modern mind the whole underlying theory of first class verse has changed Formerly during the period term d classic says Sainte Beuve when literature was govern d by recognized rules he was considered the best poet who had composed the most perfect work the most beautiful poem the most intelligible the most agreeable to read the most complete in every respect the Aeneid the Gerusalemme a fine tragedy To day something else is wanted For us the greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader s imagination and reflection who excites him the most himself to poetize The greatest poet is not he who has done the best it is he who suggests the most he not all of whose meaning is at first obvious and who leaves you much to desire to explain to study much to complete in your turn The fatal defects our American singers labor under are subordination of spirit an absence of the concrete and of real patriotism and in excess that modern esthetic contagion a queer friend of mine calls the beauty disease The immoderate taste for beauty and art says Charles Baudelaire leads men into monstrous excesses In minds imbued with a frantic greed for the beautiful all the balances of truth and justice disappear There is a lust a disease of the art faculties which eats up the moral like a cancer Of course by our plentiful verse writers there is plenty of service perform d of a kind Nor need we go far for a tally We see in every polite circle a class of accomplished good natured persons society in fact could not get on without them fully eligible for certain problems times and duties to mix egg nog to mend the broken spectacles to decide whether the stewed eels shall precede the sherry or the sherry the stewed eels to eke out missus A B s parlor tableaux with monk Jew lover Puck Prospero Caliban or what not and to generally contribute and gracefully adapt their flexibilities and talents in those ranges to the world s service But for real crises great needs and pulls moral or physical they might as well have never been born Or the accepted notion of a poet would appear to be a sort of male odalisque singing or piano playing a kind of spiced ideas second hand reminiscences or toying late hours at entertainments in rooms stifling with fashionable scent I think I haven t seen a new published healthy bracing simple lyric in ten years Not long ago there were verses in each of three fresh monthlies from leading authors and in every one the whole central motif perfectly serious was the melancholiness of a marriageable young woman who didn t get a rich husband but a poor one Besides its tonic and al fresco physiology relieving such as this the poetry of the future will take on character in a more important respect Science having extirpated the old stock fables and superstitions is clearing a field for verse for all the arts and even for romance a hundred fold ampler and more wonderful with the new principles behind Republicanism advances over the whole world Liberty with Law by her side will one day be paramount will at any rate be the central idea Then only for all the splendor and beauty of what has been or the polish of what is then only will the true poets appear and the true poems Not the satin and patchouly of today not the glorification of the butcheries and wars of the past nor any fight between Deity on one side and somebody else on the other not Milton not even Shakspere s plays grand as they are Entirely different and hitherto unknown Classes of men being authoritatively called for in imaginative literature will certainly appear What is hitherto most lacking perhaps most absolutely indicates the future Democracy has been hurried on through time by measureless tides and winds resistless as the revolution of the globe and as far reaching and rapid But in the highest walks of art it has not yet had a single representative worthy of it anywhere upon the earth Never had real bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than to sing worthily the songs these States have already indicated Their origin Washington seventy six the picturesqueness of old times the war of eighteen twelve and the sea fights the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth of area to fuse and compact the South and North the East and West to express the native forms situations scenes from Montauk to California and from the Saguenay to the Rio Grande the working out on such gigantic scales and with such a swift and mighty play of changing light and shade of the great problems of man and freedom how far ahead of the stereotyped plots or gem cutting or tales of love or wars of mere ambition Our history is so full of spinal modern germinal subjects one above all What the ancient siege of Illium and the puissance of Hector s and Agamemnon s warriors proved to Hellenic art and literature and all art and literature since may prove the war of attempted secession of eighteen sixty one sixty five to the future esthetics drama romance poems of the United States Nor could utility itself provide anything more practically serviceable to the hundred millions who a couple of generations hence will inhabit within the limits just named than the permeation of a sane sweet autochthonous national poetry must I say of a kind that does not now exist but which I fully believe will in time be supplied on scales as free as Nature s elements It is acknowledged that we of the States are the most materialistic and money making people ever known My own theory while fully accepting this is that we are the most emotional spiritualistic and poetry loving people also Infinite are the new and orbic traits waiting to be launch d forth in the firmament that is and is to be America Lately I have wonder d whether the last meaning of this cluster of thirty eight States is not only practical fraternity among themselves the only real union much nearer its accomplishment too than appears on the surface but for fraternity over the whole globe that dazzling pensive dream of ages Indeed the peculiar glory of our lands I have come to see or expect to see not in their geographical or republican greatness nor wealth or products nor military or naval power nor special eminent names in any department to shine with or outshine foreign special names in similar departments but more and more in a vaster saner more surrounding Comradeship uniting closer and closer not only the American States but all nations and all humanity That O poets is not that a theme worth chanting striving for Why not fix your verses henceforth to the gauge of the round globe the whole race Perhaps the most illustrious culmination of the modern may thus prove to be a signal growth of joyous more exalted bards of adhesiveness identically one in soul but contributed by every nation each after its distinctive kind Let us audacious start it Let the diplomats as ever still deeply plan seeking advantages proposing treaties between governments and to bind them on paper what I seek is different simpler I would inaugurate from America for this purpose new formulas international poems I have thought that the invisible root out of which the poetry deepest in and dearest to humanity grows is Friendship I have thought that both in patriotism and song even amid their grandest shows past we have adhered too long to petty limits and that the time has come to enfold the world Not only is the human and artificial world we have establish d in the West a radical departure from anything hitherto known not only men and politics and all that goes with them but Nature itself in the main sense its construction is different The same old font of type of course but set up to a text never composed or issued before For Nature consists not only in itself objectively but at least just as much in its subjective reflection from the person spirit age looking at it in the midst of it and absorbing it faithfully sends back the characteristic beliefs of the time or individual takes and readily gives again the physiognomy of any nation or literature falls like a great elastic veil on a face or like the molding plaster on a statue What is Nature What were the elements the invisible backgrounds and eidolons of it to Homer s heroes voyagers gods What all through the wanderings of Virgil s Aeneas Then to Shakspere s characters Hamlet Lear the English Norman kings the Romans What was Nature to Rousseau to Voltaire to the German Goethe in his little classical court gardens In those presentments in Tennyson see the Idylls of the King what sumptuous perfumed arras and gold Nature inimitably described better than any fit for princes and knights and peerless ladies wrathful or peaceful just the same Vivien and Merlin in their strange dalliance or the death float of Elaine or Geraint and the long journey of his disgraced Enid and himself through the wood and the wife all day driving the horses as in all the great imported art works treatises systems from Lucretius down there is a constantly lurking often pervading something that will have to be eliminated as not only unsuited to modern democracy and science in America but insulting to them and disproved by them thirty seven Still the rule and demesne of poetry will always be not the exterior but interior not the macrocosm but microcosm not Nature but Man I haven t said anything about the imperative need of a race of giant bards in the future to hold up high to eyes of land and race the eternal antiseptic models and to dauntlessly confront greed injustice and all forms of that wiliness and tyranny whose roots never die my opinion is that after all the rest is advanced that is what first class poets are for as to their days and occasions the Hebrew lyrists Roman Juvenal and doubtless the old singers of India and the British Druids to counteract dangers immensest ones already looming in America measureless corruption in politics what we call religion a mere mask of wax or lace for ensemble that most cankerous offensive of all earth s shows a vast and varied community prosperous and fat with wealth of money and products and business ventures plenty of mere intellectuality too and then utterly without the sound prevailing moral and esthetic health action beyond all the money and mere intellect of the world Is it a dream of mine that in times to come west south east north will silently surely arise a race of such poets varied yet one in soul nor only poets and of the best but newer larger prophets larger than Judea s and more passionate to meet and penetrate those woes as shafts of light the darkness As I write the last fifth of the nineteenth century is enter d upon and will soon be waning Now and for a long time to come what the United States most need to give purport definiteness reason why to their unprecedented material wealth industrial products education by rote merely great populousness and intellectual activity is the central spinal reality or even the idea of it of such a democratic band of native born and bred teachers artists litterateurs tolerant and receptive of importations but entirely adjusted to the West to ourselves to our own days combinations differences superiorities Indeed I am fond of thinking that the whole series of concrete and political triumphs of the Republic are mainly as bases and preparations for half a dozen future poets ideal personalities referring not to a special class but to the entire people four or five millions of square miles Long long are the processes of the development of a nationality Only to the rapt vision does the seen become the prophecy of the unseen thirty eight Democracy so far attending only to the real is not for the real only but the grandest ideal to justify the modern by that and not only to equal but to become by that superior to the past On a comprehensive summing up of the processes and present and hitherto condition of the United States with reference to their future and the indispensable precedents to it my point below all surfaces and subsoiling them is that the bases and prerequisites of a leading nationality are first at all hazards freedom worldly wealth and products on the largest and most varied scale common education and intercommunication and in general the passing through of just the stages and crudities we have passed or are passing through in the United States Then perhaps as weightiest factor of the whole business and of the main outgrowths of the future it remains to be definitely avow d that the native born middle class population of quite all the United States the average of farmers and mechanics everywhere the real though latent and silent bulk of America city or country presents a magnificent mass of material never before equal d on earth It is this material quite unexpress d by literature or art that in every respect insures the future of the republic During the secession war I was with the armies and saw the rank and file north and south and studied them for four years I have never had the least doubt about the country in its essential future since Meantime we can perhaps do no better than to saturate ourselves with and continue to give imitations yet awhile of the esthetic models supplies of that past and of those lands we spring from Those wondrous stores reminiscences floods currents Let them flow on flow hither freely And let the sources be enlarged to include not only the works of British origin as now but stately and devout Spain courteous France profound Germany the manly Scandinavian lands Italy s art race and always the mystic Orient Remembering that at present and doubtless long ahead a certain humility would well become us The course through time of highest civilization does it not wait the first glimpse of our contribution to its kosmic train of poems bibles first class structures perpetuities Egypt and Palestine and India Greece and Rome and mediaeval Europe and so onward The shadowy procession is not a meagre one and the standard not a low one All that is mighty in our kind seems to have already trod the road Ah never may America forget her thanks and reverence for samples treasures such as these that other life blood inspiration sunshine hourly in use to day all days forever through her broad demesne All serves our New World progress even the bafflers head winds cross tides Through many perturbations and squalls and much backing and filling the ship upon the whole makes unmistakably for her destination Shakspere has served and serves may be the best of any For conclusion a passing thought a contrast of him who in my opinion continues and stands for the Shaksperean cultus at the present day among all English writing peoples of Tennyson his poetry I find it impossible as I taste the sweetness of those lines to escape the flavor the conviction the lush ripening culmination and last honey of decay I dare not call it rottenness of that feudalism which the mighty English dramatist painted in all the splendors of its noon and afternoon And how they are chanted both poets Happy those kings and nobles to be so sung so told To run their course to get their deeds and shapes in lasting pigments the very pomp and dazzle of the sunset Meanwhile democracy waits the coming of its bards in silence and in twilight but tis the twilight of the dawn Notes thirty five A few years ago I saw the question Has America produced any great poem announced as prize subject for the competition of some university in Northern Europe I saw the item in a foreign paper and made a note of it but being taken down with paralysis and prostrated for a long season the matter slipp d away and I have never been able since to get hold of any essay presented for the prize or report of the discussion nor to learn for certain whether there was any essay or discussion nor can I now remember the place It may have been Upsala or possibly Heidelberg Perhaps some German or Scandinavian can give particulars I think it was in eighteen seventy two thirty six In a long and prominent editorial at the time on the death of William Cullen Bryant thirty seven Whatever may be said of the few principal poems or their best passages it is certain that the overwhelming mass of poetic works as now absorb d into human character exerts a certain constipating repressing indoor and artificial influence impossible to elude seldom or never that freeing dilating joyous one with which uncramp d Nature works on every individual without exception thirty eight Is there not such a thing as the philosophy of American history and politics And if so what is it Wise men say there are two sets of wills to nations and to persons one set that acts and works from explainable motives from teaching intelligence judgment circumstance caprice emulation greed et cetera and then another set perhaps deep hidden unsuspected yet often more potent than the first refusing to be argued with rising as it were out of abysses resistlessly urging on speakers doers communities unwitting to themselves the poet to his fieriest words the race to pursue its loftiest ideal Indeed the paradox of a nation s life and career with all its wondrous contradictions can probably only be explain d from these two wills sometimes conflicting each operating in its sphere combining in races or in persons and producing strangest results Let us hope there is indeed can there be any doubt there is this great unconscious and abysmic second will also running through the average nationality and career of America Let us hope that amid all the dangers and defections of the present and through all the processes of the conscious will it alone is the permanent and sovereign force destined to carry on the New World to fulfil its destinies in the future to resolutely pursue those destinies age upon age to build far far beyond its past vision present thought to form and fashion and for the general type men and women more noble more athletic than the world has yet seen to gradually firmly blend from all the States with all varieties a friendly happy free religious nationality a nationality not only the richest most inventive most productive and materialistic the world has yet known but compacted indissolubly and out of whose ample and solid bulk and giving purpose and finish to it conscience morals and all the spiritual attributes shall surely rise like spires above some group of edifices firm footed on the earth yet scaling space and heaven Great as they are and greater far to be the United States too are but a series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought And here is to my mind their final justification and certain perpetuity There is in that sublime process in the laws of the universe and above all in the moral law something that would make unsatisfactory and even vain and contemptible all the triumphs of war the gains of peace and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the nations that have ever existed or that ours included now exist except that we constantly see through all their worldly career however struggling and blind and lame attempts by all ages all peoples according to their development to reach to press to progress on and ever farther on to more and more advanced ideals The glory of the republic of the United States in my opinion is to be that emerging in the light of the modern and the splendor of science and solidly based on the past it is to cheerfully range itself and its politics are henceforth to come under those universal laws and embody them and carry them out to serve them And as only that individual becomes truly great who understands well that while complete in himself in a certain sense he is but a part of the divine eternal scheme and whose special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations with the general laws of Nature and especially with the moral law the deepest and highest of all and the last vitality of man or state so the United States may only become the greatest and the most continuous by understanding well their harmonious relations with entire humanity and history and all their laws and progress sublimed with the creative thought of Deity through all time past present and future Thus will they expand to the amplitude of their destiny and become illustrations and culminating parts of the kosmos and of civilization No more considering the States as an incident or series of incidents however vast coming accidentally along the path of time and shaped by casual emergencies as they happen to arise and the mere result of modern improvements vulgar and lucky ahead of other nations and times I would finally plant as seeds these thoughts or speculations in the growth of our republic that it is the deliberate culmination and result of all the past that here too as in all departments of the universe regular laws slow and sure in planting slow and sure in ripening have controll d and govern d and will yet control and govern and that those laws can no more be baffled or steer d clear of or vitiated by chance or any fortune or opposition than the laws of winter and summer or darkness and light The summing up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of eighteen sixty one sixty five and their results and indeed of the entire hundred years of the past of our national experiment from its inchoate movement down to the present day seventeen eighty eighteen eighty one is that they all now launch the United States fairly forth consistently with the entirety of civilization and humanity and in main sort the representative of them leading the van leading the fleet of the modern and democratic on the seas and voyages of the future And the real history of the United States starting from that great convulsive struggle for unity the secession war triumphantly concluded and the South victorious after all is only to be written at the remove of hundreds perhaps a thousand years hence A MEMORANDUM AT A VENTURE All is proper to be express d provided our aim is only high enough J F Millet The candor of science is the glory of the modern It does not hide and repress it confronts turns on the light It alone has perfect faith faith not in a part only but all Does it not undermine the old religious standards Yes in God s truth by excluding the devil from the theory of the universe by showing that evil is not a law in itself but a sickness a perversion of the good and the other side of the good that in fact all of humanity and of everything is divine in its bases its eligibilities Shall the mention of such topics as I have briefly but plainly and resolutely broach d in the Children of Adam section of Leaves of Grass be admitted in poetry and literature Ought not the innovation to be put down by opinion and criticism and if those fail by the District Attorney True I could not construct a poem which declaredly took as never before the complete human identity physical moral emotional and intellectual giving precedence and compass in a certain sense to the first nor fulfil that bona fide candor and entirety of treatment which was a part of my purpose without comprehending this section also But I would entrench myself more deeply and widely than that And while I do not ask any man to indorse my theory I confess myself anxious that what I sought to write and express and the ground I built on shall be at least partially understood from its own platform The best way seems to me to confront the question with entire frankness There are generally speaking two points of view two conditions of the world s attitude toward these matters the first the conventional one of good folks and good print everywhere repressing any direct statement of them and making allusions only at second or third hand as the Greeks did of death which in Hellenic social culture was not mention d point blank but by euphemisms In the civilization of to day this condition without stopping to elaborate the arguments and facts which are many and varied and perplexing has led to states of ignorance repressal and cover d over disease and depletion forming certainly a main factor in the world s woe A nonscientific non esthetic and eminently non religious condition bequeath d to us from the past its origins diverse one of them the far back lessons of benevolent and wise men to restrain the prevalent coarseness and animality of the tribal ages with Puritanism or perhaps Protestantism itself for another and still another specified in the latter part of this memorandum to it is probably due most of the ill births inefficient maturity snickering pruriency and of that human pathologic evil and morbidity which is in my opinion the keel and reason why of every evil and morbidity Its scent as of something sneaking furtive mephitic seems to lingeringly pervade all modern literature conversation and manners The second point of view and by far the largest as the world in working day dress vastly exceeds the world in parlor toilette is the one of common life from the oldest times down and especially in England see the earlier chapters of Taine s English Literature and see Shakspere almost anywhere and which our age to day inherits from riant stock in the wit or what passes for wit of masculine circles and in erotic stories and talk to excite express and dwell on that merely sensual voluptuousness which according to Victor Hugo is the most universal trait of all ages all lands This second condition however bad is at any rate like a disease which comes to the surface and therefore less dangerous than a conceal d one The time seems to me to have arrived and America to be the place for a new departure a third point of view The same freedom and faith and earnestness which after centuries of denial struggle repression and martyrdom the present day brings to the treatment of politics and religion must work out a plan and standard on this subject not so much for what is call d society as for thoughtfulest men and women and thoughtfulest literature The same spirit that marks the physiological author and demonstrator on these topics in his important field I have thought necessary to be exemplified for once in another certainly not less important field In the present memorandum I only venture to indicate that plan and view decided upon more than twenty years ago for my own literary action and formulated tangibly in my printed poems as Bacon says an abstract thought or theory is of no moment unless it leads to a deed or work done exemplifying it in the concrete that the sexual passion in itself while normal and unperverted is inherently legitimate creditable not necessarily an improper theme for poet as confessedly not for scientist that with reference to the whole construction organism and intentions of Leaves of Grass anything short of confronting that theme and making myself clear upon it as the enclosing basis of everything as the sanity of everything was to be the atmosphere of the poems I should beg the question in its most momentous aspect and the superstructure that follow d pretensive as it might assume to be would all rest on a poor foundation or no foundation at all In short as the assumption of the sanity of birth Nature and humanity is the key to any true theory of life and the universe at any rate the only theory out of which I wrote it is and must inevitably be the only key to Leaves of Grass and every part of it That and not a vain consistency or weak pride as a late Springfield Republican charges is the reason that I have stood out for these particular verses uncompromisingly for over twenty years and maintain them to this day That is what I felt in my inmost brain and heart when I only answer d Emerson s vehement arguments with silence under the old elms of Boston Common Indeed might not every physiologist and every good physician pray for the redeeming of this subject from its hitherto relegation to the tongues and pens of blackguards and boldly putting it for once at least if no more in the demesne of poetry and sanity as something not in itself gross or impure but entirely consistent with highest manhood and womanhood and indispensable to both Might not only every wife and every mother not only every babe that comes into the world if that were possible not only all marriage the foundation and sine qua non of the civilized state bless and thank the showing or taking for granted that motherhood fatherhood sexuality and all that belongs to them can be asserted where it comes to question openly joyously proudly without shame or the need of shame from the highest artistic and human considerations but with reverence be it written on such attempt to justify the base and start of the whole divine scheme in humanity might not the Creative Power itself deign a smile of approval To the movement for the eligibility and entrance of women amid new spheres of business politics and the suffrage the current prurient conventional treatment of sex is the main formidable obstacle The rising tide of woman s rights swelling and every year advancing farther and farther recoils from it with dismay There will in my opinion be no general progress in such eligibility till a sensible philosophic democratic method is substituted The whole question which strikes far very far deeper than most people have supposed and doubtless too something is to be said on all sides is peculiarly an important one in art is first an ethic and then still more an esthetic one I condense from a paper read not long since at Cheltenham England before the Social Science Congress to the Art Department by P H Rathbone of Liverpool on the Undraped Figure in Art and the discussion that follow d When coward Europe suffer d the unclean Turk to soil the sacred shores of Greece by his polluting presence civilization and morality receiv d a blow from which they have never entirely recover d and the trail of the serpent has been over European art and European society ever since The Turk regarded and regards women as animals without soul toys to be play d with or broken at pleasure and to be hidden partly from shame but chiefly for the purpose of stimulating exhausted passion Such is the unholy origin of the objection to the nude as a fit subject for art it is purely Asiatic and though not introduced for the first time in the fifteenth century is yet to be traced to the source of all impurity the East Although the source of the prejudice is thoroughly unhealthy and impure yet it is now shared by many pure minded and honest if somewhat uneducated people But I am prepared to maintain that it is necessary for the future of English art and of English morality that the right of the nude to a place in our galleries should be boldly asserted it must however be the nude as represented by thoroughly trained artists and with a pure and noble ethic purpose The human form male and female is the type and standard of all beauty of form and proportion and it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar with it in order safely to judge of all beauty which consists of form and proportion To women it is most necessary that they should become thoroughly imbued with the knowledge of the ideal female form in order that they should recognize the perfection of it at once and without effort and so far as possible avoid deviations from the ideal Had this been the case in times past we should not have had to deplore the distortions effected by tight lacing which destroy d the figure and ruin d the health of so many of the last generation Nor should we have had the scandalous dresses alike of society and the stage The extreme development of the low dresses which obtain d some years ago when the stays crush d up the breasts into suggestive prominence would surely have been check d had the eye of the public been properly educated by familiarity with the exquisite beauty of line of a well shaped bust I might show how thorough acquaintance with the ideal nude foot would probably have much modified the foot torturing boots and high heels which wring the foot out of all beauty of line and throw the body forward into an awkward and ungainly attitude It is argued that the effect of nude representation of women upon young men is unwholesome but it would not be so if such works were admitted without question into our galleries and became thoroughly familiar to them On the contrary it would do much to clear away from healthy hearted lads one of their sorest trials that prurient curiosity which is bred of prudish concealment Where there is mystery there is the suggestion of evil and to go to a theatre where you have only to look at the stalls to see one half of the female form and to the stage to see the other half undraped is far more pregnant with evil imaginings than the most objectionable of totally undraped figures In French art there have been questionable nude figures exhibited but the fault was not that they were nude but that they were the portraits of ugly immodest women Some discussion follow d There was a general concurrence in the principle contended for by the reader of the paper Sir Walter Stirling maintain d that the perfect male figure rather than the female was the model of beauty After a few remarks from reverend mister Roberts and Colonel Oldfield the Chairman regretted that no opponent of nude figures had taken part in the discussion He agreed with Sir Walter Stirling as to the male figure being the most perfect model of proportion He join d in defending the exhibition of nude figures but thought considerable supervision should be exercis d over such exhibitions No it is not the picture or nude statue or text with clear aim that is indecent it is the beholder s own thought inference distorted construction True modesty is one of the most precious of attributes even virtues but in nothing is there more pretense more falsity than the needless assumption of it Through precept and consciousness man has long enough realized how bad he is I would not so much disturb or demolish that conviction only to resume and keep unerringly with it the spinal meaning of the Scriptural text God overlook d all that He had made including the apex of the whole humanity

the human race have yet to be develop d DEATH OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN LECTURE deliver d in New York April fourteen eighteen seventy nine in Philadelphia eighty in Boston eighty one How often since that dark and dripping Saturday that chilly April day now fifteen years bygone my heart has entertain d the dream the wish to give of Abraham Lincoln s death its own special thought and memorial Yet now the sought for opportunity offers I find my notes incompetent why for truly profound themes is statement so idle why does the right phrase never offer and the fit tribute I dream d of waits unprepared as ever My talk here indeed is less because of itself or anything in it and nearly altogether because I feel a desire apart from any talk to specify the day the martyrdom It is for this my friends I have call d you together Oft as the rolling years bring back this hour let it again however briefly be dwelt upon For my own part I hope and desire till my own dying day whenever the fourteenth or fifteenth of April comes to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic reminiscence No narrow or sectional reminiscence It belongs to these States in their entirety not the North only but the South perhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South of all for there really this man s birth stock There and thence his antecedent stamp Why should I not say that thence his manliest traits his universality his canny easy ways and words upon the surface his inflexible determination and courage at heart Have you never realized it my friends that Lincoln though grafted on the West is essentially in personnel and character a Southern contribution And though by no means proposing to resume the secession war to night I would briefly remind you of the public conditions preceding that contest For twenty years and especially during the four or five before the war actually began the aspect of affairs in the United States though without the flash of military excitement presents more than the survey of a battle or any extended campaign or series even of Nature s convulsions The hot passions of the South the strange mixture at the North of inertia incredulity and conscious power the incendiarism of the abolitionists the rascality and grip of the politicians unparallel d in any land any age To these I must not omit adding the honesty of the essential bulk of the people everywhere yet with all the seething fury and contradiction of their natures more arous d than the Atlantic s waves in wildest equinox In politics what can be more ominous though generally unappreciated then what more significant than the Presidentiads of Fillmore and Buchanan proving conclusively that the weakness and wickedness of elected rulers are just as likely to afflict us here as in the countries of the Old World under their monarchies emperors and aristocracies In that Old World were everywhere heard underground rumblings that died out only to again surely return While in America the volcano though civic yet continued to grow more and more convulsive more and more stormy and threatening In the height of all this excitement and chaos hovering on the edge at first and then merged in its very midst and destined to play a leading part appears a strange and awkward figure I shall not easily forget the first time I ever saw Abraham Lincoln It must have been about the eighteenth or nineteenth of February eighteen sixty one It was rather a pleasant afternoon in New York city as he arrived there from the West to remain a few hours and then pass on to Washington to prepare for his inauguration I saw him in Broadway near the site of the present Post office He came down I think from Canal street to stop at the Astor House The broad spaces sidewalks and street in the neighborhood and for some distance were crowded with solid masses of people many thousands The omnibuses and other vehicles had all been turn d off leaving an unusual hush in that busy part of the city Presently two or three shabby hack barouches made their way with some difficulty through the crowd and drew up at the Astor House entrance A tall figure stepp d out of the centre of these barouches paus d leisurely on the sidewalk look d up at the granite walls and looming architecture of the grand old hotel then after a relieving stretch of arms and legs turn d round for over a minute to slowly and good humoredly scan the appearance of the vast and silent crowds There were no speeches no compliments no welcome as far as I could hear not a word said Still much anxiety was conceal d in that quiet Cautious persons had fear d some mark d insult or indignity to the President elect for he possess d no personal popularity at all in New York city and very little political But it was evidently tacitly agreed that if the few political supporters of mister Lincoln present would entirely abstain from any demonstration on their side the immense majority who were anything but supporters would abstain on their side also The result was a sulky unbroken silence such as certainly never before characterized so great a New York crowd Almost in the same neighborhood I distinctly remember d seeing Lafayette on his visit to America in eighteen twenty five I had also personally seen and heard various years afterward how Andrew Jackson Clay Webster Hungarian Kossuth Filibuster Walker the Prince of Wales on his visit and other celebres native and foreign had been welcom d there all that indescribable human roar and magnetism unlike any other sound in the universe the glad exulting thunder shouts of countless unloos d throats of men But on this occasion not a voice not a sound From the top of an omnibus driven up one side close by and block d by the curbstone and the crowds I had I say a capital view of it all and especially of mister Lincoln his look and gait his perfect composure and coolness his unusual and uncouth height his dress of complete black stovepipe hat push d back on the head dark brown complexion seam d and wrinkled yet canny looking face black bushy head of hair disproportionately long neck and his hands held behind as he stood observing the people He look d with curiosity upon that immense sea of faces and the sea of faces return d the look with similar curiosity In both there was a dash of comedy almost farce such as Shakspere puts in his blackest tragedies The crowd that hemm d around consisted I should think of thirty to forty thousand men not a single one his personal friend while I have no doubt so frenzied were the ferments of the time many an assassin s knife and pistol lurk d in hip or breast pocket there ready soon as break and riot came But no break or riot came The tall figure gave another relieving stretch or two of arms and legs then with moderate pace and accompanied by a few unknown looking persons ascended the portico steps of the Astor House disappear d through its broad entrance and the dumb show ended I saw Abraham Lincoln often the four years following that date He changed rapidly and much during his Presidency but this scene and him in it are indelibly stamp d upon my recollection As I sat on the top of my omnibus and had a good view of him the thought dim and inchoate then has since come out clear enough that four sorts of genius four mighty and primal hands will be needed to the complete limning of this man s future portrait the eyes and brains and finger touch of Plutarch and Eschylus and Michel Angelo assisted by Rabelais And now mister Lincoln passing on from this scene to Washington where he was inaugurated amid armed cavalry and sharpshooters at every point the first instance of the kind in our history and I hope it will be the last now the rapid succession of well known events too well known I believe these days we almost hate to hear them mention d the national flag fired on at Sumter the uprising of the North in paroxysms of astonishment and rage the chaos of divided councils the call for troops the first Bull Run the stunning cast down shock and dismay of the North and so in full flood the secession war Four years of lurid bleeding murky murderous war Who paint those years with all their scenes the hard fought engagements the defeats plans failures the gloomy hours days when our Nationality seem d hung in pall of doubt perhaps death the Mephistophelean sneers of foreign lands and attaches the dreaded Scylla of European interference and the Charybdis of the tremendously dangerous latent strata of secession sympathizers throughout the free States far more numerous than is supposed the long marches in summer the hot sweat and many a sunstroke as on the rush to Gettysburg in sixty three the night battles in the woods as under Hooker at Chancellorsville the camps in winter the military prisons the hospitals alas alas the hospitals The secession war Nay let me call it the Union war Though whatever call d it is even yet too near us too vast and too closely overshadowing its branches unform d yet but certain shooting too far into the future and the most indicative and mightiest of them yet ungrown A great literature will yet arise out of the era of those four years those scenes era compressing centuries of native passion first class pictures tempests of life and death an inexhaustible mine for the histories drama romance and even philosophy of peoples to come indeed the verteber of poetry and art of personal character too for all future America far more grand in my opinion to the hands capable of it than Homer s siege of Troy or the French wars to Shakspere But I must leave these speculations and come to the theme I have assign d and limited myself to Of the actual murder of President Lincoln though so much has been written probably the facts are yet very indefinite in most persons minds I read from my memoranda written at the time and revised frequently and finally since The day April fourteen eighteen sixty five seems to have been a pleasant one throughout the whole land the moral atmosphere pleasant too the long storm so dark so fratricidal full of blood and doubt and gloom over and ended at last by the sun rise of such an absolute National victory and utter break down of Secessionism we almost doubted our own senses Lee had capitulated beneath the apple tree of Appomattox The other armies the flanges of the revolt swiftly follow d And could it really be then Out of all the affairs of this world of woe and failure and disorder was there really come the confirm d unerring sign of plan like a shaft of pure light of rightful rule of God So the day as I say was propitious Early herbage early flowers were out I remember where I was stopping at the time the season being advanced there were many lilacs in full bloom By one of those caprices that enter and give tinge to events without being at all a part of them I find myself always reminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and odor of these blossoms It never fails But I must not dwell on accessories The deed hastens The popular afternoon paper of Washington the little Evening Star had spatter d all over its third page divided among the advertisements in a sensational manner in a hundred different places The President and his Lady will be at the Theatre this evening Lincoln was fond of the theatre I have myself seen him there several times I remember thinking how funny it was that he in some respects the leading actor in the stormiest drama known to real history s stage through centuries should sit there and be so completely interested and absorb d in those human jack straws moving about with their silly little gestures foreign spirit and flatulent text On this occasion the theatre was crowded many ladies in rich and gay costumes officers in their uniforms many well known citizens young folks the usual clusters of gas lights the usual magnetism of so many people cheerful with perfumes music of violins and flutes and over all and saturating all that vast vague wonder Victory the nation s victory the triumph of the Union filling the air the thought the sense with exhilaration more than all music and perfumes The President came betimes and with his wife witness d the play from the large stage boxes of the second tier two thrown into one and profusely drap d with the national flag The acts and scenes of the piece one of those singularly written compositions which have at least the merit of giving entire relief to an audience engaged in mental action or business excitements and cares during the day as it makes not the slightest call on either the moral emotional esthetic or spiritual nature a piece Our American Cousin in which among other characters so call d a Yankee certainly such a one as was never seen or the least like it ever seen in North America is introduced in England with a varied fol de rol of talk plot scenery and such phantasmagoria as goes to make up a modern popular drama had progress d through perhaps a couple of its acts when in the midst of this comedy or non such or whatever it is to be call d and to offset it or finish it out as if in Nature s and the great Muse s mockery of those poor mimes came interpolated that scene not really or exactly to be described at all for on the many hundreds who were there it seems to this hour to have left a passing blur a dream a blotch and yet partially to be described as I now proceed to give it There is a scene in the play representing a modern parlor in which two unprecedented English ladies are inform d by the impossible Yankee that he is not a man of fortune and therefore undesirable for marriage catching purposes after which the comments being finish d the dramatic trio make exit leaving the stage clear for a moment At this period came the murder of Abraham Lincoln Great as all its manifold train circling round it and stretching into the future for many a century in the politics history art c of the New World in point of fact the main thing the actual murder transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any commonest occurrence the bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation for instance Through the general hum following the stage pause with the change of positions came the muffled sound of a pistol shot which not one hundredth part of the audience heard at the time and yet a moment s hush somehow surely a vague startled thrill and then through the ornamented draperied starr d and striped space way of the President s box a sudden figure a man raises himself with hands and feet stands a moment on the railing leaps below to the stage a distance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet falls out of position catching his boot heel in the copious drapery the American flag falls on one knee quickly recovers himself rises as if nothing had happen d he really sprains his ankle but unfelt then and so the figure Booth the murderer dress d in plain black broadcloth bare headed with full glossy raven hair and his eyes like some mad animal s flashing with light and resolution yet with a certain strange calmness holds aloft in one hand a large knife walks along not much back from the footlights turns fully toward the audience his face of statuesque beauty lit by those basilisk eyes flashing with desperation perhaps insanity launches out in a firm and steady voice the words Sic semper tyrannis and then walks with neither slow nor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage and disappears Had not all this terrible scene making the mimic ones preposterous had it not all been rehears d in blank by Booth beforehand A moment s hush a scream the cry of murder missus Lincoln leaning out of the box with ashy cheeks and lips with involuntary cry pointing to the retreating figure He has kill d the President And still a moment s strange incredulous suspense and then the deluge then that mixture of horror noises uncertainty the sound somewhere back of a horse s hoofs clattering with speed the people burst through chairs and railings and break them up there is inextricable confusion and terror women faint quite feeble persons fall and are trampl d on many cries of agony are heard the broad stage suddenly fills to suffocation with a dense and motley crowd like some horrible carnival the audience rush generally upon it at least the strong men do the actors and actresses are all there in their play costumes and painted faces with mortal fright showing through the rouge the screams and calls confused talk redoubled trebled two or three manage to pass up water from the stage to the President s box others try to clamber up c c In the midst of all this the soldiers of the President s guard with others suddenly drawn to the scene burst in some two hundred altogether they storm the house through all the tiers especially the upper ones inflam d with fury literally charging the audience with fix d bayonets muskets and pistols snouting Clear out clear out you sons of Such the wild scene or a suggestion of it rather inside the play house that night Outside too in the atmosphere of shock and craze crowds of people fill d with frenzy ready to seize any outlet for it come near committing murder several times on innocent individuals One such case was especially exciting The infuriated crowd through some chance got started against one man either for words he utter d or perhaps without any cause at all and were proceeding at once to actually hang him on a neighboring lamp post when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen who placed him in their midst and fought their way slowly and amid great peril toward the station house It was a fitting episode of the whole affair The crowd rushing and eddying to and fro the night the yells the pale faces many frighten d people trying in vain to extricate themselves the attack d man not yet freed from the jaws of death looking like a corpse the silent resolute half dozen policemen with no weapons but their little clubs yet stern and steady through all those eddying swarms made a fitting side scene to the grand tragedy of the murder They gain d the station house with the protected man whom they placed in security for the night and discharged him in the morning And in the midst of that pandemonium infuriated soldiers the audience and the crowd the stage and all its actors and actresses its paint pots spangles and gas lights the life blood from those veins the best and sweetest of the land drips slowly down and death s ooze already begins its little bubbles on the lips Thus the visible incidents and surroundings of Abraham Lincoln s murder as they really occur d Thus ended the attempted secession of these States thus the four years war But the main things come subtly and invisibly afterward perhaps long afterward neither military political nor great as those are historical I say certain secondary and indirect results out of the tragedy of this death are in my opinion greatest Not the event of the murder itself Not that mister Lincoln strings the principal points and personages of the period like beads upon the single string of his career Not that his idiosyncrasy in its sudden appearance and disappearance stamps this Republic with a stamp more mark d and enduring than any yet given by any one man more even than Washington s but join d with these the immeasurable value and meaning of that whole tragedy lies to me in senses finally dearest to a nation and here all our own the imaginative and artistic senses the literary and dramatic ones Not in any common or low meaning of those terms but a meaning precious to the race and to every age A long and varied series of contradictory events arrives at last at its highest poetic single central pictorial denouement The whole involved baffling multiform whirl of the secession period comes to a head and is gather d in one brief flash of lightning illumination one simple fierce deed Its sharp culmination and as it were solution of so many bloody and angry problems illustrates those climax moments on the stage of universal Time where the historic Muse at one entrance and the tragic Muse at the other suddenly ringing down the curtain close an immense act in the long drama of creative thought and give it radiation tableau stranger than fiction Fit radiation fit close How the imagination how the student loves these things America too is to have them For not in all great deaths nor far or near not Caesar in the Roman senate house or Napoleon passing away in the wild night storm at saint Helena not Paleologus falling desperately fighting piled over dozens deep with Grecian corpses not calm old Socrates drinking the hemlock outvies that terminus of the secession war in one man s life here in our midst in our own time that seal of the emancipation of three million slaves that parturition and delivery of our at last really free Republic born again henceforth to commence its career of genuine homogeneous Union compact consistent with itself Nor will ever future American Patriots and Unionists indifferently over the whole land or North or South find a better moral to their lesson The final use of the greatest men of a Nation is after all not with reference to their deeds in themselves or their direct bearing on their times or lands The final use of a heroic eminent life especially of a heroic eminent death is its indirect filtering into the nation and the race and to give often at many removes but unerringly age after age color and fibre to the personalism of the youth and maturity of that age and of mankind Then there is a cement to the whole people subtler more underlying than any thing in written constitution or courts or armies namely the cement of a death identified thoroughly with that people at its head and for its sake Strange is it not that battles martyrs agonies blood even assassination should so condense perhaps only really lastingly condense a Nationality I repeat it the grand deaths of the race the dramatic deaths of every nationality are its most important inheritance value in some respects beyond its literature and art as the hero is beyond his finest portrait and the battle itself beyond its choicest song or epic Is not here indeed the point underlying all tragedy the famous pieces of the Grecian masters and all masters Why if the old Greeks had had this man what trilogies of plays what epics would have been made out of him How the rhapsodes would have recited him How quickly that quaint tall form would have enter d into the region where men vitalize gods and gods divinify men But Lincoln his times his death great as any any age belong altogether to our own and our autochthonic Sometimes indeed I think our American days our own stage the actors we know and have shaken hands or talk d with more fateful than anything in Eschylus more heroic than the fighters around Troy afford kings of men for our Democracy prouder than Agamemnon models of character cute and hardy as Ulysses deaths more pitiful than Priam s When centuries hence as it must in my opinion be centuries hence before the life of these States or of Democracy can be really written and illustrated the leading historians and dramatists seek for some personage some special event incisive enough to mark with deepest cut and mnemonize this turbulent Nineteenth century of ours not only these States but all over the political and social world something perhaps to close that gorgeous procession of European feudalism with all its pomp and caste prejudices of whose long train we in America are yet so inextricably the heirs something to identify with terrible identification by far the greatest revolutionary step in the history of the United States perhaps the greatest of the world our century the absolute extirpation and erasure of slavery from the States those historians will seek in vain for any point to serve more thoroughly their purpose than Abraham Lincoln s death Dear to the Muse thrice dear to Nationality to the whole human race precious to this Union precious to Democracy unspeakably and forever precious their first great Martyr Chief TWO LETTERS I TO LONDON ENGLAND Camden N J U S America March seventeenth eighteen seventy six DEAR FRIEND Yours of the twenty eighth Feb receiv d and indeed welcom d I am jogging along still about the same in physical condition still certainly no worse and I sometimes lately suspect rather better or at any rate more adjusted to the situation Even begin to think of making some move some change of base c the doctors have been advising it for over two years but I haven t felt to do it yet My paralysis does not lift I cannot walk any distance I still have this baffling obstinate apparently chronic affection of the stomachic apparatus and liver yet I get out of doors a little every day write and read in moderation appetite sufficiently good eat only very plain food but always did that digestion tolerable spirits unflagging I have told you most of this before but suppose you might like to know it all again up to date Of course and pretty darkly coloring the whole are bad spells prostrations some pretty grave ones intervals and I have resign d myself to the certainty of permanent incapacitation from solid work but things may continue at least in this half and half way for months even years My books are out the new edition a set of which immediately on receiving your letter of twenty eighth I have sent you by mail March fifteen and I suppose you have before this receiv d them My dear friend your offers of help and those of my other British friends I think I fully appreciate in the right spirit welcome and acceptive leaving the matter altogether in your and their hands and to your and their convenience discretion leisure and nicety Though poor now even to penury I have not so far been deprived of any physical thing I need or wish whatever and I feel confident I shall not in the future During my employment of seven years or more in Washington after the war eighteen sixty five seventy two I regularly saved part of my wages and though the sum has now become about exhausted by my expenses of the last three years there are already beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales of my new edition which I just job and sell myself all through this illness my book agents for three years in New York successively badly cheated me and shall continue to dispose of the books myself And that is the way I should prefer to glean my support In that way I cheerfully accept all the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer To repeat a little and without undertaking details understand dear friend for yourself and all that I heartily and most affectionately thank my British friends and that I accept their sympathetic generosity in the same spirit in which I believe nay know it is offer d that though poor I am not in want that I maintain good heart and cheer and that by far the most satisfaction to me and I think it can be done and believe it will be will be to live as long as possible on the sales by myself of my own works and perhaps if practicable by further writings for the press W W I am prohibited from writing too much and I must make this candid statement of the situation serve for all my dear friends over there II TO DRESDEN SAXONY Camden New Jersey U S A Dec twenty eighty one DEAR SIR Your letter asking definite endorsement to your translation of my Leaves of Grass into Russian is just received and I hasten to answer it Most warmly and willingly I consent to the translation and waft a prayerful God speed to the enterprise You Russians and we Americans Our countries so distant so unlike at first glance such a difference in social and political conditions and our respective methods of moral and practical development the last hundred years and yet in certain features and vastest ones so resembling each other The variety of stock elements and tongues to be resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazards the idea perennial through the ages that they both have their historic and divine mission the fervent element of manly friendship throughout the whole people surpass d by no other races the grand expanse of territorial limits and boundaries the unform d and nebulous state of many things not yet permanently settled but agreed on all hands to be the preparations of an infinitely greater future the fact that both Peoples have their independent and leading positions to hold keep and if necessary fight for against the rest of the world the deathless aspirations at the inmost centre of each great community so vehement so mysterious so abysmic are certainly features you Russians and we Americans possess in common As my dearest dream is for an internationality of poems and poets binding the lands of the earth closer than all treaties and diplomacy as the purpose beneath the rest in my book is such hearty comradeship for individuals to begin with and for all the nations of the earth as a result how happy I should be to get the hearing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples To whom now and here addressing you for Russia and Russians and empowering you should you see fit to print the present letter in your book as a preface I waft affectionate salutation from these shores in America s name W W NOTES LEFT OVER NATIONALITY AND YET It is more and more clear to me that the main sustenance for highest separate personality these States is to come from that general sustenance of the aggregate as air earth rains give sustenance to a tree and that such personality by democratic standards will only be fully coherent grand and free through the cohesion grandeur and freedom of the common aggregate the Union Thus the existence of the true American continental solidarity of the future depending on myriads of superb large sized emotional and physically perfect individualities of one sex just as much as the other the supply of such individualities in my opinion wholly depends on a compacted imperial ensemble The theory and practice of both sovereignties contradictory as they are are necessary As the centripetal law were fatal alone or the centrifugal law deadly and destructive alone but together forming the law of eternal kosmical action evolution preservation and life so by itself alone the fullness of individuality even the sanest would surely destroy itself This is what makes the importance to the identities of these States of the thoroughly fused relentless dominating Union a moral and spiritual idea subjecting all the parts with remorseless power more needed by American democracy than by any of history s hitherto empires or feudalities and the sine qua non of carrying out the republican principle to develop itself in the New World through hundreds thousands of years to come Indeed what most needs fostering through the hundred years to come in all parts of the United States north south Mississippi valley and Atlantic and Pacific coasts is this fused and fervent identity of the individual whoever he or she may be and wherever the place with the idea and fact of AMERICAN TOTALITY and with what is meant by the Flag the stars and stripes We need this conviction of nationality as a faith to be absorb d in the blood and belief of the People everywhere south north west east to emanate in their life and in native literature and art We want the germinal idea that America inheritor of the past is the custodian of the future of humanity Judging from history it is some such moral and spiritual ideas appropriate to them and such ideas only that have made the profoundest glory and endurance of nations in the past The races of Judea the classic clusters of Greece and Rome and the feudal and ecclesiastical clusters of the Middle Ages were each and all vitalized by their separate distinctive ideas ingrain d in them redeeming many sins and indeed in a sense the principal reason why for their whole career Then in the thought of nationality especially for the United States and making them original and different from all other countries another point ever remains to be considered There are two distinct principles aye paradoxes at the life fountain and life continuation of the States one the sacred principle of the Union the right of ensemble at whatever sacrifice and yet another an equally sacred principle the right of each State consider d as a separate sovereign individual in its own sphere Some go zealously for one set of these rights and some as zealously for the other set We must have both or rather bred out of them as out of mother and father a third set the perennial result and combination of both and neither jeopardized I say the loss or abdication of one set in the future will be ruin to democracy just as much as the loss of the other set The problem is to harmoniously adjust the two and the play of the two Observe the lesson of the divinity of Nature ever checking the excess of one law by an opposite or seemingly opposite law generally the other side of the same law For the theory of this Republic is not that the General government is the fountain of all life and power dispensing it forth around and to the remotest portions of our territory but that THE PEOPLE are represented in both underlying both the General and State governments and consider d just as well in their individualities and in their separate aggregates or States as consider d in one vast aggregate the Union This was the original dual theory and foundation of the United States as distinguish d from the feudal and ecclesiastical single idea of monarchies and papacies and the divine right of kings Kings have been of use hitherto as representing the idea of the identity of nations But to American democracy both ideas must be fulfill d and in my opinion the loss of vitality of either one will indeed be the loss of vitality of the other EMERSON S BOOKS THE SHADOWS OF THEM In the regions we call Nature towering beyond all measurement with infinite spread infinite depth and height in those regions including Man socially and historically with his moral emotional influences how small a part it came in my mind to day has literature really depicted even summing up all of it all ages Seems at its best some little fleet of boats hugging the shores of a boundless sea and never venturing exploring the unmapp d never Columbus like sailing out for New Worlds and to complete the orb s rondure Emerson writes frequently in the atmosphere of this thought and his books report one or two things from that very ocean and air and more legibly address d to our age and American polity than by any man yet But I will begin by scarifying him thus proving that I am not insensible to his deepest lessons I will consider his books from a democratic and western point of view I will specify the shadows on these sunny expanses Somebody has said of heroic character that wherever the tallest peaks are present must inevitably be deep chasms and valleys Mine be the ungracious task for reasons of leaving unmention d both sunny expanses and sky reaching heights to dwell on the bare spots and darknesses I have a theory that no artist or work of the very first class may be or can be without them First then these pages are perhaps too perfect too concentrated How good for instance is good butter good sugar But to be eating nothing but sugar and butter all the time even if ever so good And though the author has much to say of freedom and wildness and simplicity and spontaneity no performance was ever more based on artificial scholarships and decorums at third or fourth removes he calls it culture and built up from them It is always a make never an unconscious growth It is the porcelain figure or statuette of lion or stag or Indian hunter and a very choice statuette too appropriate for the rosewood or marble bracket of parlor or library never the animal itself or the hunter himself Indeed who wants the real animal or hunter What would that do amid astral and bric a brac and tapestry and ladies and gentlemen talking in subdued tones of Browning and Longfellow and art The least suspicion of such actual bull or Indian or of Nature carrying out itself would put all those good people to instant terror and flight Emerson in my opinion is not most eminent as poet or artist or teacher though valuable in all those He is best as critic or diagnoser Not passion or imagination or warp or weakness or any pronounced cause or specialty dominates him Cold and bloodless intellectuality dominates him I know the fires emotions love egotisms glow deep perennial as in all New Englanders but the facade hides them well they give no sign He does not see or take one side one presentation only or mainly as all the poets or most of the fine writers anyhow he sees all sides His final influence is to make his students cease to worship anything almost cease to believe in anything outside of themselves These books will fill and well fill certain stretches of life certain stages of development are like the tenets or theology the author of them preach d when a young man unspeakably serviceable and precious as a stage But in old or nervous or solemnest or dying hours when one needs the impalpably soothing and vitalizing influences of abysmic Nature or its affinities in literature or human society and the soul resents the keenest mere intellection they will not be sought for For a philosopher Emerson possesses a singularly dandified theory of manners He seems to have no notion at all that manners are simply the signs by which the chemist or metallurgist knows his metals To the profound scientist all metals are profound as they really are The little one like the conventional world will make much of gold and silver only Then to the real artist in humanity what are called bad manners are often the most picturesque and significant of all Suppose these books becoming absorb d the permanent chyle of American general and particular character what a well wash d and grammatical but bloodless and helpless race we should turn out No no dear friend though the States want scholars undoubtedly and perhaps want ladies and gentlemen who use the bath frequently and never laugh loud or talk wrong they don t want scholars or ladies and gentlemen at the expense of all the rest They want good farmers sailors mechanics clerks citizens perfect business and social relations perfect fathers and mothers If we could only have these or their approximations plenty of them fine and large and sane and generous and patriotic they might make their verbs disagree from their nominatives and laugh like volleys of musketeers if they should please Of course these are not all America wants but they are first of all to be provided on a large scale And with tremendous errors and escapades this substantially is what the States seem to have an intuition of and to be mainly aiming at The plan of a select class superfined demarcated from the rest the plan of Old World lands and literatures is not so objectionable in itself but because it chokes the true plan for us and indeed is death to it As to such special class the United States can never produce any equal to the splendid show far far beyond comparison or competition here of the principal European nations both in the past and at the present day But an immense and distinctive commonalty over our vast and varied area west and east south and north in fact for the first time in history a great aggregated real PEOPLE worthy the name and made of develop d heroic individuals both sexes is America s principal perhaps only reason for being If ever accomplish d it will be at least as much I lately think doubly as much the result of fitting and democratic sociologies literatures and arts if we ever get them as of our democratic politics At times it has been doubtful to me if Emerson really knows or feels what Poetry is at its highest as in the Bible for instance or Homer or Shakspere I see he covertly or plainly likes best superb verbal polish or something old or odd Waller s Go lovely rose or Lovelace s lines to Lucusta the quaint conceits of the old French bards and the like Of power he seems to have a gentleman s admiration but in his inmost heart the grandest attribute of God and Poets is always subordinate to the octaves conceits polite kinks and verbs The reminiscence that years ago I began like most youngsters to have a touch though it came late and was only on the surface of Emerson on the brain that I read his writings reverently and address d him in print as Master and for a month or so thought of him as such I retain not only with composure but positive satisfaction I have noticed that most young people of eager minds pass through this stage of exercise The best part of Emersonianism is it breeds the giant that destroys itself Who wants to be any man s mere follower lurks behind every page No teacher ever taught that has so provided for his pupil s setting up independently no truer evolutionist VENTURES ON AN OLD THEME A DIALOGUE One party says We arrange our lives even the best and boldest men and women that exist just as much as the most limited with reference to what society conventionally rules and makes right We retire to our rooms for freedom to undress bathe unloose everything in freedom These and much else would not be proper in society Other party answers Such is the rule of society Not always so and considerable exceptions still exist However it must be called the general rule sanction d by immemorial usage and will probably always remain so First party Why not then respect it in your poems Answer One reason and to me a profound one is that the soul of a man or woman demands enjoys compensation in the highest directions for this very restraint of himself or herself level d to the average or rather mean low however eternally practical requirements of society s intercourse To balance this indispensable abnegation the free minds of poets relieve themselves and strengthen and enrich mankind with free flights in all the directions not tolerated by ordinary society First party But must not outrage or give offence to it Answer No not in the deepest sense and do not and cannot The vast averages of time and the race en masse settle these things Only understand that the conventional standards and laws proper enough for ordinary society apply neither to the action of the soul nor its poets In fact the latter know no laws but the laws of themselves planted in them by God and are themselves the last standards of the law and its final exponents responsible to Him directly and not at all to mere etiquette Often the best service that can be done to the race is to lift the veil at least for a time from these rules and fossil etiquettes NEW POETRY California Canada Texas In my opinion the time has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and poetry I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character regardless of rhyme and the measurement rules of iambic spondee dactyl c and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue to furnish the medium for inferior writers and themes especially for persiflage and the comic as there seems henceforward to the perfect taste something inevitably comic in rhyme merely in itself and anyhow the truest and greatest Poetry while subtly and necessarily always rhythmic and distinguishable easily enough can never again in the English language be express d in arbitrary and rhyming metre any more than the greatest eloquence or the truest power and passion While admitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification have in their time play d great and fitting parts that the pensive complaint the ballads wars amours legends of Europe c have many of them been inimitably render d in rhyming verse that there have been very illustrious poets whose shapes the mantle of such verse has beautifully and appropriately envelopt and though the mantle has fallen with perhaps added beauty on some of our own age it is not withstanding certain to me that the day of such conventional rhyme is ended In America at any rate and as a medium of highest esthetic practical or spiritual expression present or future it palpably fails and must fail to serve The Muse of the Prairies of California Canada Texas and of the peaks of Colorado dismissing the literary as well as social etiquette of over sea feudalism and caste joyfully enlarging adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people with the free play emotions pride passions experiences that belong to them body and soul to the general globe and all its relations in astronomy as the savans portray them to us to the modern the busy Nineteenth century as grandly poetic as any only different with steamships railroads factories electric telegraphs cylinder presses to the thought of the solidarity of nations the brotherhood and sisterhood of the entire earth to the dignity and heroism of the practical labor of farms factories foundries workshops mines or on shipboard or on lakes and rivers resumes that other medium of expression more flexible more eligible soars to the freer vast diviner heaven of prose Of poems of the third or fourth class perhaps even some of the second it makes little or no difference who writes them they are good enough for what they are nor is it necessary that they should be actual emanations from the personality and life of the writers The very reverse sometimes gives piquancy But poems of the first class poems of the depth as distinguished from those of the surface are to be sternly tallied with the poets themselves and tried by them and their lives Who wants a glorification of courage and manly defiance from a coward or a sneak a ballad of benevolence or chastity from some rhyming hunks or lascivious glib roue In these States beyond all precedent poetry will have to do with actual facts with the concrete States and for we have not much more than begun with the definitive getting into shape of the Union Indeed I sometimes think it alone is to define the Union namely to give it artistic character spirituality dignity What American humanity is most in danger of is an overwhelming prosperity business worldliness materialism what is most lacking east west north south is a fervid and glowing Nationality and patriotism cohering all the parts into one Who may fend that danger and fill that lack in the future but a class of loftiest poets If the United States haven t grown poets on any scale of grandeur it is certain they import print and read more poetry than any equal number of people elsewhere probably more than all the rest of the world combined Poetry like a grand personality is a growth of many generations many rare combinations To have great poets there must be great audiences too BRITISH LITERATURE To avoid mistake I would say that I not only commend the study of this literature but wish our sources of supply and comparison vastly enlarged American students may well derive from all former lands from forenoon Greece and Rome down to the perturb d mediaeval times the Crusades and so to Italy the German intellect all the older literatures and all the newer ones from witty and warlike France and markedly and in many ways and at many different periods from the enterprise and soul of the great Spanish race bearing ourselves always courteous always deferential indebted beyond measure to the mother world to all its nations dead as all its nations living the offspring this America of ours the daughter not by any means of the British isles exclusively but of the continent and all continents Indeed it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we also hold from Italy France Spain especially in the best imaginative productions of those lands which are in many ways loftier and subtler than the English or British and indispensable to complete our service proportions education reminiscences c The British element these States hold and have always held enormously beyond its fit proportions I have already spoken of Shakspere He seems to me of astral genius first class entirely fit for feudalism His contributions especially to the literature of the passions are immense forever dear to humanity and his name is always to be reverenced in America But there is much in him ever offensive to democracy He is not only the tally of feudalism but I should say Shakspere is incarnated uncompromising feudalism in literature Then one seems to detect something in him I hardly know how to describe it even amid the dazzle of his genius and in inferior manifestations it is found in nearly all leading British authors Perhaps we will have to import the words Snob Snobbish c after all While of the great poems of Asian antiquity the Indian epics the book of Job the Ionian Iliad the unsurpassedly simple loving perfect idyls of the life and death of Christ in the New Testament indeed Homer and the Biblical utterances intertwine familiarly with us in the main and along down of most of the characteristic imaginative or romantic relics of the continent as the Cid Cervantes Don Quixote c I should say they substantially adjust themselves to us and far off as they are accord curiously with our bed and board to day in New York Washington Canada Ohio Texas California and with our notions both of seriousness and of fun and our standards of heroism manliness and even the democratic requirements those requirements are not only not fulfill d in the Shaksperean productions but are insulted on every page I add that while England is among the greatest of lands in political freedom or the idea of it and in stalwart personal character c the spirit of English literature is not great at least is not greatest and its products are no models for us With the exception of Shakspere there is no first class genius in that literature which with a truly vast amount of value and of artificial beauty largely from the classics is almost always material sensual not spiritual almost always congests makes plethoric not frees expands dilates is cold anti democratic loves to be sluggish and stately and shows much of that characteristic of vulgar persons the dread of saying or doing something not at all improper in itself but unconventional and that may be laugh d at In its best the sombre pervades it it is moody melancholy and to give it its due expresses in characters and plots those qualities in an unrival d manner Yet not as the black thunder storms and in great normal crashing passions of the Greek dramatists clearing the air refreshing afterward bracing with power but as in Hamlet moping sick uncertain and leaving ever after a secret taste for the blues the morbid fascination the luxury of wo I strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the United States to whom it may be eligible to overhaul the well freighted fleets the literatures of Italy Spain France Germany so full of those elements of freedom self possession gay heartedness subtlety dilation needed in preparations for the future of the States I only wish we could have really good translations I rejoice at the feeling for Oriental researches and poetry and hope it will go on DARWINISM THEN FURTHERMORE Running through prehistoric ages coming down from them into the daybreak of our records founding theology suffusing literature and so brought onward a sort of verteber and marrow to all the antique races and lands Egypt India Greece Rome the Chinese the Jews c and giving cast and complexion to their art poems and their politics as well as ecclesiasticism all of which we more or less inherit appear those venerable claims to origin from God himself or from gods and goddesses ancestry from divine beings of vaster beauty size and power than ours But in current and latest times the theory of human origin that seems to have most made its mark curiously reversing the antique is that we have come on originated developt from monkeys baboons a theory more significant perhaps in its indirections or what it necessitates than it is even in itself Of the twain far apart as they seem and angrily as their conflicting advocates to day oppose each other are not both theories to be possibly reconcil d and even blended Can we indeed spare either of them Better still out of them is not a third theory the real one or suggesting the real one to arise Of this old theory evolution as broach d anew trebled with indeed all devouring claims by Darwin it has so much in it and is so needed as a counterpoise to yet widely prevailing and unspeakably tenacious enfeebling superstitions is fused by the new man into such grand modest truly scientific accompaniments that the world of erudition both moral and physical cannot but be eventually better d and broaden d in its speculations from the advent of Darwinism Nevertheless the problem of origins human and other is not the least whit nearer its solution In due time the Evolution theory will have to abate its vehemence cannot be allow d to dominate every thing else and will have to take its place as a segment of the circle the cluster as but one of many theories many thoughts of profoundest value and re adjusting and differentiating much yet leaving the divine secrets just as inexplicable and unreachable as before maybe more so Then furthermore What is finally to be done by priest or poet and by priest or poet only amid all the stupendous and dazzling novelties of our century with the advent of America and of science and democracy remains just as indispensable after all the work of the grand astronomers chemists linguists historians and explorers of the last hundred years and the wondrous German and other metaphysicians of that time and will continue to remain needed America and here just the same as in the world of Europe or Asia of a hundred or a thousand or several thousand years ago I think indeed more needed to furnish statements from the present points the added arriere and the unspeakably immenser vistas of to day Only the priests and poets of the modern at least as exalted as any in the past fully absorbing and appreciating the results of the past in the commonalty of all humanity all time the main results already for there is perhaps nothing more or at any rate not much strictly new only more important modern combinations and new relative adjustments must indeed recast the old metal the already achiev d material into and through new moulds current forms Meantime the highest and subtlest and broadest truths of modern science wait for their true assignment and last vivid flashes of light as Democracy waits for it s through first class metaphysicians and speculative philosophs laying the basements and foundations for those new more expanded more harmonious more melodious freer American poems SOCIETY I have myself little or no hope from what is technically called Society in our American cities New York of which place I have spoken so sharply still promises something in time out of its tremendous and varied materials with a certain superiority of intuitions and the advantage of constant agitation and ever new and rapid dealings of the cards Of Boston with its circles of social mummies swathed in cerements harder than brass its bloodless religion Unitarianism its complacent vanity of scientism and literature lots of grammatical correctness mere knowledge always wearisome in itself its zealous abstractions ghosts of reforms I should say ever admitting its business powers its sharp almost demoniac intellect and no lack in its own way of courage and generosity there is at present little of cheering satisfying sign In the West California c society is yet unform d puerile seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving business or to liberally spend the money made by it in the usual rounds and shows Then there is to the humorous observer of American attempts at fashion according to the models of foreign courts and saloons quite a comic side particularly visible at Washington city a sort of high life below stairs business As if any farce could be funnier for instance than the scenes of the crowds winter nights meandering around our Presidents and their wives cabinet officers western or other Senators Representatives c born of good laboring mechanic or farmer stock and antecedents attempting those full dress receptions finesse of parlors foreign ceremonies etiquettes c Indeed consider d with any sense of propriety or any sense at all the whole of this illy play d fashionable play and display with their absorption of the best part of our wealthier citizens time money energies c is ridiculously out of place in the United States As if our proper man and woman far far greater words than gentleman and lady could still fail to see and presently achieve not this spectral business but something truly noble active sane American by modes perfections of character manners costumes social relations c adjusted to standards far far different from those Eminent and liberal foreigners British or continental must at times have their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our New World personalities The shallowest and least American persons seem surest to push abroad and call without fail on well known foreigners who are doubtless affected with indescribable qualms by these queer ones Then more than half of our authors and writers evidently think it a great thing to be aristocratic and sneer at progress democracy revolution et cetera If some international literary snobs gallery were establish d it is certain that America could contribute at least her full share of the portraits and some very distinguish d ones Observe that the most impudent slanders low insults c on the great revolutionary authors leaders poets c of Europe have their origin and main circulation in certain circles here The treatment of Victor Hugo living and Byron dead are samples Both deserving so well of America and both persistently attempted to be soil d here by unclean birds male and female Meanwhile I must still offset the like of the foregoing and all it infers by the recognition of the fact that while the surfaces of current society here show so much that is dismal noisome and vapory there are beyond question inexhaustible supplies as of true gold ore in the mines of America s general humanity Let us not ignoring the dross give fit stress to these precious immortal values also Let it be distinctly admitted that whatever may be said of our fashionable society and of any foul fractions and episodes only here in America out of the long history and manifold presentations of the ages has at last arisen and now stands what never before took positive form and sway the People and that view d en masse and while fully acknowledging deficiencies dangers faults this people inchoate latent not yet come to majority nor to its own religious literary or esthetic expression yet affords to day an exultant justification of all the faith all the hopes and prayers and prophecies of good men through the past the stablest solidest based government of the world the most assured in a future the beaming Pharos to whose perennial light all earnest eyes the world over are tending and that already in and from it the democratic principle having been mortally tried by severest tests fatalities of war and peace now issues from the trial unharm d trebly invigorated perhaps to commence forthwith its finally triumphant march around the globe THE TRAMP AND STRIKE QUESTIONS Part of a Lecture proposed never deliver d Two grim and spectral dangers dangerous to peace to health to social security to progress long known in concrete to the governments of the Old World and there eventuating more than once or twice in dynastic overturns bloodshed days months of terror seem of late years to be nearing the New World nay to be gradually establishing themselves among us What mean these phantoms here I personify them in fictitious shapes but they are very real Is the fresh and broad demesne of America destined also to give them foothold and lodgment permanent domicile Beneath the whole political world what most presses and perplexes to day sending vastest results affecting the future is not the abstract question of democracy but of social and economic organization the treatment of working people by employers and all that goes along with it not only the wages payment part but a certain spirit and principle to vivify anew these relations all the questions of progress strength tariffs finance c really evolving themselves more or less directly out of the Poverty Question the Science of Wealth and a dozen other names are given it but I prefer the severe one just used I will begin by calling the reader s attention to a thought upon the matter which may not have struck you before the wealth of the civilized world as contrasted with its poverty what does it derivatively stand for and represent A rich person ought to have a strong stomach As in Europe the wealth of to day mainly results from and represents the rapine murder outrages treachery hoggishness of hundreds of years ago and onward later so in America after the same token not yet so bad perhaps or at any rate not so palpable we have not existed long enough but we seem to be doing our best to make it up Curious as it may seem it is in what are call d the poorest lowest characters you will sometimes nay generally find glints of the most sublime virtues eligibilities heroisms Then it is doubtful whether the State is to be saved either in the monotonous long run or in tremendous special crises by its good people only When the storm is deadliest and the disease most imminent help often comes from strange quarters the homoeopathic motto you remember cure the bite with a hair of the same dog The American Revolution of seventeen seventy six was simply a great strike successful for its immediate object but whether a real success judged by the scale of the centuries and the long striking balance of Time yet remains to be settled The French Revolution was absolutely a strike and a very terrible and relentless one against ages of bad pay unjust division of wealth products and the hoggish monopoly of a few rolling in superfluity against the vast bulk of the work people living in squalor If the United States like the countries of the Old World are also to grow vast crops of poor desperate dissatisfied nomadic miserably waged populations such as we see looming upon us of late years steadily even if slowly eating into them like a cancer of lungs or stomach then our republican experiment notwithstanding all its surface successes is at heart an unhealthy failure Feb seventy nine I saw to day a sight I had never seen before and it amazed and made me serious three quite good looking American men of respectable personal presence two of them young carrying chiffonier bags on their shoulders and the usual long iron hooks in their hands plodding along their eyes cast down spying for scraps rags bones c DEMOCRACY IN THE NEW WORLD Estimated and summ d up to day having thoroughly justified itself the past hundred years as far as growth vitality and power are concern d by severest and most varied trials of peace and war and having establish d itself for good with all its necessities and benefits for time to come is now to be seriously consider d also in its pronounc d and already developt dangers While the battle was raging and the result suspended all defections and criticisms were to be hush d and everything bent with vehemence unmitigated toward the urge of victory But that victory settled new responsibilities advance I can conceive of no better service in the United States henceforth by democrats of thorough and heart felt faith than boldly exposing the weakness liabilities and infinite corruptions of democracy By the unprecedented opening up of humanity en masse in the United States the last hundred years under our institutions not only the good qualities of the race but just as much the bad ones are prominently brought forward Man is about the same in the main whether with despotism or whether with freedom The ideal form of human society Canon Kingsley declares is democracy A nation and were it even possible a whole world of free men lifting free foreheads to God and Nature calling no man master for One is their master even God knowing and doing their duties toward the Maker of the universe and therefore to each other not from fear nor calculation of profit or loss but because they have seen the beauty of righteousness and trust and peace because the law of God is in their hearts Such a nation such a society what nobler conception of moral existence can we form Would not that indeed be the kingdom of God come on earth To this faith founded in the ideal let us hold and never abandon or lose it Then what a spectacle is practically exhibited by our American democracy to day FOUNDATION STAGES THEN OTHERS Though I think I fully comprehend the absence of moral tone in our current politics and business and the almost entire futility of absolute and simple honor as a counterpoise against the enormous greed for worldly wealth with the trickeries of gaining it all through society our day I still do not share the depression and despair on the subject which I find possessing many good people The advent of America the history of the past century has been the first general aperture and opening up to the average human commonalty on the broadest scale of the eligibilities to wealth and worldly success and eminence and has been fully taken advantage of and the example has spread hence in ripples to all nations To these eligibilities to this limitless aperture the race has tended en masse roaring and rushing and crude and fiercely turbidly hastening and we have seen the first stages and are now in the midst of the result of it all so far But there will certainly ensue other stages and entirely different ones In nothing is there more evolution than the American mind Soon it will be fully realized that ostensible wealth and money making show luxury c imperatively necessitate something beyond namely the sane eternal moral and spiritual esthetic attributes elements We cannot have even that realization on any less terms than the price we are now paying for it Soon it will be understood clearly that the State cannot flourish nay cannot exist without those elements They will gradually enter into the chyle of sociology and literature They will finally make the blood and brawn of the best American individualities of both sexes and thus with them to a certainty through these very processes of to day dominate the New World GENERAL SUFFRAGE ELECTIONS et cetera It still remains doubtful to me whether these will ever secure officially the best wit and capacity whether through them the first class genius of America will ever personally appear in the high political stations the Presidency Congress the leading State offices c Those offices or the candidacy for them arranged won by caucusing money the favoritism or pecuniary interest of rings the superior manipulation of the ins over the outs or the outs over the ins are indeed at best the mere business agencies of the people are useful as formulating neither the best and highest but the average of the public judgment sense justice or sometimes want of judgment sense justice We elect Presidents Congressmen c not so much to have them consider and decide for us but as surest practical means of expressing the will of majorities on mooted questions measures c As to general suffrage after all since we have gone so far the more general it is the better I favor the widest opening of the doors Let the ventilation and area be wide enough and all is safe We can never have a born penitentiary bird or panel thief or lowest gambling hell or groggery keeper for President though such may not only emulate but get high offices from localities even from the proud and wealthy city of New York WHO GETS THE PLUNDER The protectionists are fond of flashing to the public eye the glittering delusion of great money results from manufactures mines artificial exports so many millions from this source and so many from that such a seductive unanswerable show an immense revenue of annual cash from iron cotton woollen leather goods and a hundred other things all bolstered up by protection But the really important point of all is into whose pockets does this plunder really go It would be some excuse and satisfaction if even a fair proportion of it went to the masses of laboring men resulting in homesteads to such men women children myriads of actual homes in fee simple in every State not the false glamour of the stunning wealth reported in the census in the statistics or tables in the newspapers but a fair division and generous average to those workmen and workwomen that would be something But the fact itself is nothing of the kind The profits of protection go altogether to a few score select persons who by favors of Congress State legislatures the banks and other special advantages are forming a vulgar aristocracy full as bad as anything in the British or European castes of blood or the dynasties there of the past As Sismondi pointed out the true prosperity of a nation is not in the great wealth of a special class but is only to be really attain d in having the bulk of the people provided with homes or land in fee simple This may not be the best show but it is the best reality FRIENDSHIP THE REAL ARTICLE Though Nature maintains and must prevail there will always be plenty of people and good people who cannot or think they cannot see anything in that last wisest most envelop d of proverbs Friendship rules the World Modern society in its largest vein is essentially intellectual infidelistic secretly admires and depends most on pure compulsion or science its rule and sovereignty is in short in cultivated quarters deeply Napoleonic Friendship said Bonaparte in one of his lightning flashes of candid garrulity Friendship is but a name I love no one not even my brothers Joseph perhaps a little Still if I do love him it is from habit because he is the eldest of us Duroc Ay him if any one I love in a sort but why He suits me he is cool undemonstrative unfeeling has no weak affections never embraces any one never weeps I am not sure but the same analogy is to be applied in cases often seen where with an extra development and acuteness of the intellectual faculties there is a mark d absence of the spiritual affectional and sometimes though more rarely the highest esthetic and moral elements of cognition LACKS AND WANTS YET Of most foreign countries small or large from the remotest times known down to our own each has contributed after its kind directly or indirectly at least one great undying song to help vitalize and increase the valor wisdom and elegance of humanity from the points of view attain d by it up to date The stupendous epics of India the holy Bible itself the Homeric canticles the Nibelungen the Cid Campeador the Inferno Shakspere s dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords Burns s songs Goethe s in Germany Tennyson s poems in England Victor Hugo s in France and many more are the widely various yet integral signs or land marks in certain respects the highest set up by the human mind and soul beyond science invention political amelioration c narrating in subtlest best ways the long long routes of history and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate humanity and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied civilizations Where is America s art rendering in any thing like the spirit worthy of herself and the modern to these characteristic immortal monuments So far our Democratic society estimating its various strata in the mass as one possesses nothing nor have we contributed any characteristic music the finest tie of nationality to make up for that glowing blood throbbing religious social emotional artistic indefinable indescribably beautiful charm and hold which fused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together in their wonderful interpenetration in Europe and Asia of love belief and loyalty running one way like a living weft and picturesque responsibility duty and blessedness running like a warp the other way In the Southern States under slavery much of the same In coincidence and as things now exist in the States what is more terrible more alarming than the total want of any such fusion and mutuality of love belief and rapport of interest between the comparatively few successful rich and the great masses of the unsuccessful the poor As a mixed political and social question is not this full of dark significance Is it not worth considering as a problem and puzzle in our democracy an indispensable want to be supplied RULERS STRICTLY OUT OF THE MASSES In the talk which I welcome about the need of men of training thoroughly school d and experienced men for statesmen I would present the following as an offset It was written by me twenty years ago and has been curiously verified since I say no body of men are fit to make Presidents Judges and Generals unless they themselves supply the best specimens of the same and that supplying one or two such specimens illuminates the whole body for a thousand years I expect to see the day when the like of the present personnel of the governments Federal State municipal military and naval will be look d upon with derision and when qualified mechanics and young men will reach Congress and other official stations sent in their working costumes fresh from their benches and tools and returning to them again with dignity The young fellows must prepare to do credit to this destiny for the stuff is in them Nothing gives place recollect and never ought to give place except to its clean superiors There is more rude and undevelopt bravery friendship conscientiousness clear sightedness and practical genius for any scope of action even the broadest and highest now among the American mechanics and young men than in all the official persons in these States legislative executive judicial military and naval and more than among all the literary persons I would be much pleas d to see some heroic shrewd fully inform d healthy bodied middle aged beard faced American blacksmith or boatman come down from the West across the Alleghanies and walk into the Presidency dress d in a clean suit of working attire and with the tan all over his face breast and arms I would certainly vote for that sort of man possessing the due requirements before any other candidate The facts of rank and file workingmen mechanics Lincoln Johnson Grant Garfield brought forward from the masses and placed in the Presidency and swaying its mighty powers with firm hand really with more sway than any king in history and with better capacity in using that sway can we not see that these facts have bearings far far beyond their political or party ones MONUMENTS THE PAST AND PRESENT If you go to Europe to say nothing of Asia more ancient and massive still you cannot stir without meeting venerable mementos cathedrals ruins of temples castles monuments of the great statues and paintings far far beyond anything America can ever expect to produce haunts of heroes long dead saints poets divinities with deepest associations of ages But here in the New World while those we can never emulate we have more than those to build and far more greatly to build I am not sure but the day for conventional monuments statues memorials c has pass d away and that they are henceforth superfluous and vulgar An enlarg d general superior humanity partly indeed resulting from those we are to build European Asiatic greatness are in the past Vaster and subtler America combining justifying the past yet works for a grander future in living democratic forms Here too are indicated the paths for our national bards Other times other lands have had their missions Art War Ecclesiasticism Literature Discovery Trade Architecture c c but that grand future is the enclosing purport of the United States LITTLE OR NOTHING NEW AFTER ALL How small were the best thoughts poems conclusions except for a certain invariable resemblance and uniform standard in the final thoughts theology poems c of all nations all civilizations all centuries and times Those precious legacies accumulations They come to us from the far off from all eras and all lands from Egypt and India and Greece and Rome and along through the middle and later ages in the grand monarchies of Europe born under far different institutes and conditions from ours but out of the insight and inspiration of the same old humanity the same old heart and brain the same old countenance yearningly pensively looking forth What we have to do to day is to receive them cheerfully and to give them ensemble and a modern American and democratic physiognomy A LINCOLN REMINISCENCE As is well known story telling was often with President Lincoln a weapon which he employ d with great skill Very often he could not give a point blank reply or comment and these indirections sometimes funny but not always so were probably the best responses possible In the gloomiest period of the war he had a call from a large delegation of bank presidents In the talk after business was settled one of the big Dons asked mister Lincoln if his confidence in the permanency of the Union was not beginning to be shaken whereupon the homely President told a little story When I was a young man in Illinois said he I boarded for a time with a deacon of the Presbyterian church One night I was roused from my sleep by a rap at the door and I heard the deacon s voice exclaiming Arise Abraham the day of judgment has come I sprang from my bed and rushed to the window and saw the stars falling in great showers but looking back of them in the heavens I saw the grand old constellations with which I was so well acquainted fixed and true in their places Gentlemen the world did not come to an end then nor will the Union now FREEDOM It is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand Freedom but I sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands it The whole Universe is absolute Law Freedom only opens entire activity and license under the law To the degraded or undevelopt and even to too many others the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping from law which of course is impossible More precious than all worldly riches is Freedom freedom from the painful constipation and poor narrowness of ecclesiasticism freedom in manners habiliments furniture from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions entire freedom from party rings and mere conventions in Politics and better than all a general freedom of One s Self from the tyrannic domination of vices habits appetites under which nearly every man of us often the greatest brawler for freedom is enslav d Can we attain such enfranchisement the true Democracy and the height of it While we are from birth to death the subjects of irresistible law enclosing every movement and minute we yet escape by a paradox into true free will Strange as it may seem we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of and implicit obedience to Law Great unspeakably great is the Will the free Soul of man At its greatest understanding and obeying the laws it can then and then only maintain true liberty For there is to the highest that law as absolute as any more absolute than any the Law of Liberty The shallow as intimated consider liberty a release from all law from every constraint The wise see in it on the contrary the potent Law of Laws namely the fusion and combination of the conscious will or partial individual law with those universal eternal unconscious ones which run through all Time pervade history prove immortality give moral purpose to the entire objective world and the last dignity to human life BOOK CLASSES AMERICA S LITERATURE For certain purposes literary productions through all the recorded ages may be roughly divided into two classes The first consisting of only a score or two perhaps less of typical primal representative works different from any before and embodying in themselves their own main laws and reasons for being Then the second class books and writings innumerable incessant to be briefly described as radiations or offshoots or more or less imitations of the first The works of the first class as said have their own laws and may indeed be described as making those laws and amenable only to them The sharp warning of Margaret Fuller unquell d for thirty years yet sounds in the air It does not follow that because the United States print and read more books magazines and newspapers than all the rest of the world that they really have therefore a literature OUR REAL CULMINATION The final culmination of this vast and varied Republic will be the production and perennial establishment of millions of comfortable city homesteads and moderate sized farms healthy and independent single separate ownership fee simple life in them complete but cheap within reach of all Exceptional wealth splendor countless manufactures excess of exports immense capital and capitalists the five dollar a day hotels well fill d artificial improvements even books colleges and the suffrage all in many respects in themselves hard as it is to say so and sharp as a surgeon s lance form more or less a sort of anti democratic disease and monstrosity except as they contribute by curious indirections to that culmination seem to me mainly of value or worth consideration only with reference to it There is a subtle something in the common

policy as a member of associations societies brotherhoods or what not and one s obligations to the State and Nation with essential freedom as an individual personality without which freedom a man cannot grow or expand or be full modern heroic democratic American With all the necessities and benefits of association and the world cannot get along without it the true nobility and satisfaction of a man consist in his thinking and acting for himself The problem I say is to combine the two so as not to ignore either THE LAST COLLECTIVE COMPACTION I like well our polyglot construction stamp and

school one morning when the studies of the earlier part of the day were about half completed It was well understood that this was a command for silence and attention and when these had been obtained the master spoke He was a low thick set man and his name was Lugare Boys said he I have had a complaint enter d that last night some of you were stealing fruit from mister Nichols s garden I rather think I know the thief Tim Barker step up here sir The one to whom he spoke came forward He was a slight fair looking boy of about thirteen and his face had a laughing good humor d expression which even the charge now preferr d against him and the stern tone and threatening look of the teacher had not entirely dissipated The countenance of the boy however was too unearthly fair for health it had notwithstanding its fleshy cheerful look a singular cast as if some inward disease and that a fearful one were seated within As the stripling stood before that place of judgment that place so often made the scene of heartless and coarse brutality of timid innocence confused helpless child hood outraged and gentle feelings crush d Lugare looked on him with a frown which plainly told that he felt in no very pleasant mood Happily a worthier and more philosophical system is proving to men that schools can be better govern d than by lashes and tears and sighs We are waxing toward that consummation when one of the old fashion d school masters with his cowhide his heavy birch rod and his many ingenious methods of child torture will be gazed upon as a scorn d memento of an ignorant cruel and exploded doctrine May propitious gales speed that day Were you by mister Nichols s garden fence last night said Lugare Yes sir answer d the boy I was Well sir I m glad to find you so ready with your confession And so you thought you could do a little robbing and enjoy yourself in a manner you ought to be ashamed to own without being punish d did you I have not been robbing replied the boy quickly His face was suffused whether with resentment or fright it was difficult to tell And I didn t do anything last night that I am ashamed to own No impudence exclaim d the teacher passionately as he grasp d a long and heavy ratan give me none of your sharp speeches or I ll thrash you till you beg like a dog The youngster s face paled a little his lip quiver d but he did not speak And pray sir continued Lugare as the outward signs of wrath disappear d from his features what were you about the garden for Perhaps you only receiv d the plunder and had an accomplice to do the more dangerous part of the job I went that way because it is on my road home I was there again afterwards to meet an acquaintance and and But I did not go into the garden nor take anything away from it I would not steal hardly to save myself from starving You had better have stuck to that last evening You were seen Tim Barker to come from under mister Nichols s garden fence a little after nine o clock with a bag full of something or other over your shoulders The bag had every appearance of being filled with fruit and this morning the melon beds are found to have been completely clear d Now sir what was there in that bag Like fire itself glow d the face of the detected lad He spoke not a word All the school had their eyes directed at him The perspiration ran down his white forehead like rain drops Speak sir exclaimed Lugare with a loud strike of his ratan on the desk The boy look d as though he would faint But the unmerciful teacher confident of having brought to light a criminal and exulting in the idea of the severe chastisement he should now be justified in inflicting kept working himself up to a still greater and greater degree of passion In the meantime the child seem d hardly to know what to do with himself His tongue cleav d to the roof of his mouth Either he was very much frighten d or he was actually unwell Speak I say again thunder d Lugare and his hand grasping his ratan tower d above his head in a very significant manner I hardly can sir said the poor fellow faintly His voice was husky and thick I will tell you some some other time Please let me go to my seat I a n t well Oh yes that s very likely and mister Lugare bulged out his nose and cheeks with contempt Do you think to make me believe your lies I ve found you out sir plainly enough and I am satisfied that you are as precious a little villain as there is in the State But I will postpone settling with you for an hour yet I shall then call you up again and if you don t tell the whole truth then I will give you something that ll make you remember mister Nichols s melons for many a month to come go to your seat Glad enough of the ungracious permission and answering not a sound the child crept tremblingly to his bench He felt very strangely dizzily more as if he was in a dream than in real life and laying his arms on his desk bow d down his face between them The pupils turn d to their accustom d studies for during the reign of Lugare in the village school they had been so used to scenes of violence and severe chastisement that such things made but little interruption in the tenor of their way Now while the intervening hour is passing we will clear up the mystery of the bag and of young Barker being under the garden fence on the preceding night The boy s mother was a widow and they both had to live in the very narrowest limits His father had died when he was six years old and little Tim was left a sickly emaciated infant whom no one expected to live many months To the surprise of all however the poor child kept alive and seem d to recover his health as he certainly did his size and good looks This was owing to the kind offices of an eminent physician who had a country seat in the neighborhood and who had been interested in the widow s little family Tim the physician said might possibly outgrow his disease but everything was uncertain It was a mysterious and baffling malady and it would not be wonderful if he should in some moment of apparent health be suddenly taken away The poor widow was at first in a continual state of uneasiness but several years had now pass d and none of the impending evils had fallen upon the boy s head His mother seem d to feel confident that he would live and be a help and an honor to her old age and the two struggled on together mutually happy in each other and enduring much of poverty and discomfort without repining each for the other s sake Tim s pleasant disposition had made him many friends in the village and among the rest a young fanner named Jones who with his elder brother work d a large farm in the neighborhood on shares Jones very frequently made Tim a present of a bag of potatoes or corn or some garden vegetables which he took from his own stock but as his partner was a parsimonious high tempered man and had often said that Tim was an idle fellow and ought not to be help d because he did not work Jones generally made his gifts in such a manner that no one knew anything about them except himself and the grateful objects of his kindness It might be too that the widow was both to have it understood by the neighbors that she received food from anyone for there is often an excusable pride in people of her condition which makes them shrink from being consider d as objects of charity as they would from the severest pains On the night in question Tim had been told that Jones would send them a bag of potatoes and the place at which they were to be waiting for him was fixed at mister Nichols s garden fence It was this bag that Tim had been seen staggering under and which caused the unlucky boy to be accused and convicted by his teacher as a thief That teacher was one little fitted for his important and responsible office Hasty to decide and inflexibly severe he was the terror of the little world he ruled so despotically Punishment he seemed to delight in Knowing little of those sweet fountains which in children s breasts ever open quickly at the call of gentleness and kind words he was fear d by all for his sternness and loved by none I would that he were an isolated instance in his profession The hour of grace had drawn to its close and the time approach d at which it was usual for Lugare to give his school a joyfully receiv d dismission Now and then one of the scholars would direct a furtive glance at Tim sometimes in pity sometimes in indifference or inquiry They knew that he would have no mercy shown him and though most of them loved him whipping was too common there to exact much sympathy Every inquiring glance however remain d unsatisfied for at the end of the hour Tim remain d with his face completely hidden and his head bow d in his arms precisely as he had lean d himself when he first went to his seat Lugare look d at the boy occasionally with a scowl which seem d to bode vengeance for his sullenness At length the last class had been heard and the last lesson recited and Lugare seated himself behind his desk on the platform with his longest and stoutest ratan before him Now Barker he said we ll settle that little business of yours Just step up here Tim did not move The school room was as still as the grave Not a sound was to be heard except occasionally a long drawn breath Mind me sir or it will be the worse for you Step up here and take off your jacket The boy did not stir any more than if he had been of wood Lugare shook with passion He sat still a minute as if considering the best way to wreak his vengeance That minute passed in death like silence was a fearful one to some of the children for their faces whiten d with fright It seem d as it slowly dropp d away like the minute which precedes the climax of an exquisitely performed tragedy when some mighty master of the histrionic art is treading the stage and you and the multitude around you are waiting with stretch d nerves and suspended breath in expectation of the terrible catastrophe Tim is asleep sir at length said one of the boys who sat near him Lugare at this intelligence allow d his features to relax from their expression of savage anger into a smile but that smile look d more malignant if possible than his former scowls It might be that he felt amused at the horror depicted on the faces of those about him or it might be that he was gloating in pleasure on the way in which he intended to wake the slumberer Asleep are you my young gentleman said he let us see if we can t find something to tickle your eyes open There s nothing like making the best of a bad case boys Tim here is determin d not to be worried in his mind about a little flogging for the thought of it can t even keep the little scoundrel awake Lugare smiled again as he made the last observation He grasp d his ratan firmly and descended from his seat With light and stealthy steps he cross d the room and stood by the unlucky sleeper The boy was still as unconscious of his impending punishment as ever He might be dreaming some golden dream of youth and pleasure perhaps he was far away in the world of fancy seeing scenes and feeling delights which cold reality never can bestow Lugare lifted his ratan high over his head and with the true and expert aim which he had acquired by long practice brought it down on Tim s back with a force and whacking sound which seem d sufficient to wake a freezing man in his last lethargy Quick and fast blow foliow d blow Without waiting to see the effect of the first cut the brutal wretch plied his instrument of torture first on one side of the boy s back and then on the other and only stopped at the end of two or three minutes from very weariness But still Tim show d no signs of motion and as Lugare provoked at his torpidity jerk d away one of the child s arms on which he had been leaning over the desk his head dropp d down on the board with a dull sound and his face lay turn d up and exposed to view When Lugare saw it he stood like one transfix d by a basilisk His countenance turn d to a leaden whiteness the ratan dropp d from his grasp and his eyes stretch d wide open glared as at some monstrous spectacle of horror and death The sweat started in great globules seemingly from every pore in his face his skinny lips contracted and show d his teeth and when he at length stretch d forth his arm and with the end of one of his fingers touch d the child s cheek each limb quiver d like the tongue of a snake and his strength seemed as though it would momentarily fail him The boy was dead He had probably been so for some time for his eyes were turn d up and his body was quite cold Death was in the school room and Lugare had been flogging A CORPSE Democratic Review August eighteen forty one ONE WICKED IMPULSE That section of Nassau street which runs into the great mart of New York brokers and stock jobbers has for a long time been much occupied by practitioners of the law Tolerably well known amid this class some years since was Adam Covert a middle aged man of rather limited means who to tell the truth gained more by trickery than he did in the legitimate and honorable exercise of his profession He was a tall bilious faced widower the father of two children and had lately been seeking to better his fortunes by a rich marriage But somehow or other his wooing did not seem to thrive well and with perhaps one exception the lawyer s prospects in the matrimonial way were hopelessly gloomy Among the early clients of mister Covert had been a distant relative named Marsh who dying somewhat suddenly left his son and daughter and some little property to the care of Covert under a will drawn out by that gentleman himself At no time caught without his eyes open the cunning lawyer aided by much sad confusion in the emergency which had caused his services to be called for and disguising his object under a cloud of technicalities inserted provisions in the will giving himself an almost arbitrary control over the property and over those for whom it was designed This control was even made to extend beyond the time when the children would arrive at mature age The son Philip a spirited and high temper d fellow had some time since pass d that age Esther the girl a plain and somewhat devotional young woman was in her nineteenth year Having such power over his wards Covert did not scruple openly to use his advantage in pressing his claims as a suitor for Esther s hand Since the death of Marsh the property he left which had been in real estate and was to be divided equally between the brother and sister had risen to very considerable value and Esther s share was to a man in Covert s situation a prize very well worth seeking All this time while really owning a respectable income the young orphans often felt the want of the smallest sum of money and Esther on Philip s account was more than once driven to various contrivances the pawn shop sales of her own little luxuries and the like to furnish him with means Though she had frequently shown her guardian unequivocal evidence of her aversion Esther continued to suffer from his persecutions until one day he proceeded farther and was more pressing than usual She possess d some of her brother s mettlesome temper and gave him an abrupt and most decided refusal With dignity she exposed the baseness of his conduct and forbade him ever again mentioning marriage to her He retorted bitterly vaunted his hold on her and Philip and swore an oath that unless she became his wife they should both thenceforward become penniless Losing his habitual self control in his exasperation he even added insults such as woman never receives from any one deserving the name of man and at his own convenience left the house That day Philip return d to New York after an absence of several weeks on the business of a mercantile house in whose employment he had lately engaged Toward the latter part of the same afternoon mister Covert was sitting in his office in Nassau street busily at work when a knock at the door announc d a visitor and directly afterward young Marsh enter d the room His face exhibited a peculiar pallid appearance that did not strike Covert at all agreeably and he call d his clerk from an adjoining room and gave him something to do at a desk near by I wish to see you alone mister Covert if convenient said the newcomer We can talk quite well enough where we are answer d the lawyer indeed I don t know that I have any leisure to talk at all for just now I am very much press d with business But I must speak to you rejoined Philip sternly at least I must say one thing and that is mister Covert that you are a villain Insolent exclaimed the lawyer rising behind the table and pointing to the door Do you see that sir Let one minute longer find you the other side or your feet may reach the landing by quicker method Begone sir Such a threat was the more harsh to Philip for he had rather high strung feelings of honor He grew almost livid with suppress d agitation I will see you again very soon said he in a low but distinct manner his lips trembling as he spoke and left the office The incidents of the rest of that pleasant summer day left little impression on the young man s mind He roam d to and fro without any object or destination Along South street and by Whitehall he watch d with curious eyes the movements of the shipping and the loading and unloading of cargoes and listen d to the merry heave yo of the sailors and stevedores There are some minds upon which great excitement produces the singular effect of uniting two utterly inconsistent faculties a sort of cold apathy and a sharp sensitiveness to all that is going on at the same time Philip s was one of this sort he noticed the various differences in the apparel of a gang of wharf laborers turn d over in his brain whether they receiv d wages enough to keep them comfortable and their families also and if they had families or not which he tried to tell by their looks In such petty reflections the daylight passed away And all the while the master wish of Philip s thoughts was a desire to see the lawyer Covert For what purpose he himself was by no means clear Nightfall came at last Still however the young man did not direct his steps homeward He felt more calm however and entering an eating house order d something for his supper which when it was brought to him he merely tasted and stroll d forth again There was a kind of gnawing sensation of thirst within him yet and as he pass d a hotel he bethought him that one little glass of spirits would perhaps be just the thing He drank and hour after hour wore away unconsciously he drank not one glass but three or four and strong glasses they were to him for he was habitually abstemious It had been a hot day and evening and when Philip at an advanced period of the night emerged from the bar room into the street he found that a thunderstorm had just commenced He resolutely walk d on however although at every step it grew more and more blustering The rain now pour d down a cataract the shops were all shut few of the street lamps were lighted and there was little except the frequent flashes of lightning to show him his way When about half the length of Chatham street which lay in the direction he had to take the momentary fury of the tempest forced him to turn aside into a sort of shelter form d by the corners of the deep entrance to a Jew pawnbroker s shop there He had hardly drawn himself in as closely as possible when the lightning revealed to him that the opposite corner of the nook was tenanted also A sharp rain this said the other occupant who simultaneously beheld Philip The voice sounded to the young man s ears a note which almost made him sober again It was certainly the voice of Adam Covert He made some commonplace reply and waited for another flash of lightning to show him the stranger s face It came and he saw that his companion was indeed his guardian Philip Marsh had drank deeply let us plead all that may be possible to you stern moralist Upon his mind came swarming and he could not drive them away thoughts of all those insults his sister had told him of and the bitter words Covert had spoken to her he reflected too on the injuries Esther as well as himself had receiv d and were still likely to receive at the hands of that bold bad man how mean selfish and unprincipled was his character what base and cruel advantages he had taken of many poor people entangled in his power and of how much wrong and suffering he had been the author and might be again through future years The very turmoil of the elements the harsh roll of the thunder the vindictive beating of the rain and the fierce glare of the wild fluid that seem d to riot in the ferocity of the storm around him kindled a strange sympathetic fury in the young man s mind Heaven itself so deranged were his imaginations appear d to have provided a fitting scene and time for a deed of retribution which to his disorder d passion half wore the semblance of a divine justice He remember d not the ready solution to be found in Covert s pressure of business which had no doubt kept him later than usual but fancied some mysterious intent in the ordaining that he should be there and that they two should meet at that untimely hour All this whirl of influence came over Philip with startling quickness at that horrid moment He stepp d to the side of his guardian Ho said he have we met so soon mister Covert You traitor to my dead father robber of his children I fear to think on what I think now The lawyer s natural effrontery did not desert him Unless you d like to spend a night in the watch house young gentleman said he after a short pause move on Your father was a weak man I remember as for his son his own wicked heart is his worst foe I have never done wrong to either that I can say and swear it Insolent liar exclaimed Philip his eye flashing out sparks of fire in the darkness Covert made no reply except a cool contemptuous laugh which stung the excited young man to double fury He sprang upon the lawyer and clutch d him by the neckcloth Take it then he cried hoarsely for his throat was impeded by the fiendish rage which in that black hour possess d him You are not fit to live He dragg d his guardian to the earth and fell crushingly upon him choking the shriek the poor victim but just began to utter Then with monstrous imprecations he twisted a tight knot around the gasping creature s neck drew a clasp knife from his pocket and touching the spring the long sharp blade too eager for its bloody work flew open During the lull of the storm the last strength of the prostrate man burst forth into one short loud cry of agony At the same instant the arm of the murderer thrust the blade once twice thrice deep in his enemy s bosom Not a minute had passed since that fatal exasperating laugh but the deed was done and the instinctive thought which came at once to the guilty one was a thought of fear and escape In the unearthly pause which follow d Philip s eyes gave one long searching sweep in every direction above and around him Above God of the all seeing eye What and who was that figure there Forbear In Jehovah s name forbear cried a shrill but clear and melodious voice It was as if some accusing spirit had come down to bear witness against the deed of blood Leaning far out of an open window appear d a white draperied shape its face possess d of a wonderful youthful beauty Long vivid glows of lightning gave Philip a full opportunity to see as clearly as though the sun had been shining at noonday One hand of the figure was raised upward in a deprecating attitude and his large bright black eyes bent down upon the scene below with an expression of horror and shrinking pain Such heavenly looks and the peculiar circumstance of the time fill d Philip s heart with awe Oh if it is not yet too late spoke the youth again spare him In God s voice I command Thou shalt do no murder The words rang like a knell in the ear of the terror stricken and already remorseful Philip Springing from the body he gave a second glance up and down the walk which was totally lonesome and deserted then crossing into Reade street he made his fearful way in a half state of stupor half bewilderment by the nearest avenues to his home When the corpse of the murder d lawyer was found in the morning and the officers of justice commenced their inquiry suspicion immediately fell upon Philip and he was arrested The most rigorous search however brought to light nothing at all implicating the young man except his visit to Covert s office the evening before and his angry language there That was by no means enough to fix so heavy a charge upon him The second day afterward the whole business came before the ordinary judicial tribunal in order that Philip might be either committed for the crime or discharged The testimony of mister Covert s clerk stood alone One of his employers who believing in his innocence had deserted him not in this crisis had provided him with the ablest criminal counsel in New York The proof was declared entirely insufficient and Philip was discharged The crowded court room made way for him as he came out hundreds of curious looks fixed upon his features and many a jibe pass d upon him But of all that arena of human faces he saw only one a sad pale black eyed one cowering in the centre of the rest He had seen that face twice before the first time as a warning spectre the second time in prison immediately after his arrest now for the last time This young stranger the son of a scorn d race coming to the court room to perform an unhappy duty with the intention of testifying to what he had seen melted at the sight of Philip s bloodless cheek and of his sister s convulsive sobs and forbore witnessing against the murderer Shall we applaud or condemn him Let every reader answer the question for himself That afternoon Philip left New York His friendly employer own d a small farm some miles up the Hudson and until the excitement of the affair was over he advised the young man to go thither Philip thankfully accepted the proposal made a few preparations took a hurried leave of Esther and by nightfall was settled in his new abode And how think you rested Philip Marsh that night Rested indeed O if those who clamor so much for the halter and the scaffold to punish crime could have seen that sight they might have learn d a lesson then Four days had elapsed since he that lay tossing upon the bed there had slumber d Not the slightest intermission had come to his awaken d and tensely strung sense during those frightful days Disturb d waking dreams came to him as he thought what he might do to gain his lost peace Far far away would he go The cold roll of the murder d man s eye as it turn d up its last glance into his face the shrill exclamation of pain all the unearthly vividness of the posture motions and looks of the dead the warning voice from above pursued him like tormenting furies and were never absent from his mind asleep or awake that long weary night Anything any place to escape such horrid companionship He would travel inland hire himself to do hard drudgery upon some farm work incessantly through the wide summer days and thus force nature to bestow oblivion upon his senses at least a little while now and then He would fly on on on until amid different scenes and a new life the old memories were rubb d entirely out He would fight bravely in himself for peace of mind For peace he would labor and struggle for peace he would pray At length after a feverish slumber of some thirty or forty minutes the unhappy youth waking with a nervous start rais d himself in bed and saw the blessed daylight beginning to dawn He felt the sweat trickling down his naked breast the sheet where he had lain was quite wet with it Dragging himself wearily he open d the window Ah that good morning air how it refresh d him how he lean d out and drank in the fragrance of the blossoms below and almost for the first time in his life felt how beautifully indeed God had made the earth and that there was wonderful sweetness in mere existence And amidst the thousand mute mouths and eloquent eyes which appear d as it were to look up and speak in every direction he fancied so many invitations to come among them Not without effort for he was very weak he dress d himself and issued forth into the open air Clouds of pale gold and transparent crimson draperied the eastern sky but the sun whose face gladden d them into all that glory was not yet above the horizon It was a time and place of such rare such Eden like beauty Philip paused at the summit of an upward slope and gazed around him Some few miles off he could see a gleam of the Hudson river and above it a spur of those rugged cliffs scatter d along its western shores Nearer by were cultivated fields The clover grew richly there the young grain bent to the early breeze and the air was filled with an intoxicating perfume At his side was the large well kept garden of his host in which were many pretty flowers grass plots and a wide avenue of noble trees As Philip gazed the holy calming power of Nature the invisible spirit of so much beauty and so much innocence melted into his soul The disturb d passions and the feverish conflict subsided He even felt something like envied peace of mind a sort of joy even in the presence of all the unmarr d goodness It was as fair to him guilty though he had been as to the purest of the pure No accusing frowns show d in the face of the flowers or in the green shrubs or the branches of the trees They more forgiving than mankind and distinguishing not between the children of darkness and the children of light they at least treated him with gentleness Was he then a being so accurs d Involuntarily he bent over a branch of red roses and took them softly between his hands those murderous bloody hands But the red roses neither wither d nor smell d less fragiant And as the young man kiss d them and dropp d a tear upon them it seem d to him that he had found pity and sympathy from Heaven itself Though against all the rules of story writing we continue our narrative of these mainly true incidents for such they are no further Only to say that the murderer soon departed for a new field of action that he is still living and that this is but one of thousands of cases of unravel d unpunish d crime left not to the tribunals of man but to a wider power and judgment THE LAST LOYALIST She came to me last night The floor gave back no tread The story I am going to tell is a traditional reminiscence of a country place in my rambles about which I have often passed the house now unoccupied and mostly in ruins that was the scene of the transaction I cannot of course convey to others that particular kind of influence which is derived from my being so familiar with the locality and with the very people whose grandfathers or fathers were contemporaries of the actors in the drama I shall transcribe I must hardly expect therefore that to those who hear it thro the medium of my pen the narration will possess as life like and interesting a character as it does to myself On a large and fertile neck of land that juts out in the Sound stretching to the east of New York city there stood in the latter part of the last century an old fashion d country residence It had been built by one of the first settlers of this section of the New World and its occupant was originally owner of the extensive tract lying adjacent to his house and pushing into the bosom of the salt waters It was during the troubled times which mark d our American Revolution that the incidents occurr d which are the foundation of my story Some time before the commencement of the war the owner whom I shall call Vanhome was taken sick and died For some time before his death he had lived a widower and his only child a lad of ten years old was thus left an orphan By his father s will this child was placed implicitly under the guardianship of an uncle a middle aged man who had been of late a resident in the family His care and interest however were needed but a little while not two years claps d after the parents were laid away to their last repose before another grave had to be prepared for the son the child who had been so haplessly deprived of their fostering care The period now arrived when the great national convulsion burst forth Sounds of strife and the clash of arms and the angry voices of disputants were borne along by the air and week after week grew to still louder clamor Families were divided adherents to the crown and ardent upholders of the rebellion were often found in the bosom of the same domestic circle Vanhome the uncle spoken of as guardian to the young heir was a man who lean d to the stern the high handed and the severe He soon became known among the most energetic of the loyalists So decided were his sentiments that leaving the estate which he had inherited from his brother and nephew he join d the forces of the British king Thenceforward whenever his old neighbors heard of him it was as being engaged in the cruelest outrages the boldest inroads or the most determin d attacks upon the army of his countrymen or their peaceful settlements Eight years brought the rebel States and their leaders to that glorious epoch when the last remnant of a monarch s rule was to leave their shores when the last waving of the royal standard was to flutter as it should be haul d down from the staff and its place fill d by the proud testimonial of our warriors success Pleasantly over the autumn fields shone the November sun when a horseman of somewhat military look plodded slowly along the road that led to the old Vanhome farmhouse There was nothing peculiar in his attire unless it might be a red scarf which he wore tied round his waist He was a dark featured sullen eyed man and as his glance was thrown restlessly to the right and left his whole manner appear d to be that of a person moving amid familiar and accustom d scenes Occasionally he stopp d and looking long and steadily at some object that attracted his attention mutter d to himself like one in whose breast busy thoughts were moving His course was evidently to the homestead itself at which in due time he arrived He dismounted led his horse to the stables and then without knocking though there were evident signs of occupancy around the building the traveler made his entrance as composedly and boldly as though he were master of the whole establishment Now the house being in a measure deserted for many years and the successful termination of the strife rendering it probable that the Vanhome estate would be confiscated to the new government an aged poverty stricken couple had been encouraged by the neighbors to take possession as tenants of the place Their name was Gills and these people the traveler found upon his entrance were likely to be his host and hostess Holding their right as they did by so slight a tenure they ventur d to offer no opposition when the stranger signified his intention of passing several hours there The day wore on and the sun went down in the west still the interloper gloomy and taciturn made no signs of departing But as the evening advanced whether the darkness was congenial to his sombre thoughts or whether it merely chanced so he seem d to grow more affable and communicative and informed Gills that he should pass the night there tendering him at the same time ample remuneration which the latter accepted with many thanks Tell me said he to his aged host when they were all sitting around the ample hearth at the conclusion of their evening meal tell me something to while away the hours Ah sir answered Gills this is no place for new or interesting events We live here from year to year and at the end of one we find ourselves at about the same place which we filled in the beginning Can you relate nothing then rejoin d the guest and a singular smile pass d over his features can you say nothing about your own place this house or its former inhabitants or former history The old man glanced across to his wife and a look expressive of sympathetic feeling started in the face of each It is an unfortunate story sir said Gills and may cast a chill upon you instead of the pleasant feeling which it would be best to foster when in strange walls Strange walls echoed he of the red scarf and for the first time since his arrival he half laughed but it was not the laugh which comes from a man s heart You must know sir continued Gills I am myself a sort of intruder here The Vanhomes that was the name of the former residents and owners I have never seen for when I came to these parts the last occupant had left to join the red coat soldiery I am told that he is to sail with them for foreign lands now that the war is ended and his property almost certain to pass into other hands As the old man went on the stranger cast down his eyes and listen d with an appearance of great interest though a transient smile or a brightening of the eye would occasionally disturb the serenity of his deportment The old owners of this place continued the white haired narrator were well off in the world and bore a good name among their neighbors The brother of Sergeant Vanhome now the only one of the name died ten or twelve years since leaving a son a child so small that the father s willmade provision for his being brought up by his uncle whom I mention d but now as of the British army He was a strange man this uncle disliked by all who knew him passionate vindictive and it was said very avaricious even from his childhood Well not long after the death of the parents dark stories began to be circulated about cruelty and punishment and whippings and starvation inflicted by the new master upon his nephew People who had business at the homestead would frequently when they came away relate the most fearful things of its manager and how he misused his brother s child It was half hinted that he strove to get the youngster out of the way in order that the whole estate might fall into his own hands As I told you before however nobody liked the man and perhaps they judged him too uncharitably After things had gone on in this way for some time a countryman a laborer who was hired to do farm work upon the place one evening observed that the little orphan Vanhome was more faint and pale even than usual for he was always delicate and that is one reason why I think it possible that his death of which I am now going to tell you was but the result of his own weak constitution and nothing else The laborer slept that night at the farmhouse Just before the time at which they usually retired to bed this person feeling sleepy with his day s toil left the kitchen hearth and wended his way to rest In going to his place of repose he had to pass a chamber the very chamber where you sir are to sleep to night and there he heard the voice of the orphan child uttering half suppress d exclamations as if in pitiful entreaty Upon stopping he heard also the tones of the elder Vanhome but they were harsh and bitter The sound of blows followed As each one fell it was accompanied by a groan or shriek and so they continued for some time Shock d and indignant the countryman would have burst open the door and interfered to prevent this brutal proceeding but he bethought him that he might get himself into trouble and perhaps find that he could do no good after all and so he passed on to his room Well sir the following day the child did not come out among the work people as usual He was taken very ill No physician was sent for until the next afternoon and though one arrived in the course of the night it was too late the poor boy died before morning People talk d threateningly upon the subject but nothing could be proved against Vanhome At one period there were efforts made to have the whole affair investigated Perhaps that would have taken place had not every one s attention been swallow d up by the rumors of difficulty and war which were then beginning to disturb the country Vanhome joined the army of the king His enemies said that he feared to be on the side of the rebels because if they were routed his property would be taken from him But events have shown that if this was indeed what he dreaded it has happen d to him from the very means which he took to prevent it The old man paused He had quite wearied himself with so long talking For some minutes there was unbroken silence Presently the stranger signified his intention of retiring for the night He rose and his host took a light for the purpose of ushering him to his apartment When Gills return d to his accustom d situation in the large arm chair by the chimney hearth his ancient helpmate had retired to rest With the simplicity of their times the bed stood in the same room where the three had been seated during the last few hours and now the remaining two talk d together about the singular events of the evening As the time wore on Gills show d no disposition to leave his cosy chair but sat toasting his feet and bending over the coals Gradually the insidious heat and the lateness of the hour began to exercise their influence over the old man The drowsy indolent feeling which every one has experienced in getting thoroughly heated through by close contact with a glowing fire spread in each vein and sinew and relax d its tone He lean d back in his chair and slept For a long time his repose went on quietly and soundly He could not tell how many hours elapsed but a while after midnight the torpid senses of the slumberer were awaken d by a startling shock It was a cry as of a strong man in his agony a shrill not very loud cry but fearful and creeping into the blood like cold polish d steel The old man raised himself in his seat and listen d at once fully awake For a minute all was the solemn stillness of midnight Then rose that horrid tone again wailing and wild and making the hearer s hair to stand on end One moment more and the trampling of hasty feet sounded in the passage outside The door was thrown open and the form of the stranger more like a corpse than living man rushed into the room All white yell d the conscience stricken creature all white and with the grave clothes around him One shoulder was bare and I saw he whisper d I saw blue streaks upon it It was horrible and I cried aloud He stepp d toward me He came to my very bedside his small hand almost touch d my face I could not bear it and fled The miserable man bent his head down upon his bosom convulsive rattlings shook his throat and his whole frame waver d to and fro like a tree in a storm Bewilder d and shock d Gills look d at his apparently deranged guest and knew not what answer to make or what course of conduct to pursue Thrusting out his arms and his extended fingers and bending down his eyes as men do when shading them from a glare of lightning the stranger stagger d from the door and in a moment further dash d madly through the passage which led through the kitchen into the outer road The old man heard the noise of his falling footsteps sounding fainter and fainter in the distance and then retreating dropp d his own exhausted limbs into the chair from which he had been arous d so terribly It was many minutes before his energies recover d their accustomed tone again Strangely enough his wife unawaken d by the stranger s ravings still slumber d on as profoundly as ever Pass we on to a far different scene the embarkation of the British troops for the distant land whose monarch was never more to wield the sceptre over a kingdom lost by his imprudence and tyranny With frowning brow and sullen pace the martial ranks moved on Boat after boat was filled and as each discharged its complement in the ships that lay heaving their anchors in the stream it return d and was soon filled with another load And at length it became time for the last soldier to lift his eye and take a last glance at the broad banner of England s pride which flapp d its folds from the top of the highest staff on the Battery As the warning sound of a trumpet called together all who were laggards those taking leave of friends and those who were arranging their own private affairs left until the last moment a single horseman was seen furiously dashing down the street A red scarf tightly encircled his waist He made directly for the shore and the crowd there gather d started back in wonderment as they beheld his dishevel d appearance and ghastly face Throwing himself violently from his saddle he flung the bridle over the animal s neck and gave him a sharp cut with a small riding whip He made for the boat one minute later and he had been left They were pushing the keel from the landing the stranger sprang a space of two or three feet already intervened he struck on the gunwale and the Last Soldier of King George had left the American shores WILD FRANK S RETURN As the sun one August day some fifty years ago had just pass d the meridian of a country town in the eastern section of Long Island a single traveler came up to the quaint low roof d village tavern open d its half door and enter d the common room Dust cover d the clothes of the wayfarer and his brow was moist with sweat He trod in a lagging weary way though his form and features told of an age not more than nineteen or twenty years Over one shoulder was slung a sailor s jacket and in his hand he carried a little bundle Sitting down on a rude bench he told a female who made her appearance behind the bar that he would have a glass of brandy and sugar He took off the liquor at a draught after which he lit and began to smoke a cigar with which he supplied himself from his pocket stretching out one leg and leaning his elbow down on the bench in the attitude of a man who takes an indolent lounge Do you know one Richard Hall that lives somewhere here among you said he mister Hall s is down the lane that turns off by that big locust tree answer d the woman pointing to the direction through the open door it s about half a mile from here to his house The youth for a minute or two puff d the smoke from his mouth very leisurely in silence His manner had an air of vacant self sufficiency rather strange in one of so few years I wish to see mister Hall he said at length Here s a silver six pence for any one who will carry a message to him The folks are all away It s but a short walk and your limbs are young replied the female who was not altogether pleased with the easy way of making himself at home which mark d her shabby looking customer That individual however seem d to give small attention to the hint but lean d and puff d his cigar smoke as leisurely as before Unless continued the woman catching a second glance at the sixpence unless old Joe is at the stable as he s very likely to be I ll go and find out for you And she push d open a door at her back stepp d through an adjoining room into a yard whence her voice was the next moment heard calling the person she had mention d in accents by no means remarkable for their melody or softness Her search was successful She soon return d with him who was to act as messenger a little wither d ragged old man a hanger on there whose unshaven face told plainly enough the story of his intemperate habits those deeply seated habits now too late to be uprooted that would ere long lay him in a drunkard s grave The youth inform d him what the required service was and promised him the reward as soon as he should return Tell Richard Hall that I am going to his father s house this afternoon If he asks who it is that wishes him here say the person sent no name continued the stranger sitting up from his indolent posture as the feet of old Joe were about leaving the door stone and his blear d eyes turned to eaten the last sentence of the mandate And yet perhaps you may as well added he communing a moment with himself you may tell him his brother Frank Wild Frank it is who wishes him to come The old man departed on his errand and he who call d himself Wild Frank toss d his nearly smoked cigar out of the window and folded his arms in thought No better place than this probably will occur to give a brief account of some former events in the life of the young stranger resting and waiting at the village inn Fifteen miles east of that inn lived a farmer named Hall a man of good repute well off in the world and head of a large family He was fond of gain required all his boys to labor in proportion to their age and his right hand man if he might not be called favorite was his eldest son Richard This eldest son an industrious sober faced young fellow was invested by his father with the powers of second in command and as strict and swift obedience was a prime tenet in the farmer s domestic government the children all tacitly submitted to their brother s sway all but one and that was Frank The farmer s wife was a quiet woman in rather tender health and though for all her offspring she had a mother s love Frank s kiss ever seem d sweetest to her lips She favor d him more than the rest perhaps as in a hundred similar instances for his being so often at fault and so often blamed In truth however he seldom receiv d more blame than he deserv d for he was a capricious high temper d lad and up to all kinds of mischief From these traits he was known in the neighborhood by the name of Wild Frank Among the farmer s stock there was a fine young blood mare a beautiful creature large and graceful with eyes like dark hued jewels and her color that of the deep night It being the custom of the farmer to let his boys have something about the farm that they could call their own and take care of as such Black Nell as the mare was called had somehow or other fallen to Frank s share He was very proud of her and thought as much of her comfort as his own The elder brother however saw fit to claim for himself and several times to exercise a privilege of managing and using Black Nell notwithstanding what Frank consider d his prerogative On one of these occasions a hot dispute arose and after much angry blood it was referr d to the farmer for settlement He decided in favor of Richard and added a harsh lecture to his other son The farmer was really unjust and Wild Frank s face paled with rage and mortification That furious temper which he had never been taught to curb now swell d like an overflowing torrent With difficulty restraining the exhibition of his passions as soon as he got by himself he swore that not another sun should roll by and find him under that roof Late at night he silently arose and turning his back on what he thought an inhospitable home in mood in which the child should never leave the parental roof bent his steps toward the city It may well be imagined that alarm and grief pervaded the whole of the family on discovering Frank s departure And as week after week melted away and brought no tidings of him his poor mother s heart grew wearier and wearier She spoke not much but was evidently sick in spirit Nearly two years had claps d when about a week before the incidents at the commencement of this story the farmer s family were joyfully surprised by receiving a letter from the long absent son He had been to sea and was then in New York at which port his vessel had just arrived He wrote in a gay strain appear d to have lost the angry feeling which caused his flight from home and said he heard in the city that Richard had married and settled several miles distant where he wished him all good luck and happiness Wild Frank wound up his letter by promising as soon as he could get through the imperative business of his ship to pay a visit to his parents and native place On Tuesday of the succeeding week he said he would be with them Within half an hour after the departure of old Joe the form of that ancient personage was seen slowly wheeling round the locust tree at the end of the lane accompanied by a stout young man in primitive homespun apparel The meeting between Wild Frank and his brother Richard though hardly of that kind which generally takes place between persons so closely related could not exactly be call d distant or cool either Richard press d his brother to go with him to the farmhouse and refresh and repose himself for some hours at least but Frank declined They will all expect me home this afternoon he said I wrote to them I would be there to day But you must be very tired Frank rejoin d the other won t you let some of us harness up and carry you Or if you like he stopp d a moment and a trifling suffusion spread over his face if you like I ll put the saddle on Black Nell she s here at my place now and you can ride home like a lord Frank s face color d a little too He paused for a moment in thought he was really foot sore and exhausted with his journey that hot day so he accepted his brother s offer You know the speed of Nell as well as I said Richard I ll warrant when I bring her here you ll say she s in good order as ever So telling him to amuse himself for a few minutes as well as he could Richard left the tavern Could it be that Black Nell knew her early master She neigh d and rubb d her nose on his shoulder and as he put his foot in the stirrup and rose on her back it was evident that they were both highly pleased with their meeting Bidding his brother farewell and not forgetting old Joe the young man set forth on his journey to his father s house As he left the village behind and came upon the long monotonous road before him he thought on the circumstances of his leaving home and he thought too on his course of life how it was being frittered away and lost Very gentle influences doubtless came over Wild Frank s mind then and he yearn d to show his parents that he was sorry for the trouble he had cost them He blamed himself for his former follies and even felt remorse that he had not acted more kindly to Richard and gone to his house Oh it had been a sad mistake of the farmer that he did not teach his children to love one another It was a foolish thing that he prided himself on governing his little flock well when sweet affection gentle forbearance and brotherly faith were almost unknown among them The day was now advanced though the heat pour d down with a strength little less oppressive than at noon Frank had accomplish d the greater part of his journey he was within two miles of his home The road here led over a high tiresome hill and he determined to stop on the top of it and rest himself as well as give the animal he rode a few minutes breath How well he knew the place And that mighty oak standing just outside the fence on the very summit of the hill often had he reposed under its shade It would be pleasant for a few minutes to stretch his limbs there again as of old he thought to himself and he dismounted from the saddle and led Black Nell under the tree Mindful of the comfort of his favorite he took from his little bundle which he had strapped behind him on the mare s back a piece of strong cord four or five yards in length which he tied to the bridle and wound and tied the other end for security over his own wrist then throwing himself at full length upon the ground Black Nell was at liberty to graze around him without danger of straying away It was a calm scene and a pleasant There was no rude sound hardly even a chirping insect to break the sleepy silence of the place The atmosphere had a dim hazy cast and was impregnated with overpowering heat The young man lay there minute after minute as time glided away unnoticed for he was very tired and his repose was sweet to him Occasionally he raised himself and cast a listless look at the distant landscape veil d as it was by the slight mist At length his repose was without such interruptions His eyes closed and though at first they open d languidly again at intervals after a while they shut altogether Could it be that he slept It was so indeed Yielding to the drowsy influences about him and to his prolong d weariness of travel he had fallen into a deep sound slumber Thus he lay and Black Nell the original cause of his departure from his home by a singular chance the companion of his return quietly cropp d the grass at his side An hour nearly pass d away and yet the young man slept on The light and heat were not glaring now a change had come over earth and heaven There were signs of one of those thunderstorms that in our climate spring up and pass over so quickly and so terribly Masses of vapor loom d up in the horizon and a dark shadow settled on the woods and fields The leaves of the great oak rustled together over the youth s head Clouds flitted swiftly in the sky like bodies of armed men coming up to battle at the call of their leader s trumpet A thick rain drop fell now and then while occasionally hoarse mutterings of thunder sounded in the distance yet the slumberer was not arous d It was strange that Wild Frank did not awake Perhaps his ocean life had taught him to rest undisturbed amid the jarring of elements Though the storm was now coming on in its fury he slept like a babe in its cradle Black Nell had ceased grazing and stood by her sleeping master with ears erect and her long mane and tail waving in the wind It seem d quite dark so heavy were the clouds The blast blew sweepingly the lightning flash d and the rain fell in torrents Crash after crash of thunder seem d to shake the solid earth And Black Nell she stood now an image of beautiful terror with her fore feet thrust out her neck arch d and her eyes glaring balls of fear At length after a dazzling and lurid glare there came a peal a deafening crash as if the great axle was rent God of Spirits the startled mare sprang off like a ship in an ocean storm Her eyes were blinded with light she dashed madly down the hill and plunge after plunge far far away swift as an arrow dragging the hapless body of the youth behind her In the low old fashion d dwelling of the farmer there was a large family group The men and boys had gather d under shelter at the approach of the storm and the subject of their talk was the return of the long absent son The mother spoke of him too and her eyes brighten d with pleasure as she spoke She made all the little domestic preparations cook d his favorite dishes and arranged for him his own bed in its own old place As the tempest mounted to its fury they discuss d the probability of his getting soak d by it and the provident dame had already selected some dry garments for a change But the rain was soon over and nature smiled again in her invigorated beauty The sun shone out as it was dipping in the west Drops sparkled on the leaf tips coolness and clearness were in the air The clattering of a horse s hoofs came to the ears of those who were gather d there It was on the other side of the house that the wagon road lead and they open d the door and rush d in a tumult of glad anticipations through the adjoining room to the porch What a sight it was that met them there Black Nell stood a few feet from the door with her neck crouch d down she drew her breath long and deep and vapor rose from every part of her reeking body And with eyes starting from their sockets and mouths agape with stupefying terror they beheld on the ground near her a mangled hideous mass the rough semblance of a human form all batter d and cut and bloody Attach d to it was the fatal cord dabbled over with gore And as the mother gazed for she could not withdraw her eyes and the appalling truth came upon her mind she sank down without shriek or utterance into a deep deathly swoon THE BOY LOVER Listen and the old will speak a chronicle for the young Ah youth thou art one day coming to be old too And let me tell thee how thou mayest get a useful lesson For an hour dream thyself old Realize in thy thoughts and consciousness that vigor and strength are subdued in thy sinews that the color of the shroud is liken d in thy very hairs that all those leaping desires luxurious hopes beautiful aspirations and proud confidences of thy younger life have long been buried a funeral for the better part of thee in that grave which must soon close over thy tottering limbs Look back then through the long track of the past years How has it been with thee Are there bright beacons of happiness enjoy d and of good done by the way Glimmer gentle rays of what was scatter d from a holy heart Have benevolence and love and undeviating honesty left tokens on which thy eyes can rest sweetly Is it well with thee thus Answerest thou it is Or answerest thou I see nothing but gloom and shatter d hours and the wreck of good resolves and a broken heart filled with sickness and troubled among its ruined chambers with the phantoms of many follies O youth youth this dream will one day be a reality a reality either of heavenly peace or agonizing sorrow And yet not for all is it decreed to attain the neighborhood of the three score and ten years the span of life I am to speak of one who died young Very awkward was his childhood but most fragile and sensitive So delicate a nature may exist in a rough unnoticed plant Let the boy rest he was not beautiful and dropp d away betimes But for the cause it is a singular story to which let crusted worldlings pay the tribute of a light laugh light and empty as their own hollow hearts Love which with its cankerseed of decay within has sent young men and maidens to a long d for but too premature burial Love the child monarch that Death itself cannot conquer that has its tokens on slabs at the head of grass cover d tombs tokens more visible to the eye of the stranger yet not so deeply graven as the face and the remembrances cut upon the heart of the living Love the sweet the pure the innocent yet the causer of fierce hate of wishes for deadly revenge of bloody deeds and madness and the horrors of hell Love that wanders over battlefields turning up mangled human trunks and parting back the hair from gory faces and daring the points of swords and the thunder of artillery without a fear or a thought of danger Words words I begin to see I am indeed an old man and garrulous Let me go back yes I see it must be many years It was at the close of the last century I was at that time studying law the profession my father follow d One of his clients was an elderly widow a foreigner who kept a little ale house on the banks of the North River at about two miles from what is now the centre of the city Then the spot was quite out of town and surrounded by fields and green trees The widow often invited me to come and pay her a visit when I had a leisure afternoon including also in the invitation my brother and two other students who were in my father s office Matthew the brother I mention was a boy of sixteen he was troubled with an inward illness though it had no power over his temper which ever retain d the most admirable placidity and gentleness He was cheerful but never boisterous and everybody loved him his mind seem d more develop d than is usual for his age though his personal appearance was exceedingly plain Wheaton and Brown the names of the other students were spirited clever young fellows with most of the traits that those in their position of life generally possess The first was as generous and brave as any man I ever knew He was very passionate too but the whirlwind soon blew over and left everything quiet again Frank Brown was slim graceful and handsome He profess d to be fond of sentiment and used to fall regularly in love once a month The half of every Wednesday we four youths had to ourselves and were in the habit of taking a sail a ride or a walk together One of these afternoons of a pleasant day in April the sun shining and the air clear I bethought myself of the widow and her beer about which latter article I had made inquiries and heard it spoken of in terms of high commendation I mention d the matter to Matthew and to my fellow students and we agreed to fill up our holiday by a jaunt to the ale house Accordingly we set forth and after a fine walk arrived in glorious spirits at our destination Ah how shall I describe the quiet beauties of the spot with its long low piazza looking out upon the river and its clean homely tables and the tankards of real silver in which the ale was given us and the flavor of that excellent liquor itself There was the widow and there was a sober stately old woman half companion half servant Margery by name and there was good God my fingers quiver yet as I write the word young Ninon the daughter of the widow O through the years that live no more my memory strays back and that whole scene comes up before me once again and the brightest part of the picture is the strange ethereal beauty of that young girl She was apparently about the age of my brother Matthew and the most fascinating artless creature I had ever beheld She had blue eyes and light hair and an expression of childish simplicity which was charming indeed I have no doubt that ere half an hour had elapsed from the time we enter d the tavern and saw Ninon every one of the four of us loved the girl to the very depth of passion We neither spent so much money nor drank as much beer as we had intended before starting from home The widow was very civil being pleased to see us and Margery served our wants with a deal of politeness but it was to Ninon that the afternoon s pleasure was attributable for though we were strangers we became acquainted at once the manners of the girl merry as she was putting entirely out of view the most distant imputation of indecorum and the presence of the widow and Margery for we were all in the common room together there being no other company serving to make us all disembarrass d and at ease It was not until quite a while after sunset that we started on our return to the city We made several attempts to revive the mirth and lively talk that usually signalized our rambles but they seem d forced and discordant like laughter in a sick room My brother was the only one who preserved his usual tenor of temper and conduct I need hardly say that thenceforward every Wednesday afternoon was spent at the widow s tavern Strangely neither Matthew or my two friends or myself spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference to Ninon Yet we all knew the thoughts and feelings of the others and each perhaps felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his companions The story of the widow was a touching yet simple one She was by birth a Swiss In one of the cantons of her native land she had grown up and married and lived for a time in happy comfort A son was born to her and a daughter the beautiful Ninon By some reverse of fortune the father and head of the family had the greater portion of his possessions swept from him He struggled for a time against the evil influence but it press d upon him harder and harder He had heard of a people in the western world a new and swarming land where the stranger was welcom d and peace and the protection of the strong arm thrown around him He had not heart to stay and struggle amid the scenes of his former prosperity and he determin d to go and make his home in that distant republic of the west So with his wife and children and the proceeds of what little property was left he took passage for New York He was never to reach his journey s end Either the cares that weigh d upon his mind or some other cause consign d him to a sick hammock from which he only found relief through the Great Dismisser He was buried in the sea and in due time his family arrived at the American emporium But there the son too sicken d died ere long and was buried likewise They would not bury him in the city but away by the solitary banks of the Hudson on which the widow soon afterwards took up her abode Ninon was too young to feel much grief at these sad occurrences and the mother whatever she might have suffer d inwardly had a good deal of phlegm and patience and set about making herself and her remaining child as comfortable as might be They had still a respectable sum in cash and after due deliberation the widow purchas d the little quiet tavern not far from the grave of her boy and of Sundays and holidays she took in considerable money enough to make a decent support for them in their humble way of living French and Germans visited the house frequently and quite a number of young Americans too Probably the greatest attraction to the latter was the sweet face of Ninon Spring passed and summer crept in and wasted away and autumn had arrived Every New Yorker knows what delicious weather we have in these regions of the early October days how calm clear and divested of sultriness is the air and how decently nature seems preparing for her winter sleep Thus it was the last Wednesday we started on our accustomed excursion Six months had elapsed since our first visit and as then we were full of the exuberance of young and joyful hearts Frequent and hearty were our jokes by no means particular about the theme or the method and long and loud the peals of laughter that rang over the fields or along the shore We took our seats round the same clean white table and received our favorite beverage in the same bright tankards They were set before us by the sober Margery no one else being visible As frequently happen d we were the only company Walking and breathing the keen fine air had made us dry and we soon drain d the foaming vessels and call d for more I remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that had just made their appearance from a great British author and were creating quite a public stir There was one a tale of passion and despair which Wheaton had read and of which he gave us a transcript Wild startling and dreamy perhaps it threw over our minds its peculiar cast An hour moved off and we began to think it strange that neither Ninon or the widow came into the room One of us gave a hint to that effect to Margery but she made no answer and went on in her usual way as before The grim old thing said Wheaton if she were in Spain they d make her a premier duenna I ask d the woman about Ninon and the widow She seemed disturb d I thought but making no reply to the first part of my question said that her mistress was in another part of the house and did not wish to be with company Then be kind enough missus Vinegar resumed Wheaton good naturedly be kind enough to go and ask the widow if we can see Ninon Our attendant s face turn d as pale as ashes and she precipitately left the apartment We laugh d at her agitation which Frank Brown assigned to our merry ridicule Quite a quarter of an hour elaps d before Margery s return When she appear d she told us briefly that the widow had bidden her obey our behest and now if we desired she would conduct us to the daughter s presence There was a singular expression in the woman s eyes and the whole affair began to strike us as somewhat odd but we arose and taking our caps follow d her as she stepp d through the door Back of the house were some fields and a path leading into clumps of trees At some thirty rods distant from the tavern nigh one of those clumps the larger tree whereof was a willow Margery stopp d and pausing a minute while we came up spoke in tones calm and low Ninon is there She pointed downward with her finger Great God There was a grave new made and with the sods loosely join d and a rough brown stone at each extremity Some earth yet lay upon the grass near by If we had look d we might have seen the resting place of the widow s son Ninon s brother for it was close at hand But amid the whole scene our eyes took in nothing except that horrible covering of death the oven shaped mound My sight seemed to waver my head felt dizzy and a feeling of deadly sickness came over me I heard a stifled exclamation and looking round saw Frank Brown leaning against the nearest tree great sweat upon his forehead and his cheeks bloodless as chalk Wheaton gave way to his agony more fully than ever I had known a man before he had fallen sobbing like a child and wringing his hands It is impossible to describe the suddenness and fearfulness of the sickening truth that came upon us like a stroke of thunder Of all of us my brother Matthew neither shed tears or turned pale or fainted or exposed any other evidence of inward depth of pain His quiet pleasant voice was indeed a tone lower but it was that which recall d us after the lapse of many long minutes to ourselves So the girl had died and been buried We were told of an illness that had seized her the very day after our last preceding visit but we inquired not into the particulars And now come I to the conclusion of my story and to the most singular part of it The evening of the third day afterward Wheaton who had wept scalding tears and Brown whose cheeks had recovered their color and myself that for an hour thought my heart would never rebound again from the fearful shock that evening I say we three were seated around a table in another tavern drinking other beer and laughing but a little less cheerfully and as though we had never known the widow or her daughter neither of whom I venture to affirm came into our minds once the whole night or but to be dismiss d again carelessly like the remembrance of faces seen in a crowd Strange are the contradictions of the things of life The seventh day after that dreadful visit saw my brother Matthew the delicate one who while bold men writhed in torture had kept the same placid face and the same untrembling fingers him that seventh day saw a clay cold corpse carried to the repose of the churchyard The shaft rankling far down and within wrought a poison too great for show and the youth died THE CHILD AND THE PROFLIGATE Just after sunset one evening in summer that pleasant hour when the air is balmy the light loses its glare and all around is imbued with soothing quiet on the door step of a house there sat an elderly woman waiting the arrival of her son The house was in a straggling village some fifty miles from New York city She who sat on the door step was a widow her white cap cover d locks of gray and her dress though clean was exceedingly homely Her house for the tenement she occupied was her own was very little and very old Trees clustered around it so thickly as almost to hide its color that blackish gray color which belongs to old wooden houses that have never been painted and to get in it you had to enter a little rickety gate and walk through a short path border d by carrot beds and beets and other vegetables The son whom she was expecting was her only child About a year before he had been bound apprentice to a rich farmer in the place and after finishing his daily task he was in the habit of spending half an hour at his mother s On the present occasion the shadows of night had settled heavily before the youth made his appearance When he did his walk was slow and dragging and all his motions were languid as if from great weariness He open d the gate came through the path and sat down by his mother in silence You are sullen to night Charley said the widow after a moment s pause when she found that he return d no answer to her greeting As she spoke she put her hand fondly on his head it seem d moist as if it had been dipp d in the water His shirt too was soak d and as she pass d her fingers down his shoulder she left a sharp twinge in her heart for she knew that moisture to be the hard wrung sweat of severe toil exacted from her young child he was but thirteen years old by an unyielding taskmaster You have work d hard to day my son I ve been mowing The widow s heart felt another pang Not all day Charley she said in a low voice and there was a slight quiver in it Yes mother all day replied the boy mister Ellis said he couldn t afford to hire men for wages are so high I ve swung the scythe ever since an hour before sunrise Feel of my hands There were blisters on them like great lumps Tears started in the widow s eyes She dared not trust herself with a reply though her heart was bursting with the thought that she could not better his condition There was no earthly means of support on which she had dependence enough to encourage her child in the wish she knew he was forming the wish not utter d for the first time to be freed from his bondage Mother at length said the boy I can stand it no longer I cannot and will not stay at mister Ellis s Ever since the day I first went into his house I ve been a slave and if I have to work so much longer I know I shall run off and go to sea or somewhere else I d as leave be in my grave as there And the child burst into a passionate fit of weeping His mother was silent for she was in deep grief herself After some minutes had flown however she gather d sufficient self possession to speak to her son in a soothing tone endeavoring to win him from his sorrows and cheer up his heart She told him that time was swift that in the course of a few years he would be his own master that all people have their troubles with many other ready arguments which though they had little effect in calming her own distress she hoped would act as a solace to the disturb d temper of the boy And as the half hour to which he was limited had now elaps d she took him by the hand and led him to the gate to set forth on his return The youth seemed pacified though occasionally one of those convulsive sighs that remain after a fit of weeping would break from his throat At the gate he threw his arms about his mother s neck each press d a long kiss on the lips of the other and the youngster bent his steps towards his master s house As her child pass d out of sight the widow return d shut the gate and enter d her lonely room There was no light in the old cottage that night the heart of its occupant was dark and cheerless Love agony and grief and tears and convulsive wrestlings were there The thought of a beloved son condemned to labor labor that would break down a man struggling from day to day under the hard rule of a soulless gold worshipper the knowledge that years must pass thus the sickening idea of her own poverty and of living mainly on the grudged charity of neighbors thoughts too of former happy days these rack d the widow s heart and made her bed a sleepless one without repose The boy bent his steps to his employer s as has been said In his way down the village street he had to pass a public house the only one the place contain d and when he came off against it he heard the sound of a fiddle drown d however at intervals by much laughter and talking The windows were up and the house standing close to the road Charles thought it no harm to take a look and see what was going on within Half a dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement on which he lean d his elbow and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants In one corner was an old man known in the village as Black Dave he it was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn Charles s attention to the tavern and he it was who now exerted himself in a violent manner to give with divers flourishes and extra twangs a tune very popular among that thick lipp d race whose fondness for melody is so well known In the middle of the room were five or six sailors some of them quite drunk and others in the earlier stages of that process while on benches around were more sailors and here and there a person dress d in landsman s attire The men in the middle of the room were dancing that is they were going through certain contortions and shufflings varied occasionally by exceeding hearty stamps upon the sanded floor In short the whole party were engaged in a drunken frolic which was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken frolics except perhaps that there was less than the ordinary amount of anger and quarreling Indeed everyone seem d in remarkably good humor But what excited the boy s attention more than any other object was an individual seated on one of the benches opposite who though evidently enjoying the spree as much as if he were an old hand at such business seem d in every other particular to be far out of his element His appearance was youthful He might have been twenty one or two years old His countenance was intelligent and had the air of city life and society He was dress d not gaudily but in every respect fashionably his coat being of the finest broadcloth his linen delicate and spotless as snow and his whole aspect that of one whose counterpart may now and then be seen upon the pave in Broadway of a fine afternoon He laugh d and talk d with the rest and it must be confess d his jokes like the most of those that pass d current there were by no means distinguish d for their refinement or purity Near the door was a small table cover d with decanters and glasses some of which had been used but were used again indiscriminately and a box of very thick and very long cigars One of the sailors and it was he who made the largest share of the hubbub had but one eye His chin and cheeks were cover d with huge bushy whiskers and altogether he had quite a brutal appearance Come boys said this gentleman come let us take a drink I know you re all a getting dry and he clench d his invitation with an appalling oath This politeness was responded to by a general moving of the company toward the table holding the before mention d decanters and glasses Clustering there around each one help d himself to a very handsome portion of that particular liquor which suited his fancy and steadiness and accuracy being at that moment by no means distinguishing traits of the arms and legs of the party a goodly amount of the fluid was spill d upon the floor This piece of extravagance excited the ire of the personage who gave the treat and that ire was still further increas d when he discover d two or three loiterers who seem d disposed to slight his request to drink Charles as we have before mention d was looking in at the window Walk up boys walk up If there be any skulker among us blast my eyes if he shan t go down on his marrow bones and taste the liquor we have spilt Hallo he exclaim d as he spied Charles hallo you chap in the window come here and take a sup As he spoke he stepp d to the open casement put his brawny hands under the boy s arms and lifted him into the room bodily There my lads said he turning to his companions there s a new recruit for you Not so coarse a one either he added as he took a fair view of the boy who though not what is called pretty was fresh and manly looking and large for his age Come youngster take a glass he continued And he pour d one nearly full of strong brandy Now Charles was not exactly frighten d for he was a lively fellow and had often been at the country merry makings and at the parties of the place but he was certainly rather abash d at his abrupt introduction to the midst of strangers So putting the glass aside he look d up with a pleasant smile in his new acquaintance s face I ve no need for anything now he said but I m just as much obliged to you as if I was Poh man drink it down rejoin d the sailor drink it down it won t hurt you And by way of showing its excellence the one eyed worthy drain d it himself to the last drop Then filling it again he renew d his efforts to make the lad go through the same operation I ve no occasion Besides my mother has often pray d me not to drink and I promised to obey her A little irritated by his continued refusal the sailor with a loud oath declared that Charles should swallow the brandy whether he would or no Placing one of his tremendous paws on the back of the boy s head with the other he thrust the edge of the glass to his lips swearing at the same time that if he shook it so as to spill its contents the consequences would be of a nature by no means agreeable to his back and shoulders Disliking the liquor and angry at the attempt to overbear him the undaunted child lifted his hand and struck the arm of the sailor with a blow so sudden that the glass fell and was smash d to pieces on the floor while the brandy was about equally divided between the face of Charles the clothes of the sailor and the sand By this time the whole of the company had their attention drawn to the scene Some of them laugh d when they saw Charles s undisguised antipathy to the drink but they laugh d still more heartily when he discomfited the sailor All of them however were content to let the matter go as chance would have it all but the young man of the black coat who has been spoken of What was there in the words which Charles had spoken that carried the mind of the young man back to former times to a period when he was more pure and innocent than now My mother has often pray d me not to drink Ah how the mist of months roll d aside and presented to his soul s eye the picture of his mother and a prayer of exactly similar purport Why was it too that the young man s heart moved with a feeling of kindness toward the harshly treated child Charles stood his cheek flush d and his heart throbbing wiping the trickling drops from his face with a handkerchief At first the sailor between his drunkenness and his surprise was much in the condition of one suddenly awaken d out of a deep sleep who cannot call his consciousness about him When he saw the state of things however and heard the jeering laugh of his companions his dull eye lighting up with anger fell upon the boy who had withstood him He seized Charles with a grip of iron and with the side of his heavy boot gave him a sharp and solid kick He was about repeating the performance for the child hung like a rag in his grasp but all of a sudden his ears rang as if pistols were snapp d close to them lights of various hues flicker d in his eye he had but one it will be remember d and a strong propelling power caused him to move from his position and keep moving until he was brought up by the wall A blow a cuff given in such a scientific manner that the hand from which it proceeded was evidently no stranger to the pugilistic art had been suddenly planted in the ear of the sailor It was planted by the young man of the black coat He had watch d with interest the proceeding of the sailor and the boy two or three times he was on the point of interfering but when the kick was given his rage was uncontrollable He sprang from his seat in the attitude of a boxer struck the sailor in a manner to cause those unpleasant sensations which have been described and would probably have follow d up the attack had not Charles now thoroughly terrified clung around his legs and prevented his advancing The scene was a strange one and for the time quite a silent one The company had started from their seats and for a moment held breathless but strain d positions In the middle of the room stood the young man in his not at all ungraceful attitude every nerve out and his eyes flashing brilliantly He seem d rooted like a rock and clasping him with an appearance of confidence in his protection clung the boy You scoundrel cried the young man his voice thick with passion dare to touch the boy again and I ll thrash you till no sense is left in your body The sailor now partially recover d made some gestures of a belligerent nature Come on drunken brute continued the angry youth I wish you would You ve not had half what you deserve Upon sobriety and sense more fully taking their power in the brains of the one eyed mariner however that worthy determined in his own mind that it would be most prudent to let the matter drop Expressing therefore his conviction to that effect adding certain remarks to the purport that he meant no harm to the lad that he was surprised at such a gentleman being angry at a little piece of fun and so forth he proposed that the company should go on with their jollity just as if nothing had happen d In truth he of the single eye was not a bad fellow at heart after all the fiery enemy whose advances he had so often courted that night had stolen away his good feelings and set busy devils at work within him that might have made his hands do some dreadful deed had not the stranger interposed In a few minutes the frolic of the party was upon its former footing The young man sat down upon one of the benches with the boy by his side and while the rest were loudly laughing and talking they two convers d together The stranger learn d from Charles all the particulars of his simple story how his father had died years since how his mother work d hard for a bare living and how he himself for many dreary months had been the servant of a hard hearted avaricious master More and more interested drawing the child close to his side the young man listen d to his plainly told history and thus an hour pass d away It was now past midnight The young man told Charles that on the morrow he would take steps to relieve him from his servitude that for the present night the landlord would probably give him a lodging at the inn and little persuading did the host need for that As he retired to sleep very pleasant thoughts filled the mind of the young man thoughts of a worthy action perform d thoughts too newly awakened ones of walking in a steadier and wiser path than formerly That roof then sheltered two beings that night one of them innocent and sinless of all wrong the other oh to that other what evil had not been present either in action or to his desires Who was the stranger To those that from ties of relationship or otherwise felt an interest in him the answer to that question was not pleasant to dwell upon His name was Langton parentless a dissipated young man a brawler one whose too frequent companions were rowdies blacklegs and swindlers The New York police offices were not strangers to his countenance He had been bred to the profession of medicine besides he had a very respectable income and his house was in a pleasant street on the west side of the city Little of his time however did mister John Langton spend at his domestic hearth and the elderly lady who officiated as his housekeeper was by no means surprised to have him gone for a week or a month at a time and she knowing nothing of his whereabouts Living as he did the young man was an unhappy being It was not so much that his associates were below his own capacity for Langton though sensible and well bred was not highly talented or refined but that he lived without any steady purpose that he had no one to attract him to his home that he too easily allow d himself to be tempted which caused his life to be of late one continued scene of dissatisfaction This dissatisfaction he sought to drive away by the brandy bottle and mixing in all kinds of parties where the object was pleasure On the present occasion he had left the city a few days before and passing his time at a place near the village where Charles and his mother lived He fell in during the day with those who were his companions of the tavern spree and thus it happen d that they were all together Langton hesitated not to make himself at home with any associate that suited his fancy The next morning the poor widow rose from her sleepless cot and from that lucky trait in our nature which makes one extreme follow another she set about her toil with a lighten d heart Ellis the farmer rose too short as the nights were an hour before day for his god was gain and a prime article of his creed was to get as much work as possible from every one around him In the course of the day Ellis was called upon by young Langton and never perhaps in his life was the farmer puzzled more than at the young man s proposal his desire to provide for the widow s family a family that could do him no pecuniary good and his willingness to disburse money for that purpose The widow too was called upon not only on that day but the next and the next It needs not that I should particularize the subsequent events of Langton s and the boy s history how the reformation of the profligate might be dated to begin from that time how he gradually sever d the guilty ties that had so long gall d him how he enjoy d his own home again how the friendship of Charles and himself grew not slack with time and how when in the course of seasons he became head of a family of his own he would shudder at the remembrance of his early dangers and his escapes LINGAVE S TEMPTATION Another day utter d the poet Lingave as he awoke in the morning and turn d him drowsily on his hard pallet another day comes out burthen d with its weight of woes Of what use is existence to me Crush d down beneath the merciless heel of poverty and no promise of hope to cheer me on what have I in prospect but a life neglected and a death of misery The youth paused but receiving no answer to his questions thought proper to continue the peevish soliloquy I am a genius they say and the speaker smiled bitterly but genius is not apparel and food Why should I exist in the world unknown unloved press d with cares while so many around me have all their souls can desire I behold the splendid equipages roll by I see the respectful bow at the presence of pride and I curse the contrast between my own lot and the fortune of the rich The lofty air the show of dress the aristocratic demeanor the glitter of jewels dazzle my eyes and sharp tooth d envy works within me I hate these haughty and favor d ones Why should my path be so much rougher than theirs Pitiable unfortunate man that I am to be placed beneath those whom in my heart I despise and to be constantly tantalized with the presence of that wealth I cannot enjoy And the poet cover d his eyes with his hands and wept from very passion and fretfulness O Lingave be more of a man Have you not the treasures of health and untainted propensities which many of those you envy never enjoy Are you not their superior in mental power in liberal views of mankind and in comprehensive intellect And even allowing you the choice how would you shudder at changing in total conditions with them Besides were you willing to devote all your time and energies you could gain property too squeeze and toil and worry and twist everything into a matter of profit and you can become a great man as far as money goes to make greatness Retreat then man of the polish d soul from those irritable complaints against your lot those longings for wealth and puerile distinction not worthy your class Do justice philosopher to your own powers While the world runs after its shadows and its bubbles thus commune in your own mind we will fold ourselves in our circle of understanding and look with an eye of apathy on those things it considers so mighty and so enviable Let the proud man pass with his pompous glance let the gay flutter in finery let the foolish enjoy his folly and the beautiful move on in his perishing glory we will gaze without desire on all their possessions and all their pleasures Our destiny is different from theirs Not for such as we the lowly flights of their crippled wings We acknowledge no fellow ship with them in ambition We composedly look down on the paths where they walk and pursue our own without uttering a wish to descend and be as they What is it to us that the mass pay us not that deference which wealth commands We desire no applause save the applause of the good and discriminating the choice spirits among men Our intellect would be sullied were the vulgar to approximate to it by professing to readily enter in and praising it Our pride is a towering and thrice refined pride When Lingave had given way to his temper some half hour or thereabout he grew more calm and bethought himself that he was acting a very silly part He listen d a moment to the clatter of the carts and the tramp of early passengers on the pave below as they wended along to commence their daily toil It was just sunrise and the season was summer A little canary bird the only pet poor Lingave could afford to keep chirp d merrily in its cage on the wall How slight a circumstance will sometimes change the whole current of our thoughts The music of that bird abstracting the mind of the poet but a moment from his sorrows gave a chance for his natural buoyancy to act again Lingave sprang lightly from his bed and perform d his ablutions and his simple toilet then hanging the cage on a nail outside the window and speaking an endearment to the songster which brought a perfect flood of melody in return he slowly passed through his door descended the long narrow turnings of the stairs and stood in the open street Undetermin d as to any particular destination he folded his hands behind him cast his glance upon the ground and moved listlessly onward Hour after hour the poet walk d along up this street and down that he reck d not how or where And as crowded thoroughfares are hardly the most fit places for a man to let his fancy soar in the clouds many a push and shove and curse did the dreamer get bestow d upon him The booming of the city clock sounded forth the hour twelve high noon Ho Lingave cried a voice from an open basement window as the poet pass d He stopp d and then unwittingly would have walked on still not fully awaken d from his reverie Lingave I say cried the voice again and the person to whom the voice belong d stretch d his head quite out into the area in front Stop man Have you forgotten your appointment Oh ah said the poet and he smiled unmeaningly and descending the steps went into the office of Ridman whose call it was that had startled him in his walk Who was Ridman While the poet is waiting the convenience of that personage it may be as well to describe him Ridman was a money maker He had much penetration considerable knowledge of the world and a disposition to be constantly in the midst of enterprise excitement and stir His schemes for gaining wealth were various he had dipp d into almost every branch and channel of business A slight acquaintance of several years standing subsisted between him and the poet The day previous a boy had call d with a note from Ridman to Lingave desiring the presence of the latter at the money maker s room The poet return d for answer that he would be there This was the engagement which he came near breaking Ridman had a smooth tongue All his ingenuity was needed in the explanation to his companion of why and wherefore the latter had been sent for It is not requisite to state specifically the offer made by the man of wealth to the poet Ridman in one of his enterprises found it necessary to procure the aid of such a person as Lingave a writer of power a master of elegant diction of fine taste in style passionate yet pure and of the delicate imagery that belongs to the children of song The youth was absolutely startled at the magnificent and permanent remuneration which was held out to him for a moderate exercise of his talents But the nature of the service required All the sophistry and art of Ridman could not veil its repulsiveness The poet was to labor for the advancement of what he felt to be unholy he was to inculcate what would lower the perfection of man He promised to give an answer to the proposal the succeeding day and left the place Now during the many hours there was a war going on in the heart of the poor poet He was indeed poor often he had no certainty whether he should be able to procure the next day s meals And the poet knew the beauty of truth and adored not in the abstract merely but in practice the excellence of upright principles Night came Lingave wearied lay upon his pallet again and slept The misty veil thrown over him the spirit of poesy came to his visions and stood beside him and look d down pleasantly with her large eyes which were bright and liquid like the reflection of stars in a lake Virtue such imagining then seem d conscious to the soul of the dreamer is ever the sinew of true genius Together the two in one they are endow d with immortal strength and approach loftily to Him from whom both spring Yet there are those that having great powers bend them to the slavery of wrong God forgive them for they surely do it ignorantly or heedlessly Oh could he who lightly tosses around him the seeds of evil in his writings or his enduring thoughts or his chance words could he see how haply they are to spring up in distant time and poison the air and putrefy and cause to sicken would he not shrink back in horror A bad principle jestingly spoken a falsehood but of a word may taint a whole nation Let the man to whom the great Master has given the might of mind beware how he uses that might If for the furtherance of bad ends what can be expected but that as the hour of the closing scene draws nigh thoughts of harm done and capacities distorted from their proper aim and strength so laid out that men must be worse instead of better through the exertion of that strength will come and swarm like spectres around him Be and continue poor young man so taught one whose counsels should be graven on the heart of every youth while others around you grow rich by fraud and disloyalty Be without place and power while others beg their way upward Bear the pain of disappointed hopes while others gain the accomplishment of their flattery Forego the gracious pressure of a hand for which others cringe and crawl Wrap yourself in your own virtue and seek a friend and your daily bread If you have in such a course grown gray with unblench d honor bless God and die When Lingave awoke the next morning he despatch d his answer to his wealthy friend and then plodded on as in the days before LITTLE JANE Lift up was ejaculated as a signal and click went the glasses in the hands of a party of tipsy men drinking one night at the bar of one of the middling order of taverns And many a wild gibe was utter d and many a terrible blasphemy and many an impure phrase sounded out the pollution of the hearts of these half crazed creatures as they toss d down their liquor and made the walls echo with their uproar The first and foremost in recklessness was a girlish faced fair hair d fellow of twenty two or three years They called him Mike He seem d to be look d upon by the others as a sort of prompter from whom they were to take cue And if the brazen wickedness evinced by him in a hundred freaks and remarks to his companions during their stay in that place were any test of his capacity there might hardly be one more fit to go forward as a guide on the road of destruction From the conversation of the party it appear d that they had been spending the early part of the evening in a gambling house A second third and fourth time were the glasses fill d and the effect thereof began to be perceiv d in a still higher degree of noise and loquacity among the revellers One of the serving men came in at this moment and whisper d the barkeeper who went out and in a moment return d again A person he said wish d to speak with mister Michael He waited on the walk in front The individual whose name was mention d made his excuses to the others telling them he would be back in a moment and left the room As he shut the door behind him and stepp d into the open air he saw one of his brothers his elder by eight or ten years pacing to and fro with rapid and uneven steps As the man turn d in his walk and the glare of the street lamp fell upon his face the youth half benumb d as his senses were was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation Come with me said the elder brother hurriedly the illness of our little Jane is worse and I have been sent for you Poh answered the young drunkard very composedly is that all I shall be home by and by and he turn d back again But brother she is worse than ever before Perhaps when you arrive she may be dead The tipsy one paus d in his retreat perhaps alarm d at the utterance of that dread word which seldom fails to shoot a chill to the hearts of mortals But he soon calm d himself and waving his hand to the other Why see said he a score of times at least have I been call d away to the last sickness of our good little sister and each time it proves to be nothing worse than some whim of the nurse or physician Three years has the girl been able to live very heartily under her disease and I ll be bound she ll stay on earth three years longer And as he concluded this wicked and most brutal reply the speaker open d the door and went into the bar room But in his intoxication during the hour that follow d Mike was far from being at ease At the end of that hour the words perhaps when you arrive she may be dead were not effaced from his hearing yet and he started for home The elder brother had wended his way back in sorrow Let me go before the younger one awhile to a room in that home A little girl lay there dying She had been ill a long time so it was no sudden thing for her parents and her brethren and sisters to be called for the witness of the death agony The girl was not what might be called beautiful And yet there is a solemn kind of loveliness that always surrounds a sick child The sympathy for the weak and helpless sufferer perhaps increases it in our own ideas The ashiness and the moisture on the brow and the film over the eyeballs what man can look upon the sight and not feel his heart awed within him Children I have sometimes fancied too increase in beauty as their illness deepens Besides the nearest relatives of little Jane standing round her bedside was the family doctor He had just laid her wrist down upon the coverlet and the look he gave the mother was a look in which there was no hope My child she cried in uncontrollable agony O my child And the father and the sons and daughters were bowed down in grief and thick tears rippled between the fingers held before their eyes Then there was silence awhile During the hour just by gone Jane had in her childish way bestow d a little gift upon each of her kindred as a remembrancer when she should be dead and buried in the grave And there was one of these simple tokens which had not reach d its destination She held it in her hand now It was a very small much thumbed book a religious story for infants given her by her mother when she had first learn d to read While they were all keeping this solemn stillness broken only by the suppress d sobs of those who stood and watch d for the passing away of the girl s soul a confusion of some one entering rudely and speaking in a turbulent voice was heard in an adjoining apartment Again the voice roughly sounded out it was the voice of the drunkard Mike and the father bade one of his sons go and quiet the intruder If nought else will do said he sternly put him forth by strength We want no tipsy brawlers here to disturb such a scene as this For what moved the sick girl uneasily on her pillow and raised her neck and motion d to her mother She would that Mike should be brought to her side And it was enjoin d on him whom the father had bade to eject the noisy one that he should tell Mike his sister s request and beg him to come to her He came The inebriate his mind sober d by the deep solemnity of the scene stood there and leaned over to catch the last accounts of one who soon was to be with the spirits of heaven All was the silence of the deepest night The dying child held the young man s hand in one of hers with the other she slowly lifted the trifling memorial she had assigned especially for him aloft in the air Her arm shook her eyes now becoming glassy with the death damps were cast toward her brother s face She smiled pleasantly and as an indistinct gurgle came from her throat the uplifted hand fell suddenly into the open palm of her brother s depositing the tiny volume there Little Jane was dead From that night the young man stepped no more in his wild courses but was reform d DUMB KATE Not many years since and yet long enough to have been before the abundance of railroads and similar speedy modes of conveyance the travelers from Amboy village to the metropolis of our republic were permitted to refresh themselves and the horses of the stage had a breathing spell at a certain old fashion d tavern about half way between the two places It was a quaint comfortable ancient house that tavern Huge buttonwood trees embower d it round about and there was a long porch in front the trellis d work whereof though old and moulder d had been and promised still to be for years held together by the tangled folds of a grape vine wreath d about it like a tremendous serpent How clean and fragrant everything was there How bright the pewter tankards wherefrom cider or ale went into the parch d throat of the thirsty man How pleasing to look into the expressive eyes of Kate the land lord s lovely daughter who kept everything so clean and bright Now the reason why Kate s eyes had become so expressive was that besides their proper and natural office they stood to the poor girl in the place of tongue and ears also Kate had been dumb from her birth Everybody loved the helpless creature when she was a child Gentle timid and affectionate was she and beautiful as the lilies of which she loved to cultivate so many every summer in her garden Her light hair and the like color d lashes so long and silky that droop d over her blue eyes of such uncommon size and softness her rounded shape well set off by a little modest art of dress her smile the graceful ease of her motions always attracted the admiration of the strangers who stopped there and were quite a pride to her parents and friends How could it happen that so beautiful and inoffensive a being should taste even to its dregs the bitterest unhappiness Oh there must indeed be a mysterious unfathomable meaning in the decrees of Providence which is beyond the comprehension of man for no one on earth less deserved or needed the uses of adversity than Dumb Kate Love the mighty and lawless passion came into the sanctuary of the maid s pure breast and the dove of peace fled away forever One of the persons who had occasion to stop most frequently at the tavern kept by Dumb Kate s parents was a young man the son of a wealthy farmer who own d an estate in the neighborhood He saw Kate and was struck with her natural elegance Though not of thoroughly wicked propensities the fascination of so fine a prize made this youth determine to gain her love and if possible to win her to himself At first he hardly dared even amid the depths of his own soul to entertain thoughts of vileness against one so confiding and childlike But in a short time such feelings wore away and he made up his mind to become the betrayer of poor Kate He was a good looking fellow and made but too sure of his victim Kate was lost The villain came to New York soon after and engaged in a business which prosper d well and which has no doubt by this time made him what is call d a man of fortune Not long did sickness of the heart wear into the life and happiness of Dumb Kate One pleasant spring day the neighbors having been called by a notice the previous morning the old churchyard was thrown open and a coffin was borne over the early grass that seem d so delicate with its light green hue There was a new made grave and by its side the bier was rested while they paused a moment until holy words had been said An idle boy call d there by curiosity saw something lying on the fresh earth thrown out from the grave which attracted his attention A little blossom the only one to be seen around had grown exactly on the spot where the sexton chose to dig poor Kate s last resting place It was a weak but lovely flower and now lay where it had been carelessly toss d amid the coarse gravel The boy twirl d it a moment in his fingers the bruis d fragments gave out a momentary perfume and then fell to the edge of the pit over which the child at that moment lean d and gazed in his inquisitiveness As they dropp d they were wafted to the bottom of the grave The last look was bestow d on the dead girl s face by those who loved her so well in life and then she was softly laid away to her sleep beneath that green grass covering Yet in the churchyard on the hill is Kate s grave There stands a little white stone at the head and verdure grows richly there and gossips some times of a Sabbath afternoon rambling over that gathering place of the gone from earth stop a while and con over the dumb girl s hapless story TALK TO AN ART UNION A Brooklyn fragment It is a beautiful truth that all men contain something of the artist in them And perhaps it is the case that the greatest artists live and die the world and themselves alike ignorant what they possess Who would not mourn that an ample palace of surpassingly

the deepest widest most needed good though quite certainly not in the ways attempted which have at times something irresistibly comic What can be more farcical for instance than the sight of a worthy gentleman coming three or four thousand miles through wet and wind to speak complacently and at great length on matters of which he both entirely mistakes or knows nothing before crowds of auditors equally complacent and equally at fault Yet welcome and thanks we say to those visitors we have and have had from abroad among us and may the procession continue We have had Dickens and Thackeray Froude Herbert Spencer Oscar Wilde Lord Coleridge soldiers savants poets and now Matthew Arnold and Irving the actor Some have come to make money some for a good time some to help us along and give us advice and some undoubtedly to investigate bona fide this great problem democratic America looming upon the world with such cumulative power through a hundred years now with the evident intention since the secession war to stay and take a leading hand for many a century to come in civilization s and humanity s eternal game But alas that very investigation the method of that investigation is where the deficit most surely and helplessly comes in Let not Lord Coleridge and mister Arnold to say nothing of the illustrious actor imagine that when they have met and survey d the etiquettical gatherings of our wealthy distinguish d and sure to be put forward on such occasions citizens New York Boston Philadelphia c have certain stereotyped strings of them continually lined and paraded like the lists of dishes at hotel tables you are sure to get the same over and over again it is very amusing and the bowing and introducing the receptions at the swell clubs the eating and drinking and praising and praising back and the next day riding about Central Park or doing the Public Institutions and so passing through one after another the full dress coteries of the Atlantic cities all grammatical and cultured and correct with the toned down manners of the gentlemen and the kid gloves and luncheons and finger glasses Let not our eminent visitors we say suppose that by means of these experiences they have seen America or captur d any distinctive clew or purport thereof Not a bit of it Of the pulse beats that lie within and vitalize this Commonweal to day of the hard pan purports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly by its bulk of men North and South generation after generation superficially unconscious of their own aims yet none the less pressing onward with deathless intuition those coteries do not furnish the faintest scintilla In the Old World the best flavor and significance of a race may possibly need to be look d for in its upper classes its gentries its court its etat major In the United States the rule is revers d Besides and a point this perhaps deepest of all the special marks of our grouping and design are not going to be understood in a hurry The lesson and scanning right on the ground are difficult I was going to say they are impossible to foreigners but I have occasionally found the clearest appreciation of all coming from far off quarters Surely nothing could be more apt not only for our eminent visitors present and to come but for home study than the following editorial criticism of the London Times on mister Froude s visits and lectures here a few years ago and the culminating dinner given at Delmonico s with its brilliant array of guests We read the list says the Times of those who assembled to do honor to mister Froude there were mister Emerson mister Beecher mister Curtis mister Bryant we add the names of those who sent letters of regret that they could not attend in person mister Longfellow mister Whittier They are names which are well known almost as well known and as much honor d in England as in America and yet what must we say in the end The American people outside this assemblage of writers is something vaster and greater than they singly or together can comprehend It cannot be said of any or all of them that they can speak for their nation We who look on at this distance are able perhaps on that account to see the more clearly that there are qualities of the American people which find no representation no voice among these their spokesmen And what is true of them is true of the English class of whom mister Froude may be said to be the ambassador mister Froude is master of a charming style He has the gift of grace and the gift of sympathy Taking any single character as the subject of his study he may succeed after a very short time in so comprehending its workings as to be able to present a living figure to the intelligence and memory of his readers But the movements of a nation the voiceless purpose of a people which cannot put its own thoughts into words yet acts upon them in each successive generation these things do not lie within his grasp The functions of literature such as he represents are limited in their action the influence he can wield is artificial and restricted and while he and his hearers please and are pleas d with pleasant periods his great mass of national life will flow around them unmov d in its tides by action as powerless as that of the dwellers by the shore to direct the currents of the ocean A thought here that needs to be echoed expanded permanently treasur d by our literary classes and educators The gestation the youth the knitting preparations are now over and it is full time for definite purpose result How few think of it though it is the impetus and background of our whole Nationality and popular life In the present brief memorandum I very likely for the first time awake the intelligent reader to the idea and inquiry whether there isn t such a thing as the distinctive genius of our democratic New World universal immanent bringing to a head the best experience of the past not specially literary or intellectual not merely good in the Sunday School and Temperance Society sense some invisible spine and great sympathetic to these States resident only in the average people in their practical life in their physiology in their emotions in their nebulous yet fiery patriotism in the armies both sides through the whole secession war an identity and character which indeed so far finds no voice among their spokesmen To my mind America vast and fruitful as it appears to day is even yet for its most important results entirely in the tentative state its very formation stir and whirling trials and essays more splendid and picturesque to my thinking than the accomplish d growths and shows of other lands through European history or Greece or all the past Surely a New World literature worthy the name is not to be if it ever comes some fiction or fancy or bit of sentimentalism or polish d work merely by itself or in abstraction So long as such literature is no born branch and offshoot of the Nationality rooted and grown from its roots and fibred with its fibre it can never answer any deep call or perennial need Perhaps the untaught Republic is wiser than its teachers The best literature is always a result of something far greater than itself not the hero but the portrait of the hero Before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction Beyond the old masterpieces the Iliad the interminable Hindu epics the Greek tragedies even the Bible itself range the immense facts of what must have preceded them their sine qua non the veritable poems and masterpieces of which grand as they are the word statements are but shreds and cartoons For to day and the States I think the vividest rapidest most stupendous processes ever known ever perform d by man or nation on the largest scales and in countless varieties are now and here presented Not as our poets and preachers are always conventionally putting it but quite different Some colossal foundry the flaming of the fire the melted metal the pounding trip hammers the surging crowds of workmen shifting from point to point the murky shadows the rolling haze the discord the crudeness the deafening din the disorder the dross and clouds of dust the waste and extravagance of material the shafts of darted sunshine through the vast open roof scuttles aloft the mighty castings many of them not yet fitted perhaps delay d long yet each in its due time with definite place and use and meaning Such more like is a symbol of America After all of which returning to our starting point we reiterate and in the whole Land s name a welcome to our eminent guests Visits like theirs and hospitalities and hand shaking and face meeting face and the distant brought near what divine solvents they are Travel reciprocity interviewing intercommunion of lands what are they but Democracy s and the highest Law s best aids O that our own country that every land in the world could annually continually receive the poets thinkers scientists even the official magnates of other lands as honor d guests O that the United States especially the West could have had a good long visit and explorative jaunt from the noble and melancholy Tourgueneff before he died or from Victor Hugo or Thomas Carlyle Castelar Tennyson any of the two or three great Parisian essayists were they and we to come face to face how is it possible but that the right understanding would ensue THE BIBLE AS POETRY I suppose one cannot at this day say anything new from a literary point of view about those autochthonic bequests of Asia the Hebrew Bible the mighty Hindu epics and a hundred lesser but typical works not now definitely including the Iliad though that work was certainly of Asiatic genesis as Homer himself was considerations which seem curiously ignored But will there ever be a time or place ever a student however modern of the grand art to whom those compositions will not afford profounder lessons than all else of their kind in the garnerage of the past Could there be any more opportune suggestion to the current popular writer and reader of verse what the office of poet was in primeval times and is yet capable of being anew adjusted entirely to the modern All the poems of Orientalism with the Old and New Testaments at the centre tend to deep and wide I don t know but the deepest and widest psychological development with little or nothing at all of the mere esthetic the principal verse requirement of our day Very late but unerringly comes to every capable student the perception that it is not in beauty it is not in art it is not even in science that the profoundest laws of the case have their eternal sway and outcropping In his discourse on Hebrew Poets De Sola Mendes said The fundamental feature of Judaism of the Hebrew nationality was religion its poetry was naturally religious Its subjects God and Providence the covenants with Israel God in Nature and as reveal d God the Creator and Governor Nature in her majesty and beauty inspired hymns and odes to Nature s God And then the checker d history of the nation furnish d allusions illustrations and subjects for epic display the glory of the sanctuary the offerings the splendid ritual the Holy City and lov d Palestine with its pleasant valleys and wild tracts doctor Mendes said that rhyming was not a characteristic of Hebrew poetry at all Metre was not a necessary mark of poetry Great poets discarded it the early Jewish poets knew it not Compared with the famed epics of Greece and lesser ones since the spinal supports of the Bible are simple and meagre All its history biography narratives c are as beads strung on and indicating the eternal thread of the Deific purpose and power Yet with only deepest faith for impetus and such Deific purpose for palpable or impalpable theme it often transcends the masterpieces of Hellas and all masterpieces The metaphors daring beyond account the lawless soul extravagant by our standards the glow of love and friendship the fervent kiss nothing in argument or logic but unsurpass d in proverbs in religious ecstasy in suggestions of common mortality and death man s great equalizers the spirit everything the ceremonies and forms of the churches nothing faith limitless its immense sensuousness immensely spiritual an incredible all inclusive non worldliness and dew scented illiteracy the antipodes of our Nineteenth Century business absorption and morbid refinement no hair splitting doubts no sickly sulking and sniffling no Hamlet no Adonais no Thanatopsis no In Memoriam The culminated proof of the poetry of a country is the quality of its personnel which in any race can never be really superior without superior poems The finest blending of individuality with universality in my opinion nothing out of the galaxies of the Iliad or Shakspere s heroes or from the Tennysonian Idylls so lofty devoted and starlike typified in the songs of those old Asiatic lands Men and women as great columnar trees Nowhere else the abnegation of self towering in such quaint sublimity nowhere else the simplest human emotions conquering the gods of heaven and fate itself The episode for instance toward the close of the Mahabharata the journey of the wife Savitri with the god of death Yama One terrible to see blood red his garb His body huge and dark bloodshot his eyes Which flamed like suns beneath his turban cloth Arm d was he with a noose who carries off the soul of the dead husband the wife tenaciously following and by the resistless charm of perfect poetic recitation eventually redeeming her captive mate I remember how enthusiastically William H Seward in his last days once expatiated on these themes from his travels in Turkey Egypt and Asia Minor finding the oldest Biblical narratives exactly illustrated there to day with apparently no break or change along three thousand years the veil d women the costumes the gravity and simplicity all the manners just the same The veteran Trelawney said he found the only real nobleman of the world in a good average specimen of the mid aged or elderly Oriental In the East the grand figure always leading is the old man majestic with flowing beard paternal c In Europe and America it is as we know the young fellow in novels a handsome and interesting hero more or less juvenile in operas a tenor with blooming cheeks black mustache superficial animation and perhaps good lungs but no more depth than skim milk But reading folks probably get their information of those Bible areas and current peoples as depicted in print by English and French cads the most shallow impudent supercilious brood on earth I have said nothing yet of the cumulus of associations perfectly legitimate parts of its influence and finally in many respects the dominant parts of the Bible as a poetic entity and of every portion of it Not the old edifice only the congeries also of events and struggles and surroundings of which it has been the scene and motive even the horrors dreads deaths How many ages and generations have brooded and wept and agonized over this book What untellable joys and ecstasies what support to martyrs at the stake from it No really great song can ever attain full purport till long after the death of its singer till it has accrued and incorporated the many passions many joys and sorrows it has itself arous d To what myriads has it been the shore and rock of safety the refuge from driving tempest and wreck Translated in all languages how it has united this diverse world Of civilized lands to day whose of our retrospects has it not interwoven and link d and permeated Not only does it bring us what is clasp d within its covers nay that is the least of what it brings Of its thousands there is not a verse not a word but is thick studded with human emotions successions of fathers and sons mothers and daughters of our own antecedents inseparable from that background of us on which phantasmal as it is all that we are to day inevitably depends our ancestry our past Strange but true that the principal factor in cohering the nations eras and paradoxes of the globe by giving them a common platform of two or three great ideas a commonalty of origin and projecting kosmic brotherhood the dream of all hope all time that the long trains gestations attempts and failures resulting in the New World and in modern solidarity and politics are to be identified and resolv d back into a collection of old poetic lore which more than any one thing else has been the axis of civilization and history through thousands of years and except for which this America of ours with its polity and essentials could not now be existing No true bard will ever contravene the Bible If the time ever comes when iconoclasm does its extremest in one direction against the Books of the Bible in its present form the collection must still survive in another and dominate just as much as hitherto or more than hitherto through its divine and primal poetic structure To me that is the living and definite element principle of the work evolving everything else Then the continuity the oldest and newest Asiatic utterance and character and all between holding together like the apparition of the sky and coming to us the same Even to our Nineteenth Century here are the fountain heads of song FATHER TAYLOR AND ORATORY I have never heard but one essentially perfect orator one who satisfied those depths of the emotional nature that in most cases go through life quite untouch d unfed who held every hearer by spells which no conventionalist high or low nor any pride or composure nor resistance of intellect could stand against for ten minutes And by the way is it not strange of this first class genius in the rarest and most profound of humanity s arts that it will be necessary so nearly forgotten and rubb d out is his name by the rushing whirl of the last twenty five years to first inform current readers that he was an orthodox minister of no particular celebrity who during a long life preach d especially to Yankee sailors in an old fourth class church down by the wharves in Boston had practically been a seafaring man through his earlier years and died April six eighteen seventy one just as the tide turn d going out with the ebb as an old salt should His name is now comparatively unknown outside of Boston and even there though Dickens mister Jameson doctor Bartol and Bishop Haven have commemorated him is mostly but a reminiscence During my visits to the Hub in eighteen fifty nine and sixty I several times saw and heard Father Taylor In the spring or autumn quiet Sunday forenoons I liked to go down early to the quaint ship cabin looking church where the old man minister d to enter and leisurely scan the building the low ceiling everything strongly timber d polish d and rubb d apparently the dark rich colors the gallery all in half light and smell the aroma of old wood to watch the auditors sailors mates matlows officers singly or in groups as they came in their physiognomies forms dress gait as they walk d along the aisles their postures seating themselves in the rude roomy undoor d uncushion d pews and the evident effect upon them of the place occasion and atmosphere The pulpit rising ten or twelve feet high against the rear wall was back d by a significant mural painting in oil showing out its bold lines and strong hues through the subdued light of the building of a stormy sea the waves high rolling and amid them an old style ship all bent over driving through the gale and in great peril a vivid and effectual piece of limning not meant for the criticism of artists though I think it had merit even from that standpoint but for its effect upon the congregation and what it would convey to them Father Taylor was a moderate sized man indeed almost small reminded me of old Booth the great actor and my favorite of those and preceding days well advanced in years but alert with mild blue or gray eyes and good presence and voice Soon as he open d his mouth I ceas d to pay any attention to church or audience or pictures or lights and shades a far more potent charm entirely sway d me In the course of the sermon there was no sign of any MS or reading from notes some of the parts would be in the highest degree majestic and picturesque Colloquial in a severe sense it often lean d to Biblical and Oriental forms Especially were all allusions to ships and the ocean and sailors lives of unrival d power and life likeness Sometimes there were passages of fine language and composition even from the purist s point of view A few arguments and of the best but always brief and simple One realized what grip there might have been in such words of mouth talk as that of Socrates and Epictetus In the main I should say of any of these discourses that the old Demosthenean rule and requirement of action action action first in its inward and then very moderate and restrain d its outward sense was the quality that had leading fulfilment I remember I felt the deepest impression from the old man s prayers which invariably affected me to tears Never on similar or any other occasions have I heard such impassion d pleading such human harassing reproach like Hamlet to his mother in the closet such probing to the very depths of that latent conscience and remorse which probably lie somewhere in the background of every life every soul For when Father Taylor preach d or pray d the rhetoric and art the mere words which usually play such a big part seem d altogether to disappear and the live feeling advanced upon you and seiz d you with a power before unknown Everybody felt this marvellous and awful influence One young sailor a Rhode Islander who came every Sunday and I got acquainted with and talk d to once or twice as we went away told me that must be the Holy Ghost we read of in the Testament I should be at a loss to make any comparison with other preachers or public speakers When a child I had heard Elias Hicks and Father Taylor though so different in personal appearance for Elias was of tall and most shapely form with black eyes that blazed at times like meteors always reminded me of him Both had the same inner apparently inexhaustible fund of latent volcanic passion the same tenderness blended with a curious remorseless firmness as of some surgeon operating on a belov d patient Hearing such men sends to the winds all the books and formulas and polish d speaking and rules of oratory Talking of oratory why is it that the unsophisticated practices often strike deeper than the train d ones Why do our experiences perhaps of some local country exhorter or often in the West or South at political meetings bring the most definite results In my time I have heard Webster Clay Edward Everett Phillips and such celebres yet I recall the minor but life eloquence of men like John P Hale Cassius Clay and one or two of the old abolition fanatics ahead of all those stereotyped fames Is not I sometimes question the first last and most important quality of all in training for a finish d speaker generally unsought unreck d of both by teacher and pupil Though may be it cannot be taught anyhow At any rate we need to clearly understand the distinction between oratory and elocution Under the latter art including some of high order there is indeed no scarcity in the United States preachers lawyers actors lecturers c With all there seem to be few real orators almost none I repeat and would dwell upon it more as suggestion than mere fact among all the brilliant lights of bar or stage I have heard in my time for years in New York and other cities I haunted the courts to witness notable trials and have heard all the famous actors and actresses that have been in America the past fifty years though I recall marvellous effects from one or other of them I never had anything in the way of vocal utterance to shake me through and through and become fix d with its accompaniments in my memory like those prayers and sermons like Father Taylor s personal electricity and the whole scene there the prone ship in the gale and dashing wave and foam for background in the little old sea church in Boston those summer Sundays just before the secession war broke out THE SPANISH ELEMENT IN OUR NATIONALITY Our friends at Santa Fe New Mexico have just finish d their long drawn out anniversary of the three hundred thirty threed year of the settlement of their city by the Spanish The good gray Walt Whitman was asked to write them a poem in commemoration Instead he wrote them a letter as follows Philadelphia Press August five eighteen eighty three CAMDEN NEW JERSEY July twenty eighteen eighty three To Messrs Griffin Martinez Prince and other Gentlemen at Santa Fe DEAR SIRS Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the three hundred thirty threed Anniversary of founding Santa Fe has reach d me so late that I have to decline with sincere regret But I will say a few words offhand We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents and sort them to unify them They will be found ampler than has been supposed and in widely different sources Thus far impress d by New England writers and schoolmasters we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our United States have been fashion d from the British Islands only and essentially form a second England only which is a very great mistake Many leading traits for our future national personality and some of the best ones will certainly prove to have originated from other than British stock As it is the British and German valuable as they are in the concrete already threaten excess Or rather I should say they have certainly reach d that excess To day something outside of them and to counterbalance them is seriously needed The seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States in their present devouring relations controlling and belittling everything else are in my opinion but a vast and indispensable stage in the new world s development and are certainly to be follow d by something entirely different at least by immense modifications Character literature a society worthy the name are yet to be establish d through a nationality of noblest spiritual heroic and democratic attributes not one of which at present definitely exists entirely different from the past though unerringly founded on it and to justify it To that composite American identity of the future Spanish character will supply some of the most needed parts No stock shows a grander historic retrospect grander in religiousness and loyalty or for patriotism courage decorum gravity and honor It is time to dismiss utterly the illusion compound half raw head and bloody bones and half Mysteries of Udolpho inherited from the English writers of the past two hundred years It is time to realize for it is certainly true that there will not be found any more cruelty tyranny superstition c in the resume of past Spanish history than in the corresponding resume of Anglo Norman history Nay I think there will not be found so much Then another point relating to American ethnology past and to come I will here touch upon at a venture As to our aboriginal or Indian population the Aztec in the South and many a tribe in the North and West I know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence a blank But I am not at all clear about that As America from its many far back sources and current supplies develops adapts entwines faithfully identifies its own are we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside globe and then rejecting the only ones distinctively its own the autochthonic ones As to the Spanish stock of our Southwest it is certain to me that we do not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element Who knows but that element like the course of some subterranean river dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action If I might assume to do so I would like to send you the most cordial heartfelt congratulations of your American fellow countrymen here You have more friends in the Northern and Atlantic regions than you suppose and they are deeply interested in the development of the great Southwestern interior and in what your festival would arouse to public attention Very respectfully c WALT WHITMAN WHAT LURKS BEHIND SHAKSPERE S HISTORICAL PLAYS We all know how much mythus there is in the Shakspere question as it stands to day Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf d far more dim and elusive ones of deepest importance tantalizing and half suspected suggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement But coming at once to the point the English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances my maturest judgment confirming the impressions of my early years that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions but those founded on the contests of English dynasties and the French wars but form as we get it all the chief in a complexity of puzzles Conceiv d out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism personifying in unparallel d ways the mediaeval aristocracy its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste with its own peculiar air and arrogance no mere imitation only one of the wolfish earls so plenteous in the plays themselves or some born descendant and knower might seem to be the true author of those amazing works works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature The start and germ stock of the pieces on which the present speculation is founded are undoubtedly with at the outset no small amount of bungling work in Henry VI It is plain to me that as profound and forecasting a brain and pen as ever appear d in literature after floundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogy or perhaps draughting it more or less experimentally or by accident afterward developed and defined his plan in the Second and Third Parts and from time to time thenceforward systematically enlarged it to majestic and mature proportions in Richard II Richard III King John Henry IV Henry V and even in Macbeth Coriolanus and Lear For it is impossible to grasp the whole cluster of those plays however wide the intervals and different circumstances of their composition without thinking of them as in a free sense the result of an essentially controling plan What was that plan Or rather what was veil d behind it for to me there was certainly something so veil d Even the episodes of Cade Joan of Arc and the like which sometimes seem to me like interpolations allow d may be meant to foil the possible sleuth and throw any too cute pursuer off the scent In the whole matter I should specially dwell on and make much of that inexplicable element of every highest poetic nature which causes it to cover up and involve its real purpose and meanings in folded removes and far recesses Of this trait hiding the nest where common seekers may never find it the Shaksperean works afford the most numerous and mark d illustrations known to me I would even call that trait the leading one through the whole of those works All the foregoing to premise a brief statement of how and where I get my new light on Shakspere Speaking of the special English plays my friend William O Connor says They seem simply and rudely historical in their motive as aiming to give in the rough a tableau of warring dynasties and carry to me a lurking sense of being in aid of some ulterior design probably well enough understood in that age which perhaps time and criticism will reveal Their atmosphere is one of barbarous and tumultuous gloom they do not make us love the times they limn and it is impossible to believe that the greatest of the Elizabethan men could have sought to indoctrinate the age with the love of feudalism which his own drama in its entirety if the view taken of it herein be true certainly and subtly saps and mines Reading the just specified play in the light of mister O Connor s suggestion I defy any one to escape such new and deep utterance meanings like magic ink warm d by the fire and previously invisible Will it not indeed be strange if the author of Othello and Hamlet is destin d to live in America in a generation or two less as the cunning draughtsman of the passions and more as putting on record the first full expose and by far the most vivid one immeasurably ahead of doctrinaires and economists of the political theory and results or the reason why and necessity for them which America has come on earth to abnegate and replace The summary of my suggestion would be therefore that while the more the rich and tangled jungle of the Shaksperean area is travers d and studied and the more baffled and mix d as so far appears becomes the exploring student who at last surmises everything and remains certain of nothing it is possible a future age of criticism diving deeper mapping the land and lines freer completer than hitherto may discover in the plays named the scientific Baconian inauguration of modern democracy furnishing realistic and first class artistic portraitures of the mediaeval world the feudal personalities institutes in their morbid accumulations deposits upon politics and sociology may penetrate to that hard pan far down and back of the ostent of to day on which and on which only the progressism of the last two centuries has built this Democracy which now hold s secure lodgment over the whole civilized world Whether such was the unconscious or as I think likely the more or less conscious purpose of him who fashion d those marvellous architectonics is a secondary question A THOUGHT ON SHAKSPERE The most distinctive poems the most permanently rooted and with heartiest reason for being the copious cycle of Arthurian legends or the almost equally copious Charlemagne cycle or the poems of the Cid or Scandinavian Eddas or Nibelungen or Chaucer or Spenser or bona fide Ossian or Inferno probably had their rise in the great historic perturbations which they came in to sum up and confirm indirectly embodying results to date Then however precious to culture the grandest of those poems it may be said preserve and typify results offensive to the modern spirit and long past away To state it briefly and taking the strongest examples in Homer lives the ruthless military prowess of Greece and of its special god descended dynastic houses in Shakspere the dragon rancors and stormy feudal Splendor of mediaeval caste Poetry largely consider d is an evolution sending out improved and ever expanded types in one sense the past even the best of it necessarily giving place and dying out For our existing world the bases on which all the grand old poems were built have become vacuums and even those of many comparatively modern ones are broken and half gone For us to day not their own intrinsic value vast as that is backs and maintains those poems but a mountain high growth of associations the layers of successive ages Everywhere their own lands included is there not something terrible in the tenacity with which the one book out of millions holds its grip the Homeric and Virgilian works the interminable ballad romances of the middle ages the utterances of Dante Spenser and others are upheld by their cumulus entrenchment in scholarship and as precious always welcome unspeakably valuable reminiscences Even the one who at present reigns unquestion d of Shakspere for all he stands for so much in modern literature he stands entirely for the mighty esthetic sceptres of the past not for the spiritual and democratic the sceptres of the future The inward and outward characteristics of Shakspere are his vast and rich variety of persons and themes with his wondrous delineation of each and all not only limitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource but great excess superfoetation mannerism like a fine aristocratic perfume holding a touch of musk Euphues his mark with boundless sumptuousness and adornment real velvet and gems not shoddy nor paste but a good deal of bombast and fustian certainly some terrific mouthing in Shakspere Superb and inimitable as all is it is mostly an objective and physiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in Shakspere a style supremely grand of the sort but in my opinion stopping short of the grandest sort at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern and scientific and democratic American purposes Think not of growths as forests primeval or Yellowstone geysers or Colorado ravines but of costly marble palaces and palace rooms and the noblest fixings and furniture and noble owners and occupants to correspond think of carefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening art at its best with walks and bowers and artificial lakes and appropriate statue groups and the finest cultivated roses and lilies and japonicas in plenty and you have the tally of Shakspere The low characters mechanics even the loyal henchmen all in themselves nothing serve as capital foils to the aristocracy The comedies exquisite as they certainly are bringing in admirably portray d common characters have the unmistakable hue of plays portraits made for the divertisement only of the elite of the castle and from its point of view The comedies are altogether non acceptable to America and Democracy But to the deepest soul it seems a shame to pick and choose from the riches Shakspere has left us to criticise his infinitely royal multiform quality to gauge with optic glasses the dazzle of his sun like beams The best poetic utterance after all can merely hint or remind often very indirectly or at distant removes Aught of real perfection or the solution of any deep problem or any completed statement of the moral the true the beautiful eludes the greatest deftest poet flies away like an always uncaught bird ROBERT BURNS AS POET AND PERSON What the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works what place will be assign d them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which can only be finish d by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries with their ample average I of course cannot tell But as we know him from his recorded utterances and after nearly one century and its diligence of collections songs letters anecdotes presenting the figure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully complete and the lines mainly by his own hand he forms to day in some respects the most interesting personality among singers Then there are many things in Burns s poems and character that specially endear him to America He was essentially a Republican would have been at home in the Western United States and probably become eminent there He was an average sample of the good natured warm blooded proud spirited amative alimentive convivial young and early middle aged man of the decent born middle classes everywhere and any how Without the race of which he is a distinct specimen and perhaps his poems America and her powerful Democracy could not exist to day could not project with unparallel d historic sway into the future Perhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first to be consider d It included the times of the seventy six eighty three Revolution in America of the French Revolution and an unparallel d chaos development in Europe and elsewhere In every department shining and strange names like stars some rising some in meridian some declining Voltaire Franklin Washington Kant Goethe Fulton Napoleon mark the era And while so much and of grandest moment fit for the trumpet of the world s fame was being transacted that little tragi comedy of R B s life and death was going on in a country by place in Scotland Burns s correspondence generally collected and publish d since his death gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak and worse than weak parts of his portraiture habits good and bad luck ambition and associations His letters to missus Dunlop missus McLehose Clarinda mister Thompson doctor Moore Robert Muir mister Cunningham Miss Margaret Chalmers Peter Hill Richard Brown missus Riddel Robert Ainslie and Robert Graham afford valuable lights and shades to the outline and with numerous others help to a touch here and fill in there of poet and poems There are suspicions it is true of the Genteel Letter Writer with scraps and words from the Manual of French Quotations and in the love letters some hollow mouthings Yet we wouldn t on any account lack the letters A full and true portrait is always what is wanted veracity at every hazard Besides do we not all see by this time that the story of Burns even for its own sake requires the record of the whole and several with nothing left out Completely and every point minutely told out its fullest explains and justifies itself as perhaps almost any life does He is very close to the earth He pick d up his best words and tunes directly from the Scotch home singers but tells Thompson they would not please his T s learn d lugs adding I call them simple you would pronounce them silly Yes indeed the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit Yet doctor Moore in seventeen eighty nine writes to Burns If I were to offer an opinion it would be that in your future productions you should abandon the Scotch stanza and dialect and adopt the measure and language of modern English poetry As the one hundred and twenty eighth birth anniversary of the poet draws on January eighteen eighty seven with its increasing club suppers vehement celebrations letters speeches and so on mostly as William O Connor says from people who would not have noticed R B at all during his actual life nor kept his company or read his verses on any account it may be opportune to print some leisurely jotted notes I find in my budget I take my observation of the Scottish bard by considering him as an individual amid the crowded clusters galaxies of the old world and fairly inquiring and suggesting what out of these myriads he too may be to the Western Republic In the first place no poet on record so fully bequeaths his own personal magnetism thirty nine nor illustrates more pointedly how one s verses by time and reading can so curiously fuse with the versifier s own life and death and give final light and shade to all I would say a large part of the fascination of Burns s homely simple dialect melodies is due for all current and future readers to the poet s personal errors the general bleakness of his lot his ingrain d pensiveness his brief dash into dazzling tantalizing evanescent sunshine finally culminating in those last years of his life his being taboo d and in debt sick and sore yaw d as by contending gales deeply dissatisfied with everything most of all with himself high spirited too no man ever really higher spirited than Robert Burns I think it a perfectly legitimate part too At any rate it has come to be an impalpable aroma through which only both the songs and their singer must henceforth be read and absorb d Through that view medium of misfortune of a noble spirit in low environments and of a squalid and premature death we view the undoubted facts giving as we read them now a sad kind of pungency that Burns s were before all else the lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication Perhaps even it is this strange impalpable post mortem comment and influence referr d to that gives them their contrast attraction making the zest of their author s after fame If he had lived steady fat moral comfortable well to do years on his own grade let alone what of course was out of the question the ease and velvet and rosewood and copious royalties of Tennyson or Victor Hugo or Longfellow and died well ripen d and respectable where could have come in that burst of passionate sobbing and remorse which well d forth instantly and generally in Scotland and soon follow d everywhere among English speaking races on the announcement of his death and which with no sign of stopping only regulated and vein d with fitting appreciation flows deeply widely yet Dear Rob manly witty fond friendly full of weak spots as well as strong ones essential type of so many thousands perhaps the average as just said of the decent born young men and the early mid aged not only of the British Isles but America too North and South just the same I think indeed one best part of Burns is the unquestionable proof he presents of the perennial existence among the laboring classes especially farmers of the finest latent poetic elements in their blood How clear it is to me that the common soil has always been and is now thickly strewn with just such gems He is well called the Ploughman Holding the plough said his brother Gilbert was the favorite situation with Robert for poetic compositions and some of his best verses were produced while he was at that exercise I must return to my humble station and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way at the plough tail seventeen eighty seven to the Earl of Buchan He has no high ideal of the poet or the poet s office indeed quite a low and contracted notion of both Fortune if thou ll but gie me still Hale breeks a scone and whiskey gill An rowth o rhyme to rave at will Tak a the rest See also his rhym d letters to Robert Graham invoking patronage one stronghold Lord Glencairn being dead now these appeals to Fintra my other stay with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation generally In his collected poems there is no particular unity nothing that can be called a leading theory no unmistakable spine or skeleton Perhaps indeed their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs I take up one or another he says in a letter to Thompson just as the bee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet lug Consonantly with the customs of the time yet markedly inconsistent in spirit with Burns s own case and not a little painful as it remains on record as depicting some features of the bard himself the relation called patronage existed between the nobility and gentry on one side and literary people on the other and gives one of the strongest side lights to the general coloring of poems and poets It crops out a good deal in Burns s Letters and even necessitated a certain flunkeyism on occasions through life It probably with its requirements while it help d in money and countenance did as much as any one cause in making that life a chafed and unhappy one ended by a premature and miserable death Yes there is something about Burns peculiarly acceptable to the concrete human points of view He poetizes work a day agricultural labor and life whose spirit and sympathies as well as practicalities are much the same everywhere and treats fresh often coarse natural occurrences loves persons not like many new and some old poets in a genteel style of gilt and china or at second or third removes but in their own born atmosphere laughter sweat unction Perhaps no one ever sang lads and lasses that universal race mainly the same too all ages all lands down on their own plane as he has He exhibits no philosophy worth mentioning his morality is hardly more than parrot talk not bad or deficient but cheap shopworn the platitudes of old aunts and uncles to the youngsters be good boys and keep your noses clean Only when he gets at Poosie Nansie s celebrating the barley bree or among tramps or democratic bouts and drinking generally Freedom and whiskey gang the gither we have in his own unmistakable color and warmth those interiors of rake helly life and tavern fun the cantabile of jolly beggars in highest jinks lights and groupings of rank glee and brawny amorousness outvying the best painted pictures of the Dutch school or any school By America and her democracy such a poet I cannot too often repeat must be kept in loving remembrance but it is best that discriminations be made His admirers as at those anniversary suppers over the hot Scotch will not accept for their favorite anything less than the highest rank alongside of Homer Shakspere et cetera Such in candor are not the true friends of the Ayrshire bard who really needs a different place quite by himself The Iliad and the Odyssey express courage craft full grown heroism in situations of danger the sense of command and leadership emulation the last and fullest evolution of self poise as in kings and god like even while animal appetites The Shaksperean compositions on vertebers and frame work of the primary passions portray essentially the same as Homer s the spirit and letter of the feudal world the Norman lord ambitious and arrogant taller and nobler than common men with much underplay and gusts of heat and cold volcanoes and stormy seas Burns and some will say to his credit attempts none of these themes He poetizes the humor riotous blood sulks amorous torments fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective nature with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his time and land of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in Scotland through the years and under the circumstances of the British politics of that time and of his short personal career as author from seventeen eighty three to seventeen ninety six He is intuitive and affectionate and just emerged or emerging from the shackles of the kirk from poverty ignorance and from his own rank appetites out of which latter however he never extricated himself It is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his poems there is in almost every piece a spark of fire and now and then the real afflatus He has been applauded as democratic and with some warrant while Shakspere and with the greatest warrant has been called monarchical or aristocratic which he certainly is But the splendid personalizations of Shakspere formulated on the largest freest most heroic most artistic mould are to me far dearer as lessons and more precious even as models for Democracy than the humdrum samples Burns presents The motives of some of his effusions are certainly discreditable personally one or two of them markedly so He has moreover little or no spirituality This last is his mortal flaw and defect tried by highest standards The ideal he never reach d and yet I think he leads the way to it He gives melodies and now and then the simplest and sweetest ones but harmonies complications oratorios in words never I do not speak this in any deprecatory sense Blessed be the memory of the warm hearted Scotchman for what he has left us just as it is He likewise did not know himself in more ways than one Though so really fret and independent he prided himself in his songs on being a reactionist and a Jacobite on persistent sentimental adherency to the cause of the Stuarts the weakest thinnest most faithless brainless dynasty that ever held a throne Thus while Burns is not at all great for New World study in the sense that Isaiah and Eschylus and the book of Job are unquestionably great is not to be mention d with Shakspere hardly even with current Tennyson or our Emerson he has a nestling niche of his own all fragrant fond and quaint and homely a lodge built near but outside the mighty temple of the gods of song and art those universal strivers through their works of harmony and melody and power to ever show or intimate man s crowning last victorious fusion in himself of Real and Ideal Precious too fit and precious beyond all singers high or low will Burns ever be to the native Scotch especially to the working classes of North Britain so intensely one of them and so racy of the soil sights and local customs He often apostrophizes Scotland and is or would be enthusiastically patriotic His country has lately commemorated him in a statue forty His aim is declaredly to be a Rustic Bard His poems were all written in youth or young manhood he was little more than a young man when he died His collected works in giving everything are nearly one half first drafts His brightest hit is his use of the Scotch patois so full of terms flavor d like wild fruits or berries Then I should make an allowance to Burns which cannot be made for any other poet Curiously even the frequent crudeness haste deficiencies flatness and puerilities by no means absent prove upon the whole not out of keeping in any comprehensive collection of his works heroically printed following copy every piece every line according to originals Other poets might tremble for such boldness such rawness In this odd kind chiel such points hardly mar the rest Not only are they in consonance with the underlying spirit of the pieces but complete the full abandon and veracity of the farm fields and the home brew d flavor of the Scotch vernacular Is there not often something in the very neglect unfinish careless nudity slovenly hiatus coming from intrinsic genius and not put on that secretly pleases the soul more than the wrought and re wrought polish of the most perfect verse Mark the native spice and untranslatable twang in the very names of his songs O for ane and twenty Tam John Barleycorn Last May a braw Wooer Rattlin roarin Willie O wert thou in the cauld cauld blast Gude e en to you Kimmer Merry hae I been teething a Heckle O lay thy loof in mine lass and others The longer and more elaborated poems of Burns are just such as would please a natural but homely taste and cute but average intellect and are inimitable in their way The Twa Dogs one of the best with the conversation between Cesar and Luath the Brigs of Ayr the Cotter s Saturday Night Tam O Shanter all will be long read and re read and admired and ever deserve to be With nothing profound in any of them what there is of moral and plot has an inimitably fresh and racy flavor If it came to question Literature could well afford to send adrift many a pretensive poem and even book of poems before it could spare these compositions Never indeed was there truer utterance in a certain range of idiosyncrasy than by this poet Hardly a piece of his large or small but has snap and raciness He puts in cantering rhyme often doggerel much cutting irony and idiomatic ear cuffing of the kirk deacons drilygood natured addresses to his cronies he certainly would not stop us if he were here this moment from classing that to the De il among them to Mailie and her Lambs to auld Mare Maggie to a Mouse Wee sleekit cowrin tim rous beastie to a Mountain Daisy to a Haggis to a Louse to the Toothache c and occasionally to his brother bards and lady or gentleman patrons often with strokes of tenderest sensibility idiopathic humor and genuine poetic imagination still oftener with shrewd original sheeny steel flashes of wit home spun sense or lance blade puncturing Then strangely the basis of Burns s character with all its fun and manliness was hypochondria the blues palpable enough in Despondency Man was made to Mourn Address to Ruin a Bard s Epitaph c From such deep down elements sprout up in very contrast and paradox those riant utterances of which a superficial reading will not detect the hidden foundation Yet nothing is clearer to me than the black and desperate background behind those pieces as I shall now specify them I find his most characteristic Nature s masterly touch and luxuriant life blood color and heat not in Tam O Shanter the Cotter s Saturday Night Scots wha hae Highland Mary the Twa Dogs and the like but in the Jolly Beggars Rigs of Barley Scotch Drink the Epistle to John Rankine Holy Willie s Prayer and in Halloween to say nothing of a certain cluster known still to a small inner circle in Scotland but for good reasons not published anywhere In these compositions especially the first there is much indelicacy some editions flatly leave it out but the composer reigns alone with handling free and broad and true and is an artist You may see and feel the man indirectly in his other verses all of them with more or less life likeness but these I have named last call out pronouncedly in his own voice I Rob am here Finally in any summing up of Burns though so much is to be said in the way of fault finding drawing black marks and doubtless severe literary criticism in the present outpouring I have kept myself in rather than allow d any free flow after full retrospect of his works and life the aforesaid odd kind chiel remains to my heart and brain as almost the tenderest manliest and even if contradictory dearest flesh and blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by gone poets Notes thirty nine Probably no man that ever lived a friend has made the statement was so fondly loved both by men and women as Robert Burns The reason is not hard to find he had a real heart of flesh and blood beating in his bosom you could almost hear it throb Some one said that if you had shaken hands with him his hand would have burnt yours The gods indeed made him poetical but Nature had a hand in him first His heart was in the right place he did not pile up cantos of poetic diction he pluck d the mountain daisy under his feet he wrote of field mouse hurrying from its ruin d dwelling He held the plough or the pen with the same firm manly grasp And he was loved The simple roll of the women who gave him their affection and their sympathy would make a long manuscript and most of these were of such noble worth that as Robert Chambers says their character may stand as a testimony in favor of that of Burns As I understand the foregoing is from an extremely rare book publish d by M Kie in Kilmarnock I find the whole beautiful paragraph in a capital paper on Burns by Amelia Barr forty The Dumfries statue of Robert Burns was successfully unveil d April eighteen eighty one by Lord Rosebery the occasion having been made national in its character Before the ceremony a large procession paraded the streets of the town all the trades and societies of that part of Scotland being represented at the head of which went dairymen and ploughmen the former driving their carts and being accompanied by their maids The statue is of Sicilian marble It rests on a pedestal of gray stone five feet high The poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree root holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies His face is turn d toward the right shoulder and the eyes gaze into the distance Near by lie a collie dog a broad bonnet half covering a well thumb d song book and a rustic flageolet The costume is taken from the Nasmyth portrait which has been follow d for the features of the face A WORD ABOUT TENNYSON Beautiful as the song was the original Locksley Hall of half a century ago was essentially morbid heart broken finding fault with everything especially the fact of money s being made as it ever must be and perhaps should be the paramount matter in worldly affairs Every door is barr d with gold and opens but to golden keys First a father having fallen in battle his child the singer Was left a trampled orphan and a selfish uncle s ward Of course love ensues The woman in the chant or monologue proves a false one and as far as appears the ideal of woman in the poet s reflections is a false one at any rate for America Woman is not the lesser man The heart is not the brain The best of the piece of fifty years since is its concluding line For the mighty wind arises roaring seaward and I go Then for this current eighteen eighty six seven a just out sequel which as an apparently authentic summary says reviews the life of mankind during the past sixty years and comes to the conclusion that its boasted progress is of doubtful credit to the world in general and to England in particular A cynical vein of denunciation of democratic opinions and aspirations runs throughout the poem in mark d contrast with the spirit of the poet s youth Among the most striking lines of this sequel are the following Envy wears the mask of love and laughing sober fact to scorn Cries to weakest as to strongest Ye are equals equal born Equal born Oh yes if yonder hill be level with the flat Charm us orator till the lion look no larger than the cat Till the cat through that mirage of overheated language loom Larger than the lion Demo end in working its own doom Tumble Nature heel o er head and yelling with the yelling street Set the feet above the brain and swear the brain is in the feet Bring the old dark ages back without the faith without the hope Beneath the State the Church the Throne and roll their ruins down the slope I should say that all this is a legitimate consequence of the tone and convictions of the earlier standards and points of view Then some reflections down to the hard pan of this sort of thing The course of progressive politics democracy is so certain and resistless not only in America but in Europe that we can well afford the warning calls threats checks neutralizings in imaginative literature or any department of such deep sounding and high soaring voices as Carlyle s and Tennyson s Nay the blindness excesses of the prevalent tendency the dangers of the urgent trends of our times in my opinion need such voices almost more than any I should too call it a signal instance of democratic humanity s luck that it has such enemies to contend with so candid so fervid so heroic But why do I say enemies Upon the whole is not Tennyson and was not Carlyle like an honest and stern physician the true friend of our age Let me assume to pass verdict or perhaps momentary judgment for the United States on this poet a remov d and distant position giving some advantages over a nigh one What is Tennyson s service to his race times and especially to America First I should say or at least not forget his personal character He is not to be mention das a rugged evolutionary aboriginal force but and a great lesson is in it he has been consistent throughout with the native healthy patriotic spinal element and promptings of himself His moral line is local and conventional but it is vital and genuine He reflects the uppercrust of his time its pale cast of thought even its ennui Then the simile of my friend John Burroughs is entirely true his glove is a glove of silk but the hand is a hand of iron He shows how one can be a royal laureate quite elegant and aristocratic and a little queer and affected and at the same time perfectly manly and natural As to his non democracy it fits him well and I like him the better for it I guess we all like to have I am sure I do some one who presents those sides of a thought or possibility different from our own different and yet with a sort of home likeness a tartness and contradiction offsetting the theory as we view it and construed from tastes and proclivities not at all his own To me Tennyson shows more than any poet I know perhaps has been a warning to me how much there is in finest verbalism There is such a latent charm in mere words cunning collocutions and in the voice ringing them which he has caught and brought out beyond all others as in the line And hollow hollow hollow all delight in The Passing of Arthur and evidenced in The Lady of Shalott The Deserted House and many other pieces Among the best I often linger over them again and again are Lucretius The Lotos Eaters and The Northern Farmer His mannerism is great but it is a noble and welcome mannerism His very best work to me is contain d in the books of The Idylls of the King and all that has grown out of them Though indeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson however small or however peculiar not Break Break nor Flower in the Crannied Wall nor the old eternally told passion of Edward Gray Love may come and love may go And fly like a bird from tree to tree But I will love no more no more Till Ellen Adair come back to me Yes Alfred Tennyson s is a superb character and will help give illustriousness through the long roll of time to our Nineteenth Century In its bunch of orbic names shining like a constellation of stars his will be one of the brightest His very faults doubts swervings doublings upon himself have been typical of our age We are like the voyagers of a ship casting off for new seas distant shores We would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts remembering and magnifying their pleasant experiences only and more than once impell d to jump ashore before it is too late and stay where our fathers stay d and live as they lived May be I am non literary and non decorous let me at least be human and pay part of my debt in this word about Tennyson I want him to realize that here is a great and ardent Nation that absorbs his songs and has a respect and affection for him personally as almost for no other foreigner I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as conveying no more than the simple truth and that truth a little Christmas gift no slight one either I have written impromptu and shall let it all go at that The readers of more than fifty millions of people in the New World not only owe to him some of their most agreeable and harmless and healthy hours but he has enter d into the formative influences of character here not only in the Atlantic cities but inland and far West out in Missouri in Kansas and away in Oregon in farmer s house and miner s cabin Best thanks anyhow to Alfred Tennyson thanks and appreciation in America s name SLANG IN AMERICA View d freely the English language is the accretion and growth of every dialect race and range of time and is both the free and compacted composition of all From this point of view it stands for Language in the largest sense and is really the greatest of studies It involves so much is indeed a sort of universal absorber combiner and conqueror The scope of its etymologies is the scope not only of man and civilization but the history of Nature in all departments and of the organic Universe brought up to date for all are comprehended in words and their backgrounds This is when words become vitaliz d and stand for things as they unerringly and soon come to do in the mind that enters on their study with fitting spirit grasp and appreciation Slang profoundly consider d is the lawless germinal element below all words and sentences and behind all poetry and proves a certain perennial rankness and protestantism in speech As the United States inherit by far their most precious possession the language they talk and write from the Old World under and out of its feudal institutes I will allow myself to borrow a simile even of those forms farthest removed from American Democracy Considering Language then as some mighty potentate into the majestic audience hall of the monarch ever enters a personage like one of Shakspere s clowns and takes position there and plays a part even in the stateliest ceremonies Such is Slang or indirection an attempt of common humanity to escape from bald literalism and express itself illimitably which in highest walks produces poets and poems and doubtless in pre historic times gave the start to and perfected the whole immense tangle of the old mythologies For curious as it may appear it is strictly the same impulse source the same thing Slang too is the wholesome fermentation or eructation of those processes eternally active in language by which froth and specks are thrown up mostly to pass away though occasionally to settle and permanently crystallize To make it plainer it is certain that many of the oldest and solidest words we use were originally generated from the daring and license of slang In the processes of word formation myriads die but here and there the attempt attracts superior meanings becomes valuable and indispensable and lives forever Thus the term right means literally only straight Wrong primarily meant twisted distorted Integrity meant oneness Spirit meant breath or flame A supercilious person was one who rais d his eyebrows To insult was to leap against If you influenced a man you but flow d into him The Hebrew word which is translated prophesy meant to bubble up and pour forth as a fountain The enthusiast bubbles up with the Spirit of God within him and it pours forth from him like a fountain The word prophecy is misunderstood Many suppose that it is limited to mere prediction that is but the lesser portion of prophecy The greater work is to reveal God Every true religious enthusiast is a prophet Language be it remember d is not an abstract construction of the learn d or of dictionary makers but is something arising out of the work needs ties joys affections tastes of long generations of humanity and has its bases broad and low close to the ground Its final decisions are made by the masses people nearest the concrete having most to do with actual land and sea It impermeates all the Past as well as the Present and is the grandest triumph of the human intellect Those mighty works of art says Addington Symonds which we call languages in the construction of which whole peoples unconsciously company operated the forms of which were determin d not by individual genius but by the instincts of successive generations acting to one end inherent in the nature of the race Those poems of pure thought and fancy cadenced not in words but in living imagery fountain heads of inspiration mirrors of the mind of nascent nations which we call Mythologies these surely are more marvellous in their infantine spontaneity than any more mature production of the races which evolv d them Yet we are utterly ignorant of their embryology the true science of Origins is yet in its cradle Daring as it is to say so in the growth of Language it is certain that the retrospect of slang from the start would be the recalling from their nebulous conditions of all that is poetical in the stores of human utterance Moreover the honest delving as of late years by the German and British workers in comparative philology has pierc d and dispers d many of the falsest bubbles of centuries and will disperse many more It was long recorded that in Scandinavian mythology the heroes in the Norse Paradise drank out of the skulls of their slain enemies Later investigation proves the word taken for skulls to mean horns of beasts slain in the hunt And what reader had not been exercis d over the traces of that feudal custom by which seigneurs warm d their feet in the bowels of serfs the abdomen being open d for the purpose It now is made to appear that the serf was only required to submit his unharm d abdomen as a foot cushion while his lord supp d and was required to chafe the legs of the seigneur with his hands It is curiously in embryons and childhood and among the illiterate we always find the groundwork and start of this great science and its noblest products What a relief most people have in speaking of a man not by his true and formal name with a Mister to it but by some odd or homely appellative The propensity to approach a meaning not directly and squarely but by circuitous styles of expression seems indeed a born quality of the common people everywhere evidenced by nick names and the inveterate determination of the masses to bestow sub titles sometimes ridiculous sometimes very apt Always among the soldiers during the secession war one heard of Little Mac general McClellan or of Uncle Billy general Sherman The old man was of course very common Among the rank and file both armies it was very general to speak of the different States they came from by their slang names Those from Maine were call d Foxes New Hampshire

names have more than once made Presidents Old Hickory general Jackson is one case in point Tippecanoe and Tyler too another I find the same rule in the people s conversations everywhere I heard this among the men of the city horse cars where the conductor is often call d a snatcher i e because his characteristic duty is to constantly pull or snatch the bell strap to stop or go on Two young fellows are having a friendly talk amid which says first conductor What did you do before you was a snatcher Answer of twod conductor Nail d Translation of answer I work d as carpenter What is a boom says one editor to another Esteem d contemporary says the other a boom is a bulge Barefoot whiskey is the Tennessee name for the undiluted stimulant In the slang of the New York common restaurant waiters a plate of ham and beans is known as stars and stripes codfish balls as sleeve buttons and hash as mystery The Western States of the Union are however as may be supposed the special areas of slang not only in conversation but in names of localities towns rivers et cetera A late Oregon traveller says On your way to Olympia by rail you cross a river called the Shookum Chuck your train stops at places named Newaukum Tumwater and Toutle and if you seek further you will hear of whole counties labell d Wahkiakum or Snohomish or Kitsar or Klikatat and Cowlitz Hookium and Nenolelops greet and offend you They complain in Olympia that Washington Territory gets but little immigration but what wonder What man having the whole American continent to choose from would willingly date his letters from the county of Snohomish or bring up his children in the city of Nenolelops The village of Tumwater is as I am ready to bear witness very pretty indeed but surely an emigrant would think twice before he establish d himself either there or at Toutle Seattle is sufficiently barbarous Stelicoom is no better and I suspect that the Northern Pacific Railroad terminus has been fixed at Tacoma because it is one of the few places on Puget Sound whose name does not inspire horror Then a Nevada paper chronicles the departure of a mining party from Reno The toughest set of roosters that ever

mister Harlan turn d me out for having written Leaves of Grass in the Interior Department at Washington in the Indian Bureau Along this time there came to see their Great Father an unusual number of aboriginal visitors delegations for treaties settlement of lands c some young or middle aged but mainly old men from the West North and occasionally from the South parties of from five to twenty each the most wonderful proofs of what Nature can produce the survival of the fittest no doubt all the frailer samples dropt sorted out by death as if to show how the earth and woods the attrition of storms and elements and the exigencies of life at first hand can train and fashion men indeed chiefs in heroic massiveness imperturbability muscle and that last and highest beauty consisting of strength the full exploitation and fruitage of a human identity not from the culmination points of culture and artificial civilization but tallying our race as it were with giant vital gnarl d enduring trees or monoliths of separate hardiest rocks and humanity holding its own with the best of the said trees or rocks and outdoing them There were Omahas Poncas Winnebagoes Cheyennes Navahos Apaches and many others Let me give a running account of what I see and hear through one of these conference collections at the Indian Bureau going back to the present tense Every head and face is impressive even artistic Nature redeems herself out of her crudest recesses Most have red paint on their cheeks however or some other paint Little Hill makes the opening speech which the interpreter translates by scraps Many wear head tires of gaudy color d braid wound around thickly some with circlets of eagles feathers Necklaces of bears claws are plenty around their necks Most of the chiefs are wrapt in large blankets of the brightest scarlet Two or three have blue and I see one black A wise man call d the Flesh now makes a short speech apparently asking something Indian Commissioner Dole answers him and the interpreter translates in scraps again All the principal chiefs have tomahawks or hatchets some of them very richly ornamented and costly Plaid shirts are to be observ d none too clean Now a tall fellow Hole in the Day is speaking He has a copious head dress composed of feathers and narrow ribbon under which appears a countenance painted all over a bilious yellow Let us note this young chief For all his paint Hole in the Day is a handsome Indian mild and calm dress d in drab buckskin leggings dark gray surtout and a soft black hat His costume will bear full observation and even fashion would accept him His apparel is worn loose and scant enough to show his superb physique especially in neck chest and legs The Apollo Belvidere was the involuntary exclamation of a famous European artist when he first saw a full grown young Choctaw One of the red visitors a wild lean looking Indian the one in the black woolen wrapper has an empty buffalo head with the horns on for his personal surmounting I see a markedly Bourbonish countenance among the chiefs it is not very uncommon among them I am told Most of them avoided resting on chairs during the hour of their talk in the Commissioner s office they would sit around on the floor leaning against something or stand up by the walls partially wrapt in their blankets Though some of the young fellows were as I have said magnificent and beautiful animals I think the palm of unique picturesqueness in body limb physiognomy c was borne by the old or elderly chiefs and the wise men My here alluded to experience in the Indian Bureau produced one very definite conviction as follows There is something about these aboriginal Americans in their highest characteristic representations essential traits and the ensemble of their physique and physiognomy something very remote very lofty arousing comparisons with our own civilized ideals something that our literature portrait painting c have never caught and that will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future even as a reminiscence No biographer no historian no artist has grasp d it perhaps could not grasp it It is so different so far outside our standards of eminent humanity Their feathers paint even the empty buffalo skull did not to say the least seem any more ludicrous to me than many of the fashions I have seen in civilized society I should not apply the word savage at any rate in the usual sense as a leading word in the description of those great aboriginal specimens of whom I certainly saw many of the best There were moments as I look d at them or studied them when our own exemplification of personality dignity heroic presentation anyhow as in the conventions of society or even in the accepted poems and plays seem d sickly puny inferior The interpreters agents of the Indian Department or other whites accompanying the bands in positions of responsibility were always interesting to me I had many talks with them Occasionally I would go to the hotels where the bands were quarter d and spend an hour or two informally Of course we could not have much conversation though through the interpreters more of this than might be supposed sometimes quite animated and significant I had the good luck to be invariably receiv d and treated by all of them in their most cordial manner Letter to W W from an artist B H who has been much among the American Indians I have just receiv d your little paper on the Indian delegations In the fourth paragraph you say that there is something about the essential traits of our aborigines which will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future If I am so fortunate as to regain my health I hope to weaken the force of that statement at least in so far as my talent and training will permit I intend to spend some years among them and shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer types both men and women and some of the characteristic features of their life It will certainly be well worth the while My artistic enthusiasm was never so thoroughly stirr d up as by the Indians They certainly have more of beauty dignity and nobility mingled with their own wild individuality than any of the other indigenous types of man Neither black nor Afghan Arab nor Malay and I know them all pretty well can hold a candle to the Indian All of the other aboriginal types seem to be more or less distorted from the model of perfect human form as we know it the blacks thin hipped with bulbous limbs not well mark d the Arabs large jointed c But I have seen many a young Indian as perfect in form and feature as a Greek statue very different from a Greek statue of course but as satisfying to the artistic perceptions and demand And the worst or perhaps the best of it all is that it will require an artist and a good one to record the real facts and impressions Ten thousand photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt painting Color is all important No one but an artist knows how much An Indian is only half an Indian without the blue black hair and the brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful dusky ochre and rose complexion SOME DIARY NOTES AT RANDOM NEGRO SLAVES IN NEW YORK I can myself almost remember negro slaves in New York State as my grandfather and great grandfather at West Hills Suffolk county New York own d a number The hard labor of the farm was mostly done by them and on the floor of the big kitchen toward sundown would be squatting a circle of twelve or fourteen pickaninnies eating their supper of pudding Indian corn mush and milk A friend of my grandfather named Wortman of Oyster Bay died in eighteen ten leaving ten slaves Jeanette Treadwell the last of them died suddenly in Flushing last summer eighteen eighty four at the age of ninety four years I remember old Mose one of the liberated West Hills slaves well He was very genial correct manly and cute and a great friend of my childhood CANADA NIGHTS Late in August Three wondrous nights Effects of moon clouds stars and night sheen never surpass d I am out every night enjoying all The sunset begins it I have said already how long evening lingers here The moon an hour high just after eight is past her half and looks somehow more like a human face up there than ever before As it grows later we have such gorgeous and broad cloud effects with Luna s tawny halos silver edgings great fleeces depths of blue black in patches and occasionally long low bars hanging silently a while and then gray bulging masses rolling along stately sometimes in long procession The moon travels in Scorpion to night and dims all the stars of that constellation except fiery Antares who keeps on shining just to the big one s side COUNTRY DAYS AND NIGHTS Sept thirty eighty two four point thirty A M I am down in Camden county New Jersey at the farmhouse of the Staffords have been looking a long while at the comet have in my time seen longer tail d ones but never one so pronounc d in cometary character and so spectral fierce so like some great pale living monster of the air or sea The atmosphere and sky an hour or so before sunrise so cool still translucent give the whole apparition to great advantage It is low in the east The head shows about as big as an ordinary good sized saucer is a perfectly round and defined disk the tail some sixty or seventy feet not a stripe but quite broad and gradually expanding Impress d with the silent inexplicably emotional sight I linger and look till all begins to weaken in the break of day October two The third day of mellow delicious sunshiny weather I am writing this in the recesses of the old woods my seat on a big pine log my back against a tree Am down here a few days for a change to bask in the Autumn sun to idle lusciously and simply and to eat hearty meals especially my breakfast Warm mid days the other hours of the twenty four delightfully fresh and mild cool evenings and early mornings perfect The scent of the woods and the peculiar aroma of a great yet unreap d maize field near by the white butterflies in every direction by day the golden rod the wild asters and sunflowers the song of the katydid all night Every day in Cooper s Woods enjoying simple existence and the passing hours taking short walks exercising arms and chest with the saplings or my voice with army songs or recitations A perfect week for weather seven continuous days bright and dry and cool and sunny The nights splendid with full moon about ten the grandest of star shows up in the east and south Jupiter Saturn Capella Aldebaran and great Orion Am feeling pretty well am outdoors most of the time absorbing the days and nights all I can CENTRAL PARK NOTES American Society from a Park Policeman s Point of View Am in New York city upper part visit Central Park almost every day and have for the last three weeks off and on taking observations or short rambles and sometimes riding around I talk quite a good deal with one of the Park policemen C C up toward the Ninetieth street entrance One day in particular I got him a going and it proved deeply interesting to me Our talk floated into sociology and politics I was curious to find how these things appear d on their surfaces to my friend for he plainly possess d sharp wits and good nature and had been seeing for years broad streaks of humanity somewhat out of my latitude I found that as he took such appearances the inward caste spirit of European aristocracy pervaded rich America with cynicism and artificiality at the fore Of the bulk of official persons Executives Congressmen Legislators Aldermen Department heads c c or the candidates for those positions nineteen in twenty in the policeman s judgment were just players in a game Liberty Equality Union and all the grand words of the Republic were in their mouths but lures decoys chisel d likenesses of dead wood to catch the masses Of fine afternoons along the broad tracks of the Park for many years had swept by my friend as he stood on guard the carriages c of American Gentility not by dozens and scores but by hundreds and thousands Lucky brokers capitalists contractors grocery men successful political strikers rich butchers dry goods folk c And on a large proportion of these vehicles on panels or horse trappings were conspicuously borne heraldic family crests Can this really be true In wish and willingness and if that were so what matter about the reality titles of nobility with a court and spheres fit for the capitalists the highly educated and the carriage riding classes to fence them off from the common people were the heart s desire of the good society of our great cities aye of North and South So much for my police friend s speculations which rather took me aback and which I have thought I would just print as he gave them as a doctor records symptoms PLATE GLASS NOTES St Louis Missouri November seventy nine What do you think I find manufactur d out here and of a kind the clearest and largest best and the most finish d and luxurious in the world and with ample demand for it too Plate glass One would suppose that was the last dainty outcome of an old almost effete growing civilization and yet here it is a few miles from saint Louis on a charming little river in the wilds of the West near the Mississippi I went down that way to day by the Iron Mountain Railroad was switch d off on a side track four miles through woods and ravines to Swash Creek so call d and there found Crystal city and immense Glass Works built and evidently built to stay right in the pleasant rolling forest Spent most of the day and examin d the inexhaustible and peculiar sand the glass is made of the original whity gray stuff in the banks saw the melting in the pots a wondrous process a real poem saw the delicate preparation the clay material undergoes for these great pots it has to be kneaded finally by human feet no machinery answering and I watch d the picturesque bare legged Africans treading it saw the molten stuff a great mass of a glowing pale yellow color taken out of the furnaces I shall never forget that Pot shape color concomitants more beautiful than any antique statue pass d into the adjoining casting room lifted by powerful machinery pour d out on its bed all glowing a newer vaster study for colorists indescribable a pale red tinged yellow of tarry consistence all lambent roll d by a heavy roller into rough plate glass I should say ten feet by fourteen then rapidly shov d into the annealing oven which stood ready for it The polishing and grinding rooms afterward the great glass slabs hundreds of them on their flat beds and the see saw music of the steam machinery constantly at work polishing them the myriads of human figures the works employ d four hundred men moving about with swart arms and necks and no superfluous clothing the vast rude halls with immense play of shifting shade and slow moving currents of smoke and steam and shafts of light sometimes sun striking in from above with effects that would have fill d Michel Angelo with rapture Coming back to saint Louis this evening at sundown and for over an hour afterward we follow d the Mississippi close by its western bank giving me an ampler view of the river and with effects a little different from any yet In the eastern sky hung the planet Mars just up and of a very clear and vivid yellow It was a soothing and pensive hour the spread of the river off there in the half light the glints of the down bound steamboats plodding along and that yellow orb apparently twice as large and significant as usual above the Illinois shore All along these nights nothing can exceed the calm fierce golden glistening domination of Mars over all the stars in the sky As we came nearer saint Louis the night having well set in I saw some to me novel effects in the zinc smelting establishments the tall chimneys belching flames at the top while inside through the openings at the facades of the great tanks burst forth in regular position hundreds of fierce tufts of a peculiar blue or green flame of a purity and intensity like electric lights illuminating not only the great buildings themselves but far and near outside like hues of the aurora borealis only more vivid So that remembering the Pot from the crystal furnace my jaunt seem d to give me new revelations in the color line SOME WAR MEMORANDA Jotted Down at the Time I find this incident in my notes I suppose from chinning in hospital with some sick or wounded soldier who knew of it When Kilpatrick and his forces were cut off at Brandy station last of September sixty three or thereabouts and the bands struck up Yankee Doodle there were not cannon enough in the Southern Confederacy to keep him and them in It was when Meade fell back K had his large cavalry division perhaps five thousand men but the rebs in superior force had surrounded them Things look d exceedingly desperate K had two fine bands and order d them up immediately they join d and play d Yankee Doodle with a will It went through the men like lightning but to inspire not to unnerve Every man seem d a giant They charged like a cyclone and cut their way out Their loss was but twenty It was about two in the afternoon WASHINGTON STREET SCENES Walking Down Pennsylvania Avenue April seven eighteen sixty four Warmish forenoon after the storm of the past few days I see passing up in the broad space between the curbs a big squad of a couple of hundred conscripts surrounded by a strong cordon of arm d guards and others interspers d between the ranks The government has learn d caution from its experiences there are many hundreds of bounty jumpers and already as I am told eighty thousand deserters Next also passing up the Avenue a cavalry company young but evidently well drill d and service harden d men Mark the upright posture in their saddles the bronz d and bearded young faces the easy swaying to the motions of the horses and the carbines by their right knees handsome and reckless some eighty of them riding with rapid gait clattering along Then the tinkling bells of passing cars the many shops some with large show windows some with swords straps for the shoulders of different ranks hat cords with acorns or other insignia the military patrol marching along with the orderly or second lieutenant stopping different ones to examine passes the forms the faces all sorts crowded together the worn and pale the pleas d some on their way to the railroad depot going home the cripples the darkeys the long trains of government wagons or the sad strings of ambulances conveying wounded the many officers horses tied in front of the drinking or oyster saloons or held by black men or boys or orderlies THE one hundred ninety fiveTH PENNSYLVANIA Tuesday Aug one eighteen sixty five About three o clock this afternoon sun broiling hot in Fifteenth street by the Treasury building a large and handsome regiment one hundred and ninety fifth Pennsylvania were marching by as it happen d receiv d orders just here to halt and break ranks so that they might rest themselves awhile I thought I never saw a finer set of men so hardy candid bright American looks all weather beaten and with warm clothes Every man was home born My heart was much drawn toward them They seem d very tired red and streaming with sweat It is a one year regiment mostly from Lancaster county Pa have been in Shenandoah valley On halting the men unhitch d their knapsacks and sat down to rest themselves Some lay flat on the pavement or under trees The fine physical appearance of the whole body was remarkable Great very great must be the State where such young farmers and mechanics are the practical average I went around for half an hour and talk d with several of them sometimes squatting down with the groups LEFT HAND WRITING BY SOLDIERS April thirty eighteen sixty six Here is a single significant fact from which one may judge of the character of the American soldiers in this just concluded war A gentleman in New York city a while since took it into his head to collect specimens of writing from soldiers who had lost their right hands in battle and afterwards learn d to use the left He gave public notice of his desire and offer d prizes for the best of these specimens Pretty soon they began to come in and by the time specified for awarding the prizes three hundred samples of such left hand writing by maim d soldiers had arrived I have just been looking over some of this writing A great many of the specimens are written in a beautiful manner All are good The writing in nearly all cases slants backward instead of forward One piece of writing from a soldier who had lost both arms was made by holding the pen in his mouth CENTRAL VIRGINIA IN sixty four Culpepper where I am stopping looks like a place of two or three thousand inhabitants Must be one of the pleasantest towns in Virginia Even now dilapidated fences all broken down windows out it has the remains of much beauty I am standing on an eminence overlooking the town though within its limits To the west the long Blue Mountain range is very plain looks quite near though from thirty to fifty miles distant with some gray splashes of snow yet visible The show is varied and fascinating I see a great eagle up there in the air sailing with pois d wings quite low Squads of red legged soldiers are drilling I suppose some of the new men of the Brooklyn fourteenth they march off presently with muskets on their shoulders In another place just below me are some soldiers squaring off logs to build a shanty chopping away and the noise of the axes sounding sharp I hear the bellowing unmusical screech of the mule I mark the thin blue smoke rising from camp fires Just below me is a collection of hospital tents with a yellow flag elevated on a stick and moving languidly in the breeze Two discharged men I know them both are just leaving One is so weak he can hardly walk the other is stronger and carries his comrade s musket They move slowly along the muddy road toward the depot The scenery is full of breadth and spread on the most generous scale everywhere in Virginia this thought fill d me The sights the scenes the groups have been varied and picturesque here beyond description and remain so I heard the men return in force the other night heard the shouting and got up and went out to hear what was the matter That night scene of so many hundred tramping steadily by through the mud some big flaring torches of pine knots I shall never forget I like to go to the paymaster s tent and watch the men getting paid off Some have furloughs and start at once for home sometimes amid great chaffing and blarneying There is every day the sound of the wood chopping axe and the plentiful sight of negroes crows and mud I note large droves and pens of cattle The teamsters have camps of their own and I go often among them The officers occasionally invite me to dinner or supper at headquarters The fare is plain but you get something good to drink and plenty of it general Meade is absent Sedgwick is in command PAYING THE oneST U S C T One of my war time reminiscences comprises the quiet side scene of a visit I made to the First Regiment U S Color d Troops at their encampment and on the occasion of their first paying off July eleven eighteen sixty three Though there is now no difference of opinion worth mentioning there was a powerful opposition to enlisting blacks during the earlier years of the secession war Even then however they had their champions That the color d race said a good authority is capable of military training and efficiency is demonstrated by the testimony of numberless witnesses and by the eagerness display d in the raising organizing and drilling of African troops Few white regiments make a better appearance on parade than the First and Second Louisiana Native Guards The same remark is true of other color d regiments At Milliken s Bend at Vicksburg at Port Hudson on Morris Island and wherever tested they have exhibited determin d bravery and compell d the plaudits alike of the thoughtful and thoughtless soldiery During the siege of Port Hudson the question was often ask d those who beheld their resolute charges how the niggers behav d under fire and without exception the answer was complimentary to them O tip top first rate bully were the usual replies But I did not start out to argue the case only to give my reminiscence literally as jotted on the spot at the time I write this on Mason s otherwise Analostan island under the fine shade trees of an old white stucco house with big rooms the white stucco house originally a fine country seat tradition says the famous Virginia Mason author of the Fugitive Slave Law was born here I reach d the spot from my Washington quarters by ambulance up Pennsylvania avenue through Georgetown across the Aqueduct bridge and around through a cut and winding road with rocks and many bad gullies not lacking After reaching the island we get presently in the midst of the camp of the first Regiment U S C T The tents look clean and good indeed altogether in locality especially the pleasantest camp I have yet seen The spot is umbrageous high and dry with distant sounds of the city and the puffing steamers of the Potomac up to Georgetown and back again Birds are singing in the trees the warmth is endurable here in this moist shade with the fragrance and freshness A hundred rods across is Georgetown The river between is swell d and muddy from the late rains up country So quiet here yet full of vitality all around in the far distance glimpses as I sweep my eye of hills verdure clad and with plenteous trees right where I sit locust sassafras spice and many other trees a few with huge parasitic vines just at hand the banks sloping to the river wild with beautiful free vegetation superb weeds better in their natural growth and forms than the best garden Lots of luxuriant grape vines and trumpet flowers the river flowing far down in the distance Now the paying is to begin The Major paymaster with his clerk seat themselves at a table the rolls are before them the money box is open d there are packages of five ten twenty five cent pieces Here comes the first Company B some eighty two men all blacks Certes we cannot find fault with the appearance of this crowd negroes though they be They are manly enough bright enough look as if they had the soldier stuff in them look hardy patient many of them real handsome young fellows The paying I say has begun The men are march d up in close proximity The clerk calls off name after name and each walks up receives his money and passes along out of the way It is a real study both to see them come close and to see them pass away stand counting their cash nearly all of this company get ten dollars and three cents each The clerk calls George Washington That distinguish d personage steps from the ranks in the shape of a very black man good sized and shaped and aged about thirty with a military mustache he takes his ten three and goes off evidently well pleas d There are about a dozen Washingtons in the company Let us hope they will do honor to the name At the table how quickly the Major handles the bills counts without trouble everything going on smoothly and quickly The regiment numbers to day about one thousand men including twenty officers the only whites Now another company These get five dollars thirty six cents each The men look well They too have great names besides the Washingtons aforesaid John Quincy Adams Daniel Webster Calhoun James Madison Alfred Tennyson John Brown Benj G Tucker Horace Greeley c The men step off aside count their money with a pleas d half puzzled look Occasionally but not often there are some thoroughly African physiognomies very black in color large protruding lips low forehead c But I have to say that I do not see one utterly revolting face Then another company each man of this getting ten dollars three cents also The pay proceeds very rapidly the calculation roll signing c having been arranged beforehand Then some trouble One company by the rigid rules of official computation gets only twenty three cents each man The company K is indignant and after two or three are paid the refusal to take the paltry sum is universal and the company marches off to quarters unpaid Another company I gets only seventy cents The sullen lowering disappointed look is general Half refuse it in this case Company G in full dress with brass scales on shoulders look d perhaps as well as any of the companies the men had an unusually alert look These then are the black troops or the beginning of them Well no one can see them even under these circumstances their military career in its novitiate without feeling well pleas d with them As we enter d the island we saw scores at a little distance bathing washing their clothes c The officers as far as looks go have a fine appearance have good faces and the air military Altogether it is a significant show and brings up some abolition thoughts The scene the porch of an Old Virginia slave owner s house the Potomac rippling near the Capitol just down three or four miles there seen through the pleasant blue haze of this July day After a couple of hours I get tired and go off for a ramble I write these concluding lines on a rock under the shade of a tree on the banks of the island It is solitary here the birds singing the sluggish muddy yellow waters pouring down from the late rains of the upper Potomac the green heights on the south side of the river before me The single cannon from a neighboring fort has just been fired to signal high noon I have walk d all around Analostan enjoying its luxuriant wildness and stopt in this solitary spot A water snake wriggles down the bank disturb d into the water The bank near by is fringed with a dense growth of shrubbery vines c FIVE THOUSAND POEMS There have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and little American poems all that diligent and long continued research could lay hands on The author of Old Grimes is Dead commenced it more than fifty years ago then the cluster was pass d on and accumulated by C F Harris then further pass d on and added to by the late Senator Anthony from whom the whole collection has been bequeath d to Brown University A catalogue such as it is has been made and publish d of these five thousand poems and is probably the most curious and suggestive part of the whole affair At any rate it has led me to some abstract reflection like the following I should like for myself to put on record my devout acknowledgment not only of the great masterpieces of the past but of the benefit of all poets past and present and of all poetic utterance in its entirety the dominant moral factor of humanity s progress In view of that progress and of evolution the religious and esthetic elements the distinctive and most important of any seem to me more indebted to poetry than to all other means and influences combined In a very profound sense religion is the poetry of humanity Then the points of union and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world however wide their separations of time and place and theme are much more numerous and weighty than the points of contrast Without relation as they may seem at first sight the whole earth s poets and poetry en masse the Oriental the Greek and what there is of Roman the oldest myths the interminable ballad romances of the Middle Ages the hymns and psalms of worship the epics plays swarms of lyrics of the British Islands or the Teutonic old or new or modern French or what there is in America Bryant s for instance or Whittier s or Longfellow s the verse of all tongues and ages all forms all subjects from primitive times to our own day inclusive really combine in one aggregate and electric globe or universe with all its numberless parts and radiations held together by a common centre or verteber To repeat it all poetry thus has to the point of view comprehensive enough more features of resemblance than difference and becomes essentially like the planetary globe itself compact and orbic and whole Nature seems to sow countless seeds makes incessant crude attempts thankful to get now and then even at rare and long intervals something approximately good THE OLD BOWERY A Reminiscence of New York Plays and Acting Fifty Years Ago In an article not long since missus Siddons as Lady Macbeth in The Nineteenth Century after describing the bitter regretfulness to mankind from the loss of those first class poems temples pictures gone and vanish d from any record of men the writer Fleeming Jenkin continues If this be our feeling as to the more durable works of art what shall we say of those triumphs which by their very nature la no longer than the action which creates them the triumphs of the orator the singer or the actor There is an anodyne in the words must be so inevitable and there is even some absurdity in longing for the impossible This anodyne and our sense of humor temper the unhappiness we feel when after hearing some great performance we leave the theatre and think Well this great thing has been and all that is now left of it is the feeble print up my brain the little thrill which memory will send along my nerves mine and my neighbors as we live longer the print and thrill must be feebler and when we pass away the impress of the great artist will vanish from the world The regret that a great art should in its nature be transitory explains the lively interest which many feel in reading anecdotes or descriptions of a great actor All this is emphatically my own feeling and reminiscence about the best dramatic and lyric artists I have seen in bygone days for instance Marietta Alboni the elder Booth Forrest the tenor Bettini the baritone Badiali old man Clarke I could write a whole paper on the latter s peerless rendering of the Ghost in Hamlet at the Park when I was a young fellow an actor named Ranger who appear d in America forty years ago in genre characters Henry Placide and many others But I will make a few memoranda at least of the best one I knew For the elderly New Yorker of to day perhaps nothing were more likely to start up memories of his early manhood than the mention of the Bowery and the elder Booth At the date given the more stylish and select theatre prices fifty cents pit one dollar boxes was The Park a large and well appointed house on Park Row opposite the present Post office English opera and the old comedies were often given in capital style the principal foreign stars appear d here with Italian opera at wide intervals The Park held a large part in my boyhood s and young manhood s life Here I heard the English actor Anderson in Charles de Moor and in the fine part of Gisippus Here I heard Fanny Kemble Charlotte Cushman the Seguins Daddy Rice Hackett as Falstaff Nimrod Wildfire Rip Van Winkle and in his Yankee characters See pages nineteen twenty Specimen Days It was here some years later than the date in the headline I also heard Mario many times and at his best In such parts as Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia he was inimitable the sweetest of voices a pure tenor of considerable compass and respectable power His wife Grisi was with him no longer first class or young a fine Norma though to the last Perhaps my dearest amusement reminiscences are those musical ones I doubt if ever the senses and emotions of the future will be thrill d as were the auditors of a generation ago by the deep passion of Alboni s contralto at the Broadway Theatre south side near Pearl street or by the trumpet notes of Badiali s baritone or Bettini s pensive and incomparable tenor in Fernando in Favorita or Marini s bass in Faliero among the Havana troupe Castle Garden But getting back more specifically to the date and theme I started from the heavy tragedy business prevail d more decidedly at the Bowery Theatre where Booth and Forrest were frequently to be heard Though Booth pere then in his prime ranging in age from forty to forty four years he was born in seventeen ninety six was the loyal child and continuer of the traditions of orthodox English play acting he stood out himself alone in many respects beyond any of his kind on record and with effects and ways that broke through all rules and all traditions He has been well describ d as an actor whose instant and tremendous concentration of passion in his delineations overwhelm d his audience and wrought into it such enthusiasm that it partook of the fever of inspiration surging through his own veins He seems to have been of beautiful private character very honorable affectionate good natured no arrogance glad to give the other actors the best chances He knew all stage points thoroughly and curiously ignored the mere dignities I once talk d with a man who had seen him do the Second Actor in the mock play to Charles Kean s Hamlet in Baltimore He was a marvellous linguist He play d Shylock once in London giving the dialogue in Hebrew and in New Orleans Oreste Racine s Andromaque in French One trait of his habits I have heard was strict vegetarianism He was exceptionally kind to the brute creation Every once in a while he would make a break for solitude or wild freedom sometimes for a few hours sometimes for days He illustrated Plato s rule that to the forming an artist of the very highest rank a dash of insanity or what the world calls insanity is indispensable He was a small sized man yet sharp observers noticed that however crowded the stage might be in certain scenes Booth never seem d overtopt or hidden He was singularly spontaneous and fluctuating in the same part each rendering differ d from any and all others He had no stereotyped positions and made no arbitrary requirements on his fellow performers As is well known to old play goers Booth s most effective part was Richard III Either that or lago or Shylock or Pescara in The Apostate was sure to draw a crowded house Remember heavy pieces were much more in demand those days than now He was also unapproachably grand in Sir Giles Overreach in A New Way to Pay Old Debts and the principal character in The Iron Chest In any portraiture of Booth those years the Bowery Theatre with its leading lights and the lessee and manager Thomas Hamblin cannot be left out It was at the Bowery I first saw Edwin Forrest the play was John Howard Payne s Brutus or the Fall of Tarquin and it affected me for weeks or rather I might say permanently filter d into my whole nature then in the zenith of his fame and ability Sometimes perhaps a veteran s benefit night the Bowery would group together five or six of the first class actors of those days Booth Forrest Cooper Hamblin and John R Scott for instance At that time and here George Jones Count Joannes was a young handsome actor and quite a favorite I remember seeing him in the title role in Julius Caesar and a capital performance it was To return specially to the manager Thomas Hamblin made a first rate foil to Booth and was frequently cast with him He had a large shapely imposing presence and dark and flashing eyes I remember well his rendering of the main role in Maturin s Bertram or the Castle of saint Aldobrand But I thought Tom Hamblin s best acting was in the comparatively minor part of Faulconbridge in King John he himself evidently revell d in the part and took away the house s applause from young Kean the King and Ellen Tree Constance and everybody else on the stage some time afterward at the Park Some of the Bowery actresses were remarkably good I remember missus Pritchard in Tour de Nesle and missus McClure in Fatal Curiosity and as Millwood in George Barnwell I wonder what old fellow reading these lines will recall the fine comedietta of The Youth That Never Saw a Woman and the jolly acting in it of missus Herring and old Gates The Bowery now and then was the place too for spectacular pieces such as The Last Days of Pompeii The Lion Doom d and the yet undying Mazeppa At one time Jonathan Bradford or the Murder at the Roadside Inn had a long and crowded run John Sefton and his brother William acted in it I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste a splendid pantomimist and her emotional Wept of the Wishton Wish But certainly the main reason for being of the Bowery Theatre those years was to furnish the public with Forrest s and Booth s performances the latter having a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics fully equal to the former though people were divided as always For some reason or other neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements at the more fashionable theatre the Park And it is a curious reminiscence but a true one that both these great actors and their performances were taboo d by polite society in New York and Boston at the time probably as being too robustuous But no such scruples affected the Bowery Recalling from that period the occasion of either Forrest or Booth any good night at the old Bowery pack d from ceiling to pit with its audience mainly of alert well dress d full blooded young and middle aged men the best average of American born mechanics the emotional nature of the whole mass arous d by the power and magnetism of as mighty mimes as ever trod the stage the whole crowded auditorium and what seeth d in it and flush d from its faces and eyes to me as much a part of the show as any bursting forth in one of those long kept up tempests of hand clapping peculiar to the Bowery no dainty kid glove business but electric force and muscle from perhaps two thousand full sinew d men the inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those ovations to Edwin Forrest welcoming him back after an absence comes up to me this moment Such sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely afford to many old New Yorkers some fruitful recollections I can yet remember for I always scann d an audience as rigidly as a play the faces of the leading authors poets editors of those times Fenimore Cooper Bryant Paulding Irving Charles King Watson Webb N P Willis Hoffman Halleck Mumford Morris Leggett L G Clarke R A Locke and others occasionally peering from the first tier boxes and even the great National Eminences Presidents Adams Jackson Van Buren and Tyler all made short visits there on their Eastern tours Awhile after eighteen forty the character of the Bowery as hitherto described completely changed Cheap prices and vulgar programmes came in People who of after years saw the pandemonium of the pit and the doings on the boards must not gauge by them the times and characters I am describing Not but what there was more or less rankness in the crowd even then For types of sectional New York those days the streets East of the Bowery that intersect Division Grand and up to Third avenue types that never found their Dickens or Hogarth or Balzac and have pass d away unportraitured the young ship builders cartmen butchers firemen the old time soap lock or exaggerated Mose or Sikesey of Chanfrau s plays they too were always to be seen in these audiences racy of the East river and the Dry Dock Slang wit occasional shirt sleeves and a picturesque freedom of looks and manners with a rude good nature and restless movement were generally noticeable Yet there never were audiences that paid a good actor or an interesting play the compliment of more sustain d attention or quicker rapport Then at times came the exceptionally decorous and intellectual congregations I have hinted it for the Bowery really furnish d plays and players you could get nowhere else Notably Booth always drew the best hearers and to a specimen of his acting I will now attend in some detail I happen d to see what has been reckon d by experts one of the most marvellous pieces of histrionism ever known It must have been about eighteen thirty four or thirty five A favorite comedian and actress at the Bowery Thomas Flynn and his wife were to have a joint benefit and securing Booth for Richard advertised the fact many days beforehand The house fill d early from top to bottom There was some uneasiness behind the scenes for the afternoon arrived and Booth had not come from down in Maryland where he lived However a few minutes before ringing up time he made his appearance in lively condition After a one act farce over as contrast and prelude the curtain rising for the tragedy I can from my good seat in the pit pretty well front see again Booth s quiet entrance from the side as with head bent he slowly and in silence amid the tempest of boisterous hand clapping walks down the stage to the footlights with that peculiar and abstracted gesture musingly kicking his sword which he holds off from him by its sash Though fifty years have pass d since then I can hear the clank and feel the perfect following hush of perhaps three thousand people waiting I never saw an actor who could make more of the said hush or wait and hold the audience in an indescribable half delicious half irritating suspense And so throughout the entire play all parts voice atmosphere magnetism from Now is the winter of our discontent to the closing death fight with Richmond were of the finest and grandest The latter character was play d by a stalwart young fellow named Ingersoll Indeed all the renderings were wonderfully good But the great spell cast upon the mass of hearers came from Booth Especially was the dream scene very impressive A shudder went through every nervous system in the audience it certainly did through mine Without question Booth was royal heir and legitimate representative of the Garrick Kemble Siddons dramatic traditions but he vitalized and gave an unnamable race to those traditions with his own electric personal idiosyncrasy As in all art utterance it was the subtle and powerful something special to the individual that really conquer d To me too Booth stands for much else besides theatricals I consider that my seeing the man those years glimps d for me beyond all else that inner spirit and form the unquestionable charm and vivacity but intrinsic sophistication and artificiality crystallizing rapidly upon the English stage and literature at and after Shakspere s time and coming on accumulatively through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to the beginning fifty or forty years ago of those disintegrating decomposing processes now authoritatively going on Yes although Booth must be class d in that antique almost extinct school inflated stagy rendering Shakspere perhaps inevitably appropriately from the growth of arbitrary and often cockney conventions his genius was to me one of the grandest revelations of my life a lesson of artistic expression The words fire energy abandon found in him unprecedented meanings I never heard a speaker or actor who could give such a sting to hauteur or the taunt I never heard from any other the charm of unswervingly perfect vocalization without trenching at all on mere melody the province of music So much for a Thespian temple of New York fifty years since where sceptred tragedy went trailing by under the gaze of the Dry Dock youth and both players and auditors were of a character and like we shall never see again And so much for the grandest histrion of modern times as near as I can deliberately judge and the phrenologists put my caution at seven grander I believe than Kean in the expression of electric passion the prime eligibility of the tragic artist For though those brilliant years had many fine and even magnificent actors undoubtedly at Booth s death in eighteen fifty two went the last and by far the noblest Roman of them all NOTES TO LATE ENGLISH BOOKS PREFACE TO THE READER IN THE BRITISH

road to the sea shore and a temporary rest as I supposed in the early summer of eighteen seventy three I broke down disabled and have dwelt here as my central residence all the time since almost fourteen years In the preceding pages I have described how during those years I partially recuperated in eighteen seventy six from my worst paralysis by going down to Timber creek living close to Nature and domiciling with my dear friends George and Susan Stafford From eighteen seventy seven or eight to eighty three or four I was well enough to travel around considerably journey d westward to Kansas leisurely exploring the Prairies and on to Denver and the Rocky Mountains another time north to Canada where I spent most of the summer with my friend doctor Bucke and jaunted along the great lakes and the saint Lawrence and Saguenay rivers another time to Boston to properly print the final edition of my poems I was there over two months and had a good time I have so brought out the completed Leaves of Grass during this period also Specimen Days of which the foregoing is a transcript collected and re edited the Democratic Vistas cluster see companion volume to the present commemorated Abraham Lincoln s death on the successive anniversaries of its occurrence by delivering my lecture on it ten or twelve times and put in through many a month and season the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives Thus the last fourteen years have pass d At present end days of March eighteen eighty seven I am nigh entering my sixty ninth year I find myself continuing on here quite dilapidated and even wreck d bodily from the paralysis c but in good heart to use a Long Island country phrase and with about the same mentality as ever The worst of it is I have been growing feebler quite rapidly for a year and now can t walk around hardly from one room to the next I am forced to stay in doors and in my big chair nearly all the time We have had a sharp dreary winter too and it has pinch d me I am alone most of the time every week indeed almost every day write some reminiscences essays sketches for the magazines and read or rather I should say dawdle over books and papers a good deal spend half the day at that Nor can I finish this note without putting on record wafting over sea from hence my deepest thanks to certain friends and helpers I would specify them all

here do acknowledging may I not say even glorying in it PREFACE TO DEMOCRATIC VISTAS WITH OTHER PAPERS English Edition Mainly I think I should base the request to weigh the following pages on the assumption that they present however indirectly some views of the West and Modern or of a distinctly western and modern American tendency about certain matters Then too the pages include by attempting to illustrate it a theory herein immediately mentioned For another and different point of the issue the Enlightenment Democracy and Fair show of the bulk the common people of America from sources representing not only the British Islands but all the world means at least eligibility to Enlightenment Democracy and Fair show for the bulk the common people of all civilized nations That positively the dry land has appeared at any rate is an important fact America is really the great test or trial case for all the problems and promises and speculations of humanity and of the past and present I say too we forty one are not to look so much to changes ameliorations and adaptations in Politics as to those of Literature and thence domestic Sociology I have accordingly in the following melange introduced many themes besides political ones Several of the pieces are ostensibly in explanation of my own writings but in that very process they best include and set forth their side of principles and generalities pressing vehemently for consideration our age Upon the whole it is on the atmosphere they are born in and I hope give out more than any specific piece or trait I would care to rest I think Literature a new superb democratic literature is to be the medicine and lever and with Art the chief influence in modern civilization I have myself not so much made a dead set at this theory or attempted to present it directly as admitted it to color and sometimes dominate what I had to say In both Europe and America we have serried phalanxes who promulge and defend the political claims I go for an equal force to uphold the other WALT WHITMAN CAMDEN NEW JERSEY April eighteen eighty eight Note forty one We who in many departments ways make the building up of the masses by building up grand individuals our shibboleth and in brief that is the marrow of this book ABRAHAM LINCOLN Glad am I to give were anything better lacking even the most brief and shorn testimony of Abraham Lincoln Everything I heard about him authentically and every time I saw him and it was my fortune through eighteen sixty two to sixty five to see or pass a word with or watch him personally perhaps twenty or thirty times added to and anneal d my respect and love at the moment And as I dwell on what I myself heard or saw of the mighty Westerner and blend it with the history and literature of my age and of what I can get of all ages and conclude it with his death it seems like some tragic play superior to all else I know vaster and fierier and more convulsionary for this America of ours than Eschylus or Shakspere ever drew for Athens or for England And then the Moral permeating underlying all the Lesson that none so remote none so illiterate no age no class but may directly or indirectly read Abraham Lincoln s was really one of those characters the best of which is the result of long trains of cause and effect needing a certain spaciousness of time and perhaps even remoteness to properly enclose them having unequal d influence on the shaping of this Republic and therefore the world as to day and then far more important in the future Thus the time has by no means yet come for a thorough measurement of him Nevertheless we who live in his era who have seen him and heard him face to face and are in the midst of or just parting from the strong and strange events which he and we have had to do with can in some respects bear valuable perhaps indispensable testimony concerning him I should first like to give a very fair and characteristic likeness of Lincoln as I saw him and watch d him one afternoon in Washington for nearly half an hour not long before his death It was as he stood on the balcony of the National Hotel Pennsylvania avenue making a short speech to the crowd in front on the occasion either of a set of new colors presented to a famous Illinois regiment or of the daring capture by the Western men of some flags from the enemy which latter phrase by the by was not used by him at all in his remarks How the picture happen d to be made I do not know but I bought it a few days afterward in Washington and it was endors d by every one to whom I show d it Though hundreds of portraits have been made by painters and photographers many to pass on by copies to future times I have never seen one yet that in my opinion deserv d to be called a perfectly good likeness nor do I believe there is really such a one in existence May I not say too that as there is no entirely competent and emblematic likeness of Abraham Lincoln in picture or statue there is not perhaps cannot be any fully appropriate literary statement or summing up of him yet in existence The best way to estimate the value of Lincoln is to think what the condition of America would be to day if he had never lived never been President His nomination and first election were mainly accidents experiments Severely view d one cannot think very much of American Political Parties from the beginning after the Revolutionary War down to the present time Doubtless while they have had their uses have been and are the grass on which the cow feeds and indispensable economies of growth it is undeniable that under flippant names they have merely identified temporary passions or freaks or sometimes prejudice ignorance or hatred The only thing like a great and worthy idea vitalizing a party and making it heroic was the enthusiasm in sixty four for re electing Abraham Lincoln and the reason behind that enthusiasm How does this man compare with the acknowledg d Father of his country Washington was model d on the best Saxon and Franklin of the age of the Stuarts rooted in the Elizabethan period was essentially a noble Englishman and just the kind needed for the occasions and the times of seventeen seventy six eighty three Lincoln underneath his practicality was far less European was quite thoroughly Western original essentially non conventional and had a certain sort of out door or prairie stamp One of the best of the late commentators on Shakspere Professor Dowden makes the height and aggregate of his quality as a poet to be that he thoroughly blended the ideal with the practical or realistic If this be so I should say that what Shakspere did in poetic expression Abraham Lincoln essentially did in his personal and official life I should say the invisible foundations and vertebra of his character more than any man s in history were mystical abstract moral and spiritual while upon all of them was built and out of all of them radiated under the control of the average of circumstances what the vulgar call horse sense and a life often bent by temporary but most urgent materialistic and political reasons He seems to have been a man of indomitable firmness even obstinacy on rare occasions involving great points but he was generally very easy flexible tolerant almost slouchy respecting minor matters I note that even those reports and anecdotes intended to level him down all leave the tinge of a favorable impression of him As to his religious nature it seems to me to have certainly been of the amplest deepest rooted loftiest kind Already a new generation begins to tread the stage since the persons and events of the secession war I have more than once fancied to myself the time when the present century has closed and a new one open d and the men and deeds of that contest have become somewhat vague and mythical fancied perhaps in some great Western city or group collected together or public festival where the days of old of eighteen sixty three and four and five are discuss d some ancient soldier sitting in the background as the talk goes on and betraying himself by his emotion and moist eyes like the journeying Ithacan at the banquet of King Alcinoiis when the bard sings the contending warriors and their battles on the plains of Troy So from the sluices of Ulysses eyes Fast fell the tears and sighs succeeded sighs I have fancied I say some such venerable relic of this time of ours preserv d to the next or still the next generation of America I have fancied on such occasion the young men gathering around the awe the eager questions What have you seen Abraham Lincoln and heard him speak and touch d his hand Have you with your own eyes look d on Grant and Lee and Sherman Dear to Democracy to the very last And among the paradoxes generated by America not the least curious was that spectacle of all the kings and queens and emperors of the earth many from remote distances sending tributes of condolence and sorrow in memory of one rais d through the commonest average of life a rail splitter and flat boatman Consider d from contemporary points of view who knows what the future may decide and from the points of view of current Democracy and The Union the only thing like passion or infatuation in the man was the passion for the Union of These States Abraham Lincoln seems to me the grandest figure yet on all the crowded canvas of the Nineteenth Century NEW ORLEANS IN eighteen forty eight Walt Whitman gossips of his sojourn here years ago as a newspaper writer Notes of his trip up the Mississippi and to New York Among the letters brought this morning Camden New Jersey Jan fifteen eighteen eighty seven by my faithful post office carrier J G is one as follows NEW ORLEANS Jan eleven eighty seven We have been informed that when you were younger and less famous than now you were in New Orleans and perhaps have helped on the Picayune If you have any remembrance of the Picayune s young days or of journalism in New Orleans of that era and would put it in writing verse or prose for the Picayune s fiftieth year edition Jan twenty five we shall be pleased et cetera In response to which I went down to New Orleans early in eighteen forty eight to work on a daily newspaper but it was not the Picayune though I saw quite a good deal of the editors of that paper and knew its personnel and ways But let me indulge my pen in some gossipy recollections of that time and place with extracts from my journal up the Mississippi and across the great lakes to the Hudson Probably the influence most deeply pervading everything at that time through the United States both in physical facts and in sentiment was the Mexican War then just ended Following a brilliant campaign in which our troops had march d to the capital city Mexico and taken full possession we were returning after our victory From the situation of the country the city of New Orleans had been our channel and entrepot for everything going and returning It had the best news and war correspondents it had the most to say through its leading papers the Picayune and Delta especially and its voice was readiest listen d to from it Chapparal had gone out and his army and battle letters were copied everywhere not only in the United States but in Europe Then the social cast and results no one who has never seen the society of a city under similar circumstances can understand what a strange vivacity and rattle were given throughout by such a situation I remember the crowds of soldiers the gay young officers going or coming the receipt of important news the many discussions the returning wounded and so on I remember very well seeing general Taylor with his staff and other officers at the saint Charles Theatre one evening after talking with them during the day There was a short play on the stage but the principal performance was of doctor Colyer s troupe of Model Artists then in the full tide of their popularity They gave many fine groups and solo shows The house was crowded with uniforms and shoulder straps general T himself if I remember right was almost the only officer in civilian clothes he was a jovial old rather stout plain man with a wrinkled and dark yellow face and in ways and manners show d the least of conventional ceremony or etiquette I ever saw he laugh d unrestrainedly at everything comical He had a great personal resemblance to Fenimore Cooper the novelist of New York I remember general Pillow and quite a cluster of other militaires also present One of my choice amusements during my stay in New Orleans was going down to the old French Market especially of a Sunday morning The show was a varied and curious one among the rest the Indian and negro hucksters with their wares For there were always fine specimens of Indians both men and women young and old I remember I nearly always on these occasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit for my breakfast from the immense shining copper kettle of a great Creole mulatto woman I believe she weigh d two hundred thirty pounds I never have had such coffee since About nice drinks anyhow my recollection of the cobblers with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers and also the exquisite wines and the perfect and mild French brandy help the regretful reminiscence of my New Orleans experiences of those days And what splendid and roomy and leisurely bar rooms particularly the grand ones of the saint Charles and saint Louis Bargains auctions appointments business conferences c were generally held in the spaces or recesses of these bar rooms I used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the crowded and bustling levees on the banks of the river The diagonally wedg d in boats the stevedores the piles of cotton and other merchandise the carts mules negroes et cetera afforded never ending studies and sights to me I made acquaintances among the captains boatmen or other characters and often had long talks with them sometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters Sundays I sometimes went forenoons to the old Catholic Cathedral in the French quarter I used to walk a good deal in this arrondissement and I have deeply regretted since that I did not cultivate while I had such a good opportunity the chance of better knowledge of French and Spanish Creole New Orleans people I have an idea that there is much and of importance about the Latin race contributions to American nationality in the South and Southwest that will never be put with sympathetic understanding and tact on record Let me say for better detail that through several months eighteen forty eight I work d on a new daily paper The Crescent my situation rather a pleasant one My young brother Jeff was with me and he not only grew very homesick but the climate of the place and especially the water seriously disagreed with him From this and other reasons although I was quite happily fix d I made no very long stay in the South In due time we took passage northward for saint Louis in the Pride of the West steamer which left her wharf just at dusk My brother was unwell and lay in his berth from the moment we left till the next morning he seem d to me to be in a fever and I felt alarm d However the next morning he was all right again much to my relief Our voyage up the Mississippi was after the same sort as the voyage some months before down it The shores of this great river are very monotonous and dull one continuous and rank flat with the exception of a meagre stretch of bluff about the neighborhood of Natchez Memphis c Fortunately we had good weather and not a great crowd of passengers though the berths were all full The Pride jogg d along pretty well and put us into saint Louis about noon Saturday After looking around a little I secured passage on the steamer Prairie Bird to leave late in the afternoon bound up the Illinois river to La Salle where we were to take canal for Chicago During the day I rambled with my brother over a large portion of the town search d after a refectory and after much trouble succeeded in getting some dinner Our Prairie Bird started out at dark and a couple of hours after there was quite a rain and blow which made them haul in along shore and tie fast We made but thirty miles the whole night The boat was excessively crowded with passengers and had withal so much freight that we could hardly turn around I slept on the floor and the night was uncomfortable enough The Illinois river is spotted with little villages with big names Marseilles Naples et cetera its banks are low and the vegetation excessively rank Peoria some distance up is a pleasant town I went over the place the country back is all rich land for sale cheap Three or four miles from P land of the first quality can be bought for three dollars or four dollars an acre I am transcribing from my notes written at the time Arriving at La Salle Tuesday morning we went on board a canal boat had a detention by sticking on a mud bar and then jogg d along at a slow trot some seventy of us on a moderate sized boat If the weather hadn t been rather cool particularly at night it would have been insufferable Illinois is the most splendid agricultural country I ever saw the land is of surpassing richness the place par excellence for farmers We stopt at various points along the canal some of them pretty villages It was ten o clock A M when we got in Chicago too late for the steamer so we went to an excellent public house the American Temperance and I spent the time that day and till next morning looking around Chicago At nine the next forenoon we started on the Griffith on board of which I am now inditing these memoranda up the blue waters of Lake Michigan I was delighted with the appearance of the towns along Wisconsin At Milwaukee I went on shore and walk d around the place They say the country back is beautiful and rich It seems to me that if we should ever remove from Long Island Wisconsin would be the proper place to come to The towns have a remarkable appearance of good living without any penury or want The country is so good naturally and labor is in such demand About five o clock one afternoon I heard the cry of a woman over board It proved to be a crazy lady who had become so from the loss of her son a couple of weeks before The small boat put off and succeeded in picking her up though she had been in the water fifteen minutes She was dead Her husband was on board They went off at the next stopping place While she lay in the water she probably recover d her reason as she toss d up her arms and lifted her face toward the boat Sunday Morning June eleven We pass d down Lake Huron yesterday and last night and between four and five o clock this morning we ran on the flats and have been vainly trying with the aid of a steam tug and a lumbering lighter to get clear again The day is beautiful and the water clear and calm Night before last we stopt at Mackinaw the island and town and I went up on the old fort one of the oldest stations in the Northwest We expect to get to Buffalo by to morrow The tug has fasten d lines to us but some have been snapt and the others have no effect We seem to be firmly imbedded in the sand With the exception of a larger boat and better accommodations it amounts to about the same thing as a becalmment I underwent on the Montauk voyage East Long Island last summer Later We are off again expect to reach Detroit before dinner We did not stop at Detroit We are now on Lake Erie jogging along at a good round pace A couple of hours since we were on the river above Detroit seem d to me a pretty place and thrifty I especially liked the looks of the Canadian shore opposite and of the little village of Windsor and indeed all along the banks of the river From the shrubbery and the neat appearance of some of the cottages I think it must have been settled by the French While I now write we can see a little distance ahead the scene of the battle between Perry s fleet and the British during the last war with England The lake looks to me a fine sheet of water We are having a beautiful day June twelve We stopt last evening at Cleveland and though it was dark I took the opportunity of rambling about the place went up in the heart of the city and back to what appear d to be the courthouse The streets are unusually wide and the buildings appear to be substantial and comfortable We went down through Main street and found some distance along several squares of ground very prettily planted with trees and looking attractive enough Return d to the boat by way of the lighthouse on the hill This morning we are making for Buffalo being I imagine a little more than half across Lake Erie The water is rougher than on Michigan or Huron On saint Clair it was smooth as glass The day is bright and dry with a stiff head wind We arriv d in Buffalo on Monday evening spent that night and a portion of next day going round the city exploring Then got in the cars and went to Niagara went under the falls saw the whirlpool and all the other sights Tuesday night started for Albany travel d all night From the time daylight afforded us a view of the country all seem d very rich and well cultivated Every few miles were large towns or villages Wednesday late we arriv d at Albany Spent the evening in exploring There was a political meeting Hunker at the capitol but I pass d it by Next morning I started down the Hudson in the Alida arriv d safely in New York that evening From the New Orleans Picayune Jan twenty five eighteen eighty seven SMALL MEMORANDA Thousands lost here one or two preserv d ATTORNEY GENERAL S OFFICE Washington Aug twenty two eighteen sixty five As I write this about noon the suite of rooms here is fill d with Southerners standing in squads or streaming in and out some talking with the Pardon Clerk some waiting to see the Attorney General others discussing in low tones among themselves All are mainly anxious about their pardons The famous thirteenth exception of the President s Amnesty Proclamation of makes it necessary that every secessionist whose property is worth twenty thousand dollars or over shall get a special pardon before he can transact any legal purchase sale c So hundreds and thousands of such property owners have either sent up here for the last two months or have been or are now coming personally here to get their pardons They are from Virginia Georgia Alabama Mississippi North and South Carolina and every Southern State Some of their written petitions are very abject Secession officers of the rank of Brigadier General or higher also need these special pardons They also come here I see streams of the twenty thousand dollars men and some women every day I talk now and then with them and learn much that is interesting and significant All the southern women that come some splendid specimens mothers c are dress d in deep black Immense numbers several thousands of these pardons have been pass d upon favorably the Pardon Warrants like great deeds have been issued from the State Department on the requisition of this office But for some reason or other they nearly all yet lie awaiting the President s signature He seems to be in no hurry about it but lets them wait The crowds that come here make a curious study for me I get along very sociably with any of them as I let them do all the talking only now and then I have a long confab or ask a suggestive question or two If the thing continues as at present the property and wealth of the Southern States is going to legally rest for the future on these pardons Every single one is made out with the condition that the grantee shall respect the abolition of slavery and never make an attempt to restore it Washington Sept eight nine c eighteen sixty five The arrivals swarms c of the twenty thousand dollars men seeking pardons still continue with increas d numbers and pertinacity I yesterday I am a clerk in the U S Attorney General s office here made out a long list from Alabama nearly two hundred recommended for pardon by the Provisional Governor This list in the shape of a requisition from the Attorney General goes to the State Department There the Pardon Warrants are made out brought back here and then sent to the President where they await his signature He is signing them very freely of late The President indeed as at present appears has fix d his mind on a very generous and forgiving course toward the return d secessionists He will not countenance at all the demand of the extreme Philo African element of the North to make the right of negro voting at elections a condition and sine qua non of the reconstruction of the United States south and of their resumption of company equality in the Union A GLINT INSIDE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN S CABINET APPOINTMENTS ONE ITEM OF MANY While it was hanging in suspense who should be appointed Secretary of the Interior to take the place of Caleb Smith the choice was very close between mister Harlan and colonel Jesse K Dubois of Illinois The latter had many friends He was competent he was honest and he was a man mister Harlan in the race finally gain d the Methodist interest and got himself to be consider d as identified with it and his appointment was apparently ask d for by that powerful body Bishop Simpson of Philadephia came on and spoke for the selection The President was much perplex d The reasons for appointing colonel Dubois were very strong almost insuperable yet the argument for mister Harlan under the adroit position he had plac d himself was heavy Those who press d him adduc d the magnitude of the Methodists as a body their loyalty more general and genuine than any other sect that they represented the West and had a right to be heard that all or nearly all the other great denominations had their representatives in the heads of the government that they as a body and the great sectarian power of the West formally ask d mister Harlan s appointment that he was of them having been a Methodist minister that it would not do to offend them but was highly necessary to propitiate them mister Lincoln thought deeply over the whole matter He was in more than usual tribulation on the subject Let it be enough to say that though mister Harlan finally receiv d the Secretaryship colonel Dubois came as near being appointed as a man could and not be The decision was finally made one night about ten o clock Bishop Simpson and other clergymen and leading persons in mister Harlan s behalf had been talking long and vehemently with the President A member of Congress who was pressing colonel Dubois s claims was in waiting The President had told the Bishop that he would make a decision that evening and that he thought it unnecessary to be press d any more on the subject That night he call d in the M C above alluded to and said to him Tell Uncle Jesse that I want to give him this appointment and yet I cannot I will do almost anything else in the world for him I am able I have thought the matter all over and under the circumstances think the Methodists too good and too great a body to be slighted They have stood by the government and help d us their very best I have had no better friends and as the case stands I have decided to appoint mister Harlan NOTE TO A FRIEND Written on the fly leaf of a copy of Specimen Days sent to Peter Doyle at Washington June eighteen eighty three Pete do you remember of course

Potomac shores one side or the other sometimes ten miles at a stretch Or when you work d on the horse cars and I waited for you coming home late together or resting and chatting at the Market corner seventh street and the Avenue and eating those nice musk or watermelons Or during my tedious sickness and first paralysis seventy three how you used to come to my solitary garret room and make up my bed and enliven me and chat for an hour or so or perhaps go out and get the medicines doctor Drinkard had order d for me before you went on duty Give my love to dear missus and mister Nash and tell them I have not forgotten them and never will W W WRITTEN IMPROMPTU IN AN ALBUM Germantown Phila Dec twenty six eighty three In memory of these merry Christmas days and nights to my friends mister and

with voices and laughter of the young mellow faces of the old and a by and by pause in the general joviality Now mister Whitman spoke up one of the girls what have you to say about Thanksgiving Won t you give us a sermon in advance to sober us down The sage nodded smilingly look d a moment at the blaze of the great wood fire ran his forefinger right and left through the heavy white mustache that might have otherwise impeded his voice and began Thanksgiving goes probably far deeper than you folks suppose I am not sure but it is the source of the highest poetry as in parts of the Bible Ruskin indeed makes the central source of all great art to be praise gratitude to the Almighty for life and the universe with its objects and play of action We Americans devote an official day to it every year yet I sometimes fear the real article is almost dead or dying in our self sufficient independent Republic Gratitude anyhow has never been made half enough of by the moralists it is indispensable to a complete character man s or woman s the disposition to be appreciative thankful That is the main matter the element inclination what geologists call the trend Of my own life and writings I estimate the giving thanks part with what it infers as essentially the best item I should say the quality of gratitude rounds the whole emotional nature I should say love and faith would quite lack vitality without it There are people shall I call them even religious people as things go who have no such trend to their disposition LAST OF THE WAR CASES Memorandized at the time Washington eighteen sixty five sixty six Of reminiscences of the secession war after the rest is said I have thought it remains to give a few special words in some respects at the time the typical words of all and most definite of the samples of the kill d and wounded in action and of soldiers who linger d afterward from these wounds or were laid up by obstinate disease or prostration The general statistics have been printed already but can bear to be briefly stated again There were over three million men for all periods of enlistment large and small furnish d to the Union army during the war New York State furnishing over five hundred thousand which was the greatest number of any one State The losses by disease wounds kill d in action accidents c were altogether about six hundred thousand or approximating to that number Over four million cases were treated in the main and adjudicatory army hospitals The number sounds strange but it is true More than two thirds of the deaths were from prostration or disease To day there lie buried over three hundred thousand soldiers in the various National army Cemeteries more than half of them and that is really the most significant and eloquent bequest of the war mark d unknown In full mortuary statistics of the war the greatest deficiency arises from our not having the rolls even as far as they were kept of most of the Southern military prisons a gap which probably both adds to and helps conceal the indescribable horrors of those places it is however restricting one vivid point only certain that over thirty thousand Union soldiers died largely of actual starvation in them And now leaving all figures and their sum totals I feel sure a few genuine memoranda of such things some cases jotted down sixty four sixty five and sixty six made at the time and on the spot with all the associations of those scenes and places brought back will not only go directest to the right spot but give a clearer and more actual sight of that period than anything else Before I give the last cases I begin with verbatim extracts from letters home to my mother in Brooklyn the second year of the war W W Washington Oct thirteen eighteen sixty three There has been a new lot of wounded and sick arriving for the last three days The first and second days long strings of ambulances with the sick Yesterday the worst many with bad and bloody wounds inevitably long neglected I thought I was cooler and more used to it but the sight of some cases brought tears into my eyes I had the luck yesterday however to do lots of good Had provided many nourishing articles for the men for another quarter but fortunately had my stores where I could use them at once for these new comers as they arrived faint hungry fagg d out from their journey with soil d clothes and all bloody I distributed these articles gave partly to the nurses I knew or to those in charge As many as possible I fed myself Then I found a lot of oyster soup handy and bought it all at once It is the most pitiful sight this when the men are first brought in from some camp hospital broke up or a part of the army moving These who arrived yesterday are cavalry men Our troops had fought like devils but got the worst of it They were Kilpatrick s cavalry were in the rear part of Meade s retreat and the reb cavalry knowing the ground and taking a favorable opportunity dash d in between cut them off and shell d them terribly But Kilpatrick turn d and brought them out mostly It was last Sunday One of the most terrible sights and tasks is of such receptions Oct twenty seven eighteen sixty three If any of the soldiers I know or their parents or folks should call upon you as they are often anxious to have my address in Brooklyn you just use them as you know how and if you happen to have pot luck and feel to ask them to take a bite don t be afraid to do so I have a friend Thomas Neat twod N Y Cavalry wounded in leg now home in Jamaica on furlough he will probably call Then possibly a mister Haskell or some of his folks from western New York he had a son died here and I was with the boy a good deal The old man and his wife have written me and ask d me my Brooklyn address he said he had children in New York and was occasionally down there When I come home I will show you some of the letters I get from mothers sisters fathers c They will make you cry How the time passes away To think it is over a year since I left home suddenly and have mostly been down in front since The year has vanish d swiftly and oh what scenes I have witness d during that time And the war is not settled yet and one does not see anything certain or even promising of a settlement But I do not lose the solid feeling in myself that the Union triumph is assured whether it be sooner or whether it be later or whatever roundabout way we may be led there and I find I don t change that conviction from any reverses we meet nor delays nor blunders One realizes here in Washington the great labors even the negative ones of Lincoln that it is a big thing to have just kept the United States from being thrown down and having its throat cut I have not waver d or had any doubt of the issue since Gettysburg eighth September sixty three Here now is a specimen army hospital case Lorenzo Strong company A ninth United States Cavalry shot by a shell last Sunday right leg amputated on the field Sent up here Monday night fourteenth Seem d to be doing pretty well till Wednesday noon sixteenth when he took a turn for the worse and a strangely rapid and fatal termination ensued Though I had much to do I staid and saw all It was a death picture characteristic of these soldiers hospitals the perfect specimen of physique one of the most magnificent I ever saw the convulsive spasms and working of muscles mouth and throat There are two good women nurses one on each side The doctor comes in and gives him a little chloroform One of the nurses constantly fans him for it is fearfully hot He asks to be rais d up and they put him in a half sitting posture He call d for Mark repeatedly half deliriously all day Life ebbs runs now with the speed of a mill race his splendid neck as it lays all open works still slightly his eyes turn back A religious person coming in offers a prayer in subdued tones bent at the foot of the bed and in the space of the aisle a crowd including two or three doctors several students and many soldiers has silently gather d It is very still and warm as the struggle goes on and dwindles a little more and a little more and then welcome oblivion painlessness death A pause the crowd drops away a white bandage is bound around and under the jaw the propping pillows are removed the limpsy head falls down the arms are softly placed by the side all composed all still and the broad white sheet is thrown over everything April ten eighteen sixty four Unusual agitation all around concentrated here Exciting times in Congress The Copperheads are getting furious and want to recognize the Southern Confederacy This is a pretty time to talk of recognizing such said a Pennsylvania officer in hospital to me to day after what has transpired the last three years After first Fredericksburg I felt discouraged myself and doubted whether our rulers could carry on the war But that has pass d away The war must be carried on I would willingly go in the ranks myself if I thought it would profit more than as at present and I don t know sometimes but I shall as it is Then there is certainly a strange deep fervid feeling form d or arous d in the land hard to describe or name it is not a majority feeling but it will make itself felt M you don t know what a nature a fellow gets not only after being a soldier a while but after living in the sights and influences of the camps the wounded c a nature he never experienced before The stars and stripes the tune of Yankee Doodle and similar things produce such an effect on a fellow as never before I have seen them bring tears on some men s cheeks and others turn pale with emotion I have a little flag it belong d to one of our cavalry regiments presented to me by one of the wounded it was taken by the secesh in a fight and rescued by our men in a bloody skirmish following It cost three men s lives to get back that four by three flag to tear it from the breast of a dead rebel for the name of getting their little rag back again The man that secured it was very badly wounded and they let him keep it I was with him a good deal he wanted to give me some keepsake he said he didn t expect to live so he gave me that flag The best of it all is dear M there isn t a regiment cavalry or infantry that wouldn t do the like on the like occasion April twelve I will finish my letter this morning it is a beautiful day I was up in Congress very late last night The House had a very excited night session about expelling the men that proposed recognizing the Southern Confederacy You ought to hear as I do the soldiers talk they are excited to madness We shall probably have hot times here not in the military fields alone The body of the army is true and firm as the North Star May six sixty four M the poor soldier with diarrhoea is still living but oh what a looking object Death would be a relief to him he cannot last many hours Cunningham the Ohio soldier with leg amputated at thigh has pick d up beyond expectation now looks indeed like getting well He died a few weeks afterwards The hospitals are very full I am very well indeed Hot here to day May twenty three sixty four Sometimes I think that should it come when it must to fall in battle one s anguish over a son or brother kill d might be temper d with much to take the edge off Lingering and extreme suffering from wounds or sickness seem to me far worse than death in battle I can honestly say the latter has no terrors for me as far as I myself am concern d Then I should say too about death in war that our feelings and imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter Of the many I have seen die or known of the past year I have not seen or known one who met death with terror In most cases I should say it was a welcome relief and release Yesterday I spent a good part of the afternoon with a young soldier of seventeen Charles Cutter of Lawrence city Massachusetts first Massachusetts Heavy Artillery Battery M He was brought to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen Well I thought to myself as I sat looking at him it ought to be a relief to his folks if they could see how little he really suffer d He lay very placid in a half lethargy with his eyes closed As it was extremely hot and I sat a good while silently fanning him and wiping the sweat at length he open d his eyes quite wide and clear and look d inquiringly around I said What is it my boy Do you want anything He answer d quietly with a good natured smile Oh nothing I was only looking around to see who was with me His mind was somewhat wandering yet he lay in an evident peacefulness that sanity and health might have envied I had to leave for other engagements He died I heard afterward without any special agitation in the course of the night Washington May twenty six sixty three M I think something of commencing a series of lectures readings talks c through the cities of the North to supply myself with funds for hospital ministrations I do not like to be so beholden to others I need a pretty free supply of money and the work grows upon me and fascinates me It is the most magnetic as well as terrible sight the lots of poor wounded and helpless men depending so much in one ward or another upon my soothing or talking to them or rousing them up a little or perhaps petting or feeding them their dinner or supper here is a patient for instance wounded in both arms or giving some trifle for a novelty or change anything however trivial to break the monotony of those hospital hours It is curious when I am present at the most appalling scenes deaths operations sickening wounds perhaps full of maggots I keep cool and do not give out or budge although my sympathies are very much excited but often hours afterward perhaps when I am home or out walking alone I feel sick and actually tremble when I recall the case again before me Sunday afternoon opening of eighteen sixty five Pass d this afternoon among a collection of unusually bad cases wounded and sick secession soldiers left upon our hands I spent the previous Sunday afternoon there also At that time two were dying Two others have died during the week Several of them are partly deranged I went around among them elaborately Poor boys they all needed to be cheer d up As I sat down by any particular one the eyes of all the rest in the neighboring cots would fix upon me and remain steadily riveted as long as I sat within their sight Nobody seem d to wish anything special to eat or drink The main thing ask d for was postage stamps and paper for writing I distributed all the stamps I had Tobacco was wanted by some One call d me over to him and ask d me in a low tone what denomination I belong d to He said he was a Catholic wish d to find some one of the same faith wanted some good reading I gave him something to read and sat down by him a few minutes Moved around with a word for each They were hardly any of them personally attractive cases and no visitors come here Of course they were all destitute of money I gave small sums to two or three apparently the most needy The men are from quite all the Southern States Georgia Mississippi Louisiana c Wrote several letters One for a young fellow named Thomas J Byrd with a bad wound and diarrhoea Was from Russell county Alabama been out four years Wrote to his mother had neither heard from her nor written to her in nine months Was taken prisoner last Christmas in Tennessee sent to Nashville then to Camp Chase Ohio and kept there a long time all the while not money enough to get paper and postage stamps Was paroled but on his way home the wound took gangrene had diarrhoea also had evidently been very low Demeanor cool and patient A dark skinn d quaint young fellow with strong Southern idiom no education Another letter for John W Morgan aged eighteen from Shellot Brunswick county North Carolina been out nine months gunshot wound in right leg above knee also diarrhoea wound getting along well quite a gentle affectionate boy wish d me to put in the letter for his mother to kiss his little brother and sister for him I put strong envelopes on these and two or three other letters directed them plainly and fully and dropt them in the Washington post office the next morning myself The large ward I am in is used for secession soldiers exclusively One man about forty years of age emaciated with diarrhoea I was attracted to as he lay with his eyes turn d up looking like death His weakness was so extreme that it took a minute or so every time for him to talk with anything like consecutive meaning yet he was evidently a man of good intelligence and education As I said anything he would lie a moment perfectly still then with closed eyes answer in a low very slow voice quite correct and sensible but in a way and tone that wrung my heart He had a mother wife and child living or probably living in his home in Mississippi It was long long since he had seen them Had he caus d a letter to be sent them since he got here in Washington No answer I repeated the question very slowly and soothingly He could not tell whether he had or not things of late seem d to him like a dream After waiting a moment I said Well I am going to walk down the ward a moment and when I come back you can tell me If you have not written I will sit down and write A few minutes after I return d he said he remember d now that some one had written for him two or three days before The presence of this man impress d me profoundly The flesh was all sunken on face and arms the eyes low in their sockets and glassy and with purple rings around them Two or three great tears silently flow d out from the eyes and roll d down his temples he was doubtless unused to be spoken to as I was speaking to him Sickness imprisonment exhaustion c had conquer d the body yet the mind held mastery still and call d even wandering remembrance back There are some fifty Southern soldiers here all sad sad cases There is a good deal of scurvy I distributed some paper envelopes and postage stamps and wrote addresses full and plain on many of the envelopes I return d again Tuesday August one and moved around in the same manner a couple of hours September twenty two sixty five Afternoon and evening at Douglas hospital to see a friend belonging to twod New York Artillery Hiram W Frazee Serg t down with an obstinate compound fracture of left leg receiv d in one of the last battles near Petersburg After sitting a while with him went through several neighboring wards In one of them found an old acquaintance transferr d here lately a rebel prisoner in a dying condition Poor fellow the look was already on his face He gazed long at me I ask d him if he knew me After a moment he utter d something but inarticulately I have seen him off and on for the last five months He has suffer d very much a bad wound in left leg severely fractured several operations cuttings extractions of bone splinters c I remember he seem d to me as I used to talk with him a fair specimen of the main strata of the Southerners those without property or education but still with the stamp which comes from freedom and equality I liked him Jonathan Wallace of Hurd company Georgia age thirty wife Susan F Wallace Houston Hurd company Georgia If any good soul of that county should see this I hope he will send her this word Had a family had not heard from them since taken prisoner now six months I had written for him and done trifles for him before he came here He made no outward show was mild in his talk and behavior but I knew he worried much inwardly But now all would be over very soon I half sat upon the little stand near the head of the bed Wallace was somewhat restless I placed my hand lightly on his forehead and face just sliding it over the surface In a moment or so he fell into a calm regular breathing lethargy or sleep and remain d so while I sat there It was dark and the lights were lit I hardly know why death seem d hovering near but I stay d nearly an hour A Sister of Charity dress d in black with a broad white linen bandage around her head and under her chin and a black crape over all and flowing down from her head in long wide pieces came to him and moved around the bed She bow d low and solemn to me For some time she moved around there noiseless as a ghost doing little things for the dying man December sixty five The only remaining hospital is now Harewood out in the woods northwest of the city I have been visiting there regularly every Sunday during these two months January twenty four sixty six Went out to Harewood early to day and remain d all day Sunday February four eighteen sixty six Harewood Hospital again Walk d out this afternoon bright dry

ILLUSTRATION Here is a portrait of E H from life by Henry Inman in New York about eighteen twenty seven or twenty eight The painting was finely copper plated in eighteen thirty and the present is a fac simile Looks as I saw him in the following narrative The time was signalized by the separation of the society of Friends so greatly talked of and continuing yet but so little really explain d All I give of this separation is in a Note following Notes such as they are founded on ELIAS HICKS Prefatory Note As myself a little boy hearing so much of E H at that time long ago in Suffolk and Queens and Kings counties and more than once personally seeing the old man and my dear dear father and mother faithful listeners to him at the meetings I remember how I dream d to write perhaps a piece about E H and his look and discourses however long afterward for my parents sake and the dear Friends too And the following is what has at last but all come out of it the feeling and intention never forgotten yet There is a sort of nature of persons I have compared to little rills of water fresh from perennial springs and the comparison is indeed an appropriate one persons not so very plenty yet some few certainly of them running over the surface and area of humanity all times all lands It is a specimen of this class I would now present I would sum up in E H and make his case stand for the class the sort in all ages all lands sparse not numerous yet enough to irrigate the soil enough to prove the inherent moral stock and irrepressible devotional aspirations growing indigenously of themselves always advancing and never utterly gone under or lost Always E H gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology all religion all worship all the truth to which you are possibly eligible namely in yourself and your inherent relations Others talk of Bibles saints churches exhortations vicarious atonements the canons outside of yourself and apart from man E H to the religion inside of man s very own nature This he incessantly labors to kindle nourish educate bring forward and strengthen He is the most democratic of the religionists the prophets I have no doubt that both the curious fate and death of his four sons and the facts and dwelling on them of George Fox s strange early life and permanent conversion had much to do with the peculiar and sombre ministry and style of E H from the first and confirmed him all through One must not be dominated by the man s almost absurd saturation in cut and dried biblical phraseology and in ways talk and standard regardful mainly of the one need he dwelt on above all the rest This main need he drove home to the soul the canting and sermonizing soon exhale away to any auditor that realizes what E H is for and after The present paper a broken memorandum of his formation his earlier life is the cross notch that rude wanderers make in the woods to remind them afterward of some matter of first rate importance and full investigation Remember too that E H was a thorough believer in the Hebrew Scriptures in his way The following are really but disjointed fragments recall d to serve and eke out here the lank printed pages of what I commenc d unwittingly two months ago Now as I am well in for it comes an old attack the sixth or seventh recurrence of my war paralysis dulling me from putting the notes in shape and threatening any further action head or body W W Camden N J July eighteen eighty eight To begin with my theme is comparatively featureless The great historian has pass d by the life of Elias Hicks quite without glance or touch Yet a man might commence and overhaul it as furnishing one of the amplest historic and biography s backgrounds While the foremost actors and events from seventeen fifty to eighteen thirty both in Europe and America were crowding each other on the world s stage While so many kings queens soldiers philosophs musicians voyagers litterateurs enter one side cross the boards and disappear amid loudest reverberating names Frederick the Great Swedenborg Junius Voltaire Rousseau Linnaeus Herschel curiously contemporary with the long life of Goethe through the occupancy of the British throne by George the Third amid stupendous visible political and social revolutions and far more stupendous invisible moral ones while the many quarto volumes of the Encyclopaedia Francaise are being published at fits and intervals by Diderot in Paris while Haydn and Beethoven and Mozart and Weber are working out their harmonic compositions while missus Siddons and Talma and Kean are acting while Mungo Park explores Africa and captain Cook circumnavigates the globe through all the fortunes of the American Revolution the beginning continuation and end the battle of Brooklyn the surrender at Saratoga the final peace of eighty three through the lurid tempest of the French Revolution the execution of the king and queen and the Reign of Terror through the whole of the meteor career of Napoleon through all Washington s Adams s Jefferson s Madison s and Monroe s Presidentiads amid so many flashing lists of names indeed there seems hardly in any department any end to them Old World or New Franklin Sir Joshua Reynolds Mirabeau Fox Nelson Paul Jones Kant Fichte and Hegel Fulton Walter Scott Byron Mesmer Champollion Amid pictures that dart upon me even as I speak and glow and mix and coruscate and fade like aurora boreales Louis the sixteenth threaten d by the mob the trial of Warren Hastings the death bed of Robert Burns Wellington at Waterloo Decatur capturing the Macedonian or the sea fight between the Chesapeake and the Shannon During all these whiles I say and though on a far different grade running parallel and contemporary with all a curious quiet yet busy life centred in a little country village on Long Island and within sound on still nights of the mystic surf beat of the sea About this life this Personality neither soldier nor scientist nor litterateur I propose to occupy a few minutes in fragmentary talk to give some few melanges disconnected impressions statistics resultant groups pictures thoughts of him or radiating from him Elias Hicks was born March nineteen seventeen forty eight in Hempstead township Queens county Long Island New York State near a village bearing the old Scripture name of Jericho a mile or so north and east of the present Hicksville on the L I Railroad His father and mother were Friends of that class working with their own hands and mark d by neither riches nor actual poverty Elias as a child and youth had small education from letters but largely learn d from Nature s schooling He grew up even in his ladhood a thorough gunner and fisherman The farm of his parents lay on the south or sea shore side of Long Island they had early removed from Jericho one of the best regions in the world for wild fowl and for fishing Elias became a good horseman too and knew the animal well riding races also a singer fond of vain songs as he afterwards calls them a dancer too at the country balls When a boy of thirteen he had gone to live with an elder brother and when about seventeen he changed again and went as apprentice to the carpenter s trade The time of all this was before the Revolutionary War and the locality thirty to forty miles from New York city My great grandfather Whitman was often with Elias at these periods and at merry makings and sleigh rides in winter over the plains How well I remember the region the flat plains of the middle of Long Island as then with their prairie like vistas and grassy patches in every direction and the kill calf and herds of cattle and sheep Then the South Bay and shores and the salt meadows and the sedgy smell and numberless little bayous and hummock islands in the waters the habitat of every sort of fish and aquatic fowl of North America And the bay men a strong wild peculiar race now extinct or rather entirely changed And the beach outside the sandy bars sometimes many miles at a stretch with their old history of wrecks and storms the weird white gray beach not without its tales of pathos tales too of grandest heroes and heroisms In such scenes and elements and influences in the midst of Nature and along the shores of the sea Elias Hicks was fashion d through boyhood and early manhood to maturity But a moral and mental and emotional change was imminent Along at this time he says My apprenticeship being now expir d I gradually withdrew from the company of my former associates became more acquainted with Friends and was more frequent in my attendance of meetings and although this was in some degree profitable to me yet I made but slow progress in my religious improvement The occupation of part of my time in fishing and fowling had frequently tended to preser me from falling into hurtful associations but through the rising intimations and reproofs of divine grace in my heart I now began to feel that the manner in which I sometimes amus d myself with my gun was not without sin for although I mostly preferr d going alone and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations that the opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me yet on other occasions when accompanied by some of my acquaintances and when no fowls appear d which would be useful to us after being obtain d we sometimes from wantonness or for mere diversion would destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us This cruel procedure affects my heart while penning these lines In his twenty threed year Elias was married by the Friends ceremony to Jemima Seaman His wife was an only child the parents were well off for common people and at their request the son in law mov d home with them and carried on the farm which at their decease became his own and he liv d there all his remaining life Of this matrimonial part of his career it continued and with unusual happiness for fifty eight years he says giving the account of his marriage On this important occasion we felt the clear and consoling evidence of divine truth and it remain d with us as a seal upon our spirits strengthening us mutually to bear with becoming fortitude the vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot and of which we h a large share in passing through this probationary state My wife although not of a very strong constitution liv d to be the mother of eleven children four sons and seven daughters Our second daughter a very lovely promising child died when young with the small pox and the youngest was not living at its birth The rest all arriv d to years of discretion and afforded us considerable comfort as they prov d to be in a good degree dutiful children All our sons however were of weak constitutions and were not able to take care of themselves being so enfeebl d as not to be able to walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age The two eldest died in the fifteenth year of their age the third in his seventeenth year and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died But although thus helpless the innocency of their lives and the resign d cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and pleasant and I trust we were preserv d from murmuring or repining believing the dispensation to be in wisdom and according to the will and gracious disposing of an all wise providence for purposes best known to himself And when I have observ d the great anxiety and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who are favor d with health especially their sons I could perceive very few whose troubles and exercises on that account did not far exceed ours The weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations the world and we believ d that in their death they were happy and admitted into the realms of peace and joy a reflection the most comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their tender offspring Of a serious and reflective turn by nature and from his reading and surroundings Elias had more than once markedly devotional inward intimations These feelings increas d in frequency and strength until soon the following About the twenty sixth year of my age I was again brought by the operative influence of divine grace under deep concern of mind and was led through adorable mercy to see that although I had ceas d from many sins and vanities of my youth yet there were many remaining that I was still guilty of which were not yet aton d for and for which I now felt the judgments of God to rest upon m This caus d me to cry earnestly to the Most High for pardon and redemption and he graciously condescended to hear my cry and to open a way before me wherein I must walk in order to experience reconciliation with him and as I abode in watchfulness and deep humiliation before him light broke forth out of obscurity and my darkness became as the noon day I began to have openings leading to the ministry which brought me under close exercise and deep travail of spirit for although I had for some time spoken on subjects of business in monthly and preparative meetings yet the prospe of opening my mouth in public meetings was a close trial but I endeavor d to keep my mind quiet and resign d to the heavenly call if it should be made clear to me to be my duty Nevertheless I was soon after sitting in a meeting in much weightiness of spirit a secret though clear intimation accompanied me to spe a few words which were then given to me to utter yet fear so prevail d that I did not yield to the intimation For this omission I felt close rebuke and judgment seem d for some time to cover my mind but as I humbl d myself under the Lord s mighty hand he again lifted up the light of his countenance upon me and enabl d me to renew covenant with him that if he would pass by this my offence I would in future be faithful if he should again require such a service of me The Revolutionary War following tried the sect of Friends more than any The difficulty was to steer between their convictions as patriots and their pledges of non warring peace Here is the way they solv d the problem A war with all its cruel and destructive effects having raged for several years between the British Colonies in North America and the mother country Friends as well as others were expos d to many severe trials and sufferings yet in the colony of New York Friends who stood faithful to their principles and did not meddle in the controversy had after a short period at first considerable favor allow d them The yearly meeting was held steadily duri the war on Long Island where the king s party had the rule yet Friends from the Main where the American army ruled had free passage through both armies to attend it and any other meetings they were desirous of attending except in a few instances This was a favor which the parties would not grant to their best friends who were of a war like disposition which shows what great advantages would redound to mankind were they all of this pacific spirit I pass d myself through the lines of both armies six times during the war without molestation both parties generally receiving me with openness and civility and although I had to pass over a tract of country between the two armies sometimes more than thirty miles in extent and which was much frequented by robbers a set in general of cruel unprincipled banditti issuing out from both partie yet excepting once I met with no interruption even from the But although Friends in general experienc d many favors and deliverances yet those scenes of war and confusion occasion many trials and provings in various ways to the faithful One circumstance I am willing to mention as it caus d me considerable exercise and concern There was a large cellar under the new meeting house belonging to Friends in New York which was generally let as a store When the king s troops enter d the city they took possession of it for the purpose of depositing their warlike stores and ascertaining what Friends had the care of letting it their commissary came forward and offer d to pay the rent and those Friends for want of due consideration accepted it This caus d great uneasiness to the concern d part of the Society who apprehended it not consistent with our peaceable principles to receive payment for the depositing of military stores in our houses The subject was brought before the yearly meeting in seventeen seventy nine and engag d its careful attention but those Friends who had been active in the reception of the money and some few others were not willing to acknowledge their proceedings to be inconsistent nor to return the money to those from whom it was receiv d and in order to justify themselves therein they referr d to the conduct of Friends in Philadelphia in similar cases Matters thus appearing very difficult and embarrassing it was unitedly concluded to refer the final determination thereof to the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania and several Friends were appointed to attend that meeting in relation thereto among whom I was one of the number We accordingly set out on the ninth day of the ninth month seventeen seventy nine and I was accompanied from home by my beloved friend John Willis who was likewise on the appointment We took a solemn leave of our families they feeling much anxiety at parting with us on account of the dangers we were expos d to having to pass not only the lines of the two armies but the deserted and almost uninhabited country that lay between them in many places the grass being grown up in the streets and many houses desolate and empty Believing it however my duty to proceed in the service my mind was so settled and trust fix d in the divine arm of power that faith seem d to banish all fear and cheerfulness and quiet resignation were I believe my constant companions during the journey We got permission with but little difficulty to pass the outguards of the king s army at Kingsbridge and proceeded to Westchester We afterwards attended meetings at Harrison s Purchase and Oblong having the concurrence of our monthly meeting to take some meetings in our way a concern leading thereto having for some time previously attended my mind We pass d from thence to Nine Partners and attended their monthly meeting and then turn d our faces towards Philadelphia being join d by several others of the Committee We attended New Marlborough Hardwick and Kingswood meetings on our journey and arriv d at Philadelphia on the seventh day of the week and twenty fifth of ninth month on which day we attended the yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders which began at the eleventh hour I also attended all the sittings of the yearly meeting until the fourth day of the next week and was then so indispos d with a fever which had been increasing on me for several days that I was not able to attend after that time I was therefore not present when the subject was discuss d which came from our yearly meeting but I was inform d by my companion that it was a very solemn opportunity and the matter was resulted in advising that the money should be return d into the office from whence it was receiv d accompanied with our reasons for so doing and this was accordingly done by the direction of our yearly meeting the next year Then season after season when peace and Independence reign d year following year this remains to be seventeen ninety one a specimen of his personal labors I was from home on this journey four months and eleven days rode about one thousand five hundred miles and attended forty nine particular meetings among Friends three quarterly meetings six monthly meetings and forty meetings among other people And again another experience In the forepart of this meeting my mind was reduc d into such a state of great weakness and depression that my faith was almost ready to fail which produc d great searchings of heart so that I was led to call in question all that I had ever before experienc d In this state of doubting I was ready to wish myself at home from an apprehension that I should only expose myself to reproach and wound the cause I was embark d in for the heavens seem d like brass and the earth as iron such coldness and hardness I thought could scarcely have ever been experienc d before by any creature so great was the depth of my baptism at this time nevertheless as I endeavor d to quiet my mind in this conflicting dispensation and be resign d to my allotment however distressing towards the latter part of the meeting a ray of light broke through the surrounding darkness in which the Shepherd of Israel was pleas d to arise and by the light of his glorious countenance to scatter those clouds of opposition Then ability was receiv d and utterance given to speak of his marvellous works in the redemption of souls and to op the way of life and salvation and the mysteries of his glorious kingdom which are hid from the wise and prudent of this world and reveal d only unto those who are reduc d into the state of little children and babes in Christ And concluding another jaunt in seventeen ninety four I was from home in this journey about five months and travell by land and water about two thousand two hundred and eighty three miles having visited all the meetings of Friends in the New England states and many meetings amongst those of other professions and also visited many meetings among Friends and others in the upper part of our own yearly meeting and found real peace in my labors Another tramp in seventeen ninety eight I was absent from home in this journey about five months and two weeks and rode about sixteen hundred miles and attended about one hundred and forty three meetings Here are some memoranda of eighteen thirteen near home First day Our meeting this day pass d in silent labor The cloud rested on the tabernacle and although it was a day of much rain outwardly yet very little of the dew of Hermon appear d to distil among us Nevertheless a comfortable calm was witness d towards the close which we must render to the account of unmerited mercy and love Second day Most of this day was occupied in a visit to a sick friend who appeared comforted therewith Spent part of the evening in reading part of Paul s Epistle to the Romans Third day I was busied most of this day in my common vocations Spent the evening principally in reading Paul Found considerable satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians in which he shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth without looking through and beyond the instrument to the great first cause and Author of every blessing to whom all the praise and honor are due Fifth day first of fourth month At our meeting to day found it as usual a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center where it ought to be What a multitude of intruding thoughts imperceptibly as it were steal into the mind and turn it from its proper object whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against them Felt a little strength just at the close to remind Friends of the necessity of a steady perseverance by a recapitulation of the parable of the unjust judge showing how men ought always to pray and not to faint Sixth day Nothing material occurr d but a fear lest the cares of the world should engross too much of my time Seventh day Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends which I have long lov d The rest of the day I employ d in manual labor mostly in gardening But we find if we attend to records and details we shall lay out an endless task We can briefly say summarily that his whole life was a long religious missionary life of method practicality sincerity earnestness and pure piety as near to his time here as one in Judea far back or in any life any age The reader who feels interested must get with all its dryness and mere dates absence of emotionality or literary quality and whatever abstract attraction with even a suspicion of cant sniffling the Journal of the Life and Religious Labours of Elias Hicks written by himself at some Quaker book store It is from this headquarters I have extracted the preceding quotations During E H s matured life continued from fifty to sixty years while working steadily earning his living and paying his way without intermission he makes as previously memorandized several hundred preaching visits not only through Long Island but some of them away into the Middle or Southern States or north into Canada or the then far West extending to thousands of miles or filling several weeks and sometimes months These religious journeys scrupulously accepting in payment only his transportation from place to place with his own food and shelter and never receiving a dollar of money for salary or preaching Elias through good bodily health and strength continues till quite the age of eighty It was thus at one of his latest jaunts in Brooklyn city I saw and heard him This sight and hearing shall now be described Elias Hicks was at this period in the latter part November or December of eighteen twenty nine It was the last tour of the many missions of the old man s life He was in the eighty first year of his age and a few months before he had lost by death a beloved wife with whom he had lived in unalloyed affection and esteem for fifty eight years But a few months after this meeting Elias was paralyzed and died Though it is sixty years ago since and I a little boy at the time in Brooklyn New York I can remember my father coming home toward sunset from his day s work as carpenter and saying briefly as he throws down his armful of kindling blocks with a bounce on the kitchen floor Come mother Elias preaches to night Then my mother hastening the supper and the table cleaning afterward gets a neighboring young woman a friend of the family to step in and keep house for an hour or so puts the two little ones to bed and as I had been behaving well that day as a special reward I was allow d to go also We start for the meeting Though as I said the stretch of more than half a century has pass d over me since then with its war and peace and all its joys and sins and deaths and what a half century how it comes up sometimes for an instant like the lightning flash in a storm at night I can recall that meeting yet It is a strange place for religious devotions Elias preaches anywhere no respect to buildings private or public houses school rooms barns even theatres anything that will accommodate This time it is in a handsome ball room on Brooklyn Heights overlooking New York and in full sight of that great city and its North and East rivers fill d with ships is to specify more particularly the second story of Morrison s Hotel used for the most genteel concerts balls and assemblies a large cheerful gay color d room with glass chandeliers bearing myriads of sparkling pendants plenty of settees and chairs and a sort of velvet divan running all round the side walls Before long the divan and all the settees and chairs are fill d many fashionables out of curiosity all the principal dignitaries of the town general Jeremiah Johnson Judge Furman George Hall mister Willoughby mister Pierrepont N B Morse Cyrus P Smith and F C Tucker Many young folks too some richly dress d women I remember I noticed with one party of ladies a group of uniform d officers either from the U S Navy Yard or some ship in the stream or some adjacent fort On a slightly elevated platform at the head of the room facing the audience sit a dozen or more Friends most of them elderly grim and with their broad brimm d hats on their heads Three or four women too in their characteristic Quaker costumes and bonnets All still as the grave At length after a pause and stillness becoming almost painful Elias rises and stands for a moment or two without a word A tall straight figure neither stout nor very thin dress d in drab cloth clean shaved face forehead of great expanse and large and clear black eyes forty two long or middling long white hair he was at this time between eighty and eighty one years of age his head still wearing the broad brim A moment looking around the audience with those piercing eyes amid the perfect stillness I can almost see him and the whole scene now Then the words come from his lips very emphatically and slowly pronounc d in a resonant grave melodious voice What is the chief end of man I was told in my early youth it was to glorify God and seek and enjoy him forever I cannot follow the discourse It presently becomes very fervid and in the midst of its fervor he takes the broad brim hat from his head and almost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind continues with uninterrupted earnestness But I say I cannot repeat hardly suggest his sermon Though the differences and disputes of the formal division of the Society of Friends were even then under way he did not allude to them at all A pleading tender nearly agonizing conviction and magnetic stream of natural eloquence before which all minds and natures all emotions high or low gentle or simple yielded entirely without exception was its cause method and effect Many very many were in tears Years afterward in Boston I heard Father Taylor the sailor s preacher and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the resemblance to Elias Hicks s not argumentative or intellectual but so penetrating so different from anything in the books different as the fresh air of a May morning or sea shore breeze from the atmosphere of a perfumer s shop While he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing song tone sometimes heard in such meetings but in a moment or two more as if recollecting himself he breaks off stops and resumes in a natural tone This occurs three or four times during the talk of the evening till all concludes Now and then at the many scores and hundreds even thousands of his discourses as at this one he was very mystical and radical forty three and had much to say of the light within Very likely this same inner light so dwelt upon by newer men as by Fox and Barclay at the beginning and all Friends and deep thinkers since and now is perhaps only another name for the religious conscience In my opinion they have all diagnos d like superior doctors the real in most disease of our times probably any times Amid the huge inflammation call d society and that other inflammation call d politics what is there to day of moral power and ethic sanity as antiseptic to them and all Though I think the essential elements of the moral nature exist latent in the good average people of the United States of to day and sometimes break out strongly it is certain that any mark d or dominating National Morality if I may use the phrase has not only not yet been develop d but that at any rate when the point of view is turn d on business politics competition practical life and in character and manners in our New World there seems to be a hideous depletion almost absence of such moral nature Elias taught throughout as George Fox began it or rather reiterated and verified it the Platonic doctrine that the ideals of character of justice of religious action whenever the highest is at stake are to be conform d to no outside doctrine of creeds Bibles legislative enactments conventionalities or even decorums but are to follow the inward Deity planted law of the emotional soul In this only the true Quaker or Friend has faith and it is from rigidly perhaps strainingly carrying it out that both the Old and New England records of Quakerdom show some unseemly and insane acts In one of the lives of Ralph Waldo Emerson is a list of lessons or instructions seal d orders the biographer calls them prepar d by the sage himself for his own guidance Here is one Go forth with thy message among thy fellow creatures teach them that they must trust themselves as guided by that inner light which dwells with the pure in heart to whom it was promis d of old that they shall see God How thoroughly it fits the life and theory of Elias Hicks Then in Omar Khayyam I sent my soul through the Invisible Some letter of that after life to spell And by and by my soul return d to me And answer d I myself am Heaven and Hell Indeed of this important element of the theory and practice of Quakerism the difficult to describe Light within or Inward Law by which all must be either justified or condemn d I will not undertake where so many have fail d the task of making the statement of it for the average comprehension We will give partly for the matter and partly as specimen of his speaking and writing style what Elias Hicks himself says in allusion to it one or two of very many passages Most of his discourses like those of Epictetus and the ancient peripatetics have left no record remaining they were extempore and those were not the times of reporters Of one however deliver d in Chester Pa toward the latter part of his career there is a careful transcript and from it even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to be pick d and thrash d out several times before you get the grain we give the following extract I don t want to express a great many words but I want you to be call d home to the substance For the Scriptures and all the books in the world can do no more Jesus could do no more than to recommend to this Comforter which was the light in him God is light and in him is no darkness at all and if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another Because the light is one in all and therefore it binds us together in the bonds of love for it is not only light but love that love which casts out all fear So that they who dwell in God dwell in love and they are constrain d to walk in it and if they walk in it they have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin But what blood my friends Did Jesus Christ the Saviour ever have any material blood Not a drop of it my friends not a drop of it That blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin was the life of the soul of Jesus The soul of man has no material blood but as the outward material blood created from the dust of the earth is the life of these bodies of flesh so with respect to the soul the immortal and invisible spirit its blood is that life which God breath d into it As we read in the beginning that God form d man of the dust of the ground and breath d into him the breath of life and man became a living soul He breath d into that soul and it became alive to God Then from one of his many letters for he seems to have delighted in correspondence Some may query What is the cross of Christ To these I answer It is the perfect law of God written on the tablet of the hear and in the heart of every rational creature in such indelible characters that all the power of mortals cannot erase nor obliterate it Neither is there any power or means given or dispens d to the children of men but this inward law and light by which the true and saving knowledge of God can be obtain d And by this inward law and light all will be either justified or condemn d and all made to know God for themselves and be left without excuse agreeably to the prophecy of Jeremiah and the corroborating testimony of Jesus in his last counsel and command to his disciples not to depart from Jerusalem till they should receive power from on high assuring them that they should receive power when they had receiv d the pouring forth of the spirit upon them which would qualify them to bear witness of him in Judea Jerusalem Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the earth which was verified in a marvellous manner on the day of Pentecost when thousands were converted to the Christian faith in one day By which it is evident that nothing but this inward light and law as it is heeded and obey d ever did or ever can make a true and real Christian and child of God And until the professors of Christianity agree to lay aside all their non essentials in religion and rally to this unchangeable foundation and standard of truth wars and fightings confusion and error will prevail and the angelic song cannot be heard in our land that of glory to God in the highest and on earth peace and good will to men But when all nations are made willing to make this inward law and light the rule and standard of all their faith and works then we shall be brought to know and believe alike that there is but one Lord one faith and but one baptism one God and Father that is above all through all and in all And then will all those glorious and consoling prophecies recorded in the scriptures of truth be fulfill d He the Lord shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up the sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the cow and the bear shall feed and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the sucking child shall play the hole of the asp and the wean d child put his hand on the cockatrice s den They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth that is our earthly tabernacle shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea The exposition in the last sentence that the terms of the texts are not to be taken in their literal meaning but in their spiritual one and allude to a certain wondrous exaltation of the body through religious influences is significant and is but one of a great number of instances of much that is obscure to the world s people in the preachings of this remarkable man Then a word about his physical oratory connected with the preceding If there is as doubtless there is an unnameable something behind oratory a fund within or atmosphere without deeper than art deeper even than proof that unnameable constitutional something Elias Hicks emanated from his very heart to the hearts of his audience or carried with him or probed into and shook and arous d in them a sympathetic germ probably rapport lurking in every human eligibility which no book no rule no statement has given or can give inherent knowledge intuition not even the best speech or best put forth but launch d out only by powerful human magnetism Unheard by sharpest ear unformed in clearest eye or cunningest mind Nor lore nor fame nor happiness nor wealth And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world incessantly Which you and I and all pursuing ever ever miss Open but still a secret the real of the real an illusion Costless vouchsafed to each yet never man the owner Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme historians in prose Which sculptor never chisel d yet nor painter painted Which vocalist never sung nor orator nor actor ever utter d That remorse too for a mere worldly life that aspiration towards the ideal which however overlaid lies folded latent hidden in perhaps every character More definitely as near as I remember aided by my dear mother long afterward Elias Hicks s discourse there in the Brooklyn ball room was one of his old never remitted appeals to that moral mystical portion of human nature the inner light But it is mainly for the scene itself and Elias s personnel that I recall the incident Soon afterward the old man died On first day morning the fourteenth of twod month February eighteen thirty he was engaged in his room writing to a friend until a little after ten o clock when he return d to that occupied by the family apparently just attack d by a paralytic affection which nearly deprived h of the use of his right side and of the power of speech Being assisted to a chair near the fire he manifested by signs that the letter which he had just finish d and which had been dropp d the way should be taken care of and on its being brought to him appear d satisfied and manifested a desire that all should sit down and be still seemingly sensible that his labours were brought to a close and only desirous of quietly waiting the final change The solemn composure at this time manifest in his countenance w very impressive indicating that he was sensible the time of his departure was at hand and that the prospect of death brought no terrors with it During his last illness his mental faculti were occasionally obscured yet he was at times enabled to give satisfactory evidence to those around him that all was well and that he felt nothing in his way His funeral took place on fourth day the third of third month It was attended by a large concourse of Friends and others and a solid meeting was held on the occasion after which his remains were interr d in Friends burial ground at this place Jericho Queens county New York I have thought even presented so incompletely with such fearful hiatuses and in my own feebleness and waning life one might well memorize this life of Elias Hicks Though not eminent in literature or politics or inventions or business it is a token of not a few and is significant Such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiers but I have thought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a sample that this one specially does I have already compared it to a little flowing liquid rill of Nature s life maintaining freshness As if indeed under the smoke of battles the blare of trumpets and the madness of contending hosts the screams of passion the groans of the suffering the parching of struggles of money and politics and all hell s heat and noise and competition above and around should come melting down from the mountains from sources of unpolluted snows far up there in God s hidden untrodden recesses and so rippling along among us low in the ground at men s very feet a curious little brook of clear and cool and ever healthy ever living water Note The Separation The division vulgarly call d between Orthodox and Hicksites in the Society of Friends took place in eighteen twenty seven eight and nine Probably it had been preparing some time One who was present has since described to me the climax at a meeting of Friends in Philadelphia crowded by a great attendance of both sexes with Elias as principal speaker In the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these words The blood of Christ the blood of Christ why my friends the actual blood of Christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood of bulls and goats not a bit more not a bit At these words after a momentary hush commenced a great tumult Hundreds rose to their feet Canes were thump d upon the floor From all parts of the house angry mutterings Some left the place but more remain d with exclamations flush d faces and eyes This was the definite utterance the overt act which led to the separation Families diverg d even husbands and wives parents and children were separated Of course what Elias promulg d spread a great commotion among the Friends Sometimes when he presented himself to speak in the meeting there would be opposition this led to angry words gestures unseemly noises recriminations Elias at such times was deeply affected the tears roll d in streams down his cheeks he silently waited the close of the dispute Let the Friend speak let the Friend speak he would say when his supporters in the meeting tried to bluff off some violent orthodox person objecting to the new doctrinaire But he never recanted A reviewer of the old dispute and separation made the following comments on them in a paper ten years ago It was in America where there had been no persecution worth mentioning since Mary Dyer was hang d on Boston Common that about fifty years ago differences arose singularly enough upon doctrinal points of the divinity of Christ and the nature of the atonement Whoever would know how bitter was the controversy and how much of human infirmity was found to be still lurking under broad brim hats and drab coats must seek for the information in the Lives of Elias Hicks and of Thomas Shillitoe the latter an English Friend who visited us at this unfortunate time and who exercised his gifts as a peace maker with but little success The meetings according to his testimony were sometimes turn d into mobs The disruption was wide and seems to have been final Six of the ten yearly meetings were divided and since that time various sub divisions have come four or five in number There has never however been anything like a repetition of the excitement of the Hicksite controversy and Friends of all kinds at present appear to have settled down into a solid steady comfortable state and to be working in their own way without troubling other Friends whose ways are different Note Old persons who heard this man in his day and who glean d impressions from what they saw of him judg d from their own points of views have in their conversation with me dwelt on another point They think Elias Hicks had a large element of personal ambition the pride of leadership of establishing perhaps a sect that should reflect his own name and to which he should give especial form and character Very likely Such indeed seems the means all through progress and civilization by which strong men and strong convictions achieve anything definite But the basic foundation of Elias was undoubtedly genuine religious fervor He was like an old Hebrew prophet He had the spirit of one and in his later years look d like one What Carlyle says of John Knox will apply to him He is an instance to us how a man by sincerity itself becomes heroic it is the grand gift he has We find in him a good honest intellectual talent no transcendent one a narrow inconsiderable man as compared with Luther but in heartfelt instinctive adherence to truth in sincerity as we say he has no superior nay one might ask What equal he has The heart of him is of the true Prophet cast He lies there said the Earl of Morton at Knox s grave who never fear d the face of man He resembles more than any of the moderns an old Hebrew Prophet The same inflexibility intolerance rigid narrow looking adherence to God s truth A Note yet The United States to day While under all previous conditions even convictions of society Oriental Feudal Ecclesiastical and in all past or present Despotisms through the entire past there existed and exists yet in ally and fusion with them and frequently forming the main part of them certain churches institutes priesthoods fervid beliefs c practically promoting religious and moral action to the fullest degrees of which humanity there under circumstances was capable and often conserving all there was of justice art literature and good manners it is clear I say that under the Democratic Institutes of the United States now and henceforth there are no equally genuine fountains of fervid beliefs adapted to produce similar moral and religious results according to our circumstances I consider that the churches sects pulpits of the present day in the United States exist not by any solid convictions but by a sort of tacit supercilious scornful suffrance Few speak openly none officially against them But the ostent continuously imposing who is not aware that any such living fountains of belief in them are now utterly ceas d and departed from the minds of men A Lingering Note In the making of a full man all the other consciences the emotional courageous intellectual esthetic c are to be crown d and effused by the religious conscience In the higher structure of a human self or of community the Moral the Religious the Spiritual is strictly analogous to the subtle vitalization and antiseptic play call d Health in the physiologic structure To person or State the main verteber or rather the verteber is Morality That is indeed the only real vitalization of character and of all the supersensual even heroic and artistic portions of man or nationality It is to run through and knit the superior parts and keep man or State vital and upright as health keeps the body straight and blooming Of course a really grand and strong and beautiful character is probably to be slowly grown and adjusted strictly with reference to itself its own personal and social sphere with paradox though it may be the clear understanding that the conventional theories of life worldly ambition wealth office fame c are essentially but glittering mayas delusions Doubtless the greatest scientists and theologians will sometimes find themselves saying It isn t only those who know most who contribute most to God s glory Doubtless these very scientists at times stand with bared heads before the humblest lives and personalities For there is something greater is there not than all the science and poems of the world above all else like the stars shining eternal above Shakspere s plays or Concord philosophy or art of Angelo or Raphael something that shines elusive like beams of Hesperus at evening high above all the vaunted wealth and pride prov d by its practical outcropping in life each case after its own concomitants the intuitive blending of divine love and faith in a human emotional character blending for all for the unlearn d the common and the poor I don t know in what book I once read possibly the remark has been made in books all ages that no life ever lived even the most uneventful but probed to its centre would be found in itself as subtle a drama as any that poets have ever sung or playwrights fabled Often too in size and weight that life suppos d obscure For it isn t only the palpable stars astronomers say there are dark or almost dark unnotic d orbs and suns like the dusky companions of Sirius seven times as large as our own sun rolling through space real and potent as any perhaps the most real and potent Yet none recks of them In the bright lexicon we give the spreading heavens they have not even names Amid ceaseless sophistications all times the soul would seem to glance yearningly around for such contrasts such cool still offsets Notes forty two In Walter Scott s reminiscences he speaks of Burns as having the most eloquent glowing flashing illuminated dark orbed eyes he ever beheld in a human face and I think Elias Hicks s must have been like them forty three The true Christian religion such was the teaching of Elias Hicks consists neither in rites or Bibles or sermons or Sundays but in noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration in purity in a good practical life in charity to the poor and toleration to all He said A man may keep the Sabbath may belong to a church and attend all the observances have regular family prayer keep a well bound copy of the Hebrew Scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house and yet not be a truly religious person at all E believ d little in a church as organiz d even his own with houses ministers or with salaries creeds Sundays saints Bibles holy festivals c But he believ d always in the universal church in the soul of man invisibly rapt ever waiting ever responding to universal truths He was fond of pithy proverbs He said It matters not where you live but how you live He said once to my father They talk of the devil I tell thee Walter there is no worse devil than man GEORGE FOX AND SHAKSPERE While we are about it we must almost Inevitably go back to the origin of the Society of which Elias Hicks has so far prov d to be the most mark d individual result We must revert to the latter part of the sixteenth and all or nearly all of that seventeenth century crowded with so many important historical events changes and personages Throughout Europe and especially in what we call our Mother Country men were unusually arous d some would say demented It was a special age of the insanity of witch trials and witch hangings In one year sixty were hung for witchcraft in one English county alone It was peculiarly an age of military religious conflict Protestantism and Catholicism were wrestling like giants for the mastery straining every nerve Only to think of it that age its events persons Shakspere just dead his folios publish d complete Charles first the shadowy spirit and the solid block To sum up all it was the age of Cromwell As indispensable foreground indeed for Elias Hicks and perhaps sine qua non to an estimate of the kind of man we must briefly transport ourselves back to the England of that period As I say it is the time of tremendous moral and political agitation ideas of conflicting forms governments theologies seethe and dash like ocean storms and ebb and flow like mighty tides It was or had been the time of the long feud between the Parliament and the Crown In the midst of the sprouts began George Fox born eight years after the death of Shakspere He was the son of a weaver himself a shoemaker and was converted before the age of twenty But O the sufferings mental and physical through which those years of the strange youth pass d He claim d to be sent by God to fulfill a mission I come he said to direct people to the spirit that gave forth the Scriptures The range of his thought even then cover d almost every important subject of after times anti slavery women s rights c Though in a low sphere and among the masses he forms a mark d feature in the age And how indeed beyond all any that stormy and perturb d age The foundations of the old the superstitious the conventionally poetic the credulous all breaking the light of the new and of science and democracy definitely beginning a mad fierce almost crazy age The political struggles of the reigns of the Charleses and of the Protectorate of Cromwell heated to frenzy by theological struggles Those were the years following the advent and practical working of the Reformation but Catholicism is yet strong and yet seeks supremacy We think our age full of the flush of men and doings and culminations of war and peace and so it is But there could hardly be a grander and more picturesque and varied age than that Born out of and in this age when Milton Bunyan Dryden and John Locke were still living amid the memories of Queen Elizabeth and James First and the events of their reigns when the radiance of that galaxy of poets warriors statesmen captains lords explorers wits and gentlemen that crowded the courts and times of those sovereigns still fill d the atmosphere when America commencing to be explor d and settled commenc d also to be suspected as destin d to overthrow the old standards and calculations when Feudalism like a sunset seem d to gather all its glories reminiscences personalisms in one last gorgeous effort before the advance of a

himself is almost lost in it and his contemporaries the same his fictitious Othello Romeo Hamlet Lear as real as any lords of England or Europe then and there more real to us the mind sometimes thinks

for something too a thought the thought that wakes in silent hours perhaps the deepest most eternal thought latent in the human soul This is the thought of God merged in the thoughts of moral right

poetry old or new even Shakespere s with all that statue play painting music architecture oratory can effect ceases to satisfy and please When the eager chase after wealth flags and beauty itself

certain source of what all are seeking but few or none finding it I for myself clearly see the first the last the deepest depths and highest heights of art of literature and of the purposes of life I

In the domain of Literature loftily consider d an accomplish d and veteran critic in his just out work forty four now says the kingdom of the Father has pass d the kingdom of the Son is passing the kingdom of the Spirit begins Leaving the reader to chew on and extract the juice and meaning of this I will proceed to say in melanged form what I have had brought out by the English author s essay he discusses the poetic art mostly on my own real or by him supposed views and purports If I give any answers to him or explanations of what my books intend they will be not direct but indirect and derivative Of course this brief jotting is personal Something very like querulous egotism and growling may break through the narrative for I have been and am rejected by all the great magazines carry now my seventy twod annual burden and have been a paralytic for eighteen years No great poem or other literary or artistic work of any scope old or new can be essentially consider d without weighing first the age politics or want of politics and aim visible forms unseen soul and current times out of the midst of which it rises and is formulated as the Biblic canticles and their days and spirit as the Homeric or Dante s utterance or Shakspere s or the old Scotch or Irish ballads or Ossian or Omar Khayyam So I have conceiv d and launch d and work d for years at my Leaves of Grass personal emanations only at best but with specialty of emergence and background the ripening of the nineteenth century the thought and fact and radiation of individuality of America the secession war and showing the democratic conditions supplanting everything that insults them or impedes their aggregate way Doubtless my poems illustrate one of novel thousands to come for a long period those conditions but democratic art will have to wait long before it is satisfactorily formulated and defined if it ever is I will now for one indicative moment lock horns with what many Think the greatest thing the question of art so call d I have not seen without learning something therefrom how with hardly an exception the poets of this age devote themselves always mainly sometimes altogether to fine rhyme spicy verbalism the fabric and cut of the garment jewelry concetti style art To day these adjuncts are certainly the effort beyond all else yet the lesson of Nature undoubtedly is to proceed with single purpose toward the result necessitated and for which the time has arrived utterly regardless of the outputs of shape appearance or criticism which are always left to settle themselves I have not only not bother d much about style form art et cetera but confess to more or less apathy I believe I have sometimes caught myself in decided aversion toward them throughout asking nothing of them but negative advantages that they should never impede me and never under any circumstances or for their own purposes only assume any mastery over me From the beginning I have watch d the sharp and sometimes heavy and deep penetrating objections and reviews against my work and I hope entertain d and audited them for I have probably had an advantage in constructing from a central and unitary principle since the first but at long intervals and stages sometimes lapses of five or six years or peace or war Ruskin the Englishman charges as a fearful and serious lack that my poems have no humor A profound German critic complains that compared with the luxuriant and well accepted songs of the world there is about my verse a certain coldness severity absence of spice polish or of consecutive meaning and plot The book is autobiographic at bottom and may be I do not exhibit and make ado about the stock passions I am partly of Quaker stock Then E C Stedman finds or found mark d fault with me because while celebrating the common people en masse I do not allow enough heroism and moral merit and good intentions to the choicer classes the college bred the etat major It is quite probable that S is right in the matter In the main I myself look and have from the first look d to the bulky democratic torso of the United States even for esthetic and moral attributes of serious account and refused to aim at or accept anything less If America is only for the rule and fashion and small typicality of other lands the rule of the etat major it is not the land I take it for and should to day feel that my literary aim and theory had been blanks and misdirections Strictly judged most modern poems are but larger or smaller lumps of sugar or slices of toothsome sweet cake even the banqueters dwelling on those glucose flavors as a main part of the dish Which perhaps leads to something to have great heroic poetry we need great readers a heroic appetite and audience Have we at present any such Then the thought at the centre never too often repeated Boundless material wealth free political organization immense geographic area and unprecedented business and products even the most active intellect and culture will not place this Commonwealth of ours on the topmost range of history and humanity or any eminence of democratic art to say nothing of its pinnacle Only the production and on the most copious scale of loftiest moral spiritual and heroic personal illustrations a great native Literature headed with a Poetry stronger and sweeter than any yet If there can be any such thing as a kosmic modern and original song America needs it and is worthy of it In my opinion to day bitter as it is to say so the outputs through civilized nations everywhere from the great words Literature Art Religion c with their conventional administerers stand squarely in the way of what the vitalities of those great words signify more than they really prepare the soil for them or plant the seeds or cultivate or garner the crop My own opinion has long been that for New World service our ideas of beauty inherited from the Greeks and so on to Shakspere query perverted from them need to be radically changed and made anew for to day s purposes and finer standards But if so it will all come in due time the real change will be an autochthonic interior constitutional even local one from which our notions of beauty lines and colors are wondrous lovely but character is lovelier will branch or offshoot So much have I now rattled off old age s garrulity that there is not space for explaining the most important and pregnant principle of all viz that Art is one is not partial but includes all times and forms and sorts is not exclusively aristocratic or democratic or oriental or occidental My favorite symbol would be a good font of type where the impeccable long primer rejects nothing Or the old Dutch flour miller who said I never bother myself what road the folks come I only want good wheat and rye The font is about the same forever Democratic art results of democratic development from tinge true nationality belief in the one setting up from it Note forty four Two new volumes

lands and pending days than it has yet produced from any utterance old or new Modern or new poetry too viewing or challenging it with severe criticism is largely a void while the very cognizance or even suspicion of that void and the need of filling it proves a certainty of the hidden and waiting supply Leaving other lands and languages to speak for themselves we can abruptly but deeply suggest it best from our own going first to oversea illustrations and standing on them Think of Byron Burns Shelley Keats even first raters the brothers of the radiant summit as William O Connor calls them as

completer far than any they themselves fulfill d One has in his eye and mind some very large very old entirely sound and vital tree or vine like certain hardy ever fruitful specimens in California and Canada or down in Mexico and indeed in all lands beyond the chronological records illustrations of growth continuity power amplitude and exploitation almost beyond statement but proving fact and possibility outside of argument Perhaps indeed the rarest and most blessed quality of transcendent noble poetry as of law and of the profoundest wisdom and estheticism is I would suggest from sane completed vital capable old age The final proof of song or personality is a sort of matured accreted superb evoluted almost divine impalpable diffuseness and atmosphere or invisible magnetism

upon us a war with Great Britain follow d unquestionably as that war would have by recognition of the Southern Confederacy from all the leading European nations It is now certain that all this then inevitable train of calamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and written missive of the British Minister to America which the Queen and Prince Albert latent positively and promptly cancell d and which her firm attitude did alone actually erase and leave out against all the other official prestige and Court of saint James s On such minor and personal incidents so to call them often depend the great growths and turns of civilization This moment of a woman and a queen surely swung the grandest oscillation of modern history s pendulum Many sayings and doings of that period from foreign potentates and powers might well be dropt in oblivion by America but never this if I could have my way W W AMERICAN NATIONAL LITERATURE Is there any such thing or can there ever be So you want an essay about American National Literature tremendous and fearful subject do you forty six Well if you will let me put down some melanged cogitations regarding the matter hap hazard and from my own points of view I will try Horace Greeley wrote a book named Hints toward Reforms and the title line was consider d the best part of all In the present case I will give a few thoughts and suggestions of good and ambitious intent enough anyhow first reiterating the question right out plainly American National Literature is there distinctively any such thing or can there ever be First to me comes an almost indescribably august form the People with varied typical shapes and attitudes then the divine mirror Literature As things are probably no more puzzling question ever offer d itself than going back to old Nile for a trope What bread seeds of printed mentality shall we cast upon America s waters to grow and return after many days Is there for the future authorship of the United States any better way than submission to the teeming facts events activities and importations already vital through and beneath them all I have often ponder d it and felt myself disposed to let it go at that Indeed are not those facts and activities and importations potent and certain to fulfil themselves all through our Commonwealth irrespective of any attempt from individual guidance But allowing all and even at that a good part of the matter being honest discussion examination and earnest personal presentation we may even for sanitary exercise and contact plunge boldly into the spread of the many waves and cross tides as follows Or to change the figure I will present my varied little collation what is our Country itself but an infinitely vast and varied collation in the hope that the show itself indicates a duty getting more and more incumbent every day In general civilization s totality or real representative National Literature formates itself like language or the weather not from two or three influences however important nor from any learned syllabus or criticism or what ought to be nor from any minds or advice of toploftical quarters and indeed not at all from the influences and ways ostensibly supposed though they too are adopted after a sort but slowly slowly curiously from many more and more deeper mixings and siftings especially in America and generations and years and races and what largely appears to be chance but is not chance at all First of all for future National Literature in America New England the technically moral and schoolmaster region as a cynical fellow I know calls it and the three or four great Atlantic coast cities highly as they to day suppose they dominate the whole will have to haul in their horns Ensemble is the tap root of National Literature America is become already a huge world of peoples rounded and orbic climates idiocrasies and geographies forty four Nations curiously and irresistibly blent and aggregated in ONE NATION with one imperial language and one unitary set of social and legal standards over all and I predict a yet to be National Literature In my mind this last if it ever comes is to prove grander and more important for the Commonwealth than its politics and material wealth and trade vast and indispensable as those are Think a moment what must beyond peradventure be the real permanent sub bases or lack of them Books profoundly considered show a great nation more than anything else more than laws or manners This is of course probably the deep down meaning of that well buried but ever vital platitude Let me sing the people s songs and I don t care who makes their laws Books too reflect humanity en masse and surely show them splendidly or the reverse and prove or celebrate their prevalent traits these last the main things Homer grew out of and has held the ages and holds to day by the universal admiration for personal prowess courage rankness amour propre leadership inherent in the whole human race Shakspere concentrates the brilliancy of the centuries of feudalism on the proud personalities they produced and paints the amorous passion The books of the Bible stand for the final superiority of devout emotions over the rest and of religious adoration and ultimate absolute justice more powerful than haughtiest kings or millionaires or majorities What the United States are working out and establishing needs imperatively the connivance of something subtler than ballots and legislators The Goethean theory and lesson if I may briefly state it so of the exclusive sufficiency of artistic scientific literary equipment to the character irrespective of any strong claims of the political ties of nation state or city could have answer d under the conventionality and pettiness of Weimar or the Germany or even Europe of those times but it will not do for America to day at all We have not only to exploit our own theory above any that has preceded us but we have entirely different and deeper rooted and infinitely broader themes When I have had a chance to see and observe a sufficient crowd of American boys or maturer youths or well grown men all the States as in my experiences in the secession war among the soldiers or west east north or south or my wanderings and loiterings through cities especially New York and in Washington I have invariably found coming to the front three prevailing personal traits to be named here for brevity s sake under the heads Good Nature Decorum and Intelligence I make Good Nature first as it deserves to be it is a splendid resultant of all the rest like health or fine weather Essentially these lead the inherent list of the high average personal born and bred qualities of the young fellows everywhere through the United States as any sharp observer can find out for himself Surely these make the vertebral stock of superbest and noblest nations May the destinies show it so forthcoming I mainly confide the whole future of our Commonwealth to the fact of these three bases Need I say I demand the same in the elements and spirit and fruitage of National Literature Another perhaps a born root or branch comes under the words Noblesse Oblige even for a national rule or motto My opinion is that this foregoing phrase and its spirit should influence and permeate official America and its representatives in Congress the Executive Departments the Presidency and the individual States should be one of their chiefest mottoes and be carried out practically I got the idea from my dear friend the democratic Englishwoman missus Anne Gilchrist now dead The beautiful words Noblesse Oblige said she to me once are not best for some develop d gentleman or lord but some rich and develop d nation and especially for your America Then another and very grave point for this discussion is deep deep not for trifles or pretty seemings I am not sure but the establish d and old and superb and profound and one may say needed as old conception of Deity as mainly of moral constituency goodness purity sinlessness c has been undermined by nineteenth century ideas and science What does this immense and almost abnormal development of Philanthropy mean among the moderns One doubts if there ever will come a day when the moral laws and moral standards will be supplanted as over all while time proceeds I find it so myself they will probably be intrench d deeper and expanded wider Then the expanded scientific and democratic and truly philosophic and poetic quality of modernism demands a Deific identity and scope superior to all limitations and essentially including just as well the so call d evil and crime and criminals all the malformations the defective and abortions of the universe Sometimes the bulk of the common people who are far more cute than the critics suppose relish a well hidden allusion or hint carelessly dropt faintly indicated and left to be disinterr d or not Some of the very old ballads have delicious morsels of this kind Greek Aristophanes and Pindar abounded in them I sometimes fancy the old Hellenic audiences must have been as generally keen and knowing as any of their poets Shakspere is full of them Tennyson has them It is always a capital compliment from author to reader and worthy the peering brains of America The mere smartness of the common folks however does not need encouraging but qualities more solid and opportune What are now deepest wanted in the States as roots for their literature are Patriotism Nationality Ensemble or the ideas of these and the uncompromising genesis and saturation of these Not the mere bawling and braggadocio of them but the radical emotion facts the fervor and perennial fructifying spirit at fountain head And at the risk of being misunderstood I should dwell on and repeat that a great imaginative literatus for America can never be merely good and moral in the conventional method Puritanism and what radiates from it must always be mention d by me with respect then I should say for this vast and varied Commonwealth geographically and artistically the puritanical standards are constipated narrow and non philosophic In the main I adhere to my positions in Democratic Vistas and especially to my summing up of American literature as far as to day is concern d In Scientism the Medical Profession Practical Inventions and Journalism the United States have press d forward to the glorious front rank of advanced civilized lands as also in the popular dissemination of printed matter of a superficial nature perhaps but that is an indispensable preparatory stage and have gone in common education so call d far beyond any other land or age Yet the high pitch d taunt of Margaret Fuller forty years ago still sounds in the air It does not follow because the United States print and read more books magazines and newspapers than all the rest of the world that they really have therefore a literature For perhaps it is not alone the free schools and newspapers nor railroads and factories nor all the iron cotton wheat pork and petroleum nor the gold and silver nor the surplus of a hundred or several hundred millions nor the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments nor the last national census that can put this Commonweal high or highest on the cosmical scale of history Something else is indispensable All that record is lofty but there is a loftier The great current points are perhaps simple after all first that the highest developments of the New World and Democracy and probably the best society of the civilized world all over are to be only reach d and spinally nourish d in my notion by a new evolutionary sense and treatment and secondly that the evolution principle which is the greatest law through nature and of course in these States has now reach d us markedly for and in our literature In other writings I have tried to show how vital to any aspiring Nationality must ever be its autochthonic song and how for a really great people there can be no complete and glorious Name short of emerging out of and even rais d on such born poetic expression coming from its own soil and soul its area spread idiosyncrasies and like showers of rain originally rising impalpably distill d from land and sea duly returning there again Nor do I forget what we all owe to our ancestry though perhaps we are apt to forgive and bear too much for that alone One part of the national American literatus s task is and it is not an easy one to treat the old hereditaments legends poems theologies and even customs with fitting respect and toleration and at the same time clearly understand and justify and be devoted to and exploit our own day its diffused light freedom responsibilities with all it necessitates and that our New World circumstances and stages of development demand and make proper For American literature we want mighty authors not even Carlyle and Heine like born and brought up in and more or less essentially partaking and giving out that vast abnormal ward or hysterical sick chamber which in many respects Europe with all its glories would seem to be The greatest feature in current poetry perhaps in literature anyhow is the almost total lack of first class power and simple natural health flourishing and produced at first hand typifying our own era Modern verse generally lacks quite altogether the modern and is oftener possess d in spirit with the past and feudal dressed may be in late fashions For novels and plays often the plots and surfaces are contemporary but the spirit even the fun is morbid and effete There is an essential difference between the Old and New The poems of Asia and Europe are rooted in the long past They celebrate man and his intellections and relativenesses as they have been But America in as high a strain as ever is to sing them all as they are and are to be I know of course that the past is probably a main factor in what we are and know and must be At present the States are absorb d in business money making politics agriculture the development of mines intercommunications and other material attents which all shove forward and appear at their height as consistently with modern civilization they must be and should be Then even these are but the inevitable precedents and providers for home born transcendent democratic literature to be shown in superior more heroic more spiritual more emotional personalities and songs A national literature is of course in one sense a great mirror or reflector There must however be something before something to reflect I should say now since the secession war there has been and to day unquestionably exists that something Certainly anyhow the United States do not so far utter poetry first rate literature or any of the so call d arts to any lofty admiration or advantage are not dominated or penetrated from actual inherence or plain bent to the said poetry and arts Other work other needs current inventions productions have occupied and to day mainly occupy them They are very cute and imitative and proud can t bear being left too glaringly away far behind the other high class nations and so we set up some home poets artists painters musicians literati and so forth all our own thus claim d The whole matter has gone on and exists to day probably as it should have been and should be as for the present it must be To all which we conclude and repeat the terrible query American National Literature is there distinctively any such thing or can there ever be Note forty six The essay was for the North American Review in answer to the formal request of the editor It appear d in March eighteen ninety one GATHERING THE CORN Last of October Now mellow crisp Autumn days bright moonlight nights and gathering the corn cutting up as the farmers call it Now or of late all over the country a certain green and brown drab eloquence seeming to call out You that pretend to give the news and all that s going why not give us a notice Truly O fields as for the notice Take we give it willingly Only we must do it our own way Leaving the domestic dietary and commercial parts of the question which are enormous in fact hardly second to those of any other of our great soil products we will just saunter down a lane we know on an average West Jersey farm and let the fancy of the hour itemize America s most typical agricultural show and specialty Gathering the Corn the British call it Maize the old Yankee farmer Indian Corn The great plumes the ears well envelop d in their husks the long and pointed leaves in summer like green or purple ribands with a yellow stem line in the middle all now turn d dingy the sturdy stalks and the rustling in the breeze the breeze itself well tempering the sunny noon The varied reminiscences recall d the ploughing and planting in spring the whole family in the field even the little girls and boys dropping seed in the hill the gorgeous sight through July and August the walk and observation early in the day the cheery call of the robin and the low whirr of insects in the grass the Western husking party when ripe the November moonlight gathering and the calls songs laughter of the young fellows Not to forget hereabouts in the Middle States the old worm fences with the gray rails and their scabs of moss and lichen those old rails weather beaten but strong yet Why not come down from literary dignity and confess we are sitting on one now under the shade of a great walnut tree Why not confide that these lines are pencill d on the edge of a woody bank with a glistening pond and creek seen through the trees south and the corn we are writing about close at hand on the north Why not put in the delicious scent of the life everlasting that yet lingers so profusely in every direction the chromatic song of the one persevering locust the insect is scarcer this fall and the past summer than for many years beginning slowly rising and swelling to much emphasis and then abruptly falling so appropriate to the scene so quaint so racy and suggestive in the warm sunbeams we could sit here and look and listen for an hour Why not even the tiny turtle shaped yellow back d black spotted lady bug that has lit on the shirt sleeve of the arm inditing this Ending our list with the fall drying grass the Autumn days themselves Sweet days so cool so calm so bright yet not so cool either about noon the horse mint the wild carrot the mullein and the bumble bee How the half mad vision of William Blake how the far freer far firmer fantasy that wrote Midsummer Night s Dream would have revell d night or day and beyond stint in one of our American corn fields Truly in color outline material and spiritual suggestiveness where any more inclosing theme for idealist poet literary artist What we have written has been at noon day but perhaps better still for this collation to steal off by yourself these fine nights and go slowly musingly down the lane when the dry and green gray frost touch d leaves seem whisper gossipping all over the field in low tones as if every hill had something to say and you sit or lean recluse near by and inhale that rare rich ripe and peculiar odor of the gather d plant which comes out best only to the night air The complex impressions of the far spread fields and woods in the night are blended mystically soothingly indefinitely and yet palpably to you appealing curiously perhaps mostly to the sense of smell All is comparative silence and clear shadow below and the stars are up there with Jupiter lording it over westward sulky Saturn in the east and over head the moon A rare well shadow d hour By no means the least of the eligibilities of the gather d corn A DEATH BOUQUET Pick d Noontime early January eighteen ninety Death too great a subject to be treated so indeed the greatest subject and yet I am giving you but a few random lines about it as one writes hurriedly the last part of a letter to catch the closing mail Only I trust the lines especially the poetic bits quoted may leave a lingering odor of spiritual heroism afterward For I am probably fond of viewing all really great themes indirectly and by side ways and suggestions Certain music from wondrous voices or skilful players then poetic glints still more put the soul in rapport with death or toward it Hear a strain from Tennyson s late Crossing the Bar Twilight and evening bell And after that the dark And may there be no sadness of farewell When I embark For tho from out our bourne of Time and Place The floods may bear me far I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar Am I starting the sail craft of poets in line Here then a quatrain of Phrynichus long ago to one of old Athens favorites Thrice happy Sophocles in good old age Bless d as a man and as a craftsman bless d He died his many tragedies were fair And fair his end nor knew he any sorrow Certain music indeed especially voluntaries by a good player at twilight or idle rambles alone by the shore or over prairie or on mountain road for that matter favor the right mood Words are difficult even impossible No doubt any one will recall ballads or songs or hymns may be instrumental performances that have arous d so curiously yet definitely the thought of death the mystic the after realm as no statement or sermon could and brought it hovering near A happy to call it so and easy death is at least as much a physiological result as a pyschological one The foundation of it really begins before birth and is thence directly or indirectly shaped and affected even constituted the base stomachic by every thing from that minute till the time of its occurrence And yet here is something Whittier s Burning Driftwood of an opposite coloring I know the solemn monotone Of waters calling unto me I know from whence the airs have blown That whisper of the Eternal Sea As low my fires of driftwood burn I hear that sea s deep sounds increase And fair in sunset light discern Its mirage lifted Isles of Peace Like an invisible breeze after a long and sultry day death sometimes sets in at last soothingly and refreshingly almost vitally In not a few cases the termination even appears to be a sort of ecstasy Of course there are painful deaths but I do not believe such is at all the general rule Of the many hundreds I myself saw die in the fields and hospitals during the secession war the cases of mark d suffering or agony in extremis were very rare It is a curious suggestion of immortality that the mental and emotional powers remain to their clearest through all while the senses of pain and flesh volition are blunted or even gone Then to give the following and cease before the thought gets threadbare Now land and life finale and farewell Now Voyager depart much much for thee is yet in store Often enough hast thou adventur d o er the seas Cautiously cruising studying the charts Duly again to port and hawser s tie returning But now obey thy cherish d secret wish Embrace thy friends leave all in order To port and hawser s tie no more returning Depart upon thy endless cruise old Sailor SOME LAGGARDS YET THE PERFECT HUMAN VOICE Stating it briefly and pointedly I should suggest that the human voice is a cultivation or form d growth on a fair native foundation This foundation probably exists in nine cases out of ten Sometimes nature affords the vocal organ in perfection or rather I would say near enough to whet one s appreciation and appetite for a voice that might be truly call d perfection To me the grand voice is mainly physiological by which I by no means ignore the mental help but wish to keep the emphasis where it belongs Emerson says manners form the representative apex and final charm and captivation of humanity but he might as well have changed the typicality to voice Of course there is much taught and written about elocution the best reading speaking c but it finally settles down to best human vocalization Beyond all other power and beauty there is something in the quality and power of the right voice timbre the schools call it that touches the soul the abysms It was not for nothing that the Greeks depended at their highest on poetry s and wisdom s vocal utterance by tete a tete lectures indeed all the ancients did Of celebrated people possessing this wonderful vocal power patent to me in former days I should specify the contralto Alboni Elias Hicks Father Taylor the tenor Bettini Fanny Kemble and the old actor Booth and in private life many cases often women I sometimes wonder whether the best philosophy and poetry or something like the best after all these centuries perhaps waits to be rous d out yet or suggested by the perfect physiological human voice SHAKSPERE FOR AMERICA Let me send you a supplementary word to that view of Shakspere attributed to me publish d in your July number forty seven and so courteously worded by the reviewer thanks dear friend But you have left out what perhaps is the main point as follows Even the one who at present reigns unquestion d of Shakspere for all he stands for so much in modern literature he stands entirely for the mighty esthetic sceptres of the past not for the spiritual and democratic the sceptres of the future See pp fifty five fifty eight in November Boughs and also some of my further notions on Shakspere The Old World Europe and Asia is the region of the poetry of concrete and real things the past the esthetic palaces etiquette the literature of war and love the mythological gods and the myths anyhow But the New World America is the region of the future and its poetry must be spiritual and democratic Evolution is not the rule in Nature in Politics and Inventions only but in Verse I know our age is greatly materialistic but it is greatly spiritual too and the future will be too Even what we moderns have come to mean by spirituality while including what the Hebraic utterers and mainly perhaps all the Greek and other old typical poets and also the later ones meant has so expanded and color d and vivified the comprehension of the term that it is quite a different one from the past Then science the final critic of all has the casting vote for future poetry Note forty seven This bit was in Poet lore monthly for September eighteen ninety UNASSAIL D RENOWN The N Y Critic Nov twenty four eighteen eighty nine propounded a circular to several persons and giving the responses says Walt Whitman s views as follow are naturally more radical than those of any other contributor to the discussion Briefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct nineteen the question whether I think any American poet not now living deserves a place among the thirteen English inheritors of unassail d renown Chaucer Spenser Shakspere Milton Dryden Pope Gray Burns Wordsworth Coleridge Byron Shelley and Keats and which American poets would be truly worthy c Though to me the deep of the matter goes down down beneath I remember the London Times at the time in opportune profound and friendly articles on Bryant s and Longfellow s deaths spoke of the embarrassment warping effect and confusion on America her poets and poetic students coming in possession of a great estate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn and the further contingency of the English language ever having annex d to it a lot of first class Poetry that would be American not European proving then something precious over all and beyond valuation But perhaps that is venturing outside the question Of the thirteen British immortals mention d after placing Shakspere on a sort of pre eminence of fame not to be invaded yet the names of Bryant Emerson Whittier and Longfellow with even added names sometimes Southerners sometimes Western or other writers of only one or two pieces deserve in my opinion an equally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that glorious list INSCRIPTION FOR A LITTLE BOOK ON GIORDANO BRUNO As America s mental courage the thought comes to me to day is so indebted above all current lands and peoples to the noble army of Old World martyrs past how incumbent on us that we clear those martyrs lives and names and hold them up for reverent admiration as well as beacons And typical of this and standing for it and all perhaps Giordano Bruno may well be put to day and to come in our New World s thankfulest heart and memory W W CAMDEN NEW JERSEY February twenty fourth eighteen ninety SPLINTERS While I stand in reverence before the fact of Humanity the People I will confess in writing my L of G the least consideration out of all that has had to do with it has been the consideration of the public at any rate as it now exists Strange as it may sound for a democrat to say so I am clear that no free and original and lofty soaring poem or one ambitious of those achievements can possibly be fulfill d by any writer who has largely in his thought the public or the question What will establish d literature What will the current authorities say about it As far as I have sought any not the best laid out garden or parterre has been my model but Nature has been I know that in a sense the garden is nature too but I had to choose I could not give both Besides the gardens are well represented in poetry while Nature in letter and in spirit in the divine essence little if at all Certainly while I have not hit it by a long shot I have aim d at the most ambitious the best and sometimes feel to advance that aim even with all its arrogance as the most redeeming part of my books I have never so much cared to feed the esthetic or intellectual palates but if I could arouse from its slumbers that eligibility in every soul for its own true exercise if I could only wield that lever Out from the well tended concrete and the physical and in them and from them only radiate the spiritual and heroic Undoubtedly many points belonging to this essay perhaps of the greatest necessity fitness and importance to it have been left out or forgotten But the amount of the whole matter poems preface and

mocks the quick transitions of the hour Now could he hug bleak Zembla s bolted snow Now to Arabia s heated deserts turn Yet bids the biting blast more fiercely blow The scorching sun without abatement burn There this bold Outlaw rising with the morn His sinewy functions fitted for the toil Pursues with tireless steps the rapturous horn And bears in triumph back the shaggy spoil Or on his rugged range of towering hills Turns the stiff glebe behind his hardy team His wide spread heaths to blithest measures tills And boasts the joys of life are not a dream Then to his airy hut at eve retires Clasps to his open breast his buxom spouse Basks in his faggot s blaze his passions fires And strait supine to rest unbroken bows On his smooth forehead Time s old annual score Tho left to furrow yet disdains to lie He bids weak sorrow tantalize no more And puts the cup of care contemptuous by If from some inland height that skirting bears Its rude encroachments far into the vale He views where poor dishonor d nature wears On her soft cheek alone the lily pale How will he scorn alliance with the race Those aspen shoots that shiver at a breath Children of sloth that danger dare not face And

proverb but you mustn t carry it too far I will not reject any theme or subject because the treatment is too personal As my stuff settles into shape I am told and sometimes myself discover uneasily

BAY THE OLD NAME Commencement of a gossipy travelling letter in a New York city paper May ten eighteen seventy nine My month s visit is about up but before I get back to Camden let me print some jottings of the last four weeks Have you not reader dear among your intimate friends some one temporarily absent whose letters to you avoiding all the big topics and disquisitions give only minor gossipy sights and scenes just as they come subjects disdain d by solid writers but interesting to you because they were such as happen to everybody and were the moving entourage to your friend to his or her steps eyes mentality Well with an idea something of that kind I suppose I set out on the following hurrygraphs of a breezy early summer visit to New York city and up the North river especially at present of some hours along Broadway What I came to New York for To try the experiment of a lecture to see whether I could stand it and whether an audience could was my specific object Some friends had invited me it was by no means clear how it would end I stipulated that they should get only a third rate hall and not sound the advertising trumpets a bit and so I started I much wanted something to do for occupation consistent with my limping and paralyzed state And now since it came off and since neither my hearers nor I myself really collaps d at the aforesaid lecture I intend to go up and down the land in moderation seeking whom I may devour with lectures and reading of my own poems short pulls however never exceeding an hour Crossing from Jersey city five to six P M The city part of the North river with its life breadth peculiarities the amplitude of sea and wharf cargo and commerce one don t realize them till one has been away a long time and as now returning crossing from Jersey city to Desbrosses saint gazes on the unrivall d panorama and far down the thin vapor d vistas of the bay toward the Narrows or northward up the Hudson or on the ample spread and infinite variety free and floating of the more immediate views a countless river series everything moving yet so easy and such plenty of room Little I say do folks here appreciate the most ample eligible picturesque bay and estuary surroundings in the world This is the third time such a conviction has come to me after absence returning to New York dwelling on its magnificent entrances approaching the city by them from any point More and more too the old name absorbs into me MANNAHATTA the place encircled by many swift tides and sparkling waters How fit a name for America s great democratic island

Dinner Camden New Jersey May thirty one eighteen eighty nine Walt Whitman said My friends though announced to give an address there is no such intention Following the impulse of the spirit for I am at least half of Quaker stock I have obey d the command to come and look at you for a minute and show myself face to face which is probably the best I can do But I have felt no command to make a speech and shall not therefore attempt any All I have felt the imperative conviction to say I have already printed in my books of poems or prose to which I refer any who may be curious And so hail and farewell Deeply acknowledging this deep compliment with my best respects and love to you personally to Camden to New Jersey and to all represented here you must excuse me from any word further INTESTINAL AGITATION From Pall Mall Gazette London England Feb eight eighteen ninety mister Ernest Rhys has just receiv d an interesting letter from Walt Whitman dated Camden January twenty two eighteen ninety The following is an extract from it I am still here no very mark d or significant change or happening fairly buoyant spirits c but surely slowly ebbing At this moment sitting here in my den Mickle street by the oakwood fire in the same big strong old chair with wolf skin spread over back bright sun cold dry winter day America continues is generally busy enough all over her vast demesnes intestinal agitation I call it talking plodding making money every one trying to get on perhaps to get towards the top but no special individual signalism just as well I guess WALT WHITMAN S LAST PUBLIC The gay and crowded audience at the Art Rooms Philadelphia Tuesday night April fifteen eighteen ninety says a correspondent of the Boston Transcript April nineteen might not have thought that W W crawl d out of a sick bed a few hours before crying Dangers retreat when boldly they re confronted and went over hoarse and half blind to deliver his memoranda and essay on the death of Abraham Lincoln on the twenty fifth anniversary of that tragedy He led off with the following new paragraph Of Abraham Lincoln bearing testimony twenty five years after his death and of that death I am now my friends before you Few realize the days the great historic and esthetic personalities with him in the centre we pass d through Abraham Lincoln familiar our own an Illinoisian modern yet tallying ancient Moses Joshua Ulysses or later Cromwell and grander in some respects than any of them Abraham Lincoln that makes the like of Homer Plutarch Shakspere eligible our day or any day My subject this evening for forty or fifty minutes talk is the death of this man and how that death will really filter into America I am not going to tell you anything new and it is doubtless nearly altogether because I ardently wish to commemorate the hour and martyrdom and name I am here Oft as the rolling years bring back this hour let it again however briefly be dwelt upon For my own part I hope and intend till my own dying day whenever the fourteenth and fifteenth of April comes to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic reminiscence No narrow or sectional reminiscence It belongs to these States in their entirety not the North only but the South perhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South of all for there really this man s birthstock there and then his antecedent stamp Why should I not say that thence his manliest traits his universality his canny easy ways and words upon the surface his inflexible determination at heart Have you ever realized it my friends that Lincoln though grafted on the West is essentially in personnel and character a Southern contribution The most of the poet s address was devoted to the actual occurrences and details of the murder We believe the delivery on Tuesday was Whitman s thirteenth of it The old poet is now physically wreck d But his voice and magnetism are the same For the last month he has been under a severe attack of the lately prevailing influenza the grip in accumulation upon his previous ailments and above all that terrible paralysis the bequest of secession war times He was dress d last Tuesday night in an entire suit of French Canadian grey wool cloth with broad shirt collar with no necktie long white hair red face full beard and moustache and look d as though he might weigh two hundred pounds He had to be help d and led every step In five weeks more he will begin his seventy second year He is still writing a little INGERSOLL S SPEECH From the Camden Post N J June two eighteen ninety He attends and makes a speech at the celebration of Walt Whitman s birthday Walt Whitman is now in his seventy second year His younger friends literary and personal men and women gave him a complimentary supper last Saturday night to note the close of his seventy first year and the late curious and unquestionable boom of the old man s wide spreading popularity and that of his Leaves of Grass There were thirty five in the room mostly young but some old or beginning to be The great feature was Ingersoll s utterance It was probably in its way the most admirable specimen of modern oratory hitherto delivered in the English language immense as such praise may sound It was forty to fifty minutes long altogether without notes in a good voice low enough and not too low style easy rather colloquial over and over again saying you to Whitman who sat opposite sometimes markedly impassion d once or twice humorous amid his whole speech from interior fires and volition pulsating and swaying like a first class Andalusian dancer And such a critical dissection and flattering summary The Whitmanites for the first time in their lives were fully satisfied and that is saying a good deal for they have not put their claims low by a long shot Indeed it was a tremendous talk Physically and mentally Ingersoll he had been working all day in New York talking in court and in his office is now at his best like mellow d wine or a just ripe apple to the artist sense too looks at his best not merely like a bequeath d Roman bust or fine smooth marble Cicero head or even Greek Plato for he is modern and vital and vein d and American and far more than the age knows justifies us all We cannot give a full report of this most remarkable talk and supper which was curiously conversational and Greek like but must add the following significant bit of it After the speaking and just before the close mister Whitman reverted to Colonel Ingersoll s tribute to his poems pronouncing it the capsheaf of all commendation that he had ever receiv d Then his mind still dwelling upon the Colonel s religious doubts he went on to say that what he himself had in his mind when he wrote Leaves of Grass was not only to depict American life as it existed and to show the triumphs of science and the poetry in common things and the full of an individual democratic humanity for the aggregate but also to show that there was behind all something which rounded and completed it For what he ask d would this life be without immortality It would be as a locomotive the greatest triumph of modern science with no train to draw after it If the spiritual is not behind the material to what purpose is the material What is this world without a further Divine purpose in it all Colonel Ingersoll repeated his former argument in reply FEELING FAIRLY Friday July twenty seven eighteen ninety Feeling fairly these days and even jovial sleep and appetite good enough to be thankful for had a dish of

must have been in eighteen twenty two or three that I first came to live in Brooklyn Lived first in Front street not far from what was then call d the New Ferry wending the river from the foot of Catharine or Main street to New York city I was a little child was born in eighteen nineteen but tramp d freely about the neighborhood and town even then was often on the aforesaid New Ferry remember how I was petted and deadheaded by the gatekeepers and deckhands all such fellows are kind to little children and remember the horses that seem d to me so queer as they trudg d around in the central houses of the boats making the water power For it was just on the eve of the steam engine which was soon after introduced on the ferries Edward Copeland afterward Mayor had a grocery store then at the corner of Front and Catharine streets Presently we Whitmans all moved up to Tillary street near Adams where my father who was a carpenter built a house for himself and us all It was from here I assisted the personal coming of Lafayette in eighteen twenty four five to Brooklyn He came over the Old Ferry as the now Fulton Ferry partly navigated quite up to that day by horse boats though the first steamer had begun to be used hereabouts was then call d and was receiv d at the foot of Fulton street It was on that occasion that the corner stone of the Apprentices Library at the corner of Cranberry and Henry streets since pull d down was laid by Lafayette s own hands Numerous children arrived on the grounds of whom I was one and were assisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony Among others Lafayette also helping the children took me up I was five years old press d me a moment to his breast gave me a kiss and set me down in a safe spot Lafayette was at that time between sixty five and seventy years of age with a manly figure and a kind face TWO QUESTIONS An editor of or in a leading monthly magazine Harper s Monthly July eighteen ninety asks A hundred years from now will W W be popularly rated a great poet or will he be forgotten A mighty ticklish question which can only be left for a hundred years hence perhaps more than that But whether W W has been mainly rejected by his own times is an easier question to answer All along from eighteen sixty to ninety one many of the pieces in L of G and its annexes were first sent to publishers or magazine editors before being printed in the L and were peremptorily rejected by them and sent back to their author The Eidolons was sent back by doctor H of Scribner s Monthly with a lengthy very insulting and contemptuous letter To the Sun Set Breeze was rejected by the editor of Harper s Monthly as being an improvisation only On on ye jocund twain was rejected by the Century editor as being personal merely Several of the pieces went the rounds of all the monthlies to be thus summarily rejected June ninety The rejects and sends back my little poem so I am now set out in the cold by every big magazine and publisher and may as well understand and admit it which is just as well for I find I am palpably losing my sight and ratiocination PREFACE To a volume of essays and tales by Wm D O Connor pub d posthumously in eighteen ninety one A hasty memorandum not particularly for Preface to the following tales but to put on record my respect and affection for as sane beautiful cute tolerant loving candid and free and fair intention d a nature as ever vivified our race In Boston eighteen sixty I first met William Douglas O Connor forty eight As I saw and knew him then in his twenty ninth year and for twenty five further years along he was a gallant handsome gay hearted fine voiced glowing eyed man lithe moving on his feet of healthy and magnetic atmosphere and presence and the most welcome company in the world He was a thorough going anti slavery believer speaker and writer doctrinaire and though I took a fancy to him from the first I remember I fear d his ardent abolitionism was afraid it would probably keep us apart I was a decided and out spoken anti slavery believer myself then and always but shy d from the extremists the red hot fellows of those times O C was then correcting the proofs of Harrington an eloquent and fiery novel he had written and which was printed just before the commencement of the secession war He was already married the father of two fine little children and was personally and intellectually the most attractive man I had ever met Last of sixty two I found myself led towards the war field went to Washington city to become absorb d in the armies and in the big hospitals and to get work in one of the Departments and there I met and resumed friendship and found warm hospitality from O C and his noble New England wife They had just lost by death their little child boy Phillip and O C was yet feeling serious about it The youngster had been vaccinated against the threatening of small pox which alarm d the city but somehow it led to worse results than it was intended to ward off or at any rate O C thought that proved the cause of the boy s death He had one child left a fine bright little daughter and a great comfort to her parents Dear Jeannie She grew up a most accomplish d and superior young woman declined in health and died about eighteen eighty one On through for months and years to seventy three I saw and talk d with O C almost daily I had soon got employment first for a short time in the Indian Bureau in the Interior Department and then for a long while in the Attorney General s Office The secession war with its tide of varying fortunes excitements President Lincoln and the daily sight of him the doings in Congress and at the State Capitols the news from the fields and campaigns and from foreign governments my visits to the Army Hospitals daily and nightly soon absorbing everything else with a hundred matters occurrences personalties Greeley Wendell Phillips the parties the Abolitionists c were the subjects of our talk and discussion I am not sure from what I heard then but O C was cut out for a first class public speaker or forensic advocate No audience or jury could have stood out against him He had a strange charm of physiologic voice He had a power and sharp cut faculty of statement and persuasiveness beyond any man s else I know it well for I have felt it many a time If not as orator his forte was as critic newer deeper than any also as literary author One of his traits was that while he knew all and welcom d all sorts of great genre literature all lands and times from all writers and artists and not only tolerated each and defended every attack d literary person with a skill or heart catholicism that I never saw equal d invariably advocated and excused them he kept an idiosyncrasy and identity of his own very mark d and without special tinge or undue color from any source He always applauded the freedom of the masters whence and whoever I remember his special defences of Byron Burns Poe Rabelais Victor Hugo George Sand and others There was always a little touch of pensive cadence in his superb voice and I think there was something of the same sadness in his temperament and nature Perhaps too in his literary structure But he was a very buoyant jovial good natured companion So much for a hasty melanged reminiscence and note of William O Connor my dear dear friend and staunch probably my staunchest literary believer and champion from the first and throughout without halt or demur for twenty five years No better friend none more reliable through this life of one s ups and downs On the occurrence of the latter he would be sure to make his appearance on the scene eager hopeful full of fight like a perfect knight of chivalry For he was a born sample here in the nineteenth century of the flower and symbol of olden time first class knighthood Thrice blessed be his memory W W Note forty eight Born Jan twod eighteen thirty two When grown lived several years in Boston and edited journals and magazines there went about eighteen sixty one to Washington D C and became a U S clerk first in the Light House Bureau and then in the U S Life Saving

mechanic of superior order founded in the soundest personal and professional integrity He was a great favorite among the young engineers and students not a few of them yet remaining in Kings and Queens counties and New York city will remember Jeff with old time good will and affection He was mostly self taught and was a hard student He had been troubled of late years from a bad throat and from gastric affection tending on typhoid and had been rather seriously ill with the last malady but was getting over the worst of it when he succumb d under a sudden and severe attack of the heart He died at saint Louis November twenty five eighteen ninety in his fifty eighth year Of his family the wife died in eighteen seventy three and a daughter Mannahatta died two years ago Another daughter Jessie Louisa the only child left is now living in saint Louis When Jeff was born I was in my fifteenth year and had much care of him for many years afterward and he did not separate from me He was a very handsome healthy affectionate smart child and would sit on my lap or hang on my neck half an hour at a time As he grew a big boy he liked outdoor and water sports especially boating We would often go down summers to Peconic Bay east end of Long Island and over to Shelter Island I loved long rambles and he carried his fowling piece O what happy times weeks Then in Brooklyn and New York city he learn d printing and work d awhile at it but eventually with my approval he went to employment at land surveying and merged in the studies and work of topographical engineer this satisfied him and he continued at it He was of noble nature from the first very good natured very plain very friendly O how we loved each other how many jovial good times we had Once we made a long trip from New York city down over the Allegheny mountains the National Road and via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers from Cairo to New Orleans God s blessing on your name and memory dear brother Jeff W W OLD ACTORS SINGERS SHOWS C IN NEW YORK Flitting mention with much left out Seems to me I ought acknowledge my debt to actors singers public speakers conventions and the Stage in New York my youthful days from eighteen thirty five onward say to sixty or sixty one and to plays and operas generally Which nudges a pretty big disquisition of course it should be all elaborated and penetrated more deeply but I will here give only some flitting mentionings of my youth Seems to me now when I look back the Italian contralto Marietta Alboni she is living yet in Paris eighteen ninety one in good condition good voice yet considering with the then prominent histrions Booth Edwin Forrest and Fanny Kemble and the Italian singer Bettini have had the deepest and most lasting effect upon me I should like well if Madame Alboni and the old composer Verdi and Bettini the tenor if he is living could know how much noble pleasure and happiness they gave me and how deeply I always remember them and thank them to this day For theatricals in literature and doubtless upon me personally including opera have been of course serious factors The experts and musicians of my present friends claim that the new Wagner and his pieces belong far more truly to me and I to them likely But I was fed and bred under the Italian dispensation and absorb d it and doubtless show it As a young fellow when possible I always studied a play or libretto quite carefully over by myself sometimes twice through before seeing it on the stage read it the day or two days before Tried both ways not reading some beforehand but I found I gain d most by getting that sort of mastery first if the piece had depth Surface effects and glitter were much less thought of I am sure those times There were many fine old plays neither tragedies nor comedies the names of them quite unknown to to day s current audiences All is not Gold that Glitters in which Charlotte Cushman had a superbly enacted part was of that kind C C who revel d in them was great in such pieces I think better than in the heavy popular roles We had some fine music those days We had the English opera of Cinderella with Henry Placide as the pompous old father an unsurpassable bit of comedy and music We had Bombastes Furioso Must have been in eighteen forty four or five I saw Charles Kean and missus Kean Ellen Tree saw them in the Park in Shakspere s King John He of course was the chief character She play d Queen Constance Tom Hamblin was Faulconbridge and probably the best ever on the stage It was an immense show piece too lots of grand set scenes and fine armor suits and all kinds of appointments imported from London where it had been first render d The large brass bands the three or four hundred supes the interviews between the French and English armies the talk with Hubert and the hot irons the delicious acting of Prince Arthur missus Richardson I think and all the fine blare and court pomp I remember to this hour The death scene of the King in the orchard of Swinstead Abbey was very effective Kean rush d in gray pale and yellow and threw himself on a lounge in the open His pangs were horribly realistic He must have taken lessons in some hospital Fanny Kemble play d to wonderful effect in such pieces as Fazio or the Italian wife The turning point was jealousy It was a rapid running yet heavy timber d tremendous wrenching passionate play Such old pieces always seem d to me built like an ancient ship of the line solid and lock d from keel up oak and metal and knots One of the finest characters was a great court lady Aldabella enacted by missus Sharpe O how it all entranced us and knock d us about as the scenes swept on like a cyclone Saw Hackett at the old Park many times and remember him well His renderings were first rate in everything He inaugurated the true Rip Van Winkle and look d and acted and dialogued it to perfection he was of Dutch breed and brought up among old Holland descendants in Kings and Queens counties Long Island The play and the acting of it have been adjusted to please popular audiences since but there was in that original performance certainly something of a far higher order more art more reality more resemblance a bit of fine pathos a lofty brogue beyond anything afterward One of my big treats was the rendering at the old Park of Shakspere s Tempest in musical version There was a very fine instrumental band not numerous but with a capital leader missus Austin was the Ariel and Peter Richings the Caliban both excellent The drunken song of the latter has probably been never equal d The perfect actor Clarke old Clarke was Prospero Yes there were in New York and Brooklyn some fine non technical singing performances concerts such as the Hutchinson band three brothers and the sister the red cheek d New England carnation sweet Abby sometimes plaintive and balladic sometimes anti slavery anti calomel and comic There were concerts by Templeton Russell Dempster the old Alleghanian band and many others Then we had lots of negro minstrels with capital character songs and voices I often saw Rice the original Jim Crow at the old Park Theatre filling up the gap in some short bill and the wild chants and dances were admirable probably ahead of anything since Every theatre had some superior voice and it was common to give a favorite song between the acts The Sea at the bijou Olympic Broadway near Grand was always welcome from a little Englishman named Edwin a good balladist At the Bowery the loves of Sweet William When on the Downs the fleet was moor d always bro t an encore and sometimes a treble I remember Jenny Lind and heard her eighteen fifty I think several times She had the most brilliant captivating popular musical style and expression of any one known the canary and several other sweet birds are wondrous fine but there is something in song that goes deeper isn t there The great Egyptian Collection was well up in Broadway and I got quite acquainted with doctor Abbott the proprietor paid many visits there and had long talks with him in connection with my readings of many books and reports on Egypt its antiquities history and how things and the scenes really look and what the old relics stand for as near as we can now get doctor A was an Englishman of say fifty four had been settled in Cairo as physician for twenty five years and all that time was collecting these relics and sparing no time or money seeking and getting them By advice and for a change of base for himself he brought the collection to America But the whole enterprise was a fearful disappointment in the pay and commercial part As said I went to the Egyptian Museum many many times sometimes had it all to myself delved at the formidable catalogue and on several occasions had the invaluable personal talk correction illustration and guidance of doctor A himself He was very kind and helpful to me in those studies and examinations once by appointment he appear d in full and exact Turkish Cairo costume which long usage there had made habitual to him One of the choice places of New York to me then was the Phrenological Cabinet of Fowler Wells Nassau street near Beekman Here were all the busts examples curios and books of that study obtainable I went there often and once for myself had a very elaborate and leisurely examination and chart of bumps written out I have it yet by Nelson Fowler or was it Sizer there And who remembers the renown d New York Tabernacle of those days before the war It was on the east side of Broadway near Pearl street was a great turtle shaped hall and you had to walk back from the street entrance thro a long wide corridor to get to it was very strong had an immense gallery altogether held three or four thousand people Here the huge annual conventions of the windy and cyclonic reformatory societies of those times were held especially the tumultuous Anti Slavery ones I remember hearing Wendell Phillips Emerson Cassius Clay John P Hale Beecher Fred Douglas the Burleighs Garrison and others Sometimes the Hutchinsons would sing very fine Sometimes there were angry rows A chap named Isaiah Rhynders a fierce politician of those days with a band of robust supporters would attempt to contradict the speakers and break up the meetings But the Anti Slavery and Quaker and Temperance and Missionary and other conventicles and speakers were tough tough and always maintained their ground and carried out their programs fully I went frequently to these meetings May after May learn d much from them was sure to be on hand when J P Hale or Cash Clay made speeches There were also the smaller and handsome halls of the Historical and Athensum Societies up on Broadway I very well remember W C Bryant lecturing on Homoeopathy in one of them and attending two or three addresses by R W Emerson in the other There was a series of plays and dramatic genre characters by a gentleman bill d as Ranger very fine better than merely technical full of exquisite shades like the light touches of the violin in the hands of a master There was the actor Anderson who brought us Gerald Griffin s Gysippus and play d it to admiration Among the actors of those times I recall Cooper Wallack Tom Hamblin Adams several Old Gates Scott Wm Sefton John Sefton Geo Jones Mitchell Seguin Old Clarke Richings Fisher H Placide T Placide Thorne Ingersoll Gale Mazeppa Edwin Horncastle Some of the women hastily remember d were missus Vernon missus Pritchard missus McClure Mary Taylor Clara Fisher missus Richardson missus Flynn Then the singers English Italian and other missus Wood missus Seguin missus Austin Grisi La Grange Steffanone Bosio Truffi Parodi Vestvali Bertucca Jenny Lind Gazzaniga Laborde And the opera men Bettini Badiali Marini Mario Brignoli Amodio Beneventano and many many others whose names I do not at this moment recall In another paper I have described the elder Booth and the Bowery Theatre of those times Afterward there was the Chatham The elder Thorne missus Thorne William and John Sefton Kirby Brougham and sometimes Edwin Forrest himself play d there I remember them all and many more and especially the fine theatre on Broadway near Pearl in eighteen fifty five and six There were very good circus performances or horsemanship in New York and Brooklyn Every winter in the first named city a regular place in the Bowery nearly opposite the old theatre fine animals and fine riding which I often witness d Remember seeing near here a young fierce splendid lion presented by an African Barbary Sultan to President Andrew Jackson The gift comprised also a lot of jewels a fine steel sword and an Arab stallion and the lion was made over to a show man If it is worth while I might add that there was a small but well appointed amateur theatre up Broadway with the usual stage orchestra pit boxes c and that I was myself a member for some time and acted parts in it several times second parts as they were call d Perhaps it too was a lesson or help d that way at any rate it was full of fun and enjoyment And so let us turn off the gas Out in the brilliancy of the foot lights filling the attention of perhaps a crowded audience and making many a breath and pulse swell and rise O so much passion and imparted life over and over again the season through walking gesticulating singing reciting his or her part But then sooner or later inevitably wending to the flies or exit door vanishing to sight and ear and never materializing on this earth s stage again SOME PERSONAL AND OLD AGE JOTTINGS Anything like unmitigated acceptance of my Leaves of Grass book and heart felt response to it in a popular however faint degree bubbled forth as a fresh spring from the ground in England in eighteen seventy six The time was a critical and turning point in my personal and literary life Let me revert to my memorandum book Camden New Jersey that year fill d with addresses receipts purchases c of the two volumes pub d then by myself the Leaves and the Two Rivulets some home customers for them but mostly from the British Islands I was seriously paralyzed from the Secession war poor in debt was expecting death the doctors put four chances out of five against me and I had the books printed during the lingering interim to occupy the tediousness of glum days and nights Curiously the sale abroad proved prompt and what one might call copious the names came in lists and the money with them by foreign mail The price was ten dollars a set Both the cash and the emotional cheer were deep medicines many paid double or treble price Tennyson and Ruskin did and many sent kind and eulogistic letters ladies clergymen social leaders persons of rank and high officials Those blessed gales from the British Islands probably certainly saved me Here are some of the names for I w d like to preserve them Wm M and D G Rossetti Lord Houghton Edwd Dowden missus Anne Gilchrist Keningale Cook Edwd

but the tide had palpably shifted at any rate and the sluices were turn d into my own veins and pockets That emotional audacious open handed friendly mouth d just opportune English action I say pluck d me like a brand from the burning and gave me life again to finish my book since ab t completed I do not forget it and shall not and if I ever have a biographer I charge him to put it in the narrative I have had the noblest friends and backers in America Wm O Connor doctor R M Bucke John Burroughs Geo W Childs good ones in Boston and Carnegie and R G Ingersoll in New York and yet perhaps the tenderest and gratefulest breath of my heart has gone and ever goes over the sea gales across the big pond About myself at present I will soon enter upon my seventy threed year if I live have pass d an active life as country school teacher gardener printer carpenter author and journalist domicil d in nearly all the United States and principal cities North and South went to the front moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary during the secession war eighteen sixty one to sixty five and in the Virginia hospitals and after the battles of that time tending the Northern and Southern wounded alike work d down South and in Washington city arduously three years contracted the paralysis which I have suffer d ever since and now live in a little cottage of my own near the Delaware in New Jersey My chief book unrhym d and unmetrical it has taken thirty years peace and war a borning has its aim as once said to utter the same old human critter but now in Democratic American modern and scientific conditions Then I have publish d two prose works Specimen Days and a late one November Boughs A little volume Good Bye my Fancy is soon to be out wh will finish the matter I do not propose here to enter the much fought field of the literary criticism of any of those works But for a few portraiture or descriptive bits To day in the upper story of a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river east shore sixty miles up from the sea is a rather large twenty by twenty low ceiling d room something like a big old ship s cabin The floor three quarters of it with an ingrain carpet is half cover d by a deep litter of books papers magazines thrown down letters and circulars rejected manuscripts memoranda bits of light or strong twine a bundle to be express d and two or three venerable scrap books In the room stand two large tables one of ancient saint Domingo mahogany with immense leaves cover d by a jumble of more papers a varied and copious array of writing materials several glass and china vessels or jars some with cologne water others with real honey granulated sugar a large bunch of beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums some letters and envelopt papers ready for the post office many photographs and a hundred indescribable things besides There are all around many books some quite handsome editions some half cover d by dust some within reach evidently used good sized print no type less than long primer some maps the Bible the strong cheap edition of the English crown Homer Shakspere Walter Scott Emerson Ticknor s Spanish Literature John Carlyle s Dante Felton s Greece George Sand s Consuelo avery choice little Epictetus some novels the latest foreign and American monthlies quarterlies and so on There being quite a strew of printer s proofs and slips and the daily papers the place with its quaint old fashion d calmness has also a smack of something alert and of current work There are several trunks and depositaries back d up at the walls one well bound and big box came by express lately from Washington city after storage there for nearly twenty years Indeed the whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past life I have here various editions of my own writings and sell them upon request one is a big volume of complete poems and prose one thousand pages autograph essays speeches portraits from life c Another is a little Leaves of Grass latest date six portraits morocco bound in pocket book form Fortunately the apartment is quite roomy There are three windows in front At one side is the stove with a cheerful fire of oak wood near by a good supply of fresh sticks whose faint aroma is plain On another side is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets Toward the windows is a huge arm chair a Christmas present from Thomas Donaldson s young daughter and son Philadelphia timber d as by some stout ship s spars yellow polish d ample with rattan woven seat and back and over the latter a great wide wolf skin of hairy black and silver spread to guard against cold and draught A time worn look and scent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it But probably even at the charge of parrot talk I can give no more authentic brief sketch than from an old remembrance copy where I have lately put myself on record as follows Was born May thirty one eighteen nineteen in my father s farm house at West Hills L I New York State My parents folks mostly farmers and sailors on my father s side of English on my mother s Van Velsor s from Hollandic immigration There was first and last a large family of children I was the second We moved to Brooklyn while I was still a little one in frocks and there in B I grew up out of frocks then as child and boy went to the public schools then to work in a printing office When only sixteen or seventeen years old and for three years afterward I went to teaching country schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties Long Island and boarded round Then returning to New York work d as printer and writer with an occasional shy at poetry eighteen forty eight nine About this time after ten or twelve years of experiences and work and lots of fun in New York and Brooklyn went off on a leisurely journey and working expedition my brother Jeff with me through all the Middle States and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers Lived a while in New Orleans and work d there Have lived quite a good deal in the Southern States After a time plodded back northward up the Mississippi the Missouri c and around to and by way of the great lakes Michigan Huron and Erie to Niagara Falls and Lower Canada finally returning through Central New York and down the Hudson eighteen fifty two fifty four Occupied in house building in Brooklyn For a little while of the first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper eighteen fifty five Lost my dear father this year by death Commenced putting Leaves of Grass to press for good after many MSS doings and undoings I had great trouble in leaving out the stock poetical touches but succeeded at last The book has since had some eight hitches or stages of growth with one annex and another to come out in eighteen ninety one which will complete it eighteen sixty two In December of this year went down to the field of war in Virginia My brother George reported badly wounded in the Fredericksburg fight For eighteen sixty three and sixty four see Specimen Days eighteen sixty five to seventy one Had a place as clerk till well on in seventy three in the Attorney General s Office Washington New York and Brooklyn seem more like home as I was born near and brought up in them and lived man and boy for thirty years But I lived some years in Washington and have visited and partially lived in most of the Western and Eastern cities eighteen seventy three This year lost by death my dear dear mother and just before my sister Martha the two best and sweetest women I have ever seen or known or ever expect to see Same year February a sudden climax and prostration from paralysis Had been simmering inside for several years broke out during those times temporarily and then went over But now a serious attack beyond cure doctor Drinkard my Washington physician and a first rate one said it was the result of too extreme bodily and emotional strain continued at Washington and down in front in eighteen sixty three four and five I doubt if a heartier stronger healthier physique more balanced upon itself or more unconscious more sound ever lived from eighteen thirty five to seventy two My greatest call Quaker to go around and do what I could there in those war scenes where I had fallen among the sick and wounded was that I seem d to be so strong and well I consider d myself invulnerable But this last attack shatter d me completely Quit work at Washington and moved to Camden New Jersey where I have lived since receiving many buffets and some precious caresses and now write these lines Since then eighteen seventy four ninety one a long stretch of illness or half illness with occasional lulls During these latter have revised and printed over all my books bro t out November Boughs and at intervals leisurely and exploringly travel d to the Prairie States the Rocky Mountains Canada to New York to my birthplace in Long Island and to Boston But physical disability and the war paralysis above alluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so Am now eighteen ninety one domicil d and have been for some years in this little old cottage and lot in Mickle street Camden with a house keeper and man nurse Bodily I am completely disabled but still write for publication I keep generally buoyant spirits write often as there comes any lull in physical sufferings get in the sun and down to the river whenever I can retain fair appetite assimilation and digestion sensibilities acute as ever the strength and volition of my right arm good eyesight dimming but brain normal and retain my heart s and soul s unmitigated faith not only in their own original literary plans but in the essential bulk of American humanity east and west north and south city and country through thick and thin to the last Nor must I forget in conclusion a special prayerful thankful God s blessing to my dear firm friends and personal helpers men and women home and foreign old and young OUT IN THE OPEN AGAIN From the Camden Post April sixteen ninety one Walt Whitman got out in the mid April sun and warmth of yesterday propelled in his wheel chair the first time after four months of imprisonment in his sick room He has had the worst winter yet mainly from grippe and gastric troubles and threaten d blindness but keeps good spirits and has a new little forthcoming book in the printer s hands AMERICA S BULK AVERAGE If I were ask d persona to specify the one point of America s people on which I mainly rely I should say the final average or bulk quality of the whole Happy indeed w d I consider myself to give a fair reflection and representation of even a portion of shows questions humanity events unfoldings thoughts c c my age in these States The great social political historic function of my time has been of course the attempted secession war And was there not something grand and an inside proof of perennial grandeur in that war We talk of our age s and the States materialism and it is too true But how amid the whole sordidness the entire devotion of America at any price to pecuniary success merchandise disregarding all but business and profit this war for a bare idea and abstraction a mere at bottom heroic dream and reminiscence burst forth in its great devouring flame and conflagration quickly and fiercely spreading and raging and enveloping all defining in two conflicting ideas first the Union cause second the other a strange deadly interrogation point hard to define Can we not now safely confess it with magnificent rays streaks of noblest heroism fortitude perseverance and even conscientiousness through its pervadingly malignant darkness What an area and rounded field upon the whole the spirit arrogance grim tenacity of the South the long stretches of murky gloom the general National Will below and behind and comprehending all not once really wavering not a day not an hour What could be or even can be grander As in that war its four years as through the whole history and development of the New World these States through all trials processes eruptions deepest dilemmas often straining tugging at society s heart strings as if some divine curiosity would find out how much this democracy could stand have so far finally and for more than a century best justified themselves by the average impalpable quality and personality of the bulk the People en masse I am not sure but my main and chief however indefinite claim for any page of mine w d be its derivation or seeking to derive itself f m that average quality of the American bulk the people and getting back to it again LAST SAVED ITEMS I m a vast batch left to oblivion In its highest aspect and striking its grandest average essential Poetry expresses and goes along with essential Religion has been and is more the adjunct and more serviceable to that true religion for of course there is a false one and plenty of it than all the priests and creeds and churches that now exist or have ever existed even while the temporary prevalent theory and practice of poetry is merely one side and ornamental and dainty a love sigh a bit of jewelry a feudal conceit an ingenious tale or intellectual finesse adjusted to the low taste and calibre that will always sufficiently generally prevail ranges of stairs necessary to ascend the higher The sectarian church and doctrinal follies crimes fanaticisms aggregate and individual so rife all thro history are proofs of the radicalness and universality of the indestructible element of humanity s Religion just as much as any and are the other side of it Just as disease proves health and is the other side of it The philosophy of Greece taught normality and the beauty of life Christianity teaches how to endure illness and death I have wonder d whether a third philosophy fusing both and doing full justice to both might not be outlined It will not be enough to say that no Nation ever achiev d materialistic political and money making successes with general physical comfort as fully as the United States of America are to day achieving them I know very well that those are the indispensable foundations the sine qua non of moral and heroic poetic fruitions to come For if those pre successes were all if they ended at that if nothing more were yielded than so far appears a gross materialistic prosperity only America tried by subtlest tests were a failure has not advanced the standard of humanity a bit further than other nations Or in plain terms has but inherited and enjoy d the results of ordinary claims and preceding ages Nature seem d to use me a long while myself all well able strong and happy to portray power freedom health But after a while she seems to fancy may be I can see and understand it all better by being deprived of most of those How difficult it is to add anything more to literature and how unsatisfactory for any earnest spirit to serve merely the amusement of the multitude It even seems to me said H Heine more invigorating to accomplish something bad than something empty The Highest said Don t let us begin so low isn t our range too coarse too gross The Soul answer d No not when we consider what it is all for the end involved in Time and Space Essentially my own printed records all my volumes are doubtless but off hand utterances f m Personality spontaneous following implicitly the inscrutable command dominated by that Personality vaguely even if decidedly and with little or nothing of plan art erudition c If I have chosen to hold the reins the mastery it has mainly been to give the way the power the road to the invisible steeds I wanted to see how a Person of America the last half of the nineteenth century w d appear but quite freely and fairly in honest type Haven t I given specimen clues if no more At any rate I have written enough to weary myself and I will dispatch it to the printers and cease But how much how many topics of the greatest pointand cogency I am leaving untouch d WALT WHITMAN S LAST forty nine Good Bye my Fancy concluding Annex to Leaves of Grass The Highest said Don t let us begin so low isn t our range too coarse too gross The Soul answer d No not when we consider what it is all for the end involved in Time and Space An item from last page of Good Bye H Heine s first principle of criticising a book was What motive is the author trying to carry out or express or accomplish and the second Has he achiev d it The theory of my Leaves of Grass as a composition of verses has been from first to last if I am to give impromptu a hint of the spinal marrow of the business and sign it with my name to thoroughly possess the mind memory cognizance of the author himself with everything beforehand a full armory of concrete actualities observations humanity past poems ballads facts technique war and peace politics North and South East and West nothing too large or too small the sciences as far as possible and above all America and the present after and out of which the subject of the poem long or short has been invariably turned over to his Emotionality even Personality to be shaped thence and emerges strictly therefrom with all its merits and demerits on its head Every page of my poetic or attempt at poetic utterance therefore smacks of the living physical identity date environment individuality probably beyond anything known and in style often offensive to the conventions This new last cluster Good By my Fancy follows suit and yet with a difference The clef is here changed to its lowest and the little book is a lot of tremolos about old age death and faith The physical just lingers but almost vanishes The book is garrulous irascible like old Lear and has various breaks and even tricks to avoid monotony It will have to be ciphered and ciphered out long and is probably in some respects the most curious part of its author s baffling works Walt Whitman Note forty nine Published in Lippincott s Magazine August eighteen ninety one with the following note added by the editor of the magazine With Good Bye my Fancy Walt Whitman has rounded out his life work This book is his last message and of course a great deal will be said about it by critics all over the world both in praise and dispraise but probably nothing that the critics will say will be as interesting as this characteristic utterance upon the book by the poet himself It is the subjective view as opposed to the objective views of the critics Briefly Whitman gives as he puts it a hint of the spinal marrow of the business not only of Good Bye my Fancy but also of the Leaves of Grass It was only after considerable persuasion on the editor s part that mister Whitman consented to write the above As a concise explanation of the poet s life work it must have great value to his readers and admirers After the critics have ciphered and ciphered out long they will probably have nothing better to say End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Complete Prose Works by Walt Whitman END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK COMPLETE PROSE WORKS This file should be named eight thousand eight hundred
