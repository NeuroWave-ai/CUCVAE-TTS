LOVED Produced by Suzanne Shell Harry Jones and PG Distributed Proofreaders THE MAN WHOM THE TREES LOVED ALGERNON BLACKWOOD nineteen twelve I He painted trees as by some special divining instinct of their essential qualities He understood them He knew why in an oak forest for instance each individual was utterly distinct from its fellows and why no two beeches in the whole world were alike People asked him down to paint a favorite lime or silver birch for he caught the individuality of a tree as some catch the individuality of a horse How he managed it was something of a puzzle for he never had painting lessons his drawing was often wildly inaccurate and while his perception of a Tree Personality was true and vivid his rendering of it might almost approach the ludicrous Yet the character and personality of that particular tree stood there alive beneath his brush shining frowning dreaming as the case might be friendly or hostile good or evil It emerged There was nothing else in the wide world that he could paint flowers and landscapes he only muddled away into a smudge with people he was helpless and hopeless also with animals Skies he could sometimes manage or effects of wind in foliage but as a rule he left these all severely alone He kept to trees wisely following an instinct that was guided by love It was quite arresting this way he had of making a tree look almost like a being alive It approached the uncanny Yes Sanderson knows what he s doing when he paints a tree thought old David Bittacy C B late of the Woods and Forests Why you can almost hear it rustle You can smell the thing You can hear the rain drip through its leaves You can almost see the branches move It grows For in this way somewhat he expressed his satisfaction half to persuade himself that the twenty guineas were well spent since his wife thought otherwise and half to explain this uncanny reality of life that lay in the fine old cedar framed above his study table Yet in the general view the mind of mister Bittacy was held to be austere not to say morose Few divined in him the secretly tenacious love of nature that had been fostered by years spent in the forests and jungles of the eastern world It was odd for an Englishman due possibly to that Eurasian ancestor Surreptitiously as though half ashamed of it he had kept alive a sense of beauty that hardly belonged to his type and was unusual for its vitality Trees in particular nourished it He also understood trees felt a subtle sense of communion with them born perhaps of those years he had lived in caring for them guarding protecting nursing years of solitude among their great shadowy presences He kept it largely to himself of course because he knew the world he lived in HE also kept it from his wife to some extent He knew it came between them knew that she feared it was opposed But what he did not know or realize at any rate was the extent to which she grasped the power which they wielded over his life Her fear he judged was simply due to those years in India when for weeks at a time his calling took him away from her into the jungle forests while she remained at home dreading all manner of evils that might befall him This of course explained her instinctive opposition to the passion for woods that still influenced and clung to him It was a natural survival of those anxious days of waiting in solitude for his safe return For missus Bittacy daughter of an evangelical clergy man was a self sacrificing woman who in most things found a happy duty in sharing her husband s joys and sorrows to the point of self obliteration Only in this matter of the trees she was less successful than in others It remained a problem difficult of compromise He knew for instance that what she objected to in this portrait of the cedar on their lawn was really not the price he had given for it but the unpleasant way in which the transaction emphasized this breach between their common interests the only one they had but deep Sanderson the artist earned little enough money by his strange talent such checks were few and far between The owners of fine or interesting trees who cared to have them painted singly were rare indeed and the studies that he made for his own delight he also kept for his own delight Even were there buyers he would not sell them Only a few and these peculiarly intimate friends might even see them for he disliked to hear the undiscerning criticisms of those who did not understand Not that he minded laughter at his craftsmanship he admitted it with scorn but that remarks about the personality of the tree itself could easily wound or anger him He resented slighting observations concerning them as though insults offered to personal friends who could not answer for themselves He was instantly up in arms It really is extraordinary said a Woman who Understood that you can make that cypress seem an individual when in reality all cypresses are so exactly alike And though the bit of calculated flattery had come so near to saying the right true thing Sanderson flushed as though she had slighted a friend beneath his very nose Abruptly he passed in front of her and turned the picture to the wall Almost as queer he answered rudely copying her silly emphasis as that you should have imagined individuality in your husband Madame when in reality all men are so exactly alike Since the only thing that differentiated her husband from the mob was the money for which she had married him Sanderson s relations with that particular family terminated on the spot chance of prospective orders with it His sensitiveness perhaps was morbid At any rate the way to reach his heart lay through his trees He might be said to love trees He certainly drew a splendid inspiration from them and the source of a man s inspiration be it music religion or a woman is never a safe thing to criticize I do think perhaps it was just a little extravagant dear said missus Bittacy referring to the cedar check when we want a lawnmower so badly too But as it gives you such pleasure It reminds me of a certain day Sophia replied the old gentleman looking first proudly at herself then fondly at the picture now long gone by It reminds me of another tree that Kentish lawn in the spring birds singing in the lilacs and some one in a muslin frock waiting patiently beneath a certain cedar not the one in the picture I know but I was not waiting she said indignantly I was picking fir cones for the schoolroom fire Fir cones my dear do not grow on cedars and schoolroom fires were not made in June in my young days And anyhow it isn t the same cedar It has made me fond of all cedars for its sake he answered and it reminds me that you are the same young girl still She crossed the room to his side and together they looked out of the window where upon the lawn of their Hampshire cottage a ragged Lebanon stood in a solitary state You re as full of dreams as ever she said gently and I don t regret the check a bit really Only it would have been more real if it had been the original tree wouldn t it That was blown down years ago I passed the place last year and there s not a sign of it left he replied tenderly And presently when he released her from his side she went up to the wall and carefully dusted the picture Sanderson had made of the cedar on their present lawn She went all round the frame with her tiny handkerchief standing on tiptoe to reach the top rim What I like about it said the old fellow to himself when his wife had left the room is the way he has made it live All trees have it of course but a cedar taught it to me first the something trees possess that make them know I m there when I stand close and watch I suppose I felt it then because I was in love and love reveals life everywhere He glanced a moment at the Lebanon looming gaunt and somber through the gathering dusk A curious wistful expression danced a moment through his eyes Yes Sanderson has seen it as it is he murmured solemnly dreaming there its dim hidden life against the Forest edge and as different from that other tree in Kent as I am from from the vicar say It s quite a stranger too I don t know anything about it really That other cedar I loved this old fellow I respect Friendly though yes on the whole quite friendly He s painted the friendliness right enough He saw that I d like to know that man better he added I d like to ask him how he saw so clearly that it stands there between this cottage and the Forest yet somehow more in sympathy with us than with the mass of woods behind a sort of go between That I never noticed before I see it now through his eyes It stands there like a sentinel protective rather He turned away abruptly to look through the window He saw the great encircling mass of gloom that was the Forest fringing their little lawn It pressed up closer in the darkness The prim garden with its formal beds of flowers seemed an impertinence almost some little colored insect that sought to settle on a sleeping monster some gaudy fly that danced impudently down the edge of a great river that could engulf it with a toss of its smallest wave That Forest with its thousand years of growth and its deep spreading being was some such slumbering monster yes Their cottage and garden stood too near its running lip When the winds were strong and lifted its shadowy skirts of black and purple He loved this feeling of the Forest Personality he had always loved it Queer he reflected awfully queer that trees should bring me such a sense of dim vast living I used to feel it particularly I remember in India in Canadian woods as well but never in little English woods till here And Sanderson s the only man I ever knew who felt it too He s never said so but there s the proof and he turned again to the picture that he loved A thrill of unaccustomed life ran through him as he looked I wonder by Jove I wonder his thoughts ran on whether a tree er in any lawful meaning of the term can be alive I remember some writing fellow telling me long ago that trees had once been moving things animal organisms of some sort that had stood so long feeding sleeping dreaming or something in the same place that they had lost the power to get away Fancies flew pell mell about his mind and lighting a cheroot he dropped into an armchair beside the open window and let them play Outside the blackbirds whistled in the shrubberies across the lawn He smelt the earth and trees and flowers the perfume of mown grass and the bits of open heath land far away in the heart of the woods The summer wind stirred very faintly through the leaves But the great New Forest hardly raised her sweeping skirts of black and purple shadow mister Bittacy however knew intimately every detail of that wilderness of trees within He knew all the purple coombs splashed with yellow waves of gorse sweet with juniper and myrtle and gleaming with clear and dark eyed pools that watched the sky There hawks hovered circling hour by hour and the flicker of the peewit s flight with its melancholy petulant cry deepened the sense of stillness He knew the solitary pines dwarfed tufted vigorous that sang to every lost wind travelers like the gypsies who pitched their bush like tents beneath them he knew the shaggy ponies with foals like baby centaurs the chattering jays the milky call of the cuckoos in the spring and the boom of the bittern from the lonely marshes The undergrowth of watching hollies he knew too strange and mysterious with their dark suggestive beauty and the yellow shimmer of their pale dropped leaves Here all the Forest lived and breathed in safety secure from mutilation No terror of the axe could haunt the peace of its vast subconscious life no terror of devastating Man afflict it with the dread of premature death It knew itself supreme it spread and preened itself without concealment It set no spires to carry warnings for no wind brought messages of alarm as it bulged outwards to the sun and stars But once its leafy portals left behind the trees of the countryside were otherwise The houses threatened them they knew themselves in danger The roads were no longer glades of silent turf but noisy cruel ways by which men came to attack them They were civilized cared for but cared for in order that some day they might be put to death Even in the villages where the solemn and immemorial repose of giant chestnuts aped security the tossing of a silver birch against their mass impatient in the littlest wind brought warning Dust clogged their leaves The inner humming of their quiet life became inaudible beneath the scream and shriek of clattering traffic They longed and prayed to enter the great Peace of the Forest yonder but they could not move They knew moreover that the Forest with its august deep splendor despised and pitied them They were a thing of artificial gardens and belonged to beds of flowers all forced to grow one way I d like to know that artist fellow better was the thought upon which he returned at length to the things of practical life I wonder if Sophia would mind him for a bit He rose with the sound of the gong brushing the ashes from his speckled waistcoat He pulled the waistcoat down He was slim and spare in figure active in his movements In the dim light but for that silvery moustache he might easily have passed for a man of forty I ll suggest it to her anyhow he decided on his way upstairs to dress His thought really was that Sanderson could probably explain his world of things he had always felt about trees A man who could paint the soul of a cedar in that way must know it all Why not she gave her verdict later over the bread and butter pudding unless you think he d find it dull without companions He would paint all day in the Forest dear I d like to pick his brains a bit too if I could manage it You can manage anything David was what she answered for this elderly childless couple used an affectionate politeness long since deemed old fashioned The remark however displeased her making her feel uneasy and she did not notice his rejoinder smiling his pleasure and content Except yourself and our bank account my dear This passion of his for trees was of old a bone of contention though very mild contention It frightened her That was the truth The Bible her Baedeker for earth and heaven did not mention it Her husband while humoring her could never alter that instinctive dread she had He soothed but never changed her She liked the woods perhaps as spots for shade and picnics but she could not as he did love them And after dinner with a lamp beside the open window he read aloud from The Times the evening post had brought such fragments as he thought might interest her The custom was invariable except on Sundays when to please his wife he dozed over Tennyson or Farrar as their mood might be She knitted while he read asked gentle questions told him his voice was a lovely reading voice and enjoyed the little discussions that occasions prompted because he always let her with them with Ah Sophia I had never thought of it quite in that way before but now you mention it I must say I think there s something in it For David Bittacy was wise It was long after marriage during his months of loneliness spent with trees and forests in India his wife waiting at home in the Bungalow that his other deeper side had developed the strange passion that she could not understand And after one or two serious attempts to let her share it with him he had given up and learned to hide it from her He learned that is to speak of it only casually for since she knew it was there to keep silence altogether would only increase her pain So from time to time he skimmed the surface just to let her show him where he was wrong and think she won the day It remained a debatable land of compromise He listened with patience to her criticisms her excursions and alarms knowing that while it gave her satisfaction it could not change himself The thing lay in him too deep and true for change But for peace sake some meeting place was desirable and he found it thus It was her one fault in his eyes this religious mania carried over from her upbringing and it did no serious harm Great emotion could shake it sometimes out of her She clung to it because her father taught it her and not because she had thought it out for herself Indeed like many women she never really thought at all but merely reflected the images of others thinking which she had learned to see So wise in his knowledge of human nature old David Bittacy accepted the pain of being obliged to keep a portion of his inner life shut off from the woman he deeply loved He regarded her little biblical phrases as oddities that still clung to a rather fine big soul like horns and little useless things some animals have not yet lost in the course of evolution while they have outgrown their use My dear what is it You frightened me She asked it suddenly sitting up so abruptly that her cap dropped sideways almost to her ear For David Bittacy behind his crackling paper had uttered a sharp exclamation of surprise He had lowered the sheet and was staring at her over the tops of his gold glasses Listen to this if you please he said a note of eagerness in his voice listen to this my dear Sophia It s from an address by Francis Darwin before the Royal Society He is president you know and son of the great Darwin Listen carefully I beg you It is most significant I am listening David she said with some astonishment looking up She stopped her knitting For a second she glanced behind her Something had suddenly changed in the room and it made her feel wide awake though before she had been almost dozing Her husband s voice and manner had introduced this new thing Her instincts rose in warning Do read it dear He took a deep breath looking first again over the rims of his glasses to make quite sure of her attention He had evidently come across something of genuine interest although herself she often found the passages from these Addresses somewhat heavy In a deep emphatic voice he read aloud It is impossible to know whether or not plants are conscious but it is consistent with the doctrine of continuity that in all living things there is something psychic and if we accept this point of view If she interrupted scenting danger He ignored the interruption as a thing of slight value he was accustomed to If we accept this point of view he continued we must believe that in plants there exists a faint copy of what we know as consciousness in ourselves He laid the paper down and steadily stared at her Their eyes met He had italicized the last phrase For a minute or two his wife made no reply or comment They stared at one another in silence He waited for the meaning of the words to reach her understanding with full import Then he turned and read them again in part while she released from that curious driving look in his eyes instinctively again glanced over her shoulder round the room It was almost as if she felt some one had come in to them unnoticed We must believe that in plants there exists a faint copy of what we know as consciousness in ourselves If she repeated lamely feeling before the stare of those questioning eyes she must say something but not yet having gathered her wits together quite Consciousness he rejoined And then he added gravely That my dear is the statement of a scientific man of the Twentieth Century missus Bittacy sat forward in her chair so that her silk flounces crackled louder than the newspaper She made a characteristic little sound between sniffling and snorting She put her shoes closely together with her hands upon her knees David she said quietly I think these scientific men are simply losing their heads There is nothing in the Bible that I can remember about any such thing whatsoever Nothing Sophia that I can remember either he answered patiently Then after a pause he added half to himself perhaps more than to her And now that I come to think about it it seems that Sanderson once said something to me that was similar Then mister Sanderson is a wise and thoughtful man and a safe man she quickly took up if he said that For she thought her husband referred to her remark about the Bible and not to her judgment of the scientific men And he did not correct her mistake And plants you see dear are not the same as trees she drove her advantage home not quite that is I agree said David quietly but both belong to the great vegetable kingdom There was a moment s pause before she answered Pah the vegetable kingdom indeed She tossed her pretty old head And into the words she put a degree of contempt that could the vegetable kingdom have heard it might have made it feel ashamed for covering a third of the world with its wonderful tangled network of roots and branches delicate shaking leaves and its millions of spires that caught the sun and wind and rain Its very right to existence seemed in question II Sanderson accordingly came down and on the whole his short visit was a success Why he came at all was a mystery to those who heard of it for he never paid visits and was certainly not the kind of man to court a customer There must have been something in Bittacy he liked missus Bittacy was glad when he left He brought no dress suit for one thing not even a dinner jacket and he wore very low collars with big balloon ties like a Frenchman and let his hair grow longer than was nice she felt Not that these things were important but that she considered them symptoms of something a little disordered The ties were unnecessarily flowing For all that he was an interesting man and in spite of his eccentricities of dress and so forth a gentleman Perhaps she reflected in her genuinely charitable heart he had other uses for the twenty guineas an invalid sister or an old mother to support She had no notion of the cost of brushes frames paints and canvases Also she forgave him much for the sake of his beautiful eyes and his eager enthusiasm of manner So many men of thirty were already blase Still when the visit was over she felt relieved She said nothing about his coming a second time and her husband she was glad to notice had likewise made no suggestion For truth to tell the way the younger man engrossed the older keeping him out for hours in the Forest talking on the lawn in the blazing sun and in the evenings when the damp of dusk came creeping out from the surrounding woods all regardless of his age and usual habits was not quite to her taste Of course mister Sanderson did not know how easily those attacks of Indian fever came back but David surely might have told him They talked trees from morning to night It stirred in her the old subconscious trail of dread a trail that led ever into the darkness of big woods and such feelings as her early evangelical training taught her were temptings To regard them in any other way was to play with danger Her mind as she watched these two was charged with curious thoughts of dread she could not understand yet feared the more on that account The way they studied that old mangy cedar was a trifle unnecessary unwise she felt It was disregarding the sense of proportion which deity had set upon the world for men s safe guidance Even after dinner they smoked their cigars upon the low branches that swept down and touched the lawn until at length she insisted on their coming in Cedars she had somewhere heard were not safe after sundown it was not wholesome to be too near them to sleep beneath them was even dangerous though what the precise danger was she had forgotten The upas was the tree she really meant At any rate she summoned David in and Sanderson came presently after him For a long time before deciding on this peremptory step she had watched them surreptitiously from the drawing room window her husband and her guest The dusk enveloped them with its damp veil of gauze She saw the glowing tips of their cigars and heard the drone of voices Bats flitted overhead and big silent moths whirred softly over the rhododendron blossoms And it came suddenly to her while she watched that her husband had somehow altered these last few days since mister Sanderson s arrival in fact A change had come over him though what it was she could not say She hesitated indeed to search That was the instinctive dread operating in her Provided it passed she would rather not know Small things of course she noticed small outward signs He had neglected The Times for one thing left off his speckled waistcoats for another He was absent minded sometimes showed vagueness in practical details where hitherto he showed decision And he had begun to talk in his sleep again These and a dozen other small peculiarities came suddenly upon her with the rush of a combined attack They brought with them a faint distress that made her shiver Momentarily her mind was startled then confused as her eyes picked out the shadowy figures in the dusk the cedar covering them the Forest close at their backs And then before she could think or seek internal guidance as her habit was this whisper muffled and very hurried ran across her brain It s mister Sanderson Call David in at once And she had done so Her shrill voice crossed the lawn and died away into the Forest quickly smothered No echo followed it The sound fell dead against the rampart of a thousand listening trees The damp is so very penetrating even in summer she murmured when they came obediently She was half surprised at her open audacity half repentant They came so meekly at her call And my husband is sensitive to fever from the East No please do not throw away your cigars We can sit by the open window and enjoy the evening while you smoke She was very talkative for a moment subconscious excitement was the cause It is so still so wonderfully still she went on as no one spoke so peaceful and the air so very sweet and God is always near to those who need His aid The words slipped out before she realized quite what she was saying yet fortunately in time to lower her voice for no one heard them They were perhaps an instinctive expression of relief It flustered her that she could have said the thing at all Sanderson brought her shawl and helped to arrange the chairs she thanked him in her old fashioned gentle way declining the lamps which he had offered to light They attract the moths and insects so I think The three of them sat there in the gloaming mister Bittacy s white moustache and his wife s yellow shawl gleaming at either end of the little horseshoe Sanderson with his wild black hair and shining eyes midway between them The painter went on talking softly continuing evidently the conversation begun with his host beneath the cedar missus Bittacy on her guard listened uneasily For trees you see rather conceal themselves in daylight They reveal themselves fully only after sunset I never know a tree he bowed here slightly towards the lady as though to apologize for something he felt she would not quite understand or like until I ve seen it in the night Your cedar for instance looking towards her husband again so that missus Bittacy caught the gleaming of his turned eyes I failed with badly at first because I did it in the morning You shall see to morrow what I mean that first sketch is upstairs in my portfolio it s quite another tree to the one you bought That view he leaned forward lowering his voice I caught one morning about two o clock in very faint moonlight and the stars I saw the naked being of the thing You mean that you went out mister Sanderson at that hour the old lady asked with astonishment and mild rebuke She did not care particularly for his choice of adjectives either I fear it was rather a liberty to take in another s house perhaps he answered courteously But having chanced to wake I saw the tree from my window and made my way downstairs It s a wonder Boxer didn t bit you he sleeps loose in the hall she said On the contrary The dog came out with me I hope he added the noise didn t disturb you though it s rather late to say so I feel quite guilty His white teeth showed in the dusk as he smiled A smell of earth and flowers stole in through the window on a breath of wandering air missus Bittacy said nothing at the moment We both sleep like tops put in her husband laughing You re a courageous man though Sanderson and by Jove the picture justifies you Few artist would have taken so much trouble though I read once that Holman Hunt Rossetti or some one of that lot painted all night in his orchard to get an effect of moonlight that he wanted He chattered on His wife was glad to hear his voice it made her feel more easy in her mind But presently the other held the floor again and her thoughts grew darkened and afraid Instinctively she feared the influence on her husband The mystery and wonder that lie in woods in forests in great gatherings of trees everywhere seemed so real and present while he talked The Night transfigures all things in a way he was saying but nothing so searchingly as trees From behind a veil that sunlight hangs before them in the day they emerge and show themselves Even buildings do that in a measure but trees particularly In the daytime they sleep at night they wake they manifest turn active live You remember turning politely again in the direction of his hostess how clearly Henley understood that That socialist person you mean asked the lady Her tone and accent made the substantive sound criminal It almost hissed the way she uttered it The poet yes replied the artist tactfully the friend of Stevenson you remember Stevenson who wrote those charming children s verses He quoted in a low voice the lines he meant It was for once the time the place and the setting all together The words floated out across the lawn towards the wall of blue darkness where the big Forest swept the little garden with its league long curve that was like the shore line of a sea A wave of distant sound that was like surf accompanied his voice as though the wind was fain to listen too Not to the staring Day For all the importunate questionings he pursues In his big violent voice Shall those mild things of bulk and multitude The trees God s sentinels Yield of their huge unutterable selves But at the word Of the ancient sacerdotal Night Night of many secrets whose effect Transfiguring hierophantic dread Themselves alone may fully apprehend They tremble and are changed In each the uncouth individual soul Looms forth and glooms Essential and their bodily presences Touched with inordinate significance Wearing the darkness like a livery Of some mysterious and tremendous guild They brood they menace they appall The voice of missus Bittacy presently broke the silence that followed I like that part about God s sentinels she murmured There was no sharpness in her tone it was hushed and quiet The truth so musically uttered muted her shrill objections though it had not lessened her alarm Her husband made no comment his cigar she noticed had gone out And old trees in particular continued the artist as though to himself have very definite personalities You can offend wound please them the moment you stand within their shade you feel whether they come out to you or whether they withdraw He turned abruptly towards his host You know that singular essay of Prentice Mulford s no doubt God in the Trees extravagant perhaps but yet with a fine true beauty in it You ve never read it no he asked But it was missus Bittacy who answered her husband keeping his curious deep silence I never did It fell like a drip of cold water from the face muffled in the yellow shawl even a child could have supplied the remainder of the unspoken thought Ah said Sanderson gently but there is God in the trees God in a very subtle aspect and sometimes I have known the trees express it too that which is not God dark and terrible Have you ever noticed too how clearly trees show what they want choose their companions at least How beeches for instance allow no life too near them birds or squirrels in their boughs nor any growth beneath The silence in the beech wood is quite terrifying often And how pines like bilberry bushes at their feet and sometimes little oaks all trees making a clear deliberate choice and holding firmly to it Some trees obviously it s very strange and marked seem to prefer the human The old lady sat up crackling for this was more than she could permit Her stiff silk dress emitted little sharp reports We know she answered that He was said to have walked in the garden in the cool of the evening the gulp betrayed the effort that it cost her but we are nowhere told that He hid in the trees or anything like that Trees after all we must remember are only large vegetables True was the soft answer but in everything that grows has life that is there s mystery past all finding out The wonder that lies hidden in our own souls lies also hidden I venture to assert in the stupidity and silence of a mere potato The observation was not meant to be amusing It was not amusing No one laughed On the contrary the words conveyed in too literal a sense the feeling that haunted all that conversation Each one in his own way realized with beauty with wonder with alarm that the talk had somehow brought the whole vegetable kingdom nearer to that of man Some link had been established between the two It was not wise with that great Forest listening at their very doors to speak so plainly The forest edged up closer while they did so And missus Bittacy anxious to interrupt the horrid spell broke suddenly in upon it with a matter of fact suggestion She did not like her husband s prolonged silence stillness He seemed so negative so changed David she said raising her voice I think you re feeling the dampness It s grown chilly The fever comes so suddenly you know and it might be wide to take the tincture I ll go and get it dear at once It s better And before he could object she had left the room to bring the homeopathic dose that she believed in and that to please her he swallowed by the tumbler full from week to week And the moment the door closed behind her Sanderson began again though now in quite a different tone mister Bittacy sat up in his chair The two men obviously resumed the conversation the real conversation interrupted beneath the cedar and left aside the sham one which was so much dust merely thrown in the old lady s eyes Trees love you that s the fact he said earnestly Your service to them all these years abroad has made them know you Know me Made them yes he paused a moment then added made them aware of your presence aware of a force outside themselves that deliberately seeks their welfare don t you see By Jove Sanderson This put into plain language actual sensations he had felt yet had never dared to phrase in words before They get into touch with me as it were he ventured laughing at his own sentence yet laughing only with his lips Exactly was the quick emphatic reply They seek to blend with something they feel instinctively to be good for them helpful to their essential beings encouraging to their best expression their life Good Lord Sir Bittacy heard himself saying but you re putting my own thoughts into words D you know I ve felt something like that for years As though he looked round to make sure his wife was not there then finished the sentence as though the trees were after me Amalgamate seems the best word perhaps said Sanderson slowly They would draw you to themselves Good forces you see always seek to merge evil to separate that s why Good in the end must always win the day everywhere The accumulation in the long run becomes overwhelming Evil tends to separation dissolution death The comradeship of trees their instinct to run together is a vital symbol Trees in a mass are good alone you may take it generally are well dangerous Look at a monkey puzzler or better still a holly Look at it watch it understand it Did you ever see more plainly an evil thought made visible They re wicked Beautiful too oh yes There s a strange miscalculated beauty often in evil That cedar then Not evil no but alien rather Cedars grow in forests all together The poor thing has drifted that is all They were getting rather deep Sanderson talking against time spoke so fast It was too condensed Bittacy hardly followed that last bit His mind floundered among his own less definite less sorted thoughts till presently another sentence from the artist startled him into attention again That cedar will protect you here though because you both have humanized it by your thinking so lovingly of its presence The others can t get past it as it were Protect me he exclaimed Protect me from their love Sanderson laughed We re getting rather mixed he said we re talking of one thing in the terms of another really But what I mean is you see that their love for you their awareness of your personality and presence involves the idea of winning you across the border into themselves into their world of living It means in a way taking you over The ideas the artist started in his mind ran furious wild races to and fro It was like a maze sprung suddenly into movement The whirling of the intricate lines bewildered him They went so fast leaving but half an explanation of their goal He followed first one then another but a new one always dashed across to intercept before he could get anywhere But India he said presently in a lower voice India is so far away from this little English forest The trees too are utterly different for one thing The rustle of skirts warned of missus Bittacy s approach This was a sentence he could turn round another way in case she came up and pressed for explanation There is communion among trees all the world over was the strange quick reply They always know They always know You think then The winds you see the great swift carriers They have their ancient rights of way about the world An easterly wind for instance carrying on stage by stage as it were linking dropped messages and meanings from land to land like the birds an easterly wind missus Bittacy swept in upon them with the tumbler There David she said that will ward off any beginnings of attack Just a spoonful dear Oh oh not all for he had swallowed half the contents at a single gulp as usual another dose before you go to bed and the balance in the morning first thing when you wake She turned to her guest who put the tumbler down for her upon a table at his elbow She had heard them speak of the east wind She emphasized the warning she had misinterpreted The private part of the conversation came to an abrupt end It is the one thing that upsets him more than any other an east wind she said and I am glad mister Sanderson to hear you think so too III A deep hush followed in the middle of which an owl was heard calling its muffled note in the forest A big moth whirred with a soft collision against one of the windows missus Bittacy started slightly but no one spoke Above the trees the stars were faintly visible From the distance came the barking of a dog Bittacy relighting his cigar broke the little spell of silence that had caught all three It s rather a comforting thought he said throwing the match out of the window that life is about us everywhere and that there is really no dividing line between what we call organic and inorganic The universe yes said Sanderson is all one really We re puzzled by the gaps we cannot see across but as a fact I suppose there are no gaps at all missus Bittacy rustled ominously holding her peace meanwhile She feared long words she did not understand Beelzebub lay hid among too many syllables In trees and plants especially there dreams an exquisite life that no one yet has proved unconscious Or conscious either mister Sanderson she neatly interjected It s only man that was made after His image not shrubberies and things Her husband interposed without delay It is not necessary he explained suavely to say that they re alive in the sense that we are alive At the same time with an eye to his wife I see no harm in holding dear that all created things contain some measure of His life Who made them It s only beautiful to hold that He created nothing dead We are not pantheists for all that he added soothingly Oh no Not that I hope The word alarmed her It was worse than pope Through her puzzled mind stole a stealthy dangerous thing like a panther I like to think that even in decay there s life the painter murmured The falling apart of rotten wood breeds sentiency there s force and motion in the falling of a dying leaf in the breaking up and crumbling of everything indeed And take an inert stone it s crammed with heat and weight and potencies of all sorts What holds its particles together indeed We understand it as little as gravity or why a needle always turns to the North Both things may be a mode of life You think a compass has a soul mister Sanderson exclaimed the lady with a crackling of her silk flounces that conveyed a sense of outrage even more plainly than her tone The artist smiled to himself in the darkness but it was Bittacy who hastened to reply Our friend merely suggests that these mysterious agencies he said quietly may be due to some kind of life we cannot understand Why should water only run downhill Why should trees grow at right angles to the surface of the ground and towards the sun Why should the worlds spin for ever on their axes Why should fire change the form of everything it touches without really destroying them To say these things follow the law of their being explains nothing mister Sanderson merely suggests poetically my dear of course that these may be manifestations of life though life at a different stage to ours The breath of life we read He breathed into them These things do not breathe She said it with triumph Then Sanderson put in a word But he spoke rather to himself or to his host than by way of serious rejoinder to the ruffled lady But plants do breathe too you know he said They breathe they eat they digest they move about and they adapt themselves to their environment as men and animals do They have a nervous system too at least a complex system of nuclei which have some of the qualities of nerve cells They may have memory too Certainly they know definite action in response to stimulus And though this may be physiological no one has proved that it is only that and not psychological He did not notice apparently the little gasp that was audible behind the yellow shawl Bittacy cleared his throat threw his extinguished cigar upon the lawn crossed and recrossed his legs And in trees continued the other behind a great forest for instance pointing towards the woods may stand a rather splendid Entity that manifests through all the thousand individual trees some huge collective life quite as minutely and delicately organized as our own It might merge and blend with ours under certain conditions so that we could understand it by being it for a time at least It might even engulf human vitality into the immense whirlpool of its own vast dreaming life The pull of a big forest on a man can be tremendous and utterly overwhelming The mouth of missus Bittacy was heard to close with a snap Her shawl and particularly her crackling dress exhaled the protest that burned within her like a pain She was too distressed to be overawed but at the same time too confused mid the litter of words and meanings half understood to find immediate phrases she could use Whatever the actual meaning of his language might be however and whatever subtle dangers lay concealed behind them meanwhile they certainly wove a kind of gentle spell with the glimmering darkness that held all three delicately enmeshed there by that open window The odors of dewy lawn flowers trees and earth formed part of it The moods he continued that people waken in us are due to their hidden life affecting our own Deep calls to sleep A person for instance joins you in an empty room you both instantly change The new arrival though in silence has caused a change of mood May not the moods of Nature touch and stir us in virtue of a similar prerogative The sea the hills the desert wake passion joy terror as the case may be for a few perhaps he glanced significantly at his host so that missus Bittacy again caught the turning of his eyes emotions of a curious flaming splendor that are quite nameless Well whence come these powers Surely from nothing that is dead Does not the influence of a forest its sway and strange ascendancy over certain minds betray a direct manifestation of life It lies otherwise beyond all explanation this mysterious emanation of big woods Some natures of course deliberately invite it The authority of a host of trees his voice grew almost solemn as he said the words is something not to be denied One feels it here I think particularly There was considerable tension in the air as he ceased speaking mister Bittacy had not intended that the talk should go so far They had drifted He did not wish to see his wife unhappy or afraid and he was aware acutely so that her feelings were stirred to a point he did not care about Something in her as he put it was working up towards explosion He sought to generalize the conversation diluting this accumulated emotion by spreading it The sea is His and He made it he suggested vaguely hoping Sanderson would take the hint and with the trees it is the same The whole gigantic vegetable kingdom yes the artist took him up all at the service of man for food for shelter and for a thousand purposes of his daily life Is it not striking what a lot of the globe they cover exquisitely organized life yet stationary always ready to our had when we want them never running away But the taking them for all that not so easy One man shrinks from picking flowers another from cutting down trees And it s curious that most of the forest tales and legends are dark mysterious and somewhat ill omened The forest beings are rarely gay and harmless The forest life was felt as terrible Tree worship still survives to day Wood cutters those who take the life of trees you see a race of haunted men He stopped abruptly a singular catch in his voice Bittacy felt something even before the sentences were over His wife he knew felt it still more strongly For it was in the middle of the heavy silence following upon these last remarks that missus Bittacy rising with a violent abruptness from her chair drew the attention of the others to something moving towards them across the lawn It came silently In outline it was large and curiously spread It rose high too for the sky above the shrubberies still pale gold from the sunset was dimmed by its passage She declared afterwards that it move in looping circles but what she perhaps meant to convey was spirals She screamed faintly It s come at last And it s you that brought it She turned excitedly half afraid half angry to Sanderson With a breathless sort of gasp she said it politeness all forgotten I knew it if you went on I knew it Oh Oh And she cried again Your talking has brought it out The terror that shook her voice was rather dreadful But the confusion of her vehement words passed unnoticed in the first surprise they caused For a moment nothing happened What is it you think you see my dear asked her husband startled Sanderson said nothing All three leaned forward the men still sitting but missus Bittacy had rushed hurriedly to the window placing herself of a purpose as it seemed between her husband and the lawn She pointed Her little hand made a silhouette against the sky the yellow shawl hanging from the arm like a cloud Beyond the cedar between it and the lilacs The voice had lost its shrillness it was thin and hushed There now you see it going round upon itself again going back thank God going back to the Forest It sank to a whisper shaking She repeated with a great dropping sigh of relief Thank God I thought at first it was coming here to us David to you She stepped back from the window her movements confused feeling in the darkness for the support of a chair and finding her husband s outstretched hand instead Hold me dear hold me please tight Do not let me go She was in what he called afterwards a regular state He drew her firmly down upon her chair again Smoke Sophie my dear he said quickly trying to make his voice calm and natural I see it yes It s smoke blowing over from the gardener s cottage But David and there was a new horror in her whisper now it made a noise It makes it still I hear it swishing Some such word she used swishing sishing rushing or something of the kind David I m very frightened It s something awful That man has called it out Hush hush whispered her husband He stroked her trembling hand beside him It is in the wind said Sanderson speaking for the first time very quietly The expression on his face was not visible in the gloom but his voice was soft and unafraid At the sound of it missus Bittacy started violently again Bittacy drew his chair a little forward to obstruct her view of him He felt bewildered himself a little hardly knowing quite what to say or do It was all so very curious and sudden But missus Bittacy was badly frightened It seemed to her that what she saw came from the enveloping forest just beyond their little garden It emerged in a sort of secret way moving towards them as with a purpose stealthily difficultly Then something stopped it It could not advance beyond the cedar The cedar this impression remained with her afterwards too prevented kept it back Like a rising sea the Forest had surged a moment in their direction through the covering darkness and this visible movement was its first wave Thus to her mind it seemed like that mysterious turn of the tide that used to frighten and mystify her in childhood on the sands The outward surge of some enormous Power was what she felt something to which every instinct in her being rose in opposition because it threatened her and hers In that moment she realized the Personality of the Forest menacing In the stumbling movement that she made away from the window and towards the bell she barely caught the sentence Sanderson or was it her husband murmured to himself It came because we talked of it our thinking made it aware of us and brought it out But the cedar stops it It cannot cross the lawn you see All three were standing now and her husband s voice broke in with authority while his wife s fingers touched the bell My dear I should not say anything to Thompson The anxiety he felt was manifest in his voice but his outward composure had returned The gardener can go Then Sanderson cut him short Allow me he said quickly I ll see if anything s wrong And before either of them could answer or object he was gone leaping out by the open window They saw his figure vanish with a run across the lawn into the darkness A moment later the maid entered in answer to the bell and with her came the loud barking of the terrier from the hall The lamps said her master shortly and as she softly closed the door behind her they heard the wind pass with a mournful sound of singing round the outer walls A rustle of foliage from the distance passed within it You see the wind is rising It was the wind He put a comforting arm about her distressed to feel that she was trembling But he knew that he was trembling too though with a kind of odd elation rather than alarm And it was smoke that you saw coming from Stride s cottage or from the rubbish heaps he s been burning in the kitchen garden The noise we heard was the branches rustling in the wind Why should you be so nervous A thin whispering voice answered him I was afraid for you dear Something frightened me for you That man makes me feel so uneasy and uncomfortable for his influence upon you It s very foolish I know I think I m tired I feel so overwrought and restless The words poured out in a hurried jumble and she kept turning to the window while she spoke The strain of having a visitor he said soothingly has taxed you We re so unused to having people in the house He goes to morrow He warmed her cold hands between his own stroking them tenderly More for the life of him he could not say or do The joy of a strange internal excitement made his heart beat faster He knew not what it was He knew only perhaps whence it came She peered close into his face through the gloom and said a curious thing I thought David for a moment you seemed different My nerves are all on edge to night She made no further reference to her husband s visitor A sound of footsteps from the lawn warned of Sanderson s return as he answered quickly in a lowered tone There s no need to be afraid on my account dear girl There s nothing wrong with me I assure you I never felt so well and happy in my life Thompson came in with the lamps and brightness and scarcely had she gone again when Sanderson in turn was seen climbing through the window There s nothing he said lightly as he closed it behind him Somebody s been burning leaves and the smoke is drifting a little through the trees The wind he added glancing at his host a moment significantly but in so discreet a way that missus Bittacy did not observe it the wind too has begun to roar in the Forest further out But missus Bittacy noticed about him two things which increased her uneasiness She noticed the shining of his eyes because a similar light had suddenly come into her husband s and she noticed too the apparent depth of meaning he put into those simple words that the wind had begun to roar in the Forest further out Her mind retained the disagreeable impression that he meant more than he said In his tone lay quite another implication It was not actually wind he spoke of and it would not remain further out rather it was coming in Another impression she got too still more unwelcome was that her husband understood his hidden meaning IV David dear she observed gently as soon as they were alone upstairs I have a horrible uneasy feeling about that man I cannot get rid of it The tremor in per voice caught all his tenderness He turned to look at her Of what kind my dear You re so imaginative sometimes aren t you I think she hesitated stammering a little confused still frightened I mean isn t he a hypnotist or full of those theosophical ideas or something of the sort You know what I mean He was too accustomed to her little confused alarms to explain them away seriously as a rule or to correct her verbal inaccuracies but to night he felt she needed careful tender treatment He soothed her as best he could But there s no harm in that even if he is he answered quietly Those are only new names for very old ideas you know dear There was no trace of impatience in his voice That s what I mean she replied the texts he dreaded rising in an unuttered crowd behind the words He s one of those things that we are warned would come one of those Latter Day things For her mind still bristled with the bogeys of the Antichrist and Prophecy and she had only escaped the Number of the Beast as it were by the skin of her teeth The Pope drew most of her fire usually because she could understand him the target was plain and she could shoot But this tree and forest business was so vague and horrible It terrified her He makes me think she went on of Principalities and Powers in high places and of things that walk in the darkness I did not like the way he spoke of trees getting alive in the night and all that it made me think of wolves in sheep s clothing And when I saw that awful thing in the sky above the lawn But he interrupted her at once for that was something he had decided it was best to leave unmentioned Certainly it was better not discussed He only meant I think Sophie he put in gravely yet with a little smile that trees may have a measure of conscious life rather a nice idea on the whole surely something like that bit we read in the Times the other night you remember and that a big forest may possess a sort of Collective Personality Remember he s an artist and poetical It s dangerous she said emphatically I feel it s playing with fire unwise unsafe Yet all to the glory of God he urged gently We must not shut our ears and eyes to knowledge of any kind must we With you David the wish is always farther than the thought she rejoined For like the child who thought that suffered under Pontius Pilate was suffered under a bunch of violets she heard her proverbs phonetically and reproduced them thus She hoped to convey her warning in the quotation And we must always try the spirits whether they be of God she added tentatively Certainly dear we can always do that he assented getting into bed But after a little pause during which she blew the light out David Bittacy settling down to sleep with an excitement in his blood that was new and bewilderingly delightful realized that perhaps he had not said quite enough to comfort her She was lying awake by his side still frightened He put his head up in the darkness Sophie he said softly you must remember too that in any case between us and and all that sort of thing there is a great gulf fixed a gulf that cannot be crossed er while we are still in the body And hearing no reply he satisfied himself that she was already asleep and happy But missus Bittacy was not asleep She heard the sentence only she said nothing because she felt her thought was better unexpressed She was afraid to hear the words in the darkness The Forest outside was listening and might hear them too the Forest that was roaring further out And the thought was this That gulf of course existed but Sanderson had somehow bridged it It was much later than night when she awoke out of troubled uneasy dreams and heard a sound that twisted her very nerves with fear It passed immediately with full waking for listen as she might there was nothing audible but the inarticulate murmur of the night It was in her dreams she heard it and the dreams had vanished with it But the sound was recognizable for it was that rushing noise that had come across the lawn only this time closer Just above her face while she slept had passed this murmur as of rustling branches in the very room a sound of foliage whispering A going in the tops of the mulberry trees ran through her mind She had dreamed that she lay beneath a spreading tree somewhere a tree that whispered with ten thousand soft lips of green and the dream continued for a moment even after waking She sat up in bed and stared about her The window was open at the top she saw the stars the door she remembered was locked as usual the room of course was empty The deep hush of the summer night lay over all broken only by another sound that now issued from the shadows close beside the bed a human sound yet unnatural a sound that seized the fear with which she had waked and instantly increased it And although it was one she recognized as familiar at first she could not name it Some seconds certainly passed and they were very long ones before she understood that it was her husband talking in his sleep The direction of the voice confused and puzzled her moreover for it was not as she first supposed beside her There was distance in it The next minute by the light of the sinking candle flame she saw his white figure standing out in the middle of the room half way towards the window The candle light slowly grew She saw him move then nearer to the window with arms outstretched His speech was low and mumbled the words running together too much to be distinguishable And she shivered To her sleep talking was uncanny to the point of horror it was like the talking of the dead mere parody of a living voice unnatural David she whispered dreading the sound of her own voice and half afraid to interrupt him and see his face She could not bear the sight of the wide opened eyes David you re walking in your sleep Do come back to bed dear please Her whisper seemed so dreadfully loud in the still darkness At the sound of her voice he paused then turned slowly round to face her His widely opened eyes stared into her own without recognition they looked through her into something beyond it was as though he knew the direction of the sound yet cold not see her They were shining she noticed as the eyes of Sanderson had shone several hours ago and his face was flushed distraught Anxiety was written upon every feature And instantly recognizing that the fever was upon him she forgot her terror temporarily in practical considerations He came back to bed without waking She closed his eyelids Presently he composed himself quietly to sleep or rather to deeper sleep She contrived to make him swallow something from the tumbler beside the bed Then she rose very quietly to close the window feeling the night air blow in too fresh and keen She put the candle where it could not reach him The sight of the big Baxter Bible beside it comforted her a little but all through her under being ran the warnings of a curious alarm And it was while in the act of fastening the catch with one hand and pulling the string of the blind with the other that her husband sat up again in bed and spoke in words this time that were distinctly audible The eyes had opened wide again He pointed She stood stock still and listened her shadow distorted on the blind He did not come out towards her as at first she feared The whispering voice was very clear horrible too beyond all she had ever known They are roaring in the Forest further out and I must go and see He stared beyond her as he said it to the woods They are needing me They sent for me Then his eyes wandering back again to things within the room he lay down his purpose suddenly changed And that change was horrible as well more horrible perhaps because of its revelation of another detailed world he moved in far away from her The singular phrase chilled her blood for a moment she was utterly terrified That tone of the somnambulist differing so slightly yet so distressingly from normal waking speech seemed to her somehow wicked Evil and danger lay waiting thick behind it She leaned against the window sill shaking in every limb She had an awful feeling for a moment that something was coming in to fetch him Not yet then she heard in a much lower voice from the bed but later It will be better so I shall go later The words expressed some fringe of these alarms that had haunted her so long and that the arrival and presence of Sanderson seemed to have brought to the very edge of a climax she could not even dare to think about They gave it form they brought it closer they sent her thoughts to her Deity in a wild deep prayer for help and guidance For here was a direct unconscious betrayal of a world of inner purposes and claims her husband recognized while he kept them almost wholly to himself By the time she reached his side and knew the comfort of his touch the eyes had closed again this time of their own accord and the head lay calmly back upon the pillows She gently straightened the bed clothes She watched him for some minutes shading the candle carefully with one hand There was a smile of strangest peace upon the face Then blowing out the candle she knelt down and prayed before getting back into bed But no sleep came to her She lay awake all night thinking wondering praying until at length with the chorus of the birds and the glimmer of the dawn upon the green blind she fell into a slumber of complete exhaustion But while she slept the wind continued roaring in the Forest further out The sound came closer sometimes very close indeed V With the departure of Sanderson the significance of the curious incidents waned because the moods that had produced them passed away missus Bittacy soon afterwards came to regard them as some growth of disproportion that had been very largely perhaps in her own mind It did not strike her that this change was sudden for it came about quite naturally For one thing her husband never spoke of the matter and for another she remembered how many things in life that had seemed inexplicable and singular at the time turned out later to have been quite commonplace Most of it certainly she put down to the presence of the artist and to his wild suggestive talk With his welcome removal the world turned ordinary again and safe The fever though it lasted as usual a short time only had not allowed of her husband s getting up to say good bye and she had conveyed his regrets and adieux In the morning mister Sanderson had seemed ordinary enough In his town hat and gloves as she saw him go he seemed tame and unalarming After all she thought as she watched the pony cart bear him off he s only an artist What she had thought he might be otherwise her slim imagination did not venture to disclose Her change of feeling was wholesome and refreshing She felt a little ashamed of her behavior She gave him a smile genuine because the relief she felt was genuine as he bent over her hand and kissed it but she did not suggest a second visit and her husband she noted with satisfaction and relief had said nothing either The little household fell again into the normal and sleepy routine to which it was accustomed The name of Arthur Sanderson was rarely if ever mentioned Nor for her part did she mention to her husband the incident of his walking in his sleep and the wild words he used But to forget it was equally impossible Thus it lay buried deep within her like a center of some unknown disease of which it was a mysterious symptom waiting to spread at the first favorable opportunity She prayed against it every night and morning prayed that she might forget it that God would keep her husband safe from harm For in spite of much surface foolishness that many might have read as weakness missus Bittacy had balance sanity and a fine deep faith She was greater than she knew Her love for her husband and her God were somehow one an achievement only possible to a single hearted nobility of soul There followed a summer of great violence and beauty of beauty because the refreshing rains at night prolonged the glory of the spring and spread it all across July keeping the foliage young and sweet of violence because the winds that tore about the south of England brushed the whole country into dancing movement They swept the woods magnificently and kept them roaring with a perpetual grand voice Their deepest notes seemed never to leave the sky They sang and shouted and torn leaves raced and fluttered through the air long before their usually appointed time Many a tree after days of roaring and dancing fell exhausted to the ground The cedar on the lawn gave up two limbs that fell upon successive days at the same hour too just before dusk The wind often makes its most boisterous effort at that time before it drops with the sun and these two huge branches lay in dark ruin covering half the lawn They spread across it and towards the house They left an ugly gaping space upon the tree so that the Lebanon looked unfinished half destroyed a monster shorn of its old time comeliness and splendor Far more of the Forest was now visible than before it peered through the breach of the broken defenses They could see from the windows of the house now especially from the drawing room and bedroom windows straight out into the glades and depths beyond missus Bittacy s niece and nephew who were staying on a visit at the time enjoyed themselves immensely helping the gardeners carry off the fragments It took two days to do this for mister Bittacy insisted on the branches being moved entire He would not allow them to be chopped also he would not consent to their use as firewood Under his superintendence the unwieldy masses were dragged to the edge of the garden and arranged upon the frontier line between the Forest and the lawn The children were delighted with the scheme They entered into it with enthusiasm At all costs this defense against the inroads of the Forest must be made secure They caught their uncle s earnestness felt even something of a hidden motive that he had and the visit usually rather dreaded became the visit of their lives instead It was Aunt Sophia this time who seemed discouraging and dull She s got so old and funny opined Stephen But Alice who felt in the silent displeasure of her aunt some secret thing that alarmed her said I think she s afraid of the woods She never comes into them with us you see All the more reason then for making this wall impreg all fat and thick and solid he concluded unable to manage the longer word Then nothing simply nothing can get through Can t it Uncle David And mister Bittacy jacket discarded and working in his speckled waistcoat went puffing to their aid arranging the massive limb of the cedar like a hedge Come on he said whatever happens you know we must finish before it s dark Already the wind is roaring in the Forest further out And Alice caught the phrase and instantly echoed it Stevie she cried below her breath look sharp you lazy lump Didn t you hear what Uncle David said It ll come in and catch us before we ve done They worked like Trojans and sitting beneath the wisteria tree that climbed the southern wall of the cottage missus Bittacy with her knitting watched them calling from time to time insignificant messages of counsel and advice The messages passed of course unheeded Mostly indeed they were unheard for the workers were too absorbed She warned her husband not to get too hot Alice not to tear her dress Stephen not to strain his back with pulling Her mind hovered between the homeopathic medicine chest upstairs and her anxiety to see the business finished For this breaking up of the cedar had stirred again her slumbering alarms It revived memories of the visit of mister Sanderson that had been sinking into oblivion she recalled his queer and odious way of talking and many things she hoped forgotten drew their heads up from that subconscious region to which all forgetting is impossible They looked at her and nodded They were full of life they had no intention of being pushed aside and buried permanently Now look they whispered didn t we tell you so They had been merely waiting the right moment to assert their presence And all her former vague distress crept over her Anxiety uneasiness returned That dreadful sinking of the heart came too This incident of the cedar s breaking up was actually so unimportant and yet her husband s attitude towards it made it so significant There was nothing that he said in particular or did or left undone that frightened her but his general air of earnestness seemed so unwarranted She felt that he deemed the thing important He was so exercised about it This evidence of sudden concern and interest buried all the summer from her sight and knowledge she realized now had been buried purposely he had kept it intentionally concealed Deeply submerged in him there ran this tide of other thoughts desires hopes What were they Whither did they lead The accident to the tree betrayed it most unpleasantly and doubtless more than he was aware She watched his grave and serious face as he worked there with the children and as she watched she felt afraid It vexed her that the children worked so eagerly They unconsciously supported him The thing she feared she would not even name But it was waiting Moreover as far as her puzzled mind could deal with a dread so vague and incoherent the collapse of the cedar somehow brought it nearer The fact that all so ill explained and formless the thing yet lay in her consciousness out of reach but moving and alive filled her with a kind of puzzled dreadful wonder Its presence was so very real its power so gripping its partial concealment so abominable Then out of the dim confusion she grasped one thought and saw it stand quite clear before her eyes She found difficulty in clothing it in words but its meaning perhaps was this That cedar stood in their life for something friendly its downfall meant disaster a sense of some protective influence about the cottage and about her husband in particular was thereby weakened Why do you fear the big winds so he had asked her several days before after a particularly boisterous day and the answer she gave surprised her while she gave it One of those heads poked up unconsciously and let slip the truth Because David I feel they bring the Forest with them she faltered They blow something from the trees into the mind into the house He looked at her keenly for a moment That must be why I love them then he answered They blow the souls of the trees about the sky like clouds The conversation dropped She had never heard him talk in quite that way before And another time when he had coaxed her to go with him down one of the nearer glades she asked why he took the small hand axe with him and what he wanted it for To cut the ivy that clings to the trunks and takes their life away he said But can t the verdurers do that she asked That s what they re paid for isn t it Whereupon he explained that ivy was a parasite the trees knew not how to fight alone and that the verdurers were careless and did not do it thoroughly They gave a chop here and there leaving the tree to do the rest for itself if it could Besides I like to do it for them I love to help them and protect he added the foliage rustling all about his quiet words as they went And these stray remarks as his attitude towards the broken cedar betrayed this curious subtle change that was going forward to his personality Slowly and surely all the summer it had increased It was growing the thought startled her horribly just as a tree grows the outer evidence from day to day so slight as to be unnoticeable yet the rising tide so deep and irresistible The alteration spread all through and over him was in both mind and actions sometimes almost in his face as well Occasionally thus it stood up straight outside himself and frightened her His life was somehow becoming linked so intimately with trees and with all that trees signified His interests became more and more their interests his activity combined with theirs his thoughts and feelings theirs his purpose hope desire his fate His fate The darkness of some vague enormous terror dropped its shadow on her when she thought of it Some instinct in her heart she dreaded infinitely more than death for death meant sweet translation for his soul came gradually to associate the thought of him with the thought of trees in particular with these Forest trees Sometimes before she could face the thing argue it away or pray it into silence she found the thought of him running swiftly through her mind like a thought of the Forest itself the two most intimately linked and joined together each a part and complement of the other one being The idea was too dim for her to see it face to face Its mere possibility dissolved the instant she focused it to get the truth behind it It was too utterly elusive made protaean Under the attack of even a minute s concentration the very meaning of it vanished melted away The idea lay really behind any words that she could ever find beyond the touch of definite thought Her mind was unable to grapple with it But while it vanished the trail of its approach and disappearance flickered a moment before her shaking vision The horror certainly remained Reduced to the simple human statement that her temperament sought instinctively it stood perhaps at this Her husband loved her and he loved the trees as well but the trees came first claimed parts of him she did not know She loved her God and him He loved the trees and her Thus in guise of some faint distressing compromise the matter shaped itself for her perplexed mind in the terms of conflict A silent hidden battle raged but as yet raged far away The breaking of the cedar was a visible outward fragment of a distant and mysterious encounter that was coming daily closer to them both The wind instead of roaring in the Forest further out now cam nearer booming in fitful gusts about its edge and frontiers Meanwhile the summer dimmed The autumn winds went sighing through the woods leaves turned to golden red and the evenings were drawing in with cozy shadows before the first sign of anything seriously untoward made its appearance It came then with a flat decided kind of violence that indicated mature preparation beforehand It was not impulsive nor ill considered In a fashion it seemed expected and indeed inevitable For within a fortnight of their annual change to the little village of Seillans above saint Raphael a change so regular for the past ten years that it was not even discussed between them David Bittacy abruptly refused to go Thompson had laid the tea table prepared the spirit lamp beneath the urn pulled down the blinds in that swift and silent way she had and left the room The lamps were still unlit The fire light shone on the chintz armchairs and Boxer lay asleep on the black horse hair rug Upon the walls the gilt picture frames gleamed faintly the pictures themselves indistinguishable missus Bittacy had warmed the teapot and was in the act of pouring the water in to heat the cups when her husband looking up from his chair across the hearth made the abrupt announcement My dear he said as though following a train of thought of which she only heard this final phrase it s really quite impossible for me to go And so abrupt inconsequent it sounded that she at first misunderstood She thought he meant to go out into the garden or the woods But her heart leaped all the same The tone of his voice was ominous Of course not she answered it would be most unwise Why should you She referred to the mist that always spread on autumn nights upon the lawn but before she finished the sentence she knew that he referred to something else And her heart then gave its second horrible leap David You mean abroad she gasped I mean abroad dear yes It reminded her of the tone he used when saying good bye years ago before one of those jungle expeditions she dreaded His voice then was so serious so final It was serious and final now For several moments she could think of nothing to say She busied herself with the teapot She had filled one cup with hot water till it overflowed and she emptied it slowly into the slop basin trying with all her might not to let him see the trembling of her hand The firelight and the dimness of the room both helped her But in any case he would hardly have noticed it His thoughts were far away VI

4744_31668_000002_000004	train-clean-360	They laughed in her face 
none	none	She never lost knowledge of the fact that the leagues of forest lay about their cottage like a mighty wall a crowding watching listening presence that shut them in from freedom and escape 
4744_31668_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Far from morbid naturally she did her best to deny the thought and so simple and unartificial was her type of mind that for weeks together she would wholly lose it 
none	none	Then suddenly it would return upon her with a rush of bleak reality 
4744_31668_000003_000003	train-clean-360	It was not only in her mind it existed apart from any mere mood a separate fear that walked alone it came and went yet when it went went only to watch her from another point of view 
4744_31668_000003_000004	train-clean-360	It was in abeyance hidden round the corner 
4744_31668_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The Forest never let her go completely 
4744_31668_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It was ever ready to encroach All the branches she sometimes fancied stretched one way towards their tiny cottage and garden as though it sought to draw them in and merge them in itself 
none	none	Its great deep breathing soul resented the mockery the insolence the irritation of the prim garden at its very gates 
4744_31668_000004_000003	train-clean-360	It would absorb and smother them if it could 
none	none	And every wind that blew its thundering message over the huge sounding board of the million shaking trees conveyed the purpose that it had 
4744_31668_000004_000005	train-clean-360	They had angered its great soul 
4744_31668_000004_000006	train-clean-360	At its heart was this deep incessant roaring 
none	none	All this she never framed in words the subtleties of language lay far beyond her reach 
4744_31668_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But instinctively she felt it and more besides 
none	none	It troubled her profoundly 
4744_31668_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Chiefly moreover for her husband 
4744_31668_000005_000004	train-clean-360	Merely for herself the nightmare might have left her cold 
4744_31668_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It was David s peculiar interest in the trees that gave the special invitation 
none	none	Jealousy then in its most subtle aspect came to strengthen this aversion and dislike for it came in a form that no reasonable wife could possibly object to Her husband s passion she reflected was natural and inborn 
4744_31668_000005_000007	train-clean-360	It had decided his vocation fed his ambition nourished his dreams desires hopes 
4744_31668_000005_000008	train-clean-360	All his best years of active life had been spent in the care and guardianship of trees 
none	none	He knew them understood their secret life and nature managed them intuitively as other men managed dogs and horses 
4744_31668_000005_000010	train-clean-360	He could not live for long away from them without a strange acute nostalgia that stole his peace of mind and consequently his strength of body 
none	none	A forest made him happy and at peace it nursed and fed and soothed his deepest moods 
4744_31668_000005_000012	train-clean-360	Trees influenced the sources of his life lowered or raised the very heart beat in him 
4744_31668_000005_000013	train-clean-360	Cut off from them he languished as a lover of the sea can droop inland or a mountaineer may pine in the flat monotony of the plains 
4744_31668_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This she could understand in a fashion at least and make allowances for 
none	none	She had yielded gently even sweetly to his choice of their English home for in the little island there is nothing that suggests the woods of wilder countries so nearly as the New Forest 
4744_31668_000006_000002	train-clean-360	It has the genuine air and mystery the depth and splendor the loneliness and there and there the strong untamable quality of old time forests as Bittacy of the Department knew them 
none	none	In a single detail only had he yielded to her wishes 
4744_31668_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He consented to a cottage on the edge instead of in the heart of it 
none	none	And for a dozen years now they had dwelt in peace and happiness at the lips of this great spreading thing that covered so many leagues with its tangle of swamps and moors and splendid ancient trees 
4744_31668_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Only with the last two years or so with his own increasing age and physical decline perhaps had come this marked growth of passionate interest in the welfare of the Forest 
none	none	She had watched it grow at first had laughed at it then talked sympathetically so far as sincerity permitted then had argued mildly and finally come to realize that its treatment lay altogether beyond her powers and so had come to fear it with all her heart 
4744_31668_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The six weeks they annually spent away from their English home each regarded very differently of course 
none	none	For her husband it meant a painful exile that did his health no good he yearned for his trees the sight and sound and smell of them but for herself it meant release from a haunting dread escape To renounce those six weeks by the sea on the sunny shining coast of France was almost more than this little woman even with her unselfishness could face After the first shock of the announcement she reflected as deeply as her nature permitted prayed wept in secret and made up her mind Duty she felt clearly pointed to renouncement 
4744_31668_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The discipline would certainly be severe she did not dream at the moment how severe but this fine consistent little Christian saw it plain she accepted it too without any sighing of the martyr though the courage she showed was of the martyr order 
4744_31668_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Her husband should never know the cost 
4744_31668_000010_000003	train-clean-360	In all but this one passion his unselfishness was ever as great as her own 
none	none	The love she had borne him all these years like the love she bore her anthropomorphic deity was deep and real 
4744_31668_000010_000005	train-clean-360	She loved to suffer for them both 
4744_31668_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Besides the way her husband had put it to her was singular 
4744_31668_000010_000007	train-clean-360	It did not take the form of a mere selfish predilection 
4744_31668_000010_000008	train-clean-360	Something higher than two wills in conflict seeking compromise was in it from the beginning 
none	none	I feel Sophia it would be really more than I could manage he said slowly gazing into the fire over the tops of his stretched out muddy boots
4744_31668_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 My duty and my happiness lie here with the Forest and with you My life is deeply rooted in this place 
4744_31668_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Something I can t define connects my inner being with these trees and separation would make me ill might even kill me 
4744_31668_000011_000003	train-clean-360	My hold on life would weaken here is my source of supply 
4744_31668_000011_000004	train-clean-360	I cannot explain it better than that He looked up steadily into her face across the table so that she saw the gravity of his expression and the shining of his steady eyes 
4744_31668_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 David you feel it as strongly as that she said forgetting the tea things altogether 
4744_31668_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes he replied I do 
4744_31668_000013_000001	train-clean-360	And it s not of the body only I feel it in my soul 
4744_31668_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The reality of what he hinted at crept into that shadow covered room like an actual Presence and stood beside them 
none	none	It came not by the windows or the door but it filled the entire space between the walls and ceiling It took the heat from the fire before her face 
4744_31668_000014_000003	train-clean-360	She felt suddenly cold confused a little frightened 
4744_31668_000014_000004	train-clean-360	She almost felt the rush of foliage in the wind 
4744_31668_000014_000005	train-clean-360	It stood between them 
4744_31668_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 There are things some things she faltered we are not intended to know I think The words expressed her general attitude to life not alone to this particular incident 
4744_31668_000016_000000	train-clean-360	And after a pause of several minutes disregarding the criticism as though he had not heard it I cannot explain it better than that you see his grave voice answered 
4744_31668_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 There is this deep tremendous link some secret power they emanate that keeps me well and happy and alive 
4744_31668_000016_000002	train-clean-360	If you cannot understand I feel at least you may be able to forgive His tone grew tender gentle soft 
4744_31668_000016_000003	train-clean-360	 My selfishness I know must seem quite unforgivable 
4744_31668_000016_000004	train-clean-360	I cannot help it somehow these trees this ancient Forest both seem knitted into all that makes me live and if I go 
none	none	There was a little sound of collapse in his voice 
4744_31668_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He stopped abruptly and sank back in his chair 
none	none	And at that a distinct lump came up into her throat which she had great difficulty in managing while she went over and put her arms about him
4744_31668_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear she murmured God will direct 
none	none	We will accept His guidance He has always shown the way before
4744_31668_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 My selfishness afflicts me he began but she would not let him finish 
4744_31668_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 David He will direct 
4744_31668_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Nothing shall harm you 
4744_31668_000020_000002	train-clean-360	You ve never once been selfish and I cannot bear to hear you say such things 
none	none	The way will open that is best for you for both of us She kissed him she would not let him speak her heart was in her throat and she felt for him far more than for herself 
4744_31668_000021_000000	train-clean-360	And then he had suggested that she should go alone perhaps for a shorter time and stay in her brother s villa with the children Alice and Stephen 
none	none	It was always open to her as she well knew You need the change he said when the lamps had been lit and the servant had gone out again you need it as much as I dread it I could manage somehow until you returned and should feel happier that way if you went 
4744_31668_000022_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot leave this Forest that I love so well 
none	none	I even feel Sophie dear he sat up straight and faced her as he half whispered it that I can never leave it again 
4744_31668_000022_000004	train-clean-360	My life and happiness lie here together 
none	none	And eve while scorning the idea that she could leave him alone with the Influence of the Forest all about him to have its unimpeded way she felt the pangs of that subtle jealousy bite keen and close 
4744_31668_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He loved the Forest better than herself for he placed it first 
4744_31668_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Behind the words moreover hid the unuttered thought that made her so uneasy 
4744_31668_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The terror Sanderson had brought revived and shook its wings before her very eyes For the whole conversation of which this was a fragment conveyed the unutterable implication that while he could not spare the trees they equally could not spare him 
4744_31668_000023_000004	train-clean-360	The vividness with which he managed to conceal and yet betray the fact brought a profound distress that crossed the border between presentiment and warning into positive alarm 
none	none	He clearly felt that the trees would miss him the trees he tended guarded watched over loved David I shall stay here with you 
4744_31668_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I think you need me really don t you Eagerly with a touch of heart felt passion the words poured out 
4744_31668_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Now more than ever dear 
4744_31668_000026_000001	train-clean-360	God bless you for you sweet unselfishness And your sacrifice he added is all the greater because you cannot understand the thing that makes it necessary for me to stay 
4744_31668_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps in the spring instead she said with a tremor in the voice 
4744_31668_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 In the spring perhaps he answered gently almost beneath his breath For they will not need me then 
4744_31668_000028_000001	train-clean-360	All the world can love them in the spring 
none	none	It s in the winter that they re lonely and neglected 
4744_31668_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I wish to stay with them particularly then 
4744_31668_000028_000004	train-clean-360	I even feel I ought to and I must 
4744_31668_000029_000000	train-clean-360	And in this way without further speech the decision was made 
4744_31668_000029_000001	train-clean-360	missus Bittacy at least asked no more questions 
none	none	Yet she could not bring herself to show more sympathy than was necessary She felt for one thing that if she did it might lead him to speak freely and to tell her things she could not possibly bear to know And she dared not take the risk of that VII This was at the end of summer but the autumn followed close The conversation really marked the threshold between the two seasons and marked at the same time the line between her husband s negative and aggressive state She almost felt she had done wrong to yield he grew so bold concealment all discarded He went that is quite openly to the woods forgetting all his duties all his former occupations He even sought to coax her to go with him The hidden thing blazed out without disguise And while she trembled at his energy she admired the virile passion he displayed Her jealousy had long ago retired before her fear accepting the second place Her one desire now was to protect The wife turned wholly mother He said so little but he hated to come in From morning to night he wandered in the Forest often he went out after dinner his mind was charged with trees their foliage growth development their wonder beauty strength their loneliness in isolation their power in a herded mass He knew the effect of every wind upon them the danger from the boisterous north the glory from the west the eastern dryness and the soft moist tenderness that a south wind left upon their thinning boughs He spoke all day of their sensations how they drank the fading sunshine dreamed in the moonlight thrilled to the kiss of stars The dew could bring them half the passion of the night but frost sent them plunging beneath the ground to dwell with hopes of a later coming softness in their roots They nursed the life they carried insects larvae chrysalis and when the skies above them melted he spoke of them standing motionless in an ecstasy of rain or in the noon of sunshine self poised upon their prodigy of shade And once in the middle of the night she woke at the sound of his voice and heard him wide awake not talking in his sleep but talking towards the window where the shadow of the cedar fell at noon O art thou sighing for Lebanon In the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East Sighing for Lebanon Dark cedar and when half charmed half terrified she turned and called to him by name he merely said My dear I felt the loneliness suddenly realized it the alien desolation of that tree set here upon our little lawn in England when all her Eastern brothers call her in sleep And the answer seemed so queer so un evangelical that she waited in silence till he slept again The poetry passed her by It seemed unnecessary and out of place It made her ache with suspicion fear jealousy The fear however seemed somehow all lapped up and banished soon afterwards by her unwilling admiration of the rushing splendor of her husband s state Her anxiety at any rate shifted from the religious to the medical She thought he might be losing his steadiness of mind a little How often in her prayers she offered thanks for the guidance that had made her stay with him to help and watch is impossible to say It certainly was twice a day She even went so far once when mister Mortimer the vicar called and brought with him a more or less distinguished doctor as to tell the professional man privately some symptoms of her husband s queerness And his answer that there was nothing he could prescribe for added not a little to her sense of unholy bewilderment No doubt Sir James had never been consulted under such unorthodox conditions before His sense of what was becoming naturally overrode his acquired instincts as a skilled instrument that might help the race No fever you think she asked insistently with hurry determined to get something from him Nothing that I can deal with as I told you Madam replied the offended allopathic Knight Evidently he did not care about being invited to examine patients in this surreptitious way before a teapot on the lawn chance of a fee most problematical He liked to see a tongue and feel a thumping pulse to know the pedigree and bank account of his questioner as well It was most unusual in abominable taste besides Of course it was But the drowning woman seized the only straw she could For now the aggressive attitude of her husband overcame her to the point where she found it difficult even to question him Yet in the house he was so kind and gentle doing all he could to make her sacrifice as easy as possible David you really are unwise to go out now The night is damp and very chilly The ground is soaked in dew You ll catch your death of cold His face lightened Won t you come with me dear just for once I m only going to the corner of the hollies to see the beech that stands so lonely by itself She had been out with him in the short dark afternoon and they had passed that evil group of hollies where the gypsies camped Nothing else would grow there but the hollies thrive upon the stony soil David the beech is all right and safe She had learned his phraseology a little made clever out of due season by her love There s no wind to night But it s rising he answered rising in the east I heard it in the bare and hungry larches They need the sun and dew and always cry out when the wind s upon them from the east She sent a short unspoken prayer most swiftly to her deity as she heard him say it For every time now when he spoke in this familiar intimate way of the life of the trees she felt a sheet of cold fasten tight against her very skin and flesh She shivered How could he possibly know such things Yet in all else and in the relations of his daily life he was sane and reasonable loving kind and tender It was only on the subject of the trees he seemed unhinged and queer Most curiously it seemed that since the collapse of the cedar they both loved though in different fashion his departure from the normal had increased Why else did he watch them as a man might watch a sickly child Why did he hunger especially in the dusk to catch their mood of night as he called it Why think so carefully upon them when the frost was threatening or the wind appeared to rise As she put it so frequently now herself How could he possibly know such things He went As she closed the front door after him she heard the distant roaring in the Forest And then it suddenly struck her How could she know them too It dropped upon her like a blow that she felt at once all over upon body heart and mind The discovery rushed out from its ambush to overwhelm The truth of it making all arguing futile numbed her faculties But though at first it deadened her she soon revived and her being rose into aggressive opposition A wild yet calculated courage like that which animates the leaders of splendid forlorn hopes flamed in her little person flamed grandly and invincible While knowing herself insignificant and weak she knew at the same time that power at her back which moves the worlds The faith that filled her was the weapon in her hands and the right by which she claimed it but the spirit of utter selfless sacrifice that characterized her life was the means by which she mastered its immediate use For a kind of white and faultless intuition guided her to the attack Behind her stood her Bible and her God How so magnificent a divination came to her at all may well be a matter for astonishment though some clue of explanation lies perhaps in the very simpleness of her nature At any rate she saw quite clearly certain things saw them in moments only after prayer in the still silence of the night or when left alone those long hours in the house with her knitting and her thoughts and the guidance which then flashed into her remained even after the manner of its coming was forgotten They came to her these things she saw formless wordless she could not put them into any kind of language but by the very fact of being uncaught in sentences they retained their original clear vigor Hours of patient waiting brought the first and the others followed easily afterwards by degrees on subsequent days a little and a little Her husband had been gone since early morning and had taken his luncheon with him She was sitting by the tea things the cups and teapot warmed the muffins in the fender keeping hot all ready for his return when she realized quite abruptly that this thing which took him off which kept him out so many hours day after day this thing that was against her own little will and instincts was enormous as the sea It was no mere prettiness of single Trees but something massed and mountainous About her rose the wall of its huge opposition to the sky its scale gigantic its power utterly prodigious What she knew of it hitherto as green and delicate forms waving and rustling in the winds was but as it were the spray of foam that broke into sight upon the nearer edge of viewless depths far far away The trees indeed were sentinels set visibly about the limits of a camp that itself remained invisible The awful hum and murmur of the main body in the distance passed into that still room about her with the firelight and hissing kettle Out yonder in the Forest further out the thing that was ever roaring at the center was dreadfully increasing The sense of definite battle too battle between herself and the Forest for his soul came with it Its presentiment was as clear as though Thompson had come into the room and quietly told her that the cottage was surrounded Please ma am there are trees come up about the house she might have suddenly announced And equally might have heard her own answer It s all right Thompson The main body is still far away Immediately upon its heels then came another truth with a close reality that shocked her She saw that jealousy was not confined to the human and animal world alone but ran though all creation The Vegetable Kingdom knew it too So called inanimate nature shared it with the rest Trees felt it This Forest just beyond the window standing there in the silence of the autumn evening across the little lawn this Forest understood it equally The remorseless branching power that sought to keep exclusively for itself the thing it loved and needed spread like a running desire through all its million leaves and stems and roots In humans of course it was consciously directed in animals it acted with frank instinctiveness but in trees this jealousy rose in some blind tide of impersonal and unconscious wrath that would sweep opposition from its path as the wind sweeps powdered snow from the surface of the ice Their number was a host with endless reinforcements and once it realized its passion was returned the power increased Her husband loved the trees They had become aware of it They would take him from her in the end Then while she heard his footsteps in the hall and the closing of the front door she saw a third thing clearly realized the widening of the gap between herself and him This other love had made it All these weeks of the summer when she felt so close to him now especially when she had made the biggest sacrifice of her life to stay by his side and help him he had been slowly surely drawing away The estrangement was here and now a fact accomplished It had been all this time maturing there yawned this broad deep space between them Across the empty distance she saw the change in merciless perspective It revealed his face and figure dearly loved once fondly worshipped far on the other side in shadowy distance small the back turned from her and moving while she watched moving away from her They had their tea in silence then She asked no questions he volunteered no information of his day The heart was big within her and the terrible loneliness of age spread through her like a rising icy mist She watched him filling all his wants His hair was untidy and his boots were caked with blackish mud He moved with a restless swaying motion that somehow blanched her cheek and sent a miserable shivering down her back It reminded her of trees His eyes were very bright He brought in with him an odor of the earth and forest that seemed to choke her and make it difficult to breathe and what she noticed with a climax of almost uncontrollable alarm upon his face beneath the lamplight shone traces of a mild faint glory that made her think of moonlight falling upon a wood through speckled shadows It was his new found happiness that shone there a happiness uncaused by her and in which she had no part In his coat was a spray of faded yellow beech leaves I brought this from the Forest to you he said with all the air that belonged to his little acts of devotion long ago And she took the spray of leaves mechanically with a smile and a murmured thank you dear as though he had unknowingly put into her hands the weapon for her own destruction and she had accepted it And when the tea was over and he left the room he did not go to his study or to change his clothes She heard the front door softly shut behind him as he again went out towards the Forest A moment later she was in her room upstairs kneeling beside the bed the side she slept on and praying wildly through a flood of tears that God would save and keep him to her Wind brushed the window panes behind her while she knelt VIII One sunny November morning when the strain had reached a pitch that made repression almost unmanageable she came to an impulsive decision and obeyed it Her husband had again gone out with luncheon for the day She took adventure in her hands and followed him The power of seeing clear was strong upon her forcing her up to some unnatural level of understanding To stay indoors and wait inactive for his return seemed suddenly impossible She meant to know what he knew feel what he felt put herself in his place She would dare the fascination of the Forest share it with him It was greatly daring but it would give her greater understanding how to help and save him and therefore greater Power She went upstairs a moment first to pray In a thick warm skirt and wearing heavy boots those walking boots she used with him upon the mountains about Seillans she left the cottage by the back way and turned towards the Forest She could not actually follow him for he had started off an hour before and she knew not exactly his direction What was so urgent in her was the wish to be with him in the woods to walk beneath leafless branches just as he did to be there when he was there even though not together For it had come to her that she might thus share with him for once this horrible mighty life and breathing of the trees he loved In winter he had said they needed him particularly and winter now was coming Her love must bring her something of what he felt himself the huge attraction the suction and the pull of all the trees Thus in some vicarious fashion she might share though unknown to himself this very thing that was taking him away from her She might thus even lessen its attack upon himself The impulse came to her clairvoyantly and she obeyed without a sign of hesitation Deeper comprehension would come to her of the whole awful puzzle And come it did yet not in the way she imagined and expected The air was very still the sky a cold pale blue but cloudless The entire Forest stood silent at attention It knew perfectly well that she had come It knew the moment when she entered watched and followed her and behind her something dropped without a sound and shut her in Her feet upon the glades of mossy grass fell silently as the oaks and beeches shifted past in rows and took up their positions at her back It was not pleasant this way they grew so dense behind her the instant she had passed She realized that they gathered in an ever growing army massed herded trooped between her and the cottage shutting off escape They let her pass so easily but to get out again she would know them differently thick crowded branches all drawn and hostile Already their increasing numbers bewildered her In front they looked so sparse and scattered with open spaces where the sunshine fell but when she turned it seemed they stood so close together a serried army darkening the sunlight They blocked the day collected all the shadows stood with their leafless and forbidding rampart like the night They swallowed down into themselves the very glade by which she came For when she glanced behind her rarely the way she had come was shadowy and lost Yet the morning sparkled overhead and a glance of excitement ran quivering through the entire day It was what she always knew as children s weather so clear and harmless without a sign of danger nothing ominous to threaten or alarm Steadfast in her purpose looking back as little as she dared Sophia Bittacy marched slowly and deliberately into the heart of the silent woods deeper ever deeper And then abruptly in an open space where the sunshine fell unhindered she stopped It was one of the breathing places of the forest Dead withered bracken lay in patches of unsightly grey There were bits of heather too All round the trees stood looking on oak beech holly ash pine larch with here and there small groups of juniper On the lips of this breathing space of the woods she stopped to rest disobeying her instinct for the first time For the other instinct in her was to go on She did not really want to rest This was the little act that brought it to her the wireless message from a vast Emitter I ve been stopped she thought to herself with a horrid qualm She looked about her in this quiet ancient place Nothing stirred There was no life nor sign of life no birds sang no rabbits scuttled off at her approach The stillness was bewildering and gravity hung down upon it like a heavy curtain It hushed the heart in her Could this be part of what her husband felt this sense of thick entanglement with stems boughs roots and foliage This has always been as it is now she thought yet not knowing why she thought it Ever since the Forest grew it has been still and secret here It has never changed The curtain of silence drew closer while she said it thickening round her For a thousand years I m here with a thousand years And behind this place stand all the forests of the world So foreign to her temperament were such thoughts and so alien to all she had been taught to look for in Nature that she strove against them She made an effort to oppose But they clung and haunted just the same they refused to be dispersed The curtain hung dense and heavy as though its texture thickened The air with difficulty came through And then she thought that curtain stirred There was movement somewhere That obscure dim thing which ever broods behind the visible appearances of trees came nearer to her She caught her breath and stared about her listening intently The trees perhaps because she saw them more in detail now it seemed to her had changed A vague faint alteration spread over them at first so slight she scarcely would admit it then growing steadily though still obscurely outwards They tremble and are changed flashed through her mind the horrid line that Sanderson had quoted Yet the change was graceful for all the uncouthness attendant upon the size of so vast a movement They had turned in her direction That was it They saw her In this way the change expressed itself in her groping terrified thought Till now it had been otherwise she had looked at them from her own point of view now they looked at her from theirs They stared her in the face and eyes they stared at her all over In some unkind resentful hostile way they watched her Hitherto in life she had watched them variously in superficial ways reading into them what her own mind suggested Now they read into her the things they actually were and not merely another s interpretations of them They seemed in their motionless silence there instinct with life a life moreover that breathed about her a species of terrible soft enchantment that bewitched It branched all through her climbing to the brain The Forest held her with its huge and giant fascination In this secluded breathing spot that the centuries had left untouched she had stepped close against the hidden pulse of the whole collective mass of them They were aware of her and had turned to gaze with their myriad vast sight upon the intruder They shouted at her in the silence For she wanted to look back at them but it was like staring at a crowd and her glance merely shifted from one tree to another hurriedly finding in none the one she sought They saw her so easily each and all The rows that stood behind her also stared But she could not return the gaze Her husband she realized could And their steady stare shocked her as though in some sense she knew that she was naked They saw so much of her she saw of them so little Her efforts to return their gaze were pitiful The constant shifting increased her bewilderment Conscious of this awful and enormous sight all over her she let her eyes first rest upon the ground and then she closed them altogether She kept the lids as tight together as ever they would go But the sight of the trees came even into that inner darkness behind the fastened lids for there was no escaping it Outside in the light she still knew that the leaves of the hollies glittered smoothly that the dead foliage of the oaks hung crisp in the air about her that the needles of the little junipers were pointing all one way The spread perception of the Forest was focused on herself and no mere shutting of the eyes could hide its scattered yet concentrated stare the all inclusive vision of great woods There was no wind yet here and there a single leaf hanging by its dried up stalk shook all alone with great rapidity rattling It was the sentry drawing attention to her presence And then again as once long weeks before she felt their Being as a tide about her The tide had turned That memory of her childhood sands came back when the nurse said The tide has turned now we must go in and she saw the mass of piled up waters green and heaped to the horizon and realized that it was slowly coming in The gigantic mass of it too vast for hurry loaded with massive purpose she used to feel was moving towards herself The fluid body of the sea was creeping along beneath the sky to the very spot upon the yellow sands where she stood and played The sight and thought of it had always overwhelmed her with a sense of awe as though her puny self were the object of the whole sea s advance The tide has turned we had better now go in This was happening now about her the same thing was happening in the woods slow sure and steady and its motion as little discernible as the sea s The tide had turned The small human presence that had ventured among its green and mountainous depths moreover was its objective That all was clear within her while she sat and waited with tight shut lids But the next moment she opened her eyes with a sudden realization of something more The presence that it sought was after all not hers It was the presence of some one other than herself And then she understood Her eyes had opened with a click it seemed but the sound in reality was outside herself Across the clearing where the sunshine lay so calm and still she saw the figure of her husband moving among the trees a man like a tree walking With hands behind his back and head uplifted he moved quite slowly as though absorbed in his own thoughts Hardly fifty paces separated them but he had no inkling of her presence there so near With mind intent and senses all turned inwards he marched past her like a figure in a dream and like a figure in a dream she saw him go Love yearning pity rose in a storm within her but as in nightmare she found no words or movement possible She sat and watched him go go from her go into the deeper reaches of the green enveloping woods Desire to save to bid him stop and turn ran in a passion through her being but there was nothing she could do She saw him go away from her go of his own accord and willingly beyond her she saw the branches drop about his steps and hid him His figure faded out among the speckled shade and sunlight The trees covered him The tide just took him all unresisting and content to go Upon the bosom of the green soft sea he floated away beyond her reach of vision Her eyes could follow him no longer He was gone And then for the first time she realized even at that distance that the look upon his face was one of peace and happiness rapt and caught away in joy a look of youth That expression now he never showed to her But she had known it Years ago in the early days of their married life she had seen it on his face Now it no longer obeyed the summons of her presence and her love The woods alone could call it forth it answered to the trees the Forest had taken every part of him from her his very heart and soul Her sight that had plunged inwards to the fields of faded memory now came back to outer things again She looked about her and her love returning empty handed and unsatisfied left her open to the invading of the bleakest terror she had ever known That such things could be real and happen found her helpless utterly Terror invaded the quietest corners of her heart that had never yet known quailing She could not for moments at any rate reach either her Bible or her God Desolate in an empty world of fear she sat with eyes too dry and hot for tears yet with a coldness as of ice upon her very flesh She stared unseeing about her That horror which stalks in the stillness of the noonday when the glare of an artificial sunshine lights up the motionless trees moved all about her In front and behind she was aware of it Beyond this stealthy silence just within the edge of it the things of another world were passing But she could not know them Her husband knew them knew their beauty and their awe yes but for her they were out of reach She might not share with him the very least of them It seemed that behind and through the glare of this wintry noonday in the heart of the woods there brooded another universe of life and passion for her all unexpressed The silence veiled it the stillness hid it but he moved with it all and understood His love interpreted it She rose to her feet tottered feebly and collapsed again upon the moss Yet for herself she felt no terror no little personal fear could touch her whose anguish and deep longing streamed all out to him whom she so bravely loved In this time of utter self forgetfulness when she realized that the battle was hopeless thinking she had lost even her God she found Him again quite close beside her like a little Presence in this terrible heart of the hostile Forest But at first she did not recognize that He was there she did not know Him in that strangely unacceptable guise For He stood so very close so very intimate so very sweet and comforting and yet so hard to understand as Resignation Once more she struggled to her feet and this time turned successfully and slowly made her way along the mossy glade by which she came And at first she marveled though only for a moment at the ease with which she found the path For a moment only because almost at once she saw the truth The trees were glad that she should go They helped her on her way The Forest did not want her The tide was coming in indeed yet not for her And so in another of those flashes of clear vision that of late had lifted life above the normal level she saw and understood the whole terrible thing complete Till now though unexpressed in thought or language her fear had been that the woods her husband loved would somehow take him from her to merge his life in theirs even to kill him on some mysterious way This time she saw her deep mistake and so seeing let in upon herself the fuller agony of horror For their jealousy was not the petty jealousy of animals or humans They wanted him because they loved him but they did not want him dead Full charged with his splendid life and enthusiasm they wanted him They wanted him alive It was she who stood in their way and it was she whom they intended to remove This was what brought the sense of abject helplessness She stood upon the sands against an entire ocean slowly rolling in against her For as all the forces of a human being combine unconsciously to eject a grain of sand that has crept beneath the skin to cause discomfort so the entire mass of what Sanderson had called the Collective Consciousness of the Forest strove to eject this human atom that stood across the path of its desire Loving her husband she had crept beneath its skin It was her they would eject and take away it was her they would destroy not him Him whom they loved and needed they would keep alive They meant to take him living She reached the house in safety though she never remembered how she found her way It was made all simple for her The branches almost urged her out But behind her as she left the shadowed precincts she felt as though some towering Angel of the Woods let fall across the threshold the flaming sword of a countless multitude of leaves that formed behind her a barrier green shimmering and impassable Into the Forest she never walked again And she went about her daily duties with a calm and quietness that was a perpetual astonishment even to herself for it hardly seemed of this world at all She talked to her husband when he came in for tea after dark Resignation brings a curious large courage when there is nothing more to lose The soul takes risks and dares Is it a curious short cut sometimes to the heights David I went into the Forest too this morning soon after you I went I saw you there Wasn t it wonderful he answered simply inclining his head a little There was no surprise or annoyance in his look a mild and gentle ennui rather He asked no real question She thought of some garden tree the wind attacks too suddenly bending it over when it does not want to bend the mild unwillingness with which it yields She often saw him this way now in the terms of trees It was very wonderful indeed dear yes she replied low her voice not faltering though indistinct But for me it was too too strange and big The passion of tears lay just below the quiet voice all unbetrayed Somehow she kept them back There was a pause and then he added I find it more and more so every day His voice passed through the lamp lit room like a murmur of the wind in branches The look of youth and happiness she had caught upon his face out there had wholly gone and an expression of weariness was in its place as of a man distressed vaguely at finding himself in uncongenial surroundings where he is slightly ill at ease It was the house he hated coming back to rooms and walls and furniture The ceilings and closed windows confined him Yet in it no suggestion that he found her irksome Her presence seemed of no account at all indeed he hardly noticed her For whole long periods he lost her did not know that she was there He had no need of her He lived alone Each lived alone The outward signs by which she recognized that the awful battle was against her and the terms of surrender accepted were pathetic She put the medicine chest away upon the shelf she gave the orders for his pocket luncheon before he asked she went to bed alone and early leaving the front door unlocked with milk and bread and butter in the hall beside the lamp all concessions that she felt impelled to make Fore more and more unless the weather was too violent he went out after dinner even staying for hours in the woods But she never slept until she heard the front door close below and knew soon afterwards his careful step come creeping up the stairs and into the room so softly Until she heard his regular deep breathing close beside her she lay awake All strength or desire to resist had gone for good The thing against her was too huge and powerful Capitulation was complete a fact accomplished She dated it from the day she followed him to the Forest Moreover the time for evacuation her own evacuation seemed approaching It came stealthily ever nearer surely and slowly as the rising tide she used to dread At the high water mark she stood waiting calmly waiting to be swept away Across the lawn all those terrible days of early winter the encircling Forest watched it come guiding its silent swell and currents towards her feet Only she never once gave up her Bible or her praying This complete resignation moreover had somehow brought to her a strange great understanding and if she could not share her husband s horrible abandonment to powers outside himself she could and did in some half groping way grasp at shadowy meanings that might make such abandonment possible yes but more than merely possible in some extraordinary sense not evil Hitherto she had divided the beyond world into two sharp halves spirits good or spirits evil But thoughts came to her now on soft and very tentative feet like the footsteps of the gods which are on wool that besides these definite classes there might be other Powers as well belonging definitely to neither one nor other Her thought stopped dead at that But the big idea found lodgment in her little mind and owing to the largeness of her heart remained there unejected It even brought a certain solace with it The failure or unwillingness as she preferred to state it of her God to interfere and help that also she came in a measure to understand For here she found it more and more possible to imagine was perhaps no positive evil at work but only something that usually stands away from humankind something alien and not commonly recognized There was a gulf fixed between the two and mister Sanderson had bridged it by his talk his explanations his attitude of mind Through these her husband had found the way into it His temperament and natural passion for the woods had prepared the soul in him and the moment he saw the way to go he took it the line of least resistance Life was of course open to all and her husband had the right to choose it where he would He had chosen it away from her away from other men but not necessarily away from God This was an enormous concession that she skirted never really faced it was too revolutionary to face But its possibility peeped into her bewildered mind It might delay his progress or it might advance it Who could know And why should God who ordered all things with such magnificent detail from the pathway of a sun to the falling of a sparrow object to his free choice or interfere to hinder him and stop She came to realize resignation that is in another aspect It gave her comfort if not peace She fought against all belittling of her God It was perhaps enough that He knew You are not alone dear in the trees out there she ventured one night as he crept on tiptoe into the room not far from midnight God is with you Magnificently was the immediate answer given with enthusiasm for He is everywhere And I only wish that you But she stuffed the clothes against her ears That invitation on his lips was more than she could bear to hear It seemed like asking her to hurry to her own execution She buried her face among the sheets and blankets shaking all over like a leaf IX And so the thought that she was the one to go remained and grew It was perhaps first sign of that weakening of the mind which indicated the singular manner of her going For it was her mental opposition the trees felt that stood in their way Once that was overcome obliterated her physical presence did not matter She would be harmless Having accepted defeat because she had come to feel that his obsession was not actually evil she accepted at the same time the conditions of an atrocious loneliness She stood now from her husband farther than from the moon They had no visitors Callers were few and far between and less encouraged than before The empty dark of winter was before them Among the neighbors was none in whom without disloyalty to her husband she could confide mister Mortimer had he been single might have helped her in this desert of solitude that preyed upon her mind but his wife was there the obstacle for missus Mortimer wore sandals believed that nuts were the complete food of man and indulged in other idiosyncrasies that classed her inevitably among the latter signs which missus Bittacy had been taught to dread as dangerous She stood most desolately alone Solitude therefore in which the mind unhindered feeds upon its own delusions was the assignable cause of her gradual mental disruption and collapse With the definite arrival of the colder weather her husband gave up his rambles after dark evenings were spent together over the fire he read The Times they even talked about their postponed visit abroad in the coming spring No restlessness was on him at the change he seemed content and easy in his mind spoke little of the trees and woods enjoyed far better health than if there had been change of scene and to herself was tender kind solicitous over trifles as in the distant days of their first honeymoon But this deep calm could not deceive her it meant she fully understood that he felt sure of himself sure of her and sure of the trees as well It all lay buried in the depths of him too secure and deep too intimately established in his central being to permit of those surface fluctuations which betray disharmony within His life was hid with trees Even the fever so dreaded in the damp of winter left him free She now knew why the fever was due to their efforts to obtain him his efforts to respond and go physical results of a fierce unrest he had never understood till Sanderson came with his wicked explanations Now it was otherwise The bridge was made And he had gone And she brave loyal and consistent soul found herself utterly alone even trying to make his passage easy It seemed that she stood at the bottom of some huge ravine that opened in her mind the walls whereof instead of rock were trees that reached enormous to the sky engulfing her God alone knew that she was there He watched permitted even perhaps approved At any rate He knew During those quiet evenings in the house moreover while they sat over the fire listening to the roaming winds about the house her husband knew continual access to the world his alien love had furnished for him Never for a single instant was he cut off from it She gazed at the newspaper spread before his face and knees saw the smoke of his cheroot curl up above the edge noticed the little hole in his evening socks and listened to the paragraphs he read aloud as of old But this was all a veil he spread about himself of purpose Behind it he escaped It was the conjurer s trick to divert the sight to unimportant details while the essential thing went forward unobserved He managed wonderfully she loved him for the pains he took to spare her distress but all the while she knew that the body lolling in that armchair before her eyes contained the merest fragment of his actual self It was little better than a corpse It was an empty shell The essential soul of him was out yonder with the Forest farther out near that ever roaring heart of it And with the dark the Forest came up boldly and pressed against the very walls and windows peering in upon them joining hands above the slates and chimneys The winds were always walking on the lawn and gravel paths steps came and went and came again some one seemed always talking in the woods some one was in the building too She passed them on the stairs or running soft and muffled very large and gentle down the passages and landings after dusk as though loose fragments of the Day had broken off and stayed there caught among the shadows trying to get out They blundered silently all about the house They waited till she passed then made a run for it And her husband always knew She saw him more than once deliberately avoid them because she was there More than once too she saw him stand and listen when he thought she was not near then heard herself the long bounding stride of their approach across the silent garden Already he had heard them in the windy distance of the night far far away They sped she well knew along that glade of mossy turf by which she last came out it cushioned their tread exactly as it had cushioned her own It seemed to her the trees were always in the house with him and in their very bedroom He welcomed them unaware that she also knew and trembled One night in their bedroom it caught her unawares She woke out of deep sleep and it came upon her before she could gather her forces for control The day had been wildly boisterous but now the wind had dropped only its rags went fluttering through the night The rays of the full moon fell in a shower between the branches Overhead still raced the scud and wrack shaped like hurrying monsters but below the earth was quiet Still and dripping stood the hosts of trees Their trunks gleamed wet and sparkling where the moon caught them There was a strong smell of mould and fallen leaves The air was sharp heavy with odor And she knew all this the instant that she woke for it seemed to her that she had been elsewhere following her husband as though she had been out There was no dream at all merely the definite haunting certainty It dived away lost buried in the night She sat upright in bed She had come back The room shone pale in the moonlight reflected through the windows for the blinds were up and she saw her husband s form beside her motionless in deep sleep But what caught her unawares was the horrid thing that by this fact of sudden unexpected waking she had surprised these other things in the room beside the very bed gathered close about him while he slept It was their dreadful boldness herself of no account as it were that terrified her into screaming before she could collect her powers to prevent She screamed before she realized what she did a long high shriek of terror that filled the room yet made so little actual sound For wet and shimmering presences stood grouped all round that bed She saw their outline underneath the ceiling the green spread bulk of them their vague extension over walls and furniture They shifted to and fro massed yet translucent mild yet thick moving and turning within themselves to a hushed noise of multitudinous soft rustling In their sound was something very sweet and sinning that fell into her with a spell of horrible enchantment They were so mild each one alone yet so terrific in their combination Cold seized her The sheets against her body had turned to ice She screamed a second time though the sound hardly issued from her throat The spell sank deeper reaching to the heart for it softened all the currents of her blood and took life from her in a stream towards themselves Resistance in that moment seemed impossible Her husband then stirred in his sleep and woke And instantly the forms drew up erect and gathered themselves in some amazing way together They lessened in extent then scattered through the air like an effect of light when shadows seek to smother it It was tremendous yet most exquisite A sheet of pale green shadow that yet had form and substance filled the room There was a rush of silent movement as the Presences drew past her through the air and they were gone But clearest of all she saw the manner of their going for she recognized in their tumult of escape by the window open at the top the same wide looping circles spirals as it seemed that she had seen upon the lawn those weeks ago when Sanderson had talked The room once more was empty In the collapse that followed she heard her husband s voice as though coming from some great distance Her own replies she heard as well Both were so strange and unlike their normal speech the very words unnatural What is it dear Why do you wake me now And his voice whispered it with a sighing sound like wind in pine boughs A moment since something went past me through the air of the room Back to the night outside it went Her voice too held the same note as of wind entangled among too many leaves My dear it was the wind But it called David It was calling you by name The air of the branches dear was what you heard Now sleep again I beg you sleep It had a crowd of eyes all through and over it before and behind Her voice grew louder But his own in reply sank lower far away and oddly hushed The moonlight dear upon the sea of twigs and boughs in the rain was what you saw But it frightened me I ve lost my God and you I m cold as death My dear it is the cold of the early morning hours The whole world sleeps Now sleep again yourself He whispered close to her ear She felt his hand stroking her His voice was soft and very soothing But only a part of him was there only a part of him was speaking it was a half emptied body that lay beside her and uttered these strange sentences even forcing her own singular choice of words The horrible dim enchantment of the trees was close about them in the room gnarled ancient lonely trees of winter whispering round the human life they loved And let me sleep again she heard him murmur as he settled down among the clothes sleep back into that deep delicious peace from which you called me His dreamy happy tone and that look of youth and joy she discerned upon his features even in the filtered moonlight touched her again as with the spell of those shining mild green presences It sank down into her She felt sleep grope for her On the threshold of slumber one of those strange vagrant voices that loss of consciousness lets loose cried faintly in her heart There is joy in the Forest over one sinner that Then sleep took her before she had time to realize even that she was vilely parodying one of her most precious texts and that the irreverence was ghastly And though she quickly slept again her sleep was not as usual dreamless It was not woods and trees she dreamed of but a small and curious dream that kept coming again and again upon her that she stood upon a wee bare rock I the sea and that the tide was rising The water first came to her feet then to her knees then to her waist Each time the dream returned the tide seemed higher Once it rose to her neck once even to her mouth covering her lips for a moment so that she could not breathe She did not wake between the dreams a period of drab and dreamless slumber intervened But finally the water rose above her eyes and face completely covering her head And then came explanation the sort of explanation dreams bring She understood For beneath the water she had seen the world of seaweed rising from the bottom of the sea like a forest of dense green long sinuous stems immense thick branches millions of feelers spreading through the darkened watery depths the power of their ocean foliage The Vegetable Kingdom was even in the sea It was everywhere Earth air and water helped it way of escape there was none And even underneath the sea she heard that terrible sound of roaring was it surf or wind or voices further out yet coming steadily towards her And so in the loneliness of that drab English winter the mind of missus Bittacy preying upon itself and fed by constant dread went lost in disproportion Dreariness filled the weeks with dismal sunless skies and a clinging moisture that knew no wholesome tonic of keen frosts Alone with her thoughts both her husband and her God withdrawn into distance she counted the days to Spring She groped her way stumbling down the long dark tunnel Through the arch at the far end lay a brilliant picture of the violet sea sparkling on the coast of France There lay safety and escape for both of them could she but hold on Behind her the trees blocked up the other entrance She never once looked back She drooped Vitality passed from her drawn out and away as by some steady suction Immense and incessant was this sensation of her powers draining off The taps were all turned on Her personality as it were streamed steadily away coaxed outwards by this Power that never wearied and seemed inexhaustible It won her as the full moon wins the tide She waned she faded she obeyed At first she watched the process and recognized exactly what was going on Her physical life and that balance of mind which depends on physical well being were being slowly undermined She saw that clearly Only the soul dwelling like a star apart from these and independent of them lay safe somewhere with her distant God That she knew tranquilly The spiritual love that linked her to her husband was safe from all attack Later in His good time they would merge together again because of it But meanwhile all of her that had kinship with the earth was slowly going This separation was being remorselessly accomplished Every part of her the trees could touch was being steadily drained from her She was being removed After a time however even this power of realization went so that she no longer watched the process or knew exactly what was going on The one satisfaction she had known the feeling that it was sweet to suffer for his sake went with it She stood utterly alone with this terror of the trees mid the ruins of her broken and disordered mind She slept badly woke in the morning with hot and tired eyes her head ached dully she grew confused in thought and lost the clues of daily life in the most feeble fashion At the same time she lost sight too of that brilliant picture at the exist of the tunnel it faded away into a tiny semicircle of pale light the violet sea and the sunshine the merest point of white remote as a star and equally inaccessible She knew now that she could never reach it And through the darkness that stretched behind the power of the trees came close and caught her twining about her feet and arms climbing to her very lips She woke at night finding it difficult to breathe There seemed wet leaves pressing against her mouth and soft green tendrils clinging to her neck Her feet were heavy half rooted as it were in deep thick earth Huge creepers stretched along the whole of that black tunnel feeling about her person for points where they might fasten well as ivy or the giant parasites of the Vegetable Kingdom settle down on the trees themselves to sap their life and kill them Slowly and surely the morbid growth possessed her life and held her She feared those very winds that ran about the wintry forest They were in league with it They helped it everywhere Why don t you sleep dear It was her husband now who played the role of nurse tending her little wants with an honest care that at least aped the services of love He was so utterly unconscious of the raging battle he had caused What is it keeps you so wide awake and restless The winds she whispered in the dark For hours she had been watching the tossing of the trees through the blindless windows They go walking and talking everywhere to night keeping me awake And all the time they call so loudly to you And his strange whispered answer appalled her for a moment until the meaning of it faded and left her in a dark confusion of the mind that was now becoming almost permanent The trees excite them in the night The winds are the great swift carriers Go with them dear and not against You ll find sleep that way if you do The storm is rising she began hardly knowing what she said All the more then go with them Don t resist They ll take you to the trees that s all Resist The word touched on the button of some text that once had helped her Resist the devil and he will flee from you she heard her whispered answer and the same second had buried her face beneath the clothes in a flood of hysterical weeping But her husband did not seem disturbed Perhaps he did not hear it for the wind ran just then against the windows with a booming shout and the roaring of the Forest farther out came behind the blow surging into the room Perhaps too he was already asleep again She slowly regained a sort of dull composure Her face emerged from the tangle of sheets and blankets With a growing terror over her she listened The storm was rising It came with a sudden and impetuous rush that made all further sleep for her impossible Alone in a shaking world it seemed she lay and listened That storm interpreted for her mind the climax The Forest bellowed out its victory to the winds the winds in turn proclaimed it to the Night The whole world knew of her complete defeat her loss her little human pain This was the roar and shout of victory that she listened to For unmistakably the trees were shouting in the dark These were sounds too like the flapping of great sails a thousand at a time and sometimes reports that resembled more than anything else the distant booming of enormous drums The trees stood up the whole beleaguering host of them stood up and with the uproar of their million branches drummed the thundering message out across the night It seemed as if they had all broken loose Their roots swept trailing over field and hedge and roof They tossed their bushy heads beneath the clouds with a wild delighted shuffling of great boughs With trunks upright they raced leaping through the sky There was upheaval and adventure in the awful sound they made and their cry was like the cry of a sea that has broken through its gates and poured loose upon the world Through it all her husband slept peacefully as though he heard it not It was as she well knew the sleep of the semi dead For he was out with all that clamoring turmoil The part of him that she had lost was there The form that slept so calmly at her side was but the shell half emptied And when the winter s morning stole upon the scene at length with a pale washed sunshine that followed the departing tempest the first thing she saw as she crept to the window and looked out was the ruined cedar lying on the lawn Only the gaunt and crippled trunk of it remained The single giant bough that had been left to it lay dark upon the grass sucked endways towards the Forest by a great wind eddy It lay there like a mass of drift wood from a wreck left by the ebbing of a high spring tide upon the sands remnant of some friendly splendid vessel that once sheltered men And in the distance she heard the roaring of the Forest further out Her husband s voice was in it End of Project Gutenberg s The Man Whom the Trees Loved by Algernon Blackwood END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAN WHOM THE TREES LOVED This file should be named
