including that of translation into foreign languages including the Scandinavian Cleek of Scotland Yard PROLOGUE The Affair of the Man Who Vanished mister Maverick Narkom Superintendent at Scotland Yard flung aside the paper he was reading and wheeled round in his revolving desk chair all alert on the instant like a terrier that scents a rat He knew well what the coming of the footsteps toward his private office portended his messenger was returning at last Good Now he would get at the facts of the matter and be relieved from the sneers of carping critics and the pin pricks of overzealous reporters who seemed to think that the Yard was to blame and all the forces connected with it to be screamed at as incompetents if every evildoer in London was not instantly brought to book and his craftiest secrets promptly revealed Gad Let them take on his job then if they thought the thing so easy Let them have a go at this business of stopping at one s post until two o clock in the morning trying to patch up the jumbled fragments of a puzzle of this sort if they regarded it as such child s play finding an assassin whom nobody had seen and who struck with a method which neither medical science nor legal acumen could trace or name Then by James The door opened and closed and Detective Sergeant Petrie stepped into the room removing his hat and standing at attention Well rapped out the superintendent in the sharp staccato of nervous impatience Speak up It was a false alarm was it not No sir It s even worse than reported Quicker and sharper than any of the others He s gone sir Gone Good God you don t mean dead Yes sir Dead as Julius Caesar Total collapse about twenty minutes after my arrival and went off like that snapping his fingers and giving his hand an outward fling Same way as the others only as I say quicker sir and with no more trace of what caused it than the doctors were able to discover in the beginning That makes five in the same mysterious way Superintendent and not a ghost of a clue yet The papers will be ringing with it to morrow Ringing with it Can they ring any more than they are doing already Narkom threw up both arms and laughed the thin mirthless laughter of utter despair Can they say anything worse than they have said Blame any more unreasonably than they have blamed It is small solace for the overburdened taxpayer to reflect that he may be done to death at any hour of the night and that the heads of the institution he has so long and so consistently supported are capable of giving his stricken family nothing more in return than the Dear me dear me of utter bewilderment and to prove anew that the efficiency of our boasted police detective system may be classed under the head of Brilliant Fiction That sort of thing day after day as if I had done nothing but pile up failures of this kind since I came into office No heed of the past six years brilliant success No thought for the manner in which the police departments of other countries were made to sit up and to marvel at our methods Two months failure and that doesn t count By the Lord Harry I d give my head to make those newspaper fellows eat their words gad yes Why don t you then sir Petrie dropped his voice a tone or two and looked round over the angle of his shoulder as he spoke then recollecting the time and the improbability of anybody being within earshot took heart of grace and spoke up bolder There s no use blinking the fact mister Narkom it was none of us none of the regular force I mean that made the record of those years what it was That chap Cleek was the man that did it sir You know that as well as I I don t know whether you ve fallen out with him or not or if he s off on some secret mission that keeps him from handling Yard matters these days But if he isn t take my advice sir and put him on this case at once Don t talk such rot flung out Narkom impatiently Do you think I d have waited until now to do it if it could be done Put him on the case indeed How the devil am I to do it when I don t know where on earth to find him He cleared out directly after that Panther s Paw case six months ago Gave up his lodgings sacked his housekeeper laid off his assistant Dollops and went the Lord knows where and why My hat Then that s the reason we never hear any more of him in Yard matters is it I wondered Disappeared eh Well well You don t think he can have gone back to his old lay back to the wrong uns and his old Vanishing Cracksman s tricks do you sir No I don t No backslider about that chap by James He s not built that way Last time I saw him he was out shopping with Miss Ailsa Lorne the girl who redeemed him and judging from their manner toward each other I rather fancied well never mind That s got nothing to do with you Besides I feel sure that if they had missus Narkom and I would have been invited All he said was that he was going to take a holiday He didn t say why and he didn t say where I wish to heaven I d asked him I could have kicked myself for not having done so when that she devil of a Frenchwoman managed to slip the leash and get off scot free Mean that party we nabbed in the house at Roehampton along with the Mauravanian baron who got up that Silver Snare fake don t you sir Margot the Queen of the Apaches Or at least that s who you declared she was I recollect And that s who I still declare she was rapped in Narkom testily and what I ll continue to say while there s a breath left in me I never actually saw the woman until that night it is true but Cleek told me she was Margot and who should know better than he when he was once her pal and partner But it s one of the infernal drawbacks of British justice that a crook s word s as good as an officer s if it s not refuted by actual proof The woman brought a dozen witnesses to prove that she was a respectable Austrian lady on a visit to her son in England that the motor in which she was riding broke down before that Roehampton house about an hour before our descent upon it and that she had merely been invited to step in and wait while the repairs were being attended to by her chauffeur Of course such a chauffeur was forthcoming when she was brought up before the magistrate and a garage keeper was produced to back up his statement so that when the Mauravanian prisoner confessed from the dock that what the lady said was true that settled it I couldn t swear to her identity and Cleek who could was gone the Lord knows where upon which the magistrate admitted the woman to bail and delivered her over to the custody of her solicitors pending my efforts to get somebody over from Paris to identify her And no sooner is the vixen set at large than presto away she goes bag and baggage out of the country and not a man in England has seen hide nor hair of her since Gad if I could but have got word to Cleek at that time just to put him on his guard against her But I couldn t I ve no more idea than a child where the man went not one It s pretty safe odds to lay one s head against a brass farthing as to where the woman went though I reckon said Petrie stroking his chin Bunked it back to Paris I expect sir and made for her hole like any other fox I hear them French tecs are as keen to get hold of her as we were but she slips em like an eel Can t lay hands on her and couldn t swear to her identity if they did Not one in a hundred of em s ever seen her to be sure of her I m told No not one Even Cleek himself knows nothing of who and what she really is He confessed that to me Their knowledge of each other began when they threw in their lot together for the first time and ceased when they parted Yes I suppose she did go back to Paris Petrie it would be her safest place and there d be rich pickings there for her and her crew just now The city is en fete you know Yes sir King Ulric of Mauravania is there as the guest of the Republic Funny time for a king to go visiting another nation sir isn t it when there s a revolution threatening in his own Dunno much about the ways of kings Superintendent but if there was a row coming up in my house you can bet all you re worth I d be mighty sure to stop at home Diplomacy Petrie diplomacy he may be safer where he is Rumours are afloat that Prince What s his name son and heir of the late Queen Karma is not only still living but has during the present year secretly visited Mauravania in person I see by the papers that that ripping old royalist Count Irma is implicated in the revolutionary movement and that by the king s orders he has been arrested and imprisoned in the Fort of Sulberga on a charge of sedition Grand old johnny that I hope no harm comes to him He was in England not so long ago Came to consult Cleek about some business regarding a lost pearl and I took no end of a fancy to him Hope he pulls out all right but if he doesn t oh well we can t bother over other people s troubles we ve got enough of our own just now with these mysterious murders going on and the newspapers hammering the Yard day in and day out Gad how I wish I knew how to get hold of Cleek how I wish I did Can t you find somebody to put you on the lay sir some friend of his somebody that s seen him or maybe heard from him since you have Oh don t talk rubbish snapped Narkom with a short derisive laugh Friends indeed What friends has he outside of myself Who knows him any better than I know him and what do I know of him at that Nothing not where he comes from not what his real name may be not a living thing but that he chooses to call himself Hamilton Cleek and to fight in the interest of the law as strenuously as he once fought against it And where will I find a man who has seen him as you suggest or would know if he had seen him when he has that amazing birth gift to fall back upon You never saw his real face never in all your life I never saw it but twice and even I why he might pass me in the street a dozen times a day and I d never know him if I looked straight into his eyes He d come like a shot if he knew I wanted him gad yes But he doesn t and there you are Imagination was never one of Petrie s strong points His mind moved always along well prepared grooves to time honoured ends It found one of those grooves and moved along it now Why don t you advertise for him then he suggested Put a Personal in the morning papers sir Chap like that s sure to read the news every day and it s bound to come to his notice sooner or later Or if it doesn t why people will get to knowing that the Yard s lost him and get to talking about it and maybe he ll learn of it that way Narkom looked at him The suggestion was so bald so painfully ordinary and commonplace that heretofore it had never occurred to him To associate Cleek s name with the banalities of the everyday Agony Column to connect him with the appeals of the scullery and the methods of the raw amateur The very outrageousness of the thing was its best passport to success By James I believe there s something in that he said abruptly If you get people to talking Well it doesn t matter so that he hears so that he finds out I want him You ring up the Daily Mail while I m scratching off an ad Tell em it s simply got to go in the morning s issue I ll give it to them over the line myself in a minute He lurched over to his desk drove a pen into the ink pot and made such good haste in marshalling his straggling thoughts that he had the thing finished before Petrie had got farther than Yes Scotland Yard Hold the line please Superintendent Narkom wants to speak to you The Yard s requests are at all times treated with respect and courtesy by the controlling forces of the daily press so it fell out that late as the hour was space was accorded and in the morning half a dozen papers bore this notice prominently displayed CLEEK Where are you Urgently needed Communicate at once Maverick Narkom The expected came to pass and the unexpected followed close upon its heels The daily press publishing the full account of the latest addition to the already long list of mysterious murders which for a fortnight past had been adding nervous terrors to the public mind screamed afresh as Narkom knew that it would and went into paroxysms of the Reporters Disease until the very paper was yellow with the froth of it The afternoon editions were still worse for between breakfast and lunch time yet another man had fallen victim to the mysterious assassin and sheets pink and sheets green sheets gray and sheets yellow were scattering panic from one end of London to the other The police detective system of the country was rotten The Government should interfere must interfere It was a national disgrace that the foremost city of the civilized world should be terrorized in this appalling fashion and the author of the outrages remain undetected Could anything be more appalling It could and it was When night came and the evening papers were supplanting the afternoon ones that something more appalling known hours before to the Yard itself was glaring out on every bulletin and every front page in words like these LONDON S REIGN OF TERROR APPALLING ATROCITY IN CLARGES STREET SHOCKING DYNAMITE OUTRAGE Clarges Street The old magic street of those magic old times of Cleek and the Red Limousine and the Riddles that were unriddled for the asking Narkom grabbed the report the instant he heard that name and began to read it breathlessly It was the usual station advice ticked through to headquarters and deciphered by the operator there and it ran tersely thus four twenty eight P M Attempt made by unknown parties to blow up house in Clarges Street Piccadilly Partially successful Three persons injured and two killed No clue to motive Occupants family from Essex Only moved in two days ago House been vacant for months previously Formerly occupied by retired seafaring man named captain Horatio Burbage who Narkom read no farther He flung the paper aside with a sort of mingled laugh and blub and collapsed into his chair with his eyes hidden in the crook of an upthrown arm and the muscles of his mouth twitching Now I know why he cleared out Good old Cleek Bully old Cleek he said to himself and stopped suddenly as though something had got into his throat and half choked him But after a moment or two he jumped to his feet and began walking up and down the room his face fairly glowing and if he had put his thoughts into words they would have run like this Margot s crew of course And he must have guessed that something of the sort would happen some time if he stopped there after that Silver Snare business at Roehampton either from her lot or from the followers of that Mauravanian johnnie who was at the back of it They were after him even in that little game those two I wonder why What the dickens when one comes to think of it could have made the Prime Minister of Mauravania interest himself in an Apache trick to do in an ex cracksman Gad she flies high sometimes that Margot Prime Minister of Mauravania And the fool faced fifteen years hard to do the thing and let her get off scot free Faced it and took it and is taking it still for the sake of helping her to wipe off an old score against a reformed criminal Wonder if Cleek ever crossed him in something Wonder if he too was on the crooked side once and wanted to make sure of its never being shown up Oh well he got his medicine And so too will this unknown murderer who s doing the secret killing in London now that this Clarges Street affair is over Bully old Cleek Slipped em again Had their second shot and missed you Now you ll come out of hiding old chap and we shall have the good old times once more His eye fell upon the ever ready telephone He stopped short in his purposeless walking and nodded and smiled to it We ll have you singing your old tune before long my friend he said optimistically I know my man gad yes He ll let no grass grow under his feet now that this thing s over I shall hear soon yes by James I shall His optimism was splendidly rewarded Not however from the quarter nor in the manner he expected It had but just gone half past seven when a tap sounded the door of his office swung inward and the porter stepped into the room Person wanting to speak with you sir in private he announced Says it s about some Personal in the morning paper Send him in send him in at once rapped out Narkom excitedly Move sharp and don t let anybody else in until I give the word Then as soon as the porter had disappeared he crossed the room twitched the thick curtains over the window switched on the electric light wheeled another big chair up beside his desk and with face aglow jerked open a drawer and got out a cigarette box which had not seen the light for weeks Quick as he was the door opened and shut again before the lid of the box could be thrown back and into the room stepped Cleek s henchman Dollops Hullo You is it you blessed young monkey said Narkom gayly as he looked up and saw the boy Knew I d hear to day knew it by James Sent you for me has he eh Is he coming himself or does he want me to go to him Speak up and Good Lord what s the matter with you What s up Anything wrong Dollops had turned the colour of an under baked biscuit and was looking at him with eyes of absolute despair Sir he said moving quickly forward and speaking in the breathless manner of a spent runner Sir I was a hopin it was a fake and to hear you speak like that Gawd s truth guv ner you don t mean as it s real sir do you That you don t know either Know Know what Where he is wot s become of him mister Cleek the guv ner sir I made sure that you d know if anybody would That s wot made me come sir I d a gone off me bloomin dot if I hadn t after you a puttin in that Personal and him never a turnin up like he d ort Sir do you mean to say as you don t know where he is and haven t seen him even yet No I ve not Good Lord haven t you No sir I aren t clapped eyes on him since he sent me off to the bloomin seaside six months ago All he told me when we come to part was that Miss Lorne was goin out to India on a short visit to Cap n and missus Awksley Lady Chepstow as was sir and that directly she was gone he d be knockin about for a time on his own and I wasn t to worry over him I haven t seen hide nor hair of him sir since that hour Nor heard from him Narkom s voice was thick and the hand he laid on the chair back hard shut Oh yes sir I ve heard I d have gone off my bloomin dot if I hadn t done that Heard from him twice Once when he wrote and gimme my orders about the new place he s took up the river four weeks ago The second time last Friday sir when he wrote me the thing that s fetched me here that s been tearin the heart out of me ever since I heard at Charing Cross about wot s happened at Clarges Street sir And what was that Why sir he wrote that he d jist remembered about some papers as he d left behind the wainscot in his old den and that he d get the key and drop in at the old Clarges Street house on the way ome Said he d arrive in England either yesterday afternoon or this one sir but whichever it was he d wire me from Dover before he took the train And he never done it sir my Gawd he never done it in this world Good God Narkom flung out the words in a sort of panic his lips twitching his whole body shaking his face like the face of a dead man He never done it I tell you pursued Dollops in an absolute tremble of fright I haven t never had a blessed line and now this here awful thing has happened And if he done what he said he was a goin to do if he come to town and went to that house If he said more the clanging of a bell drowned it completely Narkom had turned to his desk and was hammering furiously upon the call gong A scurry of flying feet came up the outer passage the door opened in a flash and the porter was there And behind him Lennard the chauffeur who guessed from that excited summons that there would be a call for him The limousine as quick as you can get her round said Narkom in the sharp staccato of excitement To the scene of the explosion in Clarges Street first and if the bodies of the victims have been removed then to the mortuary without an instant s delay He dashed into the inner room grabbed his hat and coat down from the hook where they were hanging and dashed back again like a man in a panic Come on he said beckoning to Dollops as he flung open the door and ran out into the passage If they ve done him in him if they ve got him after all Come on come on Dollops came on with a rush and two minutes later the red limousine swung out into the roadway and took the distance between Scotland Yard and Clarges Street at a mile a minute clip Arrival at the scene of the disaster elicited the fact that the remains literally remains since they had been well nigh blown to fragments had indeed been removed to the mortuary so thither Narkom and Dollops followed them their fears being in no wise lightened by learning that the bodies were undeniably those of men As the features of both victims were beyond any possibility of recognition identification could of course be arrived at only through bodily marks and Dollops s close association with Cleek rendered him particularly capable of speaking with authority regarding those of his master It was therefore a source of unspeakable delight to both Narkom and himself when after close and minute examination of the remains he was able to say positively Sir whatever s become of him praise God neither of these here two dead men is him bless his heart So they didn t get him after all supplemented Narkom laughing for the first time in hours Still it cannot be doubted that whoever committed this outrage was after him since the people who have suffered are complete strangers to the locality and had only just moved into the house No doubt the person or persons who threw the bomb knew of Cleek s having at one time lived there as Captain Burbage Margot did for one and finding the house still occupied and not knowing of his removal why there you are Margot The name brought back all Dollops banished fears He switched round on the superintendent and laid a nervous clutch on his sleeve And Margot s lay is Paris Sir I didn t tell you did I that it was from there the guv ner wrote those two letters to me Cinnamon From Paris Yes sir He didn t say from wot part of the city nor wot he was a doin there anyways but my hat listen here sir They re there them Mauravanian johnnies and the Apaches and Margot there too and you know how both lots has their knife into him I dunno wot the Mauravanians is got against him sir he never tells nothin to nobody he don t but most like it s summink he done to some of em that time he went out there about the lost pearl but they re after him and the Apaches is after him and between the two Guv ner his voice rose thin and shrill guv ner if one lot don t get him the other may and sir there s Apaches in London this very night I know I ve seen em Seen them When Where At Charing Cross station sir jist before I went to the Yard to see you As I hadn t had no telegram from the guv ner like I was promised I went there on the off chance hopin to meet him when the boat train come in And there I see em sir a loungin round the platform where the Dover train goes out at nine to catch the night boat back to Calais sir I spotted em on the instant from their walk their way of carryin of theirselves their manner of wearin of their bloomin hair Laughin among themselves they was and lookin round at the entrance every now and then like as they was expectin some one to come and join em and I see too as they was a goin back to where they come from cause they d the return halves of their tickets in their hatbands One of em he buys a paper at the bookstall and sees summink in it as tickled him wonderful for I see him go up to the others and point it out to em and then the whole lot begins to larf like blessed hyenas I spotted wot the paper was and the place on the page the blighter was a pointin at so I went and bought one myself to see wot it was Sir it was that there Personal of yours The minnit I read that I makes a dash for a taxi to go to you at once sir and jist as I does so a newsboy runs by me with a bill on his chest tellin about the explosion and then sir I fair went off me dot They were back on the pavement within sight of the limousine when the boy said this Narkom brought the car to his side with one excited word and fairly wrenched open the door To Charing Cross station as fast as you can streak it he said excitedly The last train for the night boat leaves at nine sharp Catch it if you rack the motor to pieces Crumbs A minute and a half commented Lennard as he consulted the clock dial beside him then just waiting for Narkom and Dollops to jump into the vehicle he brought her head round with a swing threw back the clutch and let her go full tilt But even the best of motors cannot accomplish the impossible The gates were closed the signal down the last train already outside the station when they reached it and not even the mandate of the law might hope to stay it or to call it back Plenty of petrol Narkom faced round as he spoke and looked at Lennard Plenty sir All right beat it The boat sails from Dover at eleven I ve got to catch it Understand Yes sir But you could wire down and have her held over till we get there Superintendent Not for the world She must sail on time I must get aboard without being noticed without some persons I m following having the least cause for suspicion Beat that train do you hear me beat it I want to get there and get aboard that boat before the others arrive Do you want any further incentive than that If so here it is for you mister Cleek s in Paris mister Cleek s in danger mister Cleek God s truth Hop in sir hop in I ll have you there ahead of that train if I dash down the Admiralty Pier in flames from front to rear Just let me get to the open road sir and I ll show you something to make you sit up He did Once out of the track of all traffic and with the lights of the city well at his back he strapped his goggles tight jerked his cap down to his eyebrows and leaned over the wheel For mister Cleek do you hear he said addressing the car as if it were a human being Now then show what you re made of There Take your head Now go you vixen GO There was a sudden roar a sudden leap then the car shot forward as though all the gales of all the universe were sweeping it on and the wild race to the coast began Narkom jerked down the blinds turned on the light and flung open the locker as they pounded on Dip in Get something that can be made to fit you he said to Dollops We can t risk any of those fellows identifying you as the chap who was hanging round the station to night Toss me over that wig the gray one in the far corner there God knows what we re on the track of but if it leads to Cleek I ll follow it to the end of time Then lifting his voice until it sounded above the motor s roar Faster Lennard faster he called Give it to her give it to her We ve got to beat that train if it kills us They did beat it The engine s light was not even in sight when the bright glare of the moon on the Channel s waters flashed up out of the darkness before them nor was the sound of the train s coming even faintly audible as yet when a few minutes later the limousine swung down the incline and came to a standstill within a stone s throw of the entrance to the pier at whose extreme end the packet lay with gangways down and fires up and her huge bulk rising and falling with the movements of the waves Beat her you see sir said Lennard chuckling as he got down and opened the door for the superintendent to alight Better not go any nearer sir with the car There s a chap down there standing by the gangplank and he seems interested in us from the way he s watching Jumped up like a shot and came down the gangplank the instant he heard us coming Better do the rest of the journey afoot sir and make a pretence of paying me as if I was a public taxi What ll I do Stop here until morning Yes Put up at a garage and if I don t return by the first boat get back to town Meantime cut off somewhere and ring up the Yard Tell em where I ve gone Now then Dollops come on A moment later the limousine had swung off into the darkness and disappeared and what might properly have been taken for a couple of English curates on their way to a Continental holiday moved down the long pier between the glimmering and inadequate lamps to the waiting boat But long before they reached it the figure at the gangplank the tall erect figure of a man whom the most casual observer must have recognized as one who had known military training had changed its alert attitude and was sauntering up and down as if when they came nearer and the light allowed him to see what they were he had lost all interest in them and their doings Narkom gave the man a glance from the tail of his eye as they went up the gangplank and boarded the boat and brief as that glance was it was sufficient to assure him of two things First that the man was not only strikingly handsome but bore himself with an air which spoke of culture birth position second that he was a foreigner with the fair hair and the slightly hooked nose which was so characteristic of the Mauravanians With Dollops at his side Narkom slunk aft where the lights were less brilliant and the stern of the boat hung over the dark still waters and pausing there turned and looked back at the waiting man A French sailor was moving past in the darkness He stopped the man and spoke to him Tell me he said slipping a shilling into the fellow s hand do you happen to know who that gentleman is standing on the pier there Yes m sieur He is equerry to his Majesty King Ulric of Mauravania He has crossed with us frequently during his Majesty s sojourn in Paris Gawd s truth sir whispered Dollops plucking nervously at the superintendent s sleeve as the sailor after touching his cap with his forefinger passed on Apaches at one end and them Mauravanian johnnies at the other I tell you they re a workin hand in hand for some reason workin against him Narkom lifted a silencing hand and turned to move away where there would be less likelihood of anything they might say being overheard for at that moment a voice had sounded and from a most unusual quarter Unnoticed until now a fisher s boat which for some time had been nearing the shore swept under the packet s stern and grazed along the stone front of the pier Voila m sieur said in French the man who sailed it Have I not kept my word and brought your excellency across in safety and with speed Yes replied the passenger whom the fisher addressed He spoke in perfect French and with the smoothness of a man of the better class You have done well indeed Also it was better than waiting about at Calais for the morning boat I can now catch the very first train to London Fast is she There is your money Adieu Then came the sound of some one leaving the boat and scrambling up the water stairs and hard on the heels of it the first whistle of the coming train Narkom glancing round saw a slouching ill clad fellow whose appearance was in distinct contrast with his voice and manner of speaking come into view upon the summit of the pier His complexion was sallow his matted hair seemed to have gone for years uncombed a Turkish fez dirty and discoloured was on his head and over his arm hung several bits of tapestry and shining stuff which betokened his calling as that of a seller of Oriental draperies This much Narkom saw and would have gone on his way giving the fellow no second thought but that a curious thing happened Moving away toward the footpath which led from the pier to the town the pedler caught sight suddenly of the man standing at the gangplank he halted abruptly looked round to make sure that no one was watching then without more ado turned round suddenly on his heel walked straightway to the gangplank and boarded the boat The Mauravanian took not the slightest heed of him nor he of the Mauravanian Afterward when the train had arrived Narkom thought he knew why For the present he was merely puzzled to understand why this dirty greasy Oriental pedler who had been at the pains to cross the Channel in a fisher s boat should do so for the apparent purpose of merely going back on the packet to Calais By this time the train had arrived the pier was alive with people porters were running back and forth with luggage and there was bustle and confusion everywhere Narkom looked along the length of the vessel to the teeming gangway The Mauravanian was still there alert as before his fixed eyes keenly watching A crowd came stringing along bags and bundles done up in gaudy handkerchiefs in their hands laughing jostling jabbering together in low class French Here they are guv ner the Apaches said Dollops in a whisper That s the lot sir Keep your eye on them as they come aboard and if they are with him Crumbs Not a sign not a blessed one For the Apaches stringing up the gangplank by twos and threes and coming within brushing distance of the waiting man passed on as the Oriental pedler had passed on taking no notice of him nor he of them nor yet of how as they advanced the pedler slouched forward and slipped into the thick of them By James one of them that s what the fellow is said Narkom as he observed this If during the voyage the Mauravanian speaks to one man of the lot He stopped and sucked in his breath and let the rest of the sentence go by default For of a sudden there had come into sight upon the pier a dapper little French dandy fuzzy of moustache mincing of gait with a flower in his buttonhole and a shining topper on his beautifully pomaded head and it came upon Narkom with a shock of remembrance that he had seen this selfsame living fashion plate pass by Scotland Yard twice that very day Onward he came this pretty monsieur with his jaunty air and his lovely wine glass waist onward and up the gangway and aboard the packet and there the Mauravanian still stood looking out over the crowd and taking no more heed of him than he had taken of anybody else But with the vanishing of this exquisite to whom he had paid no heed his alertness and his interest seemed somehow to evaporate for he turned now and again to watch the sailors and the longshoremen at their several duties and strolled leisurely aboard and stood lounging against the rail of the lower deck when the call of All ashore that s going rang through the vessel s length and was still lounging there when the packet cast off her mooring and swinging her bows round in the direction of France creamed her way out into the Channel and headed for Calais A wind unnoticed in the safe shelter of the harbour played boisterously across the chopping waves as the vessel forged outward sending clouds of spray sweeping over the bows and along the decks and such passengers as refrained from seeking the shelter of the saloon and smoke room sought refuge by crowding aft Come whispered Narkom tapping Dollops arm We can neither talk nor watch here with safety in this crowd Let us go forrard Better a drenching in loneliness than shelter with a crowd like this Come along The boy obeyed without a murmur following the larger and heavier built curate along the wet decks to the deserted bows and finding safe retreat with him there in the dark shadow cast by a tarpaulin covered lifeboat From this safe shelter they could by craning their necks get a half view of the interior of the smoke room through its hooked back door and their first glance in that direction pinned their interest for the pretty Monsieur was there smoking a cigarette and sipping now and again at a glass of absinthe which stood on a little round table at his elbow But of the Mauravanian or the Apaches or of the Oriental pedler there was neither sight nor sound nor had there been since the vessel started What do you make of it queried Narkom when at the end of an hour the dim outlines of the French coast blurred the clear silver of the moonlit sky Have we come on a wild goose chase do you think What do you suppose has become of the Apaches and of the pedler chap Travellin second class said Dollops after stealing out and making a round of the vessel and creeping back into the shadow of the lifeboat unseen Pallin with em he is sir Makin a play of sellin em things for their donahs for the sake of appearances One of em he is and if either that Frenchy or that Mauravanian johnny is mixed up with them lay low Smeller to the ground sir and eyes and ears wide open We ll know wot s wot now For of a sudden the Mauravanian had come into view far down the wet and glistening promenade deck and was whistling a curious lilting air as he strolled along past the open door of the smoke room Just the mere twitch of Monsieur s head told when he heard that tune He finished his absinthe flung aside his cigarette and strolled leisurely out upon the deck The Mauravanian was at the after end of the promenade a glance told him that He set his face resolutely in the direction of the bows and sauntered leisurely along He moved on quietly until he came to the very end of the covered promenade where the curving front of the deckhouse looked out upon the spray washed forward deck then stopped and planted his back against it and stood silently waiting not ten feet distant from where Narkom and Dollops crouched A minute later the Mauravanian continuing what was to all appearances a lonely and aimless promenade round the vessel came abreast of that spot and of him And then the deluge Monsieur spoke out guardedly but in a clear crisp tone that left no room for doubt upon one point at least Mon ami it is done it is accomplished that crisp voice said You shall report that to his Majesty s ministers Voila it is done It is not done replied the Mauravanian in a swift biting emphatic whisper You jump to conclusions too quickly Here take this It is an evening paper The thing was useless he was not there Not there Grande Dieu Sh h Take it read it I will see you when we land Not here it is too dangerous Au revoir Then he passed on and round the curve of the deckhouse to the promenade on the other side and Monsieur with the paper hard shut in the grip of a tense hand moved fleetly back toward the smoke room But not unknown any longer Gawd s truth a woman gulped Dollops in a shaking voice No not a woman a devil said Narkom through his teeth Margot by James Margot herself And what is he what is Cleek that a king should enter into compact with a woman to kill him Margot dash her Well I ll have you now my lady yes by James I will Guv ner Gawd s truth sir where are you going To the operator in charge of the wireless to send a message to the chief of the Calais police to meet me on arrival said Narkom in reply Stop where you are Lay low Wait for me We ll land in a dozen minutes time I ll have that Jezebel and her confederates and I ll rout out Cleek and get him beyond the clutches of them if I tear up all France to do it Gawd bless you sir Gawd bless you and forgive me said Dollops with a lump in his throat and a mist in his eyes I said often you was a sosidge and a muff sir but you aren t you re a man Narkom did not hear He was gone already down the deck to the cabin of the wireless operator In another moment he had passed in shut the door behind him and the Law at sea was talking to the Law ashore through the blue ether and across the moonlit waves It was ten minutes later The message had gone its way and Narkom was back in the lifeboat s shadow again and close on the bows the lamps of Calais pier shone yellow in the blue and silver darkness On the deck below people were bustling about and making for the place where the gangplank was to be thrust out presently and link boat and shore together On the quay customs officials were making ready for the coming inspection porters were scuttling about in their blue smocks and peaked caps and back of all the outlines of Calais Town loomed shadowy and grim through the crowding gloom The loneliness of the upper deck offered its attractions to the Mauravanian and to Margot and in the emptiness of it they met again within earshot of the lifeboat where Narkom and the boy lay hidden for one brief word before they went ashore So you have read you understand how useless it was the Mauravanian said joining her again at the deckhouse where she stood with the crumpled newspaper in her hand His Majesty s purse cannot be lightened of all that promised sum for any such bungle as this Speak quickly where may we go to talk in safety I cannot risk it here I will not risk it in the train Must we wait until we reach Paris mademoiselle Or have you a lair of your own here I have lairs as you term them in half the cities of France Monsieur le Comte she answered with a vicious little note of resentment in her voice And I do not work for nothing no not I I paid for my adherence to his Majesty s Prime Minister and I intend to be paid for my services to his Majesty s self even though I have this once failed It must be settled that question at once and for all now to night I guessed it would be like that he answered with a jerk of his shoulders Where shall it be then Speak quickly They are making the landing and I must not be seen talking with you after we go ashore Where then At the Inn of the Seven Sinners on the Quai d Lorme a gunshot distant Any cocher will take you there Is it safe All my lairs are safe monsieur It overhangs the water And if strangers come there is a trap with a bolt on the under side One way to the town and the sewers and forty other inns The other to a motor boat always in readiness for instant use You could choose for yourself should occasion come You will not find the place shut my lairs never are A password No there is none for any but the Brotherhood Nor will you need one You remember old Marise of the Twisted Arm in Paris Well she serves at the Seven Sinners now I have promoted Madame Serpice to the Twisted Arm She will know you will Marise Say to her I am coming shortly She and her mates will raise the roof with joy and la la The gangway is out They are calling all ashore Look for me and my lads close on your heels when you arrive Au revoir Au revoir he repeated and slipping by went below and made his way ashore She waited that he might get well on his way that none might by any possibility associate them then turning went down after him and out to the pier where her crew were already forgathering and when or how she passed the word to them that it was not Paris to night but the Inn of the Seven Sinners neither Narkom nor Dollops could decide close as they came on after her for she seemed to speak to no one No Inn of the Seven Sinners for you to night my lady if my friend M Ducroix has attended to that wireless message properly muttered Narkom as he followed her Look sharp Dollops and if you see a Sergeant de Ville let me know They ve no luggage that lot and besides they are natives so they will pass the customs in a jiffy Hullo there goes that pedler chap and without his fez or his draperies b gad Through the customs like a flash the bounder And there go the others too And she after them she by James God Where are Ducroix and his men Why aren t they here looking vainly about for some sign of the Chief of Police I can t do anything without him here on foreign soil Why in heaven s name doesn t the man come Maybe he hasn t had time guv ner maybe he wasn t on hand when the message arrived hazarded Dollops It s not fifteen minutes all told since it was dispatched So if There she goes there she goes Passed and through the customs in a wink the Jezebel interposed Narkom in a fever of excitement as he saw Margot go by the inspector at the door and walk out into the streets of the city Lord if she slips me now She shan t cut in Dollops jerking down his hat brim and turning up his collar Wait here till the cops come I ll nip out after her and see where she goes Like as not the cops ll know the place when you mention it but if they don t watch out for me I ll come back and lead em Then he moved hurriedly forward passed the inspector and was gone in a twinkling For ten wretched minutes after he too had passed the customs and was at liberty to leave Narkom paced up and down and fretted and fumed before a sound of clanking sabres caught his ear and looking round he saw M Ducroix enter the place at the head of a detachment of police He hurried to him and in a word made himself known Ten million pardons m sieur but I was absent when the message he shall be deliver exclaimed Ducroix in broken English I shall come and shall bring my men as soon as he shall be receive M sieur who shall it be this great criminal you demand of me to arrest Is he here No no A moment Ducroix Do you know a place called the Inn of the Seven Sinners Perfectly It is but a stone s throw distant on the Quai d Lorme Come with me to it then I ll make you the most envied man in France Ducroix I ll deliver into your hands that witch of the underworld Margot the Queen of the Apaches Ducroix s face lit up like a face transfigured M sieur he cried That woman You can give me that woman You know her You can recognize her But yes I remember You shall have her in your hands once in your own country but she shall slip you as she shall slip everybody She won t slip you then I promise you that said Narkom Reward and glory both shall be yours I have followed her across the channel Ducroix I know where she is to be found for a certainty She is at the Inn of the Seven Sinners Just take me there and I ll turn the Jezebel over to you Ducroix needed no urging The prospect of such a capture made him fairly beside himself with delight In twenty swift words he translated this glorious news to his men setting them as wild with excitement as he was himself then with a sharp Come m sieur he turned on his heel and led the breathless race for the goal Halfway down the narrow ink black street that led to the inn they encountered Dollops pelting back at full speed Come on guv ner come on all of you he broke out as he came abreast of them She s there they re all there kickin up Meg s diversions sir and singin and dancin like mad And sir he s there too the pedler chap I see him come up and sneak in with the rest Come on This way all of you If they had merely run before they all but flew now for this second assurance that Margot the great and long sought for Margot was actually within their reach served to spur every man to outdo himself so that it was but a minute or two later when they came in sight of the inn and bore down upon it in a solid phalanx And then just then when another minute would have settled everything the demon of mischance chose to play them a scurvy trick All they knew of it was that an Apache coming out of the building for some purpose of his own looked up and saw them then faced round and bent back in the doorway that of a sudden a very tornado of music and laughter and singing and dancing rolled out into the night and that when they came pounding up to the doorway the fellow was lounging there serenely smoking and inside his colleagues were holding a revel wild enough to wake the dead In the winking of an eye he was carried off his feet and swept on by this sudden inrush of the law the door clashed open the little slatted barrier beyond was knocked aside and the police were pouring into the room and running headlong into a spinning mass of wild dancers The band ceased suddenly as they appeared the dancers cried out as if in a panic of alarm and at Ducroix s commanding Surrender in the name of the Law a fat woman behind the bar flung up her arms and voiced a despairing shriek Soul of misfortune for what m sieur for what she cried It is no sin to laugh and dance We break no law my customers and I What is it you want that you come in upon us like this Ah what indeed Not anything that could be seen A glance round the room showed nothing and no one but these suddenly disturbed dancers and of Margot and the Mauravanian never a sign M sieur began Ducroix turning to Narkom whose despair was only too evident and who in company with Dollops was rushing about the place pushing people here and there looking behind them looking in all the corners and generally deporting themselves after the manner of a couple of hounds endeavouring to pick up a lost scent M sieur shall it be an error then Narkom did not answer Of a sudden however he remembered what had been said of the trap and pushing aside a group of girls standing over it found it in the middle of the floor Here it is this is the way she got out he shouted Bolted by James bolted on the under side Up with it up with it the Jezebel got out this way But though Ducroix and Dollops aided him and they pulled and tugged and tugged and pulled they could not budge it one inch M sieur no what madness He is not a trap no he is not a trap at all protested old Marise It is but a square where the floor broke and was mended Mother of misfortune it is nothing but that What response Narkom might have made was checked by a sudden discovery Huddling in a corner feigning a drunken sleep he saw a man lying with his face hidden in his folded arms It was the pedler He pounced on the man and jerked up his head before the fellow could prevent it or could dream of what was about to happen Here s one of them at least he cried and fell to shaking him with all his force Here s one of Margot s pals Ducroix You shan t go empty handed after all A cry of consternation fluttered through the gathering as he brought the man s face into view Evidently they were past masters of the art of acting these Apaches for one might have sworn that every man and every woman of them was taken aback by the fellow s presence Mother of Miracles who shall the man be exclaimed Marise Messieurs I know him not I have not seen him in all my life before Cochon speak up Who are you that you come in like this and get a respectable widow in trouble dog Eh The man made a motion first to his ears then to his mouth then fell to making movements in the sign language but spoke never a word La la he is a deaf mute m sieur said Ducroix He hears not and speaks not poor unfortunate Oh doesn t he said Narkom with an ugly laugh He spoke well enough a couple of hours back I promise you My young friend here and I heard him when he paid off the fisherman who had carried him over to Dover just before he sneaked aboard the packet to come back with Margot and the Mauravanian The eyes of the Apaches flew to the man s face with a sudden keen interest which only they might understand but he still stood wagging his great head either drunkenly or idiotically and pointing to ears and mouth Lay hold of him run him in said Narkom whirling him across into the arms of a couple of stalwart Sergeants de Ville I ll go before the magistrate and lay a charge against him in the morning that will open your eyes when you hear it One of a bloodthirsty dynamiting crew the dog Lay fast hold of him don t let him get away on your lives God to have lost that woman to have lost her after all It was a sore blow certainly but there was nothing to do but to grin and bear it for to seek Margot at any of the inns which might communicate with the sewer trap or to hunt for her and a motor boat on the dark water s surface was in very truth like looking for a needle in a haystack and quite as hopeless He therefore decided to go for the rest of the night to the nearest hotel and waiting only to see the pedler carried away in safe custody and promising to be on hand when he was brought up before the local magistrate in the morning took Dollops by the arm and dejectedly went his way The morning saw him living up to his promise and long before the arrival of the magistrate or indeed before the night s harvest of prisoners was brought over from the lockup and thrust into the three little detention rooms below the court he was there with Dollops and Ducroix observing with wonder that groups of evil looking fellows of the Apache breed were hanging round the building as he approached and that later on others of the same kidney slipped in and took seats in the little courtroom and kept constantly whispering one to the other while they waited for the morning session to begin Gawd s truth guv ner look at em the ole blessed place is alive with the bounders whispered Dollops Wot do you think they are up to sir Makin a rush and settin the pedler free when he comes up before the Beak There s twenty of em waitin round the door if there s one Narkom made no reply The arrival of the magistrate focussed all eyes on the bench and riveted his attention with the rest The proceedings opened with all the trivial cases first the night s sweep of the dragnet drunks and disorderlies vagrants and pariahs One by one these were brought in and paid their fines and went their way unheeded for this part of the morning s proceedings interested nobody not even the Apaches The list was dragged through monotonously the last blear eyed sot a hideous cadaverous monkey faced wretch whose brutal countenance sickened Narkom when he shambled up in his filthy rags had paid his fine and gone his way and there remained now but a case of attempted suicide to be disposed of before the serious cases began This latter occupied the magistrate s time and attention for perhaps twenty minutes or so then that too was disposed of and then a voice was heard calling out for the unknown man arrested last night at the Inn of the Seven Sinners to be brought forward In an instant a ripple of excitement ran through the little court The Apache fraternity sat up within and passed the word to the Apache fraternity without and these stood at attention close lipped dark browed eager like human tigers waiting for the word to spring Every eye was fixed on the door through which that pretended mute should be led in but although others had come at the first call he came not even at the second and the magistrate had just issued an impatient command for the case to be called yet a third time when there was a clatter of hasty footsteps and the keeper of the detention rooms burst into the court pale as a dead man and shaking in every nerve M sieur le Juge he cried out extending his two arms Soul of Misfortunes how shall I tell He is not there he is gone he is escape that unknown one When I shall unlock the room and call for Jean Lamareau the drunkard at the case before the last there shall come out of the dimness to me what I shall think is he and I shall bring him here and he shall be fine and dismissed But m sieur he shall not be Jean Lamareau after all I shall go now and call for the unknown and I shall get no answer I shall go in and make of the place light and there he shall be that real Jean Lamareau stripped of his clothes choked to unconsciousness alone on the floor and the other shall have paid his fine and gone A great cry went up a wild confusion filled the court The Apaches within rose and ran with the news to the Apaches without and these joining forces scattered and ran through the streets in the direction the escaped prisoner had been seen to take But through it all Narkom sat there squeezing his hands together and laughing in little shaking gusts that had a heart throb wavering through them for to him this could mean but one thing Cleek he said leaning down and shrilling a joyous whisper into Dollops ear But one man in all the world could have done that thing but one man in all the world would have dared It was he it was Cleek God bless his bully soul Amen sir said Dollops swallowing something then he rose at Narkom s bidding and followed him outside A minute later a gamin brushing against them put out a grimy hand and said whiningly Boulogne messieurs Quai des Anges Third house back from the waterside in time for the noon boat across to Folkestone Give me two francs please The monsieur said you would if I said that to you when you came out The two francs were in his hand almost as he ceased speaking and in less than a minute later a fiacre was whirling Narkom and Dollops off to the railway station and the next outgoing train to Boulogne It was still short of midday when they arrived at the Quai des Anges and made their way to the third house back from the waterside a little tavern with a toy garden in front and a sort of bowered arcade behind and there under an almond tree with a cigarette between his fingers and a bunch of flowers in his buttonhole they came upon him at last Guv ner Oh Gawd bless you guv ner is it really you again said Dollops rushing up to him like a girl to a lover Yes it is really I he answered with one of his easy laughs Then he rose and held out his hand as Narkom advanced and for a moment or two they stood there palm in palm saying not one word making not one sound Nearly did for me my overzealous friend said Cleek after a time I could have kicked you when you turned up with that lot at the Seven Sinners Another ten minutes and I d have had that in my hands which would have compelled his Majesty of Mauravania to give Irma his liberty and to abdicate in his consort s favour But you came you dear old blunderer and when I looked up and recognized you well let it pass I was on my way back to London when I chanced to see Count Waldemar on watch beside the gangway of the Calais packet he had slipped me the hound slipped me in Paris and I saw my chance to run him down Gad it was a close squeak that when you let those Apaches know that I had just crossed over from this side and had gone aboard the packet because I saw Waldemar They guessed then I couldn t speak there and I dared not speak in the court They were there on every hand inside the building and out waiting to knife me the instant they were sure I had to get out I had to get past them and voila He turned and laid an affectionate hand on Dollops shoulder and laughed softly and pleasantly New place all right old chap Garden doing well and all my traps in shipshape order eh Yes sir Gawd bless you sir Everything sir everything Good lad Then we ll be off to them My holiday is over mister Narkom and I m going back into harness again You want me I see and I said I d come if you did Give me a few days rest in old England dear friend and then out with your riddles and I m your man again CHAPTER I This will be it I think sir said Lennard bringing the limousine to a halt at the head of a branching lane thick set with lime and chestnut trees between whose double wall of green one could catch a distant glimpse of the river shining golden in the five o clock light Look see There s the sign post To the Sleeping Mermaid over to the left there Anything pinned to it or hanging on it mister Narkom spoke from the interior of the vehicle without making even the slightest movement toward alighting merely glancing at a few memoranda scribbled on the back of a card whose reverse bore the words Taverne Maladosie Quai des Anges Boulogne printed upon it in rather ornate script A bit of rag a scrap of newspaper a fowl s feather anything Look sharp No sir not a thing of any sort that I can see from here Shall I nip over and make sure Yes Only don t give away the fact that you are examining it in case there should be anybody on the lookout If you find the smallest thing even a carpet tack attached to the post get back into your seat at once and cut off townward as fast as you can make the car travel Right you are sir said Lennard and forthwith did as he had been bidden In less than ninety seconds however he was back with word that the post s surface was as smooth as your hand and not a thing of any sort attached to it from top to bottom Narkom fetched a deep breath of relief at this news tucked the card into his pocket and got out immediately Hang round the neighbourhood somewhere and keep your ears open in case I should have to give the signal sooner than I anticipate he said then twisted round on his heel turned into the tree bordered lane and bore down in the direction of the river When still short by thirty yards or so of its flowered and willow fringed brim he came upon a quaint little diamond paned red roofed low eaved house set far back from the shore with a garden full of violets and primroses and flaunting crocuses in front of it and a tangle of blossoming things crowding what once had been a bower bordered bowling green in the rear Queen Anne for a ducat he commented as he looked at the place and took in every detail from the magpie in the old pointed topped wicker cage hanging from a nail beside the doorway to the rudely carved figure of a mermaid over the jutting flower filled diamond paned window of the bar parlour with its swinging sashes and its oak beam sill shoulder high from the green sweet smelling earth How the dickens does he ferret out these places I wonder And what fool has put his money into a show like this in these days of advancement and enterprise Buried away from the line of traffic ashore and shut in by trees from the river Gad they can t do a pound s worth of business in a month at an out of the way roost like this Certainly they were not doing much of it that day for as he passed through the taproom he caught a glimpse of the landlady dozing in a deep chair by the window and of the back of a by no means smartly dressed barmaid who might have been stone deaf for all notice she took of his entrance standing on a stool behind the bar dusting and polishing the woodwork of the shelves The door of the bar parlour was open and through it Narkom caught a glimpse of a bent kneed stoop shouldered doddering old man shuffling about filling match boxes wiping ash trays and carefully refolding the rumpled newspapers that lay on the centre table That he was not the proprietor merely a waiter the towel over his arm the shabby old dress coat the baggy kneed trousers would have been evidence enough without that added by the humble tasks he was performing Poor devil And at his age said Narkom to himself as he noted the pale hopeless looking time worn face and the shuffling time bent body then moved by a sense of keen pity he walked into the room and spoke gently to him Tea for two uncle at a quarter past five to the tick if you can manage it he said tossing the old man a shilling And say to the landlady that I d like to have exclusive use of this room for an hour or two so she can charge the loss to my account if she has to turn any other customers away Thanky sir I ll attend to it at once sir replied the old fellow pocketing the coin and moving briskly away to give the order In another minute he was back again laying the cloth and setting out the dishes while Narkom improved the time of waiting by straying round the room and looking at the old prints and cases of stuffed fishes that hung on the oak panelled walls It still wanted a minute or so of being a quarter past five when the old man bore in the tea tray itself and set it upon the waiting table and little custom though the place enjoyed Narkom could not but compliment it upon its promptness and the inviting quality of the viands served You may go he said to the waiter when the man at length bowed low and announced that all was ready then after a moment turning round and finding him still shuffling about I say you may go he reiterated a trifle sharply No don t take the cosy off the teapot leave it as it is The gentleman I am expecting has not arrived yet and look here will you have the goodness to let that cosy alone and to clear out when I tell you By James if you don t Hullo What the dickens was that That was undoubtedly the tingle of a handful of gravel against the panes of the window A sign that the coast is quite clear and that you have not been followed dear friend said a voice Cleek s voice in reply Shall we not sit down I m famishing And as Narkom turned round on his heel with the certainty that no one had entered the room since the door was closed and he himself before it the tea cosy was whipped off by a hand that no longer shook the waiter s bent figure straightened his pale drawn features writhed blent settled into placid calmness and the thing was done By all that s wonderful Cleek blurted out Narkom delightedly and lurched toward him Sh h h Gently gently my friend he interposed putting up a warning hand It is true Dollops has signalled that there is no one in the vicinity likely to hear but although the maid is both deaf and dumb recollect that missus Condiment is neither and I have no more wish for her to discover my real calling than I ever had missus Condiment repeated Narkom sinking his voice and speaking in a tone of agitation and amazement You don t mean to tell me that the old woman you employed as housekeeper when you lived in Clarges Street is here Certainly she is the landlady Her assistant is that same deaf and dumb maid of all work who worked with her at the old house and is sharing with her a sort of retirement here Captain Burbage set the pair of them up in business here two days after his departure from Clarges Street and pays them a monthly wage sufficient to make up for any lack of custom All that they are bound to do is to allow a pensioner of the captain s a poor old half witted ex waiter called Joseph to come and go as he will and to gratify a whim for waiting upon people if he chooses to do so What s that No the captain does not live here He and his henchman Dollops are supposed to be out of the country missus Condiment does not know where he lives nor will she ever be permitted to do so You may some day perhaps that is for the future to decide but not at present my dear friend it is too risky Why risky old chap Surely I can come and go in disguise as I did in the old days Cleek We managed secret visits all right then remember Yes I know But things have changed mister Narkom You may disguise yourself as cleverly as you please but you can t disguise the red limousine It is known and it will be followed so until you can get another of a totally different colour and appearance I ll ring you up each morning at the Yard and we can make our appointments over your private wire For the present we must take no great risks In the days that lie behind dear friend I had no tracker to guard against but Margot no enemies but her paltry crew to reckon with and to outwit In these I have many They have brains these new foes they are rich they are desperate they are powerful and behind them is the implacable hate and the malignant hand of No matter You wouldn t understand I can make a devilish good guess then rapped in Narkom a trifle testily his vanity a little hurt by that final suggestion and his mind harking back to the brief enlightening conversation between Margot and Count Waldemar that night on the spray swept deck of the Channel packet Behind them is the implacable hate and the malignant hand of the King of Mauravania What utter rubbish Cleek s jeering laughter fairly stung it was so full of pitying derision My friend have you taken to reading penny novelettes of late A thief taker and a monarch An ex criminal and a king I should have given you credit for more common sense It was the King of Mauravania s equerry who directed that attempt to kill you by blowing up the house in Clarges Street Very possibly But that does not incriminate his royal master Count Waldemar is not only equerry to King Ulric of Mauravania but is also nephew to its ex Prime Minister the gentleman who is doing fifteen years energetic labour for the British Government as a result of that attempt to trap me with his witless Silver Snare Oh said Narkom considerably crestfallen then grasped at yet another straw with sudden breathless eagerness But even then the head of the Mauravanian Government must have had some reason for wishing to wipe you out he added earnestly There could be no question of avenging an uncle s overthrow at that time Cleek his voice running thin and eager his hand shutting suddenly upon his famous ally s arm Cleek trust me Won t you Can t you As God hears me old chap I ll respect it Who are you What are you man Cleek he made answer calmly drawing out a chair and taking his seat at the table Cleek of Scotland Yard Cleek of the Forty Faces which you will Who should know that better than you whose helping hand has made me what I am Yes but before Cleek What were you who were you in the days before The Vanishing Cracksman a dog who would have gone on no doubt to a dog s end but for your kind hand and the dear eyes of Ailsa Lorne Now give me my tea I m famishing and after that we ll talk of this new riddle that needs unriddling for the honour of the Yard Yes thanks two lumps and just a mere dash of milk Gad It s good to be back in England dear friend it s good it s good CHAPTER II Five men eh said Cleek glancing up at mister Narkom who for two or three minutes past had been giving him a sketchy outline of the case in hand A goodish many that And all inside of the past six weeks you say No wonder the papers have been hammering the Yard if as you suggest they were not accidental deaths Sure they are not As sure as I am that I m speaking to you at this minute I had my doubts in the beginning there seemed so little to connect the separate tragedies but when case after case followed with exactly or nearly exactly the same details in every instance one simply had to suspect foul play Naturally Even a donkey must know that there s food about if he smells thistles Begin at the beginning please How did the affair start When and where In the neighbourhood of Hampstead Heath at two o clock in the morning The constable on duty in the district came upon a man clad only in pajamas lying face downward under the wall surrounding a corner house still warm but as dead as Queen Anne In his pajamas eh said Cleek reaching for a fresh slice of toast Pretty clear evidence that that poor beggar s trouble whatever it was must have overtaken him in bed and that that bed was either in the vicinity of the spot where he was found or else the man had been carried in a closed vehicle to the place where the constable discovered him A chap can t walk far in that kind of a get up without attracting attention And the body was warm you say when found Hum m Any vehicle seen or heard in the vicinity of the spot just previously Not the ghost of one The night was very still and the constable must have heard if either cab auto carriage or dray had passed in any direction whatsoever He is positive that none did Naturally he thought as you suggested just now that the man must have come from some house in the neighbourhood Investigation however proved that he did not in short that nobody could be found who had ever seen him before Indeed it is hardly likely that he could have been sleeping in any of the surrounding houses for the neighbourhood is a very good one and the man had the appearance of being a person of the labouring class Any marks on the clothing or body Not one beyond a tattooed heart on the left forearm which caused the coroner to come to the conclusion later that the man had at some time been either a soldier or a sailor Why The tattooing was evidently of foreign origin he said from the skilful manner in which it had been performed and the brilliant colour of the pigments used Beyond that the body bore no blemish The man had not been stabbed he had not been shot and a post mortem examination of the viscera proved conclusively that he had not been poisoned Neither had he been strangled etherized drowned or bludgeoned for the brain was in no way injured and the lungs were in a healthy condition It was noticed however that the passages of the throat and nose were unduly red and that there was a slightly distended condition of the bowels This latter however was set down by the physicians as the natural condition following enteric from which it was positive that the man had recently suffered They attributed the slightly inflamed condition of the nasal passage and throat to his having either swallowed or snuffed up something camphor or something of that sort to allay the progress of the enteric although even by analysis they were unable to discover a trace of camphor or indeed of any foreign substance whatsoever The body was held in the public mortuary for several days awaiting identification but nobody came forward to claim it so it was eventually buried in the usual way and a verdict of Found Dead entered in the archives against the number given to it The matter had excited but little comment on the part of the public or the newspapers and would never have been recalled but for the astonishing fact that just two nights after the burial a second man was found under precisely similar circumstances only that this second man was clad in boots undervest and trousers He was found in a sort of gulley down which from the marks on the side he had evidently fallen behind some furze bushes at a far and little frequented part of the heath An autopsy established the fact that this man had died in a precisely similar manner to the first but what was more startling that he had evidently pre deceased that first victim by several days for when found decomposition had already set in Hum m m I see said Cleek arching his brows and stirring his tea rather slowly A clear case of what Paddy would term the second fellow being the first one Go on please What next Oh a perfect fever of excitement of course for it now became evident that a crime had been committed in both instances and the Press made a great to do over it Within the course of the next fortnight it was positively frothing throwing panic into the public mind by the wholesale and whipping up people s fears like a madman stirring a salad for by that time a third body had been found under some furze bushes upward of half a mile distant from where the second had been discovered Like the first body this one was wearing night clothes but it was in an even more advanced state of decomposition than the second showing that the man must have died long before either of them Oho said Cleek with a strong rising inflection What a blundering idiot Our assassin is evidently a raw hand at the game mister Narkom and not as I had begun to fancy either a professional or the appointed agent of some secret society following a process of extermination against certain marked men Neither the secret agent nor the professional bandit would be guilty of the extreme folly of operating several times in the same locality be assured and here is this muddling amateur letting himself be lulled into a feeling of security by the failure of anybody to discover the bodies of the first victims and then going at it again in the same place and the same way For it is fair to assume I daresay that the fourth man was discovered under precisely similar circumstances to the first Not exactly very like them but not exactly like them Cleek As a matter of fact he was alive when found I didn t credit the report when I first heard it a newspaper man brought it to me and sent Petrie to investigate the truth of it Why didn t you believe the report Because it seemed so wildly improbable And besides they had hatched up so many yarns those newspaper reporters since the affair began According to this fellow a tramp crossing the heath in quest of a place to sleep had been frightened half out of his wits by hearing a voice which he described as being like the voice of some one strangling calling out in the darkness Sapphires Sapphires and a few moments later when as the reporter said the tramp told him he was scuttling away in a panic he came suddenly upon the figure of a man who was dancing round and round like a whirling dervish with his mouth wide open his tongue hanging out and the forefinger of each hand stuck in his nostril as if What s that What s that Cleek s voice flicked in like the crack of a whip Good God Dancing round in circles His mouth open His tongue hanging out His fingers thrust into his nostrils Was that what you said Yes Why Do you see anything promising in that fact Cleek It seems to excite you Never mind about that Stick to the subject Was that report found to be correct then In a measure yes Only of course one had to take the tramp s assertion that the man had been calling out Sapphires upon faith for when discovered and conveyed to the hospital he was in a comatose condition and beyond making any sound at all He died without recovering consciousness about twenty minutes after Petrie s arrival and although the doctors performed a post mortem immediately after the breath had left his body there was not a trace of anything to be found that differed in the slightest from the other cases Heart brain liver lungs all were in a healthy condition and beyond the reddened throat and the signs of recent enteric there was nothing abnormal But his lips his lips mister Narkom Was there a smear of earth upon them Was he lying on his face when found Were his fingers clenched in the grass Did it look as if he had been biting the soil Yes replied Narkom As a matter of fact there was both earth and grass in the mouth The doctors removed it carefully examined it under the microscope even subjected it to chemical test in the hope of discovering some foreign substance mixed with the mass but failed utterly to discover a single trace Of course of course It would be gone like a breath gone like a passing cloud if it were that If it were what Cleek my dear fellow Good Lord you don t mean to tell me you ve got a clue Perhaps perhaps don t worry me he made answer testily then rose and walked over to the window and stood there alone pinching his chin between his thumb and forefinger and staring fixedly at things beyond After a time however Yes it could be that assuredly it could be that he said in a low sunk voice as if answering a query But in England in this far land In Malay yes in Ceylon certainly And sapphires too sapphires Hum m m They mine them there One man had travelled in foreign parts and been tattooed by natives So that the selfsame country Just so Of course Of course But who But how And in England His voice dropped off He stood for a minute or so in absolute silence drumming noiselessly with his finger tips upon the window sill then turned abruptly and spoke to mister Narkom Go on with the story please he said There was a fifth man I believe When and how did his end come Like the others for the most part but with one startling difference instead of being undressed nothing had been removed but his collar and boots He was killed on the night I started with Dollops for the Continent in quest of you and his was the second body that was not actually found on the heath Like the first man he was found under the wall which surrounds Lemmingham House Lemmingham House What s that a hotel or a private residence A private residence owned and occupied by mister James Barrington Edwards Any relation to that Captain Barrington Edwards who was cashiered from the army some twenty years ago for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman The same man Oho the same man eh Cleek s tone was full of sudden interest Stop a bit Let me put my thinking box into operation Captain Barrington Edwards hum m m That little military unpleasantness happened out in Ceylon did it not The gentleman had a fancy for conjuring tricks I believe even went so far as to study them firsthand under the tutelage of native fakirs and was subsequently caught cheating at cards That s the man isn t it Yes said Narkom that s the man I ll have something startling to tell you in connection with him presently but not in connection with that card cheating scandal He always swore that he was innocent of that In fact that it was a put up job by one of the other officers for the sake of ruining him Yes I know they all say that It s the only thing they can say Still I always believed him Cleek He s been a pretty straightforward man in all my dealings with him and I ve had several Besides which he is highly respected these days Then too there s the fact that the fellow he said put up the job against him for the sake of blackening him in the eyes of his sweetheart eventually married the girl so it does look rather fishy However although it ruined Barrington Edwards for the time being and embittered him so that he never married he certainly had the satisfaction of knowing that the fellow who had caused this trouble turned out an absolute rotter spent all his wife s money and brought her down to absolute beggary whereas if she d stuck to Barrington Edwards she d have been a wealthy woman indeed to day He s worth half a million at the least calculation How s that Somebody die and leave him a fortune No He had a little of his own Speculated while he was in the East in precious stones and land which he had reason to believe likely to produce them succeeded beyond his wildest hopes and is to day head of the firm of Barrington Edwards Morpeth Firmin the biggest dealers in precious stones that Hatton Garden can boast of Oho said Cleek I see I see and screwed round on his heel and looked out of the window again Then after a moment And mister Barrington Edwards lives in the neighbourhood of Hampstead Heath does he he asked quite calmly Alone No With his nephew and heir young mister Archer Blaine a dead sister s only child As a matter of fact it was mister Archer Blaine himself who discovered the body of the fifth victim Coming home at a quarter to one from a visit to an old college friend he found the man lying stone dead in the shadow of the wall surrounding Lemmingham House and of course lost no time in dashing indoors for a police whistle and summoning the constable on point duty in the district The body was at once given in charge of a hastily summoned detachment from the Yard and conveyed to the Hampstead mortuary where it still lies awaiting identification Been photographed Not as yet Of course it will be as were the other four prior to the time of burial should nobody turn up to claim it But in this instance we have great hopes that identification will take place on the strength of a marked peculiarity The man is web footed and The man is what rapped in Cleek excitedly Web footed repeated Narkom The several toes are attached one to the other by a thin membrane after the manner of a duck s feet and on the left foot there is a peculiar horny protuberance like Like a rudimentary sixth toe interrupted Cleek fairly flinging the eager query at him It is eh Well by the Eternal I once knew a fellow years ago in the Far East whose feet were malformed like that and if by any possibility Stop a bit A word more Is that man a big fellow broad shouldered muscular and about forty or forty five years of age You ve described him to a T dear chap There is however a certain other peculiarity which you have not mentioned though that of course maybe a recent acquirement The palm of the right hand Wait a bit Wait a bit interposed Cleek a trifle irritably He had swung away from the window and was now walking up and down the room with short nervous steps his chin pinched up between his thumb and forefinger his brows knotted and his eyes fixed upon the floor Saffragam Jaffna Trincomalee In all three of them in all three he said putting his running thoughts into muttered words And now a dead man sticks his fingers in his nostrils and talks of sapphires Sapphires eh And the Saffragam district stuck thick with them as spangles on a Nautch girl s veil The Bareva for a ducat The Bareva Reef or I m a Dutchman And Barrington Edwards was in that with the rest So was Peabody so was Miles and so too were Lieutenant Edgburn and the Spaniard Juan Alvarez Eight of them b gad eight And I was ass enough to forget idiot enough not to catch the connection until I heard again of Jim Peabody s web foot But wait Stop there should be another marked foot if this is indeed a clue to the riddle and so He stopped short in his restless pacing and faced round on mister Narkom Tell me something he said in a sharp staccato The four other dead men did any among them have an injured foot the left or the right I forget which from which all toes but the big one had been torn off by a crocodile s bite so that in life the fellow must have limped a little when he walked Did any of the dead men bear a mark like that No said Narkom The feet of all the others were normal in every particular Hum m m That s a bit of a setback And I am either on the wrong track or Alvarez is still alive What s that Oh it doesn t matter a mere fancy of mine that s all Now let us get back to our mutton please You were going to tell me something about the right hand of the man with the web foot What was it The palm bore certain curious hieroglyphics traced upon it in bright purple Hieroglyphics eh That doesn t look quite so promising said Cleek in a disappointed tone It is quite possible that there may be more than one web footed man in the world so of course Hum m m What were these hieroglyphics mister Narkom Can you describe them I can do better my dear chap replied the superintendent dipping into an inner pocket and bringing forth a brown leather case I took an accurate tracing of them from the dead hand this morning and there you are That s what s on his palm Cleek close to the base of the forefinger running diagonally across it Cleek took the slip of tracing paper and carried it to the window for the twilight was deepening and the room was filling with shadows In the middle of the thin transparent sheet was traced this Illustration of a handwritten message He turned it up and down he held it to the light and studied it for a moment or two in perplexed silence then of a sudden he faced round and Narkom could see that his eyes were shining and that the curious one sided smile peculiar unto him was looping up his cheek My friend he said answering the eager query in the superintendent s look this is yet another vindication of Poe s theory that things least hidden are best hidden and that the most complex mysteries are those which are based on the simplest principles With your permission I ll keep this tucking the tracing into his pocket and afterward I will go to the mortuary and inspect the original Meantime I will go so far as to tell you that I know the motive for these murders I know the means and if you will give me forty eight hours to solve the riddle at the end of that time I ll know the man I will even go farther and tell you the names of the victims and all on the evidence of your neat little tracing The web footed man was one James Peabody a farrier at one time attached to the Blue Cavalry at Trincomalee Ceylon Another was Joseph Miles an Irishman bitten early with the wanderlust which takes men everywhere and in making rolling stones of them suffers them to gather no moss Still another and probably from the tattoo mark on his arm the first victim found was Thomas Hart ablebodied seaman formerly in service on the P O line the remaining two were Alexander McCurdy a Scotchman and T Jenkins Quegg a Yankee The latter however was a naturalized Englishman and both were privates in her late Majesty s army and honourably discharged Cleek my dear fellow are you a magician said Narkom sinking into a chair overcome Oh no my friend merely a man with a memory that s all and I happen to remember a curious little pool that was made up of eight men Five of them are dead The other three are Juan Alvarez a Spaniard that Lieutenant Edgburn who married and beggared the girl Captain Barrington Edwards lost when he was disgraced and last of all the ex Captain Barrington Edwards himself Gently gently my friend Don t excite yourself All these murders have been committed with a definite purpose in view with a devil s instrument and for the devil s own stake riches Those riches mister Narkom were to come in the shape of precious stones the glorious sapphires of Ceylon And five of the eight men who were to reap the harvest of them died mysteriously in the vicinity of Lemmingham House Cleek My hat Narkom sprang up as he spoke and then sat down again in a sort of panic And he Barrington Edwards the man that lives there deals in precious stones Then that man Gently my friend gently don t bang away at the first rabbit that bolts out of the hole it may be a wee one and you ll lose the buck that follows Two men live in that house remember mister Archer Blaine is mister Barrington Edwards heir as well as his nephew and who knows CHAPTER III Cinnamon what a corroboration what a horrible corroboration Cleek you knock the last prop from under me you make certain a thing that I thought was only a woman s wild imaginings said Narkom getting up suddenly all a tremble with excitement Good heavens to have Miss Valmond s story corroborated in this dreadful way Miss Valmond Who s she Any relation to that Miss Rose Valmond whose name one sees in the papers so frequently in connection with gifts to Catholic Orphanages and Foundling Homes The same lady replied Narkom Her charities are numberless her life a psalm I think she has done more good in her simple undemonstrative way than half the guilds and missions in London She has an independent fortune and lives in company with an invalid and almost imbecile mother and a brother who is I am told studying for the priesthood in a beautiful home surrounded by splendid grounds the walls of which separate her garden from that of Lemmingham House Ah I see Then she is a neighbour of Barrington Edwards Yes From the back windows of her residence one can look into the grounds of his That is how Cleek mister Narkom s voice shook with agitation You will remember I said a little time back that I would have something startling to tell you in connection with Barrington Edwards something that was not connected with that old army scandal If it had not been for the high character of my informant if it had been any other woman in all England I should have thought she was suffering from nerves fancying things as the result of an overwrought mind sent into a state of hysteria through all those abominable crimes in the neighbourhood but when it was she when it was Miss Valmond Oho said Cleek screwing round suddenly Then Miss Valmond told you something with regard to Barrington Edwards Yes a horrible something She came to me this morning looking as I hope I shall never see a good woman look again as if she had been tortured to the last limit of human endurance She had been fighting a silent battle for weeks and weeks she said but her conscience would not let her keep the appalling secret any longer neither would her duty to Heaven Wakened in the dead of night by a sense of oppression she had gone to her window to open it for air and looking down by chance into the garden of Lemmingham House she had seen a man come rushing out of the rear door of Barrington Edwards place in his pajamas closely followed by another whom she believed to be Barrington Edwards himself and she had seen that man unlock the door in the side wall and push the poor wretch out into the road where he was afterward found by the constable By Jupiter Ah you may be moved when you connect that circumstance with what you have yourself unearthed But there is worse to come Unable to overcome a frightful fascination which drew her night after night to that window she saw that same thing happen again to the fourth and finally the fifth man the web footed one and that last time she saw the face of the pursuer quite plainly It was Barrington Edwards Sure of that was she Absolutely It was the positive certainty it was he that drove her at last to speak Cleek made no reply no comment merely screwed round on his heel and took to pacing the floor again After a minute however mister Narkom he said halting abruptly I suppose all my old duds are still in the locker of the limousine aren t they Good I thought so Give Lennard the signal will you I must risk the old car in an emergency like this Take me first to the cable office please then to the mortuary and afterward to Miss Valmond s home I hate to torture her further poor girl but I must get all the facts of this first hand He did The limousine was summoned at once and inside of an hour it set him down looking the very picture of a solicitor s clerk at the cable office then picked up and set him down at the Hampstead mortuary this time making so good a counterpart of Petrie that even Hammond who was on guard beside the dead man said Hullo Pete that you Thought you was off duty to day as he came in with the superintendent Jim Peabody fast enough mister Narkom commented Cleek when they were left together beside the dead man Changed of course in all the years but still poor old Jim Good hearted honest but illiterate Could barely more than write his name and even that without a capital poor chap Let me look at the hand A violet smudge on the top of the thumb as well as those marks on the palm I see Hum m m Any letters or writing of any sort in the pockets when found None eh That old bone handled pocket knife there his Yes I d like to look at it Open it please Thanks I thought so I thought so Those the socks he had on Poor wretch Down to that at last eh down to that Let me have one of them for a day or so will you and yes the photographs of the other four please Thanks very much No that s all Now then to call on Miss Valmond if you don t mind Right you are Let her go Lennard Down with the blinds and open with the locker again mister Narkom and we ll dig mister George Headland out of his two months old grave And at exactly ten minutes after eight o clock mister George Headland was dug up and was standing with mister Narkom in Rose Valmond s house listening to Rose Valmond s story from her own lips and saying to himself the while that here surely was that often talked of seldom seen creature a woman with an angel s face How it distressed her to tell again this story which might take away a human life was manifest from the trembling of her sweet voice the painful twitching of her tender mouth and the tears that rose so readily to her soft eyes Oh mister Headland I can hardly reconcile myself to having done it even yet she said pathetically I do not know this mister Barrington Edwards but by sight and it seems such a horrible thing to rise up against a stranger like that But I couldn t keep it any longer I felt that to do so would be equivalent to sharing his guilt and the thought that if I kept silent I might possibly be paving the way to the sacrifice of other innocent lives almost drove me out of my mind I can quite understand your feelings Miss Valmond said Cleek touched to the very heart by the deep distress of her But may I say I think you have done right I never yet knew Heaven to be anything but tender to those who do their duty and you certainly have done yours to yourself to your fellow creatures and to God Before she could make any response to this footsteps sounded from the outer passage and a deep rich masculine voice said Rose Rose dear I am ready now and almost in the same moment a tall well set up man in priestly clothing crossed the threshold and entered the room He stopped short as he saw the others and made a hasty apology Oh pardon me he said I did not know that you had visitors dear otherwise Eh what mister Narkom is it not Yes mister Valmond replied the superintendent holding out a welcoming hand It is I and this is my friend and assistant mister George Headland We have just been talking with your sister over her trying experience Terrible terrible is the proper word mister Narkom Like you I never heard of it until to day It shocked me to the very soul you may believe Delighted to meet you mister Headland A new disciple eh mister Narkom Another follower in the footsteps of the great Cleek By the way I see you have lost touch with that amazing man I saw your advertisement in the paper the other day Any clue to his whereabouts as yet Not the slightest Ah that s too bad From what I have heard of him he would have made short work of this present case had he been available But pray pardon me if I rush off my time is very limited Rose dear I am going to visit Father Burns this evening and shall stop at the orphanage on the way so if you have the customary parcel for the children It is upstairs in my oratory dear she interposed Come with me if the gentlemen will excuse us for a moment and I will get it for you May we not all go up Miss Valmond interposed Cleek I should like if you do not mind to get a view of the garden of Lemmingham House from the window where you were standing that night and to have you explain the positions of the two men if you will Yes certainly come by all means she replied and led the way forthwith They had scarcely gone halfway down the passage to the staircase however when they came abreast of the open doorway of a room dimly lit by a shaded lamp wherein an elderly woman sat huddled up in a deep chair with her shaking head bowed over hands that moved restlessly and aimlessly after the uneasy manner of an idiot s and the shape of whose face could be but faintly seen through the veil of white hair that fell loosely over it Cleek had barely time to recall Narkom s statement regarding the semi imbecile mother when Miss Valmond gave a little cry of wonder and ran into the room Why mother she said in her gentle way whatever are you doing down here dearest I thought you were still asleep in the oratory When did you come down The imbecile merely mumbled and muttered and shook her nodding head neither answering nor taking any notice whatsoever It is one of her bad nights explained Miss Valmond as she came out and rejoined them We can do nothing with her when she is like this Horace you will have to come home earlier than usual to night and help me to get her to bed Then she went on leading the way upstairs until they came at length to a sort of sanctuary where Madonna faces looked down from sombre niches and wax lights burnt with a scented flame on a draped and cushioned prie dieu Here Miss Valmond who was in the lead went in and taking a paper wrapped parcel from beside the little altar came back and put it in her brother s hand and sent him on his way Was it from there you saw the occurrence Miss Valmond asked Cleek looking past her into the dim religious light of the sanctuary Oh no she made reply From the window of my bedroom just on the other side of the wall In here look see And she opened a door to the right and led them in touching a key that flashed an electric lamp into radiance and illuminated the entire room It was a large room furnished in dull oak and dark green after the stately sombre style of a Gothic chapel and at one end there was a curtained recess leading to a large bow window At the other there was a sort of altar banked high with white flowers and at the side there was a huge canopied bed over the head of which hung an immense crucifix fastened to the wall that backed upon the oratory It was a majestic thing that crucifix richly carved and exquisitely designed Cleek went nearer and looked at it his artistic eye captured by the beauty of it and Miss Valmond noting his interest smiled My brother brought me that from Rome she said Is it not divine mister Headland Yes he said But you must be more careful of it I fear Miss Valmond Is it not chipping Look Isn t this a piece of it He bent and picked a tiny curled sliver of wood from the narrow space between the two down filled pillows of the bed holding it out to her upon his palm But of a sudden he smiled lifted the sliver to his nose smelt it and cast it away The laugh is on me I fear it s only a cedar paring from a lead pencil And now please I d like to investigate the window She led him to it at once explaining where she stood on the eventful night where she had seen the two figures pass and where was the wall door through which the dying man had been thrust I wish I might see that door clearer said Cleek for night had fallen and the moon was not yet up Don t happen to have such a thing as a telescope or an opera glass do you Miss Valmond My brother has a pair of field glasses downstairs in his room Shall I run and fetch them for you I d be very grateful if you would said Cleek and a moment after she had gone Run down and get my sketching materials out of the locker will you mister Narkom he added I want to make a diagram of that house and garden Then he sat down on the window seat and for five whole minutes was alone The field glasses and the sketching materials were brought the garden door examined and the diagram made Miss Valmond and Narkom standing by and watching eagerly the whole proceeding That s all said Cleek after a time brushing the charcoal dust from his fingers and snapping the elastic band over the sketch book I know my man at last mister Narkom Give me until ten o clock to morrow night and then if Miss Valmond will let us in here again I ll capture Barrington Edwards red handed You are sure of him then As sure as I am that I m alive I ll lay a trap that will catch him I promise you that So if Miss Valmond will let us in here again Yes mister Headland I will Good Then let us say at ten o clock to morrow night here in this room you I your brother mister Narkom all concerned said Cleek At ten to the tick remember Now come along mister Narkom and let me be about weaving the snare that shall pull this mister Barrington Edwards to the scaffold Speaking he bowed to Miss Valmond and taking mister Narkom s arm passed out and went down the stairs to prepare for the last great act of tragedy CHAPTER IV At ten to the tick on the following night he had said and at ten to the tick he was there the old red limousine whirling him up to the door in company with mister Narkom there to be admitted by Miss Valmond s brother My dear mister Headland I have been on thorns ever since I heard said he I hope and pray it is right this assistance we are giving But tell me please have you succeeded in your plans Are you sure they will not fail To both questions yes mister Valmond We ll have our man to night Now if you please where is your sister Upstairs in her own room with my mother We tried to get the mater to bed but she is very fractious to night and will not let Rose out of her sight for a single instant But she will not hamper your plans I m sure Come quickly please this way Here he led them on and up until they stood in Miss Valmond s bedroom and in Miss Valmond s presence again She was there by the window her imbecile mother sitting at her feet with her face in her daughter s lap that daughter s solicitous hand gently stroking her tumbled hair and no light but that of the moon through the broad window illuminating the hushed and stately room I keep my word you see Miss Valmond said Cleek as he entered And in five minutes time if you watch from that window you all shall see a thing that will amaze you You have run the wretched man down then mister Headland Yes to the last ditch to the wall itself he answered making room for her brother to get by him and make a place for himself at the window Oh it s a pretty little game he s been playing that gentleman and it dates back twenty years ago when he was kicked out of his regiment in Ceylon In Ceylon I er God bless my soul was he ever in Ceylon mister Headland Yes mister Valmond he was It was at a time when there was what you might call a sapphire fever raging there and precious stones were being unearthed in every unheard of quarter He got the fever with the rest but he hadn t much money so when he fell in with a lot of fellows who had heard of a Cingalese one Bareva Singh who had a reef to sell in the Saffragam district they made a pool between them and bought the blessed thing calling it after the man they had purchased it from the Bareva Reef setting out like a party of donkeys to mine it for themselves and expecting to pull out sapphires by the bucketful Dear me dear me how very extraordinary Of course they didn t Or did they No they didn t A month s work convinced them that the ground was as empty of treasure as an eggshell so they abandoned it separated and went their several ways A few months ago however it was discovered that if they had had the implements to mine deeper their dream would have been realized for the reef was a perfect bed of sapphires and eight men held an equal share in it The scheme then was to get rid of these men secretly one by one for one perhaps two men to get the deeds held by the others to pretend that they had been purchased from the original owners and to prevent by murder those original owners from Illustration Got you Miss Rosie Edgburn Got you Senor Juan Alvarez rapped Cleek Stop him nab him mister Narkom He stopped suddenly and switched round Miss Valmond had risen and so had her mother He was on the pair of them like a leaping cat there was a sharp click click a snarl and a scream and one end of a handcuff was on the wrist of each Got you Miss Rosie Edgburn Got you Senor Juan Alvarez he rapped out sharply then in a louder tone as the Reverend Horace made a bolt for the door Stop him nab him mister Narkom Quick Played sir played Come in Petrie come in Hammond Gentlemen here they are all three of them Lieutenant Eric Edgburn his daughter Rose and Senor Juan Alvarez the three brute beasts who sent five men to their death for the sake of a lode of sapphires and the devil s lust for gain It s a lie flung out the girl who had been known as Rose Valmond Oh no it s not you vixen You loathsome creature that prostituted holy things and made a shield of religion to carry on a vampire s deeds Look here you beast of blasphemy I know the secret of this he said and walked over and laid his hand on the crucifix at the head of the bed Petrie round into the oratory with you There s a nob at the side of the prayer desk press it when I shout Oh no Miss Edgburn no I shan t dance circles nor put my fingers into my nose nor bite the dust and die Look how I dare it all Now Petrie now And lo as he spoke out of the nostrils of the figure on the cross there rushed downward two streams of white vapour which beat upon the pillows and upon him smothering both in white dust Face powder Miss Edgburn only face powder from your own little case over there he said I removed the devil s dust last night when I was in this room alone She made him no reply only like a cornered wretch screamed out and fainted mister Narkom you have seen the method of administering the thing which caused the death of those five men it is now only fair that you should know what that thing was he said turning to the superintendent It is known by two names Devil s Dust and Dust of Death and both suit it well It is the fine feathery powder that grows on the young shoots of the bamboo tree a favourite method of secret killing with the natives of the Malay Peninsula and those of Madagascar the Philippines and Ceylon When blown into the nostrils of a living creature it produces first an awful agony of suffocation a feeling as though the brain is coming down and exuding from the nostrils then delirium during which the victim invariably falls on his face and bites the earth then comes death Death without a trace my friend for the hellish dust all but evaporates and the slight sediment that remains is carried out of the system by the spasm of enteric it produces That is the riddle s solution As for the rest those men were lured here by letters from Alvarez telling them of the reef s great fortune of the necessity for coming at once and bringing their deeds with them and impressing upon them the possibility of being defrauded if they breathed one word to a mortal soul about their leaving or why They came they were invited to spend the night and to sleep upon that accursed bed and the devil s dust did the rest I traced that out through poor Jim Peabody s sock It was one of the blue yarn kind that are given to the inmates of workhouses I traced him through that and the others through the photographs Each had been known to have received a letter from London and each had in turn vanished without a word Poor chaps Poor unhappy chaps Let us hope dear friend that they have found the Place of Sapphires after all CHAPTER V How did I come to suspect the girl said Cleek answering Narkom s query as they swung off through the darkness in the red limousine leaving Edgburn and his confederates in the hands of the police Well as a matter of fact I did not suspect her at all in the beginning her saintly reputation saved her from any such thing as that It was only when her father came in that I knew And later I knew even better when I saw that pretended imbecile sitting there in that room for the blundering fool had been ass enough to kick off his slippers and sit there in his stocking feet and I spotted the Alvarez foot on the instant Still I didn t know but what the girl herself might be an innocent victim a sort of dove in a vulture s nest and it was not until I found that scrap of wood from a sharpened lead pencil that I began to doubt her It was only when I promised that Barrington Edwards should be trapped that I actually knew The light that flamed in her eyes in spite of her at that would have made an idiot understand What s that What should I suspect from the finding of that scrap of pencil My dear mister Narkom carry your mind back to that moment when I found the stain on poor Jim Peabody s thumb and then examined the blade of his pocket knife The marks on the latter showed clearly that the man had sharpened a pencil with it and of course with the point of that pencil against the top of his thumb By the peculiar bronze like shine of the streaks and the small particles of dust adhering to the knife blade I felt persuaded that the pencil was an indelible one in short one of those which write a faint blackish lilac hue which on the application of moisture turns to a vivid and indelible purple The moisture induced by the act of thrusting his forefingers up his nostrils to allay the horrible sensation of the brain descending which that hellish powder produces together with the perspiration which comes with intense agony had made such a change in the smears his thumb and forefinger bore and left no room for doubt that at the time he was smitten he had either just begun or just concluded writing something with an indelible pencil which he had but recently sharpened Poor wretch he of all the lot had some one belonging to him that was still living his poor old mother It is very fair to suppose that finding the Alvarez place so lavishly furnished and having hopes that great riches were yet to be his he sat down on that bed and began to write a few lines in his illiterate way to that mother before wholly undressing and getting between the sheets The mark on his palm is a clear proof that when the powder suddenly descended upon him he involuntarily closed his hand on that letter and the perspiration transferred to his flesh the shape of the scrawl upon which it rested Pardon How did I know through that scrawl that I was really on the track and that it was the Bareva Reef that was at the bottom of the whole game My dear mister Narkom I won t insult your intelligence by explaining that All you have to do is to turn that tracing upside down and look through it or at it in a mirror and you ll have the answer for yourself What s that The parcel the girl gave Edgburn to carry out on the pretext of taking it to an orphanage Oh that was how they were slowly getting rid of the victims clothes Cutting them up into little pieces and throwing them into the river I suppose or if not He stopped suddenly his ear caught by a warning sound then turned in his seat and glanced through the little window at the back of the limousine I thought as much he said half aloud then leaned forward caught up the pipe of the speaking tube and signalled Lennard Look sharp taxi following us he said Put on a sudden spurt that chap will increase speed to keep pace with us then pull up sharp and let the other fellow s impetus carry him by before he can help himself Out with the light mister Narkom out with it quick Both Lennard and his master followed instructions Of a sudden the lights flicked out the car leapt forward with a bound then pulled up with a jerk that shook it from end to end In that moment the taxi in the rear whizzed by them and Narkom leaning forward to look as it flashed past saw seated within it the figure of Count Waldemar of Mauravania By James Did you see that Cleek he cried and switched round and made a grab for Cleek s arm But Cleek was not there His seat was empty and the door beside it was swinging ajar Well I ll be jiggered exclaimed the superintendent fairly carried out of himself for even in his old Vanishing Cracksman s days when he had slipped the leash and eluded the police so often the man had not made a more adroit more silent more successful getaway than this Of all the astonishing Gad an eel s a fool to him for slipping out of tight places When did he go I wonder and where Never very strong on matters of detail here curiosity tricked him into absolute indiscretion Sliding along the seat to the swinging door he thrust it open and leaned out into the darkness for a purpose so evident that he who ran might read That one who ran did he had good reason to understand in the next instant for of a sudden the taxi in advance checked its wild flight swung round with a noisy scroo op and pelted back until the two vehicles stood cheek by jowl so to speak and the glare of its headlights was pouring full force upon mister Narkom and into the interior of the red limousine Here Dash your infernal impudence began he blinking up at the driver through a glare which prevented him seeing that the taxicab s leather blinds had been discreetly pulled down and its interior rendered quite invisible but before he could add so much as another word to his protest the chauffeur s voice broke in with a blandness and an accent which told its own story Dix mille pardons m sieur it commenced then pulled itself up as if the owner of it had suddenly recollected himself and added abruptly in a farcical attempt to imitate the jargon of the fast disappearing London cabby Keep of the air on ole coq Only wantin to arsk of the question civile Lost my bloomin way Put a cove on to the short cut to the Igh Street will yer like a blessed Christian I dunno where I are mister Narkom was not suffered to make reply Before he had more than grasped the fact that the speaker was undeniably a Frenchman Lennard out of the range of that dazzling light had made the discovery that he was yet more undeniably a Frenchman of that class from which the Apaches are recruited and stepped into the breach with astonishing adroitness Oh that s the trouble is it he interposed My hat Why of course we ll put you on the way Wot s more we ll take you along and show you won t we guv ner eh so as you won t go astray till you gets there Eads in and door shut Superintendent bringing the limousine around until it pointed in the same direction as the taxicab Now then straight ahead and foller yer nose Jules we ll be rubbin shoulders with you the whole blessed way And as the Dook of Wellington said to Napoleon Bonaparte None of your larks you blighter you re a comin along with me That he was was a condition of affairs so inevitable that the chauffeur made no attempt to evade it merely put on speed and headed straight for the distant High Street for the purpose of getting rid of his escort as soon as possible and Lennard putting on speed likewise and keeping pace with him ran him neck and neck until the heath was left far and away behind the darkness gave place to a glitter of street lamps the lonely roads to populous thoroughfares and the way was left clear for Cleek to get off unfollowed and unmolested CHAPTER VI Screened by that darkness and close sheltered by the matted gorse which fringed and dotted the expanse of the nearby heath he had been an interested witness to the entire proceeding Played my lad played he commented putting his thoughts into mumbled words of laughing approval as Lennard taking the taxicab under guard escorted it and its occupants out of the immediate neighbourhood then excessive caution prompting him to quell even this little ebullition he shut up like an oyster and neither spoke nor moved nor made any sound until the two vehicles were represented by nothing but a purring noise dwindling away into the distance When that time came however he rose and facing the heath forged out across its mist wrapped breadth with that long swinging soldierly stride peculiar unto him his forehead puckered with troubled thought his jaw clamped and his lips compressed until his mouth seemed nothing more than a bleak slit gashed in a gray unpleasant looking mask But after a while the night and the time and the place worked their own spell and the troubled look dropped away the dull eyes lighted the grim features softened and the curious crooked smile that was Nature s birth gift to him broke down the rigid lines of the bleak slit and looped up one corner of his mouth It was magic ground this heath a place thick set as the Caves of Manheur with the Sapphires of Memory and to a nature such as his these things could not but appeal Here Dollops had come into his life a starveling an outcast derelict even in the very morning time of youth a bit of human wreckage that another ten minutes would have seen stranded forever upon the reefs of crime Here too on that selfsame night when the devil had been cheated and the boy had gone and they two stood alone together in the mist and darkness he had first laid aside the mask of respectability and told Ailsa Lorne the truth about himself Of his Apache times of his Vanishing Cracksman s days and in the telling had watched the light die out of her dear eyes and dread of him darken them when she knew But not for always thank God For in later days when Time had lessened the shock when she came to know him better when the threads of their two lives had become more closely woven and the hope had grown to be something more than a mere possibility He laughed aloud remembering and with a sudden rush of animal spirits twitched off his hat flung it up and caught it as it fell after the manner of a happy boy God what a world what a glorious glorious world All things were possible in it if a man but walked straight and knew how to wait Well please God a part at least of his long waiting would be over in another month She would be back in England then her long visit to the Hawksleys ended and nothing before her now but the pleasant excitement of trousseau days For the coming autumn would see the final act of restitution made the last Vanishing Cracksman debt paid to the uttermost farthing and when that time came He flung up his hat again and shouted from sheer excess of joy and forged on through the mist and darkness whistling His way lay across the great common to the Vale of Health district and thence down a slanting road and a sloping street to the Hampstead Heath Station of the Tube Railway and he covered the distance to such good effect that half past eleven found him down under swaying to the rhythmic movement of an electric train and arrowing through the earth at a lively clip Ten minutes later he changed over to yet another underground system swung on for half an hour or so through gloom and bad air and the musty smell of a damp tunnel before the drop of the land and the rise of the roadbed carried the train out into the open and the air came fresh and sweet and pure as God made it over field and flood and dewy garden spaces and away to the west a prickle of lights on a quiet river told where the stars mirrored themselves in the glass of Father Thames At a toy station in the hush and loneliness of the pleasant country ways his long ride came to an end at last and he swung off into the balm and fragrance of the night to face a two mile walk along quiet shadow filled lanes and over wet wastes of young bracken to a wee little house in the heart of a green wilderness with a high walled old world garden surrounding it and in the far background a gloom of woodland smeared in darker purple against the purple darkness of the sky No light shone out from the house to greet him no light could come from behind that screening wall unless it were one set in an upper window yet he was certain the place was not deserted for as he came up out of the darkness catlike of tread and catlike of ear he was willing to swear that he could catch the sound of some one moving about restlessly in the shadow of that high brick wall and the experiences of the night made him cautious of things that moved in darkness He stopped short and remained absolutely still for half a minute then stooping swished his hand through the bracken in excellent imitation of a small animal running and shrilled out a note that was uncannily like the death squeal of a stoat caught rabbit Gawd s truth guv ner is it you at last sir And me never seein nor hearin a blessed thing spoke a voice in answer from the wall s foot then a latch clicked and as Cleek rose to his feet a garden door swung inward a rectangle of light shone in the darkness and silhouetted against it stood Dollops What are you doing out here at this time of night you young monkey Don t you know it s almost one o clock said Cleek as he went forward and joined the boy Don t I know it says you Don t I just he gave back There aren t a minute since the night come on that I haven t counted sir not a bloomin one and if you hadn t turned up just as you did Well let that pass as the Suffragette said when she heaved arf a brick through the shop window Gawd s truth guv ner do you realise that you ve been gone since yesterday afternoon and I haven t heard a word from you in all that time Well what of that It s not the first time by dozens that I ve done the same thing Why should it worry you at this late day Look here my young man you re not developing nerves are you Because if you are Turn round and let s have a look at you Why you are as pale as a ghost you young beggar and shaking like a leaf Anything wrong with you old chap Not as I knows of returned Dollops making a brave attempt to smile and be his old happy go lucky whimsical self albeit he wasn t carrying it off quite successfully for there was a droop to his smile and a sort of whimper underlying his voice and Cleek s keen eyes saw that his hand groped about blindly in its effort to find the fastenings of the garden door Leastwise nothing as matters now that you are here sir And I am glad yer back guv ner Lawd yuss Nothin like company to buck you up as the bull said when he tossed the tinker so of course Here You let those fastenings alone I ll attend to them rapped in Cleek s voice with a curious note of alarm in it as he moved briskly forward and barred and locked the wall door If I didn t know that eating not drinking was your particular failing Here he stopped his half uttered comment cut into by a bleating cry and he screwed round to face a startling situation For there was Dollops leaning heavily against a flowering almond tree his face like a dead face for colour and his fingers clawing frantically at the lower part of his waistcoat doubling and twisting in the throes of an internal convulsion The gravelled pathway gave forth two sharp scrunches and Cleek was just in time to catch him as he lurched forward and sprawled heavily against him The man s arms closed instinctively about the twisting sweat drenched helpless shape and with great haste and infinite tenderness gathered it up and carried it into the house but he had scarcely more than laid the boy upon a sofa and lit the lamp of the small apartment which served them as a general living room when all the agony of uncertainty which beset his mind regarding the genesis of this terrifying attack vanished in a sudden rush of enlightenment All that was left of a bounteous and strikingly diversified afternoon tea still littered the small round dining table and there on one plate lay the shells of two crabs on another the remains of a large rhubarb tart on a third the skins of five bananas leaning coquettishly up against the lid of an open pickle jar and hard by there was a pint tumbler with the white blur of milk dimming it Good Lord The young anaconda blurted out Cleek as he stood and stared at this appalling array No wonder no wonder Then he turned round on his heel looked at the writhing and moaning boy and in a sudden fever of doing peeled off his coat rolled up his sleeves and made a bolt for the kitchen stove the hot water kettle and the medicine chest The result of Master Dollops little gastronomic experiment scarcely needs to be recorded It is sufficient to say that he had the time of his life that night that he kept Cleek busy every minute for the next twenty four hours wringing out flannels in hot water and dosing him with homely remedies and that when he finally came through the siege was as limp as a wet newspaper and as feeble as a good many dry ones What you need to pull yourself together is a change you reckless young ostrich a week s roughing it in the open country by field and stream and as many miles as possible from so much as the odour of a pastry cook s shop said Cleek patting him gently upon the shoulder A nice sort of assistant you are keeping a man out of his bed for twenty four hours with his heart in his mouth and his hair on end you young beggar Now now now None of your blubbing Sit tight while I run down and make some gruel for you After that I ll nip out and phone through to the Yard and tell mister Narkom to have somebody look up a caravan that can be hired and we ll be off for a week s gypsying in Yorkshire old chap He did coming back later with a piece of surprising news For it just so happened that the idea of a week s holiday making a week s rambling about the green lanes the broad moors and through the wild gorges of the West Riding and living the simple life in a caravan appealed to mister Maverick Narkom as being the most desirable thing in the world at that moment and he made haste to ask Cleek s permission to share the holiday with him As nothing could have been more to his great ally s liking the matter was settled forthwith A caravan was hired by telegram to Sheffield and at ten the next morning the little party turned its back upon London and fared forth to the pleasant country lands the charm of laughing waters and the magic that hides in trees For five days they led an absolutely idyllic life loafing in green wildernesses and sleeping in the shadow of whispering woods and this getting back to nature proved as much of a tonic to the two men as to the boy himself refreshing both mind and body putting red blood into their veins and breathing the breath of God into their nostrils Having amply provisioned the caravan before starting they went no nearer to any human habitation than they were obliged to do in passing from one district to another and one day was so exact a pattern of the next that its history might have stood for them all up with the dawn and the birds and into woodland pool or tree shaded river then gathering fuel and making a fire and cooking breakfast then washing the utensils harnessing the horses and moving on again sometimes Cleek driving sometimes Narkom sometimes the boy stopping when they were hungry to prepare lunch just as they had prepared breakfast then forging on again until they found some tree hedged dell or bosky wood where they might spend the night crooned to sleep by the wind in the leaves and watched over by the sentinel stars So they had spent the major part of the week and so they might have spent it all but that chance chose to thrust them suddenly out of idleness into activity and to bring them here in this Arcadia face to face again with the evils of mankind and the harsh duty of the law It had gone nine o clock on that fifth night when a curious thing happened they had halted for the night by the banks of a shallow chattering stream which flowed through a wayside spinney beyond whose clustering treetops they had seen before the light failed the castellated top of a distant tower and farther afield the weathercock on an uplifting church spire they had supped and were enjoying their ease the two men sprawling at full length on the ground enjoying a comfortable smoke while Dollops with a mouth harmonica was doing Knocked Em in the Old Kent Road his back against a tree his eyes upturned in ecstasy his long legs stretched out upon the turf and his feet crossed one over the other and all about them was peace all the sordid money grubbing crime stained world seemed millions of miles away when of a sudden there came a swift rush of bodies trampling on dead leaves and brushing against live ones then a voice cried out commandingly Surrender yourselves in the name of the king and scrambling to a sitting position they looked up to find themselves confronted by a constable a gamekeeper and two farm labourers the one with drawn truncheon and the other three with cocked guns CHAPTER VII Hullo I say began mister Narkom in amazement Why what the dickens But he was suffered to get no farther You mind your P s and Q s I warn you that anything you say will be used against you interjected sharply and authoritatively the voice of the constable Hawkins you and Marlow keep close guard over these chaps while me and mister Simpkins looks round for the animal I said it would be the work of gypsies didn t I now mister Simpkins addressing the gamekeeper Come on and let s have a look for the beast Keep eyes peeled and gun at full cock mister Simpkins and give un both barrels if un makes to spring at us This be a sharp capture mister Simpkins what Aye but un seems to take it uncommon cool mister Nippers one of em s larfiin fit to bust hisself replied the gamekeeper as Cleek slapped both thighs and throwing back his head voiced an appreciative guffaw Un doan t look much loike gypsies either from t little as Ah can see of em in this tomfool loight Wait a bit till Ah scoop up an armful o leaves and throw em on the embers o fire yon He did so forthwith and the moment the dry leaves fell on the remnants of the fire which the caravanners had used to cook their evening meal there was a gush of aromatic smoke a sudden puff and then a broad ribbon of light rushed upward and dispelled every trace of darkness And by the aid of that ribbon of light mister Nippers saw something which made him almost collapse with astonishment and chagrin The great of the world may and often do forget their meetings with the small fry but the small fry never cease to remember their meetings with the great or to treasure a vivid remembrance of that immortal day when they were privileged to rub elbows with the elect Five years had passed since missus Maverick Narkom seeking a place wherein to spend the summer holidays with the little Narkoms and their nurses had let her choice fall upon Winton Old Bridges and had dwelt there for two whole months Three times during her sojourn her liege lord had come down for a week end with his wife and children and during one of these brief visits meeting mister Ephraim Nippers the village constable in the public highway he had deigned to stop and speak to the man and to present him with a sixpenny cigar Times had changed since then mister Nippers was now head constable for the district but he still kept that cigar under a glass shade on the drawing room whatnot and he still treasured a vivid recollection of the great man who had given it to him and whom he now saw sitting on the ground with his coat off and his waistcoat unbuttoned his moustache uncurled wisps of dried grass clinging to his tousled hair and all the dignity of office conspicuous by its absence Oh lummy said mister Nippers with a gulp Put down the hammers of them guns you two put em down quick It s mister Narkom mister Maverick Narkom superintendent at Scotland Yard Hullo exclaimed mister Narkom shading his eyes from the firelight and leaning forward to get a clearer view of the speaker How the dickens do you know that my man And who the dickens are you anyway Can t say that I remember ever seeing your face before mister Nippers hastened to explain that little experience of five years ago but the circumstance which had impressed itself so deeply upon his memory had passed entirely out of the superintendent s Oh that s it is it said he Can t say that I recall the occasion but missus Narkom certainly did stop at Winton Old Bridges some four or five summers ago so of course it s possible By the way my man what caused you to make this sudden descent upon us And what are these chaps who are with you bearing arms for Anything up Oh lummy sir yes A murder s just been committed leastwise it s only just been discovered but it can t have been long since it was committed mister Narkom for Miss Renfrew who found him sir and give the alarm she says as the poor dear gentleman was alive at a quarter to eight cause she looked into the room at that time to ask him if there was anything he wanted and he spoke up and told her no and went on with his figgerin just the same as usual As usual said Cleek Why do you say as usual my friend Was the man an accountant of some sort Lummy no sir A great inventor is what he is or was poor gentleman Reckon you must a heard of un some time or another most everybody has Nosworth is the name sir mister Septimus Nosworth of the Round House You could see the tower of it over yon if you was to step out into the road and get clear of these trees Cleek was on his feet like a flash Not the great Septimus Nosworth he questioned eagerly Not the man who invented Lithamite the greatest authority on high explosives in England Not that Septimus Nosworth surely Aye him s the one poor gentleman I thought it like as the name would be familiar sir A goodish few have heard of un one way and another Yes acquiesced Cleek Lithamite carried his name from one end of the globe to the other and his family affairs came into unusual prominence in consequence Widower wasn t he hard as nails and bitter as gall Had an only son hadn t he a wild young blade who went the pace took up with chorus girls music hall ladies and persons of that stripe and got kicked out from under the parental roof in consequence Lummy now think of you a knowin about all that said mister Nippers in amazement But then your bein with mister Narkom and him bein what he is why of course Scotland Yard it do know everything I m told sir Yes it reads the papers occasionally mister Nippers said Cleek I may take it from your reply may I not that I am correct regarding mister Septimus Nosworth s son Indeed yes sir right as rain Leastwise from what I ve heard I never see the young gentleman myself Them things you mention happened before mister Nosworth come to live in these parts a matter of some four years or more ago Alwuss had his laboratory here sir built it on the land he leased from Sir Ralph Droger s father in the early sixties and used to come over frequent and shut hisself in the Round House for days on end but never come here to live until after that flare up with Master Harry Come then and built livin quarters beside the Round House and after a piece fetched Miss Renfrew and old Patty Dax over to live with un Miss Renfrew and old Patty Dax Who are they Miss Renfrew is his niece sir darter of a dead sister Old Patty Dax she war the cook I dunno what her be now though her died six months ago and un hired Mistress Armroyd in her place French piece her am though bein widder of a Lancashire man and though I doan t much fancy foreigners nor their ways this I will say her keeps the house like a pin and her cookin s amazin tasty indeed yes You are an occasional caller in the servants hall I see mister Nippers said Cleek serenely as he took up his coat and shook it preparatory to putting it on I think mister Narkom that in the interests of the public at large it will be well for some one a little more efficient than the local constabulary to look into this case so if you don t mind making yourself a trifle more presentable it will be as well for us to get mister Nippers to show us the way to the scene of the tragedy While you are doing it I will put a few Headland questions to our friend here if you don t mind assuring him that I am competent to advise Right you are old chap said Narkom taking his cue Nippers this is mister George Headland one of the best of my Yard detectives He ll very likely give you a tip or two in the matter of detecting crimes if you pay attention to what he says Nippers paid attention forthwith The idea of being in consultation with any one connected with Scotland Yard tickled his very soul and in fancy he already saw his name getting into the newspapers of London and his fame spreading far beyond his native weald I won t trouble you for the full details of the murder mister Nippers said Cleek Those I fancy this Miss Renfrew will be able to supply when I see her For the present tell me how many other occupants does the house hold beyond these two of whom you have spoken Miss Renfrew and the cook missus Armroyd None sir but the scullery maid Emily and the parlour maid Clark But both of them is out to night sir havin went to a concert over at Beattie Corners A friend of Mistress Armroyd s sent her two tickets and her not bein able to go herself her thought it a pity for em to be wasted so her give em to the maids I see no male servants at all then No sir not one There s Jones the handy man as comes in mornin s to do the rough work and the haulin and carryin and things like that and there s the gardener and mister Kemper him as is mister Nosworth s assistant in the laboratory sir but none of em is ever in the house after five o clock Set against havin men sleep in the house was mister Nosworth swore as never another should after him and Master Harry had their fallin out Why sir he was that bitter he d never even allow mister Charles to set foot in the place just because him and Master Harry used to be friends which makes it precious hard on Miss Renfrew I can tell you As how Is this mister Charles connected with Miss Renfrew in any way Lummy yes sir he s her young man Been sweet on each other ever since they was in pinafores but never had no chance to marry because mister Charles mister Charles Drummond is his full name sir he hasn t one shillin to rub against another and Miss Renfrew she s a little worse off than him Never gets nothin I m told for keepin house for her uncle just her food and lodgin and clothes and her slavin like a nigger for him the whole blessed time Keeps his books and superintends the runnin of the house she do but never gets a brass farthin for it poor girl I don t like to speak ill of the dead mister Headland sir but this I must say A rare old skinflint was mister Septimus Nosworth wouldn t part with a groat unless un was forced to But praise be her ll get her dues now fegs yes unless old skinflint went and changed his will without her knowin Oho said Cleek with a strong rising inflection His will was made in Miss Renfrew s favour was it Aye That s why her come and put up with un and all his hardheartedness denyin her the pleasure o ever seein her young man just because him and Master Harry had been friends and playmates when t pair of un was just boys in knickers and broad collars There be a stone heart for you Rather Now one more question I think you said it was Miss Renfrew who gave the alarm when the murder was discovered mister Nippers How did she give it and to whom Eh now to me and Mistress Armroyd of course Me and her war sittin in the kitchen havin a bite o supper at the time Gorham he war there too in the beginnin but un didn t stop of course twouldn t a done for the pair of us to be off duty together Oh is Gorham a constable then Aye under constable second to me Got un appointed six months ago Him had just gone a bit of a time when Miss Renfrew come rushin in and shrieked out about the murder but he heard the rumpus and came poundin back of course I dunno what I d a done if un hadn t for Miss Renfrew her went from one faintin fit to another twas just orful Gorham helped Ah to carry her up to the sittin room wheer Mistress Armroyd burnt feathers under her nose and when we d got her round a bit we all three went outside and round to the laboratory That s when we first see the prints of the animal s feet Mistress Armroyd spied em first all over the flower bed just under the laboratory window Oho then that is what you meant when you alluded to an animal when you pounced down upon us was it I see One word more what kind of an animal was it Or couldn t you tell from the marks No sir I couldn t nobody could unless it might be Sir Ralph Droger He ll be like to if anybody Keeps all sorts of animals and birds and things in great cages in Droger Park does Sir Ralph One thing I can swear to though sir they warn t like the footprints of any animal as I ever see Theer be a picture o saint Jarge and the Dragon on the walls o Town Hall at Birchampton mister Headland sir and them footprints is more like the paws of that dragon than anything else I can call to mind Scaly and clawed they is like the thing as made em was part bird and part beast and they re a good twelve inches long every one of em Hum m m That s extraordinary Deeply imprinted are they Lummy yes sir The animal as made em must have weighed ten or twelve stone at least Soon as I see them sir I knowed I had my work cut out so I left Gorham in charge of the house rattled up these two men and mister Simpkins here which all three is employed at Droger Park sir and set out hot foot to look for gypsies Why Cause Mistress Armroyd she says as she see a gypsy lurkin round the place just before dark sir and he had a queer thing like a bear s muzzle in his hand Ah I see said Cleek and gave one of his odd smiles as he turned round and looked at the superintendent All ready mister Narkom Good Let us go over to the Round House and investigate this interesting case Dollops stop where you are and look after the caravan If we are away more than a couple of hours tumble into bed and go to sleep We may be a short time or we may be a long one In affairs like this one never knows Any ideas old chap queried Narkom in a whisper as they forged along together in the wake of Nippers and his three companions Yes a great many answered Cleek I am particularly anxious mister Narkom to have a look at those footprints and an interview with Miss Renfrew I want to meet that young lady very much indeed CHAPTER VIII Twenty minutes later his desires in that respect were granted and having been introduced by mister Nippers to the little gathering in the sitting room of the house of disaster as a friend of mine from Scotland Yard miss he found himself in the presence of one of those meek faced dove eyed mousy little bodies who seem born to be patient Griseldas and in looking at her he was minded of the description of Lady Jane in the poem Her pulse was slow milk white her skin She had not blood enough to sin Years of repression had told upon her and she looked older than she really was so old and so dragged out in fact that missus Armroyd the cook appeared youthful and attractive in contrast Indeed it was no wonder that mister Ephraim Nippers had been attracted by that good soul for although her hair was streaked with gray and her figure was of the sack of flour order and her eyes were assisted in their offices by a pair of steel bowed spectacles her face was still youthful in contour and mister Narkom looking at her concluded that at twenty four or twenty five she must have been a remarkably pretty and remarkably fascinating woman What Cleek s thoughts were upon that subject it is impossible to record for he merely gave her one look on coming into the room and then took no further notice of her whatsoever Indeed mister Headland I am glad I am very very glad that fortune has sent you into this neighbourhood at this terrible time said Miss Renfrew when Cleek was introduced I do not wish to say anything disparaging of mister Nippers but you can see for yourself how unfitted such men as he and his assistant are to handle an affair of this importance Indeed I cannot rid my mind of the thought that if more competent police were on duty here the murder would not have happened In short that the assassin whoever he maybe counted upon the blundering methods of these men as his passport to safety My own thought precisely said Cleek mister Nippers has given me a brief outline of the affair would you mind giving me the full details Miss Renfrew At what hour did mister Nosworth go into his laboratory Or don t you know exactly Yes I know to the fraction of a moment mister Headland I was looking at my watch at the time It was exactly eight minutes past seven We had been going over the monthly accounts together when he suddenly got up and without a word walked through that door over there It leads to a covered passage connecting the house proper with the laboratory That as you may have heard is a circular building with a castellated top It was built wholly and solely for the carrying on of his experiments There is but one floor and one window a very small one about six feet from the ground and on the side of the Round House which looks away from this building Nothing but the door to that is on this side light being supplied to the interior by a roof made entirely of heavy corrugated glass I see Then the place is like a huge tube Exactly and lined entirely with chilled steel Such few wooden appliances as are necessary for the equipment of the place are thickly coated with asbestos I made no comment when my uncle rose and walked in there without a word I never did For the past six or seven months he had been absorbed in working out the details of a new invention and I had become used to his jumping up like that and leaving me We never have supper in this house my uncle always called it a useless extravagance Instead we defer tea until six o clock and make that the final meal of the day It was exactly five minutes to seven when I finished my accounts and as I had had a hard day of it I decided to go to bed early after having first taken a walk as far as the old bridge where I hoped that somebody would be waiting for me I know said Cleek gently I have heard the story It would be mister Charles Drummond would it not Yes He was not there however Something must have prevented his coming Hum m m Go on please Before leaving the house it occurred to me that I ought to look into the laboratory and see if there was anything my uncle would be likely to need for the night as I intended to go straightway to bed on my return I did so He was sitting at his desk immediately under the one window of which I have spoken and with his back to me when I looked in He answered my inquiry with a curt No nothing Get out and don t worry me I immediately shut the door and left him returning here by way of the covered passage and going upstairs to make some necessary changes in my dress for the walk to the old bridge When I came down ready for my journey I looked at the clock on the mantel over there It was exactly seventeen minutes to eight o clock I had been a little longer in dressing than I had anticipated being so in order to save time in getting to the trysting place I concluded to make a short cut by going out of the rear door and crossing diagonally through our grounds instead of going by the public highway as usual I had scarcely more than crossed the threshold when I ran plump into Constable Gorham As he is rather a favourite with good missus Armroyd here I fancied that he had been paying her a visit and was just coming away from the kitchen Instead he rather startled me by stating that he had seen something which he thought best to come round and investigate In short that as he was patrolling the highway he had seen a man vault over the wall of our grounds and bending down dart out of sight like a hare He was almost positive that that man was Sir Ralph Droger Of course that frightened me almost out of my wits Why There was bad blood between my uncle and Sir Ralph Droger bitter bad blood As you perhaps know my uncle held this ground on a life lease from the Droger estate That is to say so long as he lived or refused to vacate that lease no Droger could oust him nor yet lift one spadeful of earth from the property Does Sir Ralph desire to do either He desires to do both Borings secretly made have manifested the fact that both Barnsley thick coal and iron ore underlie the place Sir Ralph wishes to tear down the Round House and this building and to begin mining operations My uncle who has been offered the full value of every stick and stone has always obstinately refused to budge one inch or to lessen the lease by one half hour It is for the term of my life he has always said and for the term of my life I ll hold it Oho said Cleek and then puckered up his lips as if about to whistle Under such circumstances went on Miss Renfrew it was only natural that I should be horribly frightened and only too willing to act upon the constable s suggestion that we at once look into the Round House and see if everything was right with my uncle Why should the constable suggest that Everybody in the neighbourhood knows of the bitter ill feeling existing between the two men so of course it was only natural Hum m m Yes Just so Did you act on Constable Gorham s suggestion then Yes I led the way in here and then up the covered passage to the laboratory and opened the door My uncle was sitting exactly as he had been when I looked in before his back to me and his face to the window but although he did not turn it was evident that he was annoyed by my disturbing him for he growled angrily What the devil are you coming in here and disturbing me like this for Jane Get out and leave me alone Hum m m said Cleek drawing down his brows and pinching his chin Any mirrors in the Round House Mirrors No certainly not mister Headland Why Nothing only that I was wondering if as you say he never turned and you never spoke how in the world he knew that it really was you that s all Oh I see what you mean said Miss Renfrew knotting up her brows It does seem a little peculiar when one looks at it in that way I never thought of it before Neither can I explain it mister Headland any more than to say that I suppose he took it for granted And as it happened he was right Besides as you will remember I had intruded upon him only a short time before Quite so said Cleek That s what makes it appear stranger than ever Under the circumstances one might have expected him to say not What are you coming in here for but What are you coming in for again Still of course there s no accounting for little lapses like that Go on please what next Why of course I immediately explained what Constable Gorham had said and why I had looked in To which he replied The man s an ass Get out Upon which I closed the door and the constable and I went away at once Constable there with you during it all then Yes certainly in the covered passage just behind me He saw and heard everything though of course neither of us actually entered the laboratory itself There was really no necessity when we knew that my uncle was safe and sound you see Quite so agreed Cleek So you shut the door and went away and then what Constable Gorham went back to his beat and I flew as fast as I could to meet mister Drummond It is only a short way to the old bridge at best and by taking that short cut through the grounds I was there in less than ten minutes And by half past eight I was back here in a greater state of terror than before And why Were you so much alarmed that mister Drummond did not keep the appointment No That did not worry me at all He is often unable to keep his appointments with me He is filling the post of private secretary to a large company promoter and his time is not his own What terrified me was that after waiting a few minutes for him I heard somebody running along the road and a few moments later Sir Ralph Droger flew by me as if he were being pursued Under ordinary circumstances I should have thought that he was getting into training for the autumn sports he is you may know very keen on athletics and holds the County Club s cup for running and jumping but when I remembered what Constable Gorham had said and saw that Sir Ralph was coming from the direction of this house all my wits flew I got into a sort of panic and almost collapsed with fright And all because the man was coming from the direction of this house Not that alone she answered with a shudder I have said that I should under ordinary circumstances have thought he was merely training for the autumn sports for you see he was in a running costume of white cotton stuff and his legs were bare from the knee down but as he shot past me in the moonlight I caught sight of something like a huge splash of blood on his clothes and coupling that with the rest I nearly went out of my senses It wasn t until long afterward I recollected that the badge of the County Club is the winged foot of Mercury wrought in brilliant scarlet embroidery To me just then that thing of red was blood my uncle s blood and I ran and ran and ran until I got back here to the house and flew up the covered passage and burst into the Round House He was sitting there still just as he had been sitting before But he didn t call out to me this time he didn t reprove me for disturbing him didn t make one single movement utter one single sound And when I went to him I knew why He was dead stone dead The face and throat of him were torn and rent as if some furious animal had mauled him and there were curious yellow stains upon his clothes That s all mister Headland I don t know what I did nor where I went from the moment I rushed shrieking from that room until I came to my senses and found myself in this one with dear kind missus Armroyd here bending over me and doing all in her power to soothe and to comfort me There there cherie you shall not more distress yourself It is of a hardness too great for the poor mind to bear put in missus Armroyd herself at this bending over the sofa as she spoke and softly smoothing the girl s hair It is better she should be at peace for a little is it not monsieur Very much better madame replied Cleek noting how softly her hand fell and how gracefully it moved over the soft hair and across the white forehead No doubt the major part of what still remains to be told you in the goodness of your heart will supply Of a certainty monsieur of a certainty But for the present continued Cleek finishing the interrupted sentence there still remains a question or two which must be asked and which only Miss Renfrew herself can answer As those are of a private and purely personal nature madame would it be asking too much He gave his shoulders an eloquent Frenchified shrug looked up at her after the manner of her own countrymen and let the rest of the sentence go by default Madame looked at him and gave her little hands an airy and a graceful flirt Of a certainty monsieur she said with charming grace Cela m est egal and walked away with a step remarkably light and remarkably graceful for one of such weight and generous dimensions Miss Renfrew said Cleek sinking his voice and looking her straight in the eyes as soon as missus Armroyd had left them Miss Renfrew tell me something please Have you any suspicion regarding the identity or the purpose of the person who murdered your uncle Not in the slightest mister Headland Of course in the beginning my thoughts flew at once to Sir Ralph Droger but I now see how absurd it is to think that such as he I am not even hinting at Sir Ralph Droger interposed Cleek Two other people in the world have a motive quite as strong as any that might be assigned to him You of course feel every confidence in the honour and integrity of mister Charles Drummond mister Headland Gently gently please I merely wished to know if in your heart you had any secret doubt and your flaring up like that has answered me You see one has to remember that the late mister Nosworth is said to have made a will in your favour The statement is correct is it not To the best of my belief yes Filed it with his solicitors did he That I can t say I think not however He was always sufficient unto himself and had a rooted objection to trusting anything of value to the care of any man living Even his most important documents plans and formulas of his various inventions even the very lease of this property have always been kept in the desk in the laboratory Hum m m said Cleek and pinched his chin hard Then after a moment One last question he went on suddenly What do you know Miss Renfrew of the recent movements of mister Harry Nosworth the son who was kicked out Nothing absolutely nothing she answered with a look of something akin to horror I know what you are thinking of but although he is as bad as man can be it is abominable to suppose that he would lift his hand against his own father Hum m m Yes of course But still it has been known to happen and as you say he was a bad lot I ran foul of the young gentleman once when No matter it doesn t signify So you don t know anything about him eh Nothing thank God The last I did hear he had gone on the stage and taken up with some horrible creature and the pair of them were subsequently sent to prison for enticing people to dreadful places and then drugging and robbing them But even that I heard from an outside source for my uncle never so much as mentioned him No I know nothing of him nothing at all In fact I ve never seen him since he was a boy He never lived here you know and until I came here I knew next to nothing of my uncle himself We were poor and lived in a quite different town my mother and I Uncle Septimus never came to see us while my mother lived He came for the first time when she was dead and his son had gone away and I was so poor and so friendless I was glad to accept the home he offered No mister Headland I know nothing of Harry Nosworth I hope for his own sake he is dead Cleek made no reply He sat for a minute pinching his chin and staring at the carpet then he got up suddenly and faced round in the direction of the little group at the far end of the room That s all for the present he said mister Narkom mister Nippers get a light of some sort please and let s go out and have a look at those footprints CHAPTER IX The suggestion was acted upon immediately even missus Armroyd joining in the descent upon the portable lamps and filing out with the rest into the gloom and loneliness of the grounds and Miss Renfrew finding that she was likely to be left alone in this house of horrors rose quickly and hurried out with them One step beyond the threshold brought them within sight of the famous Round House Bulked against the pale silver of the moonlit sky there it stood a grim unlovely thing of stone and steel with a trampled flower bed encircling the base of it and a man on guard Constable Gorham Lummy I d clean forgot him exclaimed mister Nippers as he caught sight of him And theer un be keepin guard like I told un out here in the grounds whiles weem ben talkin comfortable inside E do be a chap for doin as heem tole that Gorham indeed yes Nobody replied to him All were busily engaged in following the lead of Scotland Yard as represented by Cleek and Superintendent Narkom and bearing down on that huge stone tube within whose circular walls a dead man sat alone Dreary post this Constable said Cleek coming abreast of the silent guard Yes sir very But dooty s dooty and there you be replied Gorham touching his helmet with his finger then as the light from the lamps fell full upon Cleek s face and let him see that it was no face he had ever seen in this district before his eyes widened with a puzzled stare which never quite left them even when the entire group had passed on and turned the curve of the Round House wall And beyond that curve Cleek came to a sudden halt Here a curtainless window cut a square of light in the wall s dark face and struck a glare on the trunk and the boughs of a lime tree directly opposite and under that window a trampled flower bed lay with curious marks deep sunk in the soft moist surface of it Cleek took the lamp from missus Armroyd s hand and bending looked at them closely mister Nippers had not exaggerated when he said that they were all of twelve inches in length Nor was he far out when he declared that they looked like the footprints of some creature that was part animal and part bird for there they were with three huge clawlike projections in front and a solitary one behind and so like to the mark which a gigantic bird could have made that one might have said such a creature had made them only that it was impossible for anything to fly that was possessed of weight sufficient to drive those huge footprints so deeply into the earth as they had been driven by the mere walking of the Thing Claws and the marks of scales mister Nippers had asserted and claws and the marks of scales the prints in the soft earth showed La la the horror of them exclaimed missus Armroyd putting up her little hands and averting her face It could kill and kill and kill horses oxen anything an abominable creature like that What do you figure it to have been monsieur souls of the saints what Blest if I know said Cleek Only of course it couldn t possibly be anything human so we may put the idea of the old chap having been killed by anything of his kind out of our minds altogether It is perfectly clear that the creature whatever it might be got in through the window there you see it is open and killed him before he could call out for help or strike a blow in his own defence Eh but window s six foot up mister Headland sir put in Nippers excitedly and howm a thing the weight o that goin to fly in Didn t fly in my friend replied Cleek with an air of lofty superiority Use your wits man It jumped in from the tree there Look here see going to it and tapping certain abrasions upon the trunk Here s where it peeled off the bark in climbing up Lord man why it s plain as the nose on your face Ten to one we shall find the same sort of footprints when we go into the laboratory damp ones you know from the moisture of the earth and to make sure in case we do find em let s take the length of the things and see Got a tape measure with you No Oh well lend me your handcuffs if you ve got a pair with you and we can manage a measurement with those Thanks very much Now then let s see One two three by Jupiter three fingers longer than these things chain and all That ll do Now then let s go in and see about the others Lead the way Miss Renfrew if you will She would and did Leading the way back to the covered passage she opened a door in the side of it a door designed to let the inventor out into the grounds without going through the house if he so desired and conducted them to the laboratory leaving Constable Gorham to continue his dreary sentry duty outside At any time the interior of that huge stone walled steel lined tube must have been unlovely and depressing to all but the man who laboured in it But to night with that man sitting dead in it with his face to the open window a lamp beside him and stiff hands resting on the pages of a book that lay open on the desk s flat top it was doubly so for added to its other unpleasant qualities there was now a disagreeable odour and a curious eye smarting throat roughening heaviness in the atmosphere which was like to nothing so much as the fumes thrown off by burnt chemicals Cleek gave one or two sniffs at the air as he entered glanced at mister Narkom then walked straightway to the desk and looked into the dead man s face Under the marks of the scratches and cuts upon it marks which would seem to carry out the idea of an animal s attack the features were distorted and discoloured and the hair of beard and moustache was curiously crinkled and discoloured Cleek stopped dead short as he saw that face and his swaggering flippant cocksure air of a minute before dropped from him like a discarded mantle Hullo this doesn t look quite so promising for the animal theory as it did he flung out sharply This man has been shot shot with a shell filled with his own soundless and annihilating devil s invention lithamite and bomb throwing is not a trick of beasts of a lower order than the animal tribe Look here mister Narkom see The lock of the desk has been broken Shut the door there Nippers Let nobody leave the room There has been murder and robbery here and the thing that climbed that tree was not an animal nor yet a bird It was a cut throat and a thief Naturally enough this statement produced something in the nature of a panic Miss Renfrew indeed appearing to be on the verge of fainting and it is not at all unlikely that she would have slipped to the floor but for the close proximity of missus Armroyd That s right madame Get a chair put her into it She will need all her strength presently I promise you Wait a bit Better have a doctor I fancy and an inquiry into the whereabouts of mister Charles Drummond mister Narkom cut out will you and wire this message to that young man s employer Pens and papers were on the dead man s desk Cleek bent over scratched off some hurried lines and passed them to the superintendent Sharp s the word please we ve got ugly business on hand and we must know about that Drummond chap without delay Miss Renfrew has not been telling the truth to night Look at this man Rigor mortis pronounced Feel him muscles like iron flesh like ice She says that he spoke to her at a quarter to eight o clock I tell you that at a quarter to eight this man had been dead upward of an hour Good God exclaimed mister Narkom but his cry was cut into by a wilder one from Miss Renfrew Oh no Oh no she protested starting up from her seat only to drop back into it strengthless shaking ghastly pale It could not be it could not I have told the truth nothing but the truth He did speak to me at a quarter to eight he did he did Constable Gorham was there he heard him he will tell you the same Yes yes I know you said so but will he He looks a sturdy straightgoing honest sort of chap who couldn t be coaxed or bribed into backing up a lie so send him in as you go out mister Narkom we ll see what he has to say What he had to say when he came in a few moments later was what Miss Renfrew had declared an exact corroboration of her statement He had seen a man whom he fancied was Sir Ralph Droger run out of the grounds and he had suggested to Miss Renfrew that they had better look into the Round House and see if all was right with mister Nosworth They had looked in as she had said and mister Nosworth had called out and asked her what the devil she was coming in and disturbing him for and it was a quarter to eight o clock exactly Sure about that are you questioned Cleek Yes sir sure as that I m telling you so this minute How do you fix the exact time As we came out of the covered passage Miss Renfrew looked at her wrist watch and says impatient like There I ve lost another two minutes and am that much later for nothing See It s a quarter to eight Good night Then she cut off over the grounds and leaves me La la exclaimed missus Armroyd approvingly There s the brave heart to come to mademoiselle s rescue so gallantly But yes I make you the cake of plums for that mon cher Monsieur of the yard of Scotland he can no more torture the poor stricken child after that not he But Cleek appeared to be less easy to convince than she had hoped for he pursued the subject still questioning Gorham to needless length it seemed trying his best to trip him up to shake his statement but always failing and indeed going over the same ground to such length that one might have thought he was endeavouring to gain time If he was he certainly succeeded for it was quite fifteen minutes later when mister Narkom returned to the Round House and he was at it still Indeed he did not conclude to give it up as a bad job until the superintendent came Get it off all right did you mister Narkom he asked glancing round as he heard him enter Quite all right old chap Right as rain in every particular Thanks very much I m having rather a difficult task of it for our friend the constable here corroborates Miss Renfrew s statement to the hair and yet I am absolutely positive that there is a mistake There is no mistake no not one The wicked one to say it still Oh that s all very well madame but I know what I know and when you tell me that a dead man can ask questions Pah The fact of the matter is the constable merely fancies he heard mister Nosworth speak That s where the mistake comes in Now look here I once knew of an exactly similar case and I ll tell you just how it happened Let us suppose strolling leisurely forward let us suppose that this space here is the covered passage and you madame step here a moment please Thanks very much and you are Miss Renfrew and Gorham here is himself and standing beside her as he did then Wasn t beside her sir at least not just exactly A bit behind her like this Oh very well then that will do Now then Here s the passage and here are you and I ll just show you how a mistake could occur and how it did occur under precisely similar circumstances Once upon a time when I was in Paris In Paris monsieur Yes madame this little thing I m going to tell you about happened there You may or may not have heard that a certain Frenchy dramatist wrote a play called Chanticler or maybe you never heard of it Didn t eh Well it s a play where all the characters are barnyard creatures dogs poultry birds and the like and the odd fancy of men and women dressing up like fowls took such a hold on the public that before long there were Chanticler dances and Chanticler parties in all the houses and Chanticler turns on at all the music halls until wherever one went for an evening s amusement one was pretty sure to see somebody or another dressed up like a cock or a hen and running the thing to death But that s another story and we ll pass over it Now it just so happened that one night when the craze for the thing was dying out and barnyard dresses could be bought for a song I strolled into a little fourth rate cafe at Montmarte and there saw the only Chanticler dancer that I ever thought was worth a sou She was a pretty dainty little thing light as a feather and graceful as a fairy Alone I think she might have made her mark but she was one of what in music halldom they call a team Her partner was a man bad dancer an indifferent singer but a really passable ventriloquist A ventriloquist monsieur er er Cleek madame name s Cleek if you don t mind Cleek Oh Lummy blurted out mister Nippers But neither madame nor Constable Gorham said anything They merely swung round and made a sudden bolt and Cleek making a bolt too pounced down on them like a leaping cat and the sharp click click of the handcuffs he had borrowed from mister Nippers told just when he linked their two wrists together Game s up Madame Fifine otherwise Madame Nosworth the worthless wife of a worthless husband he rapped out sharply Game s up mister Henry Nosworth bandit pickpocket and murderer There s a hot corner in hell waiting for the brute beast that could kill his own father and would for the simple sake of money Get at him quick mister Narkom He s got one free hand Nip the paper out of his pocket before the brute destroys it Played sir played Buck up Miss Renfrew buck up little girl you ll get your Boy and you ll get mister Septimus Nosworth s promised fortune after all God s in his heaven and all s right with the world CHAPTER X Yes a very very clever scheme indeed Miss Renfrew agreed Cleek Laid with great cunning and carried out with extreme carefulness as witness the man s coming here and getting appointed constable and biding his time and the woman serving as cook for six months to get the entree to the house and to be ready to assist when the time of action came round I don t think I had the least inkling of the truth until I entered this house and saw that woman She had done her best to pad herself to an unwieldy size and to blanch portions of her hair but she couldn t quite make her face appear old without betraying the fact that it was painted and hers is one of those peculiarly pretty faces that one never forgets when one has ever seen it I knew her the instant I entered the house and remembering the Chanticler dress with its fowl s foot boots I guessed at once what those marks would prove to be when I came to investigate them She must have stamped on the ground with all her might to sink the marks in so deeply but she meant to make sure of the claws and the exaggerated scales on the toes leaving their imprint I was certain we should find that dress and those boots among her effects and mister Narkom did What I wrote on that pretended telegram was for him to slip away into the house proper and search every trunk and cupboard for them Pardon No I don t think they really had any idea of incriminating Sir Ralph Droger That thought came into the fellow s mind when you stepped out and caught him stealing away after the murder had been committed No doubt he like you had seen Sir Ralph practising for the sports and he simply made capital of it The main idea was to kill his father and to destroy the will and of course when it became apparent that the old gentleman had died intestate even a discarded son must inherit Where he made his blunder however was in his haste to practise his ventriloquial accomplishment to prevent your going into the Round House and discovering that his father was already dead He ought to have waited until you had spoken so that it would appear natural for the old man to know without turning who it was that had opened the door That is what put me on the track of him Until that moment I hadn t the slightest suspicion where he was nor under what guise he was hiding Of course I had a vague suspicion even before I came and saw her that the cook was in it Her readiness in inventing a fictitious gypsy with a bear s muzzle coupled with what Nippers had told me of the animal marks she had pointed out looked a bit fishy but until I actually met her nothing really tangible began to take shape in my thoughts That s all I think And now good night and good luck to you Miss Renfrew The riddle is solved and mister Narkom and I must be getting back to the wilderness and to our ground floor beds in the hotel of the beautiful stars Here as if some spirit of nervous unrest had suddenly beset him he turned round on his heel motioned the superintendent to follow and brushing by the awed and staring mister Ephraim Nippers whisked open the door and passed briskly out into the hush and darkness of the night The footpath which led through the grounds to the gate and thence to the long lonely way back to Dollops and the caravan lay before him He swung into it with a curious sort of energy and forged away from the house at such speed that Narkom s short fat legs were hard put to it to catch up with him before he came to the path s end My dear chap are you going into training for a match with that Sir Ralph What s his name of whom Miss Renfrew spoke he wheezed when he finally overtook him You long lean beggars are the very old boy for covering the ground But wait until you get to be my age by James Perhaps I shan t Perhaps they won t let me threw back Cleek in a voice curiously blurred as if he spoke with his teeth hard shut Donkeys do die you know that little bit of tommyrot about the absence of their dead bodies to the contrary Meaning what old chap That I ve been as big an ass as any of the thistle eating kind that ever walked Gad such an indiscretion Such an example of pure brainlessness And the worst of it is that it s all due to my own wretched vanity my own miserable weakness for the theatrical and the spectacular It came to me suddenly while I was standing there explaining things to Miss Renfrew and I could have kicked myself for my folly Folly What folly What folly What Good heavens man use your wits Isn t it enough for me to be a blockhead without you entering the lists along with me said Cleek irritably Or no Forgive that dear friend My nerves were speaking not my heart But in moments like this when we had built a safe bridge and my own stupidity has hacked it down Faugh I tell you I could kick myself Didn t you hear Didn t you see I saw that for some special reason you were suddenly obsessed with a desire to get out of the house in the midst of your talking with Miss Renfrew if that s what you refer to is it Not altogether It s part of it however But not the worst part unfortunately It was at that moment then the recollection of my indiscretion came to me and I realized what a dolt I had been how completely I had destroyed our splendid security wrecked what little still remains of this glorious holiday when I couldn t let George Headland have the centre of the stage but needs must come in like the hero of a melodrama and announce myself as Cleek To Nosworth and his wife To Nippers To all that gaping crowd You remember that incident surely Yes Of course I do But what of it What of it Man alive with a chap like that Nippers how long do you suppose it will remain a secret that Cleek is in Yorkshire In the West Riding of it In this particular locality Travelling about with mister Maverick Narkom in a caravan a caravan that can t cover five miles of country in the time a train or a motor car is able to get over fifty Good lud I never thought of that But wait a bit There s a way to overcome that difficulty of course Stop here a minute or two and I ll run back and pledge that Nippers fool to keep his mouth shut about it He ll give me his promise I know To be sure he will But how long do you suppose he will keep it How long do you suppose that an empty headed gabbling old fool like that fellow will refrain from increasing his own importance in the neighbourhood by swaggering about and boasting of his intimacy with the powers at Scotland Yard and the rest of it And even if he shouldn t what about the others The gathering of rustics that heard what he heard The gamekeepers from the Droger estate The Nosworths as well as they Can their mouths too be shut They will not love me for this night s business be sure Then too they have lived in Paris The woman is French by birth Of Montmartre of the Apache class the Apache kind and she will know of the Cracksman be assured So will her husband And they won t take their medicine lying down believe me An accused man has the right to communicate with counsel remember and a wire up to London will cost less than a shilling So as between Margot s crew and our friend Count Waldemar la la There you are mister Narkom screwed up his face and said something under his breath He could not but follow this line of reasoning when the thing was put before him so plainly And we had been so free from all worry over the beggars up to this he said savagely But to get a hint to pick up the scent out here in a wild bit of country like this Cinnamon it makes me sweat What do you propose to do The only thing that s left us to do gave back Cleek Get out of it as quickly as possible and draw a red herring over the scent In other words put back to Dollops abandon the caravan make our way to some place where it is possible to telephone for the chap we hired it from to send out and get it then to make tracks for home Yes but why bother about telephoning old chap Why can t we drop in ourselves and tell the man when we get back to Sheffield on our way to London Because we are not going back to Sheffield my friend not going in for anything so silly as twice travelling over the same ground if it s all the same to you replied Cleek as he swung off from the highway on to the dark still moor and struck out for the place where they had left Dollops and the caravan At best we can t be more than thirty miles from the boundary line of Cumberland A night s walking will cover that There we can rest a while at some little out of the way hostelry then take a train over the Scottish border and make for Dumfries From that point on the game is easy There are six trains a day leaving for saint Pancras and eight for Euston We can choose which we like and a seven hours ride will land us in London without having once doubled on our tracks or crossed the route by which we came out of it By James what a ripping idea said mister Narkom approvingly Come along then old chap let s get back to the boy and be about it as soon as possible Then he threw open his coat and waistcoat to get the full benefit of the air before facing the ordeal and falling into step with Cleek struck out over the moor at so brisk a dog trot that his short fat legs seemed fairly to twinkle CHAPTER XI By the side of the little chattering stream that flowed through the bit of woodland where mister Nippers and his associates had come upon them they found Dollops with his legs drawn up his arms folded across his knees and his forehead resting upon them sleeping serenely over the embers of a burnt out fire He was still making music but of a kind which needed no assistance from a mouth harmonica to produce it They awoke him and told him of the sudden change in the programme and of the need for haste in carrying it out Oh so help me Them Apaches eh And that foreign josser Count What s his name too said he rubbing his eyes and blinking sleepily Right you are guv ner Gimme two seconds to get the cobwebs out of my thinking box and I m ready to face marching orders as soon as you like My hat though but this is a startler I can understand wot them Apache johnnies has got against you sir of course but wot that Mauravanian biscuit is getting after you for beats me Wot did you ever do to the blighter guv ner Trip him up in some little bit of crooked business sir and did him down as the Mericans say Something like that returned Cleek Don t waste time in talking Simply get together such things as we shall need and let us be off about our business as soon as possible Dollops obeyed instructions upon both points obeyed them indeed with such alacrity that he shut up like an oyster forthwith dived into the caravan and bounced out again and within five minutes of the time he had been told of the necessity for starting had started and was forging away with the others over the dark still moor and facing cheerily the prospect of a thirty mile walk to Cumberlandshire All through the night they pressed onward thus the two men walking shoulder to shoulder and the boy at their heels over vast stretches of moorland where bracken and grass hung heavy and glittering under their weight of dew down the craggy sides of steep gullies where the spring freshets had quickened mere trickles into noisy water splashes that spewed over the rocks to fall into chuckling froth filled pools below along twisting paths through the dark still woodland stretches and thence out upon the wild wet moor again with the wind in their faces and the sky all a prickle with steadily dimming stars And by and by the mist wrapped moon dropped down out of sight the worn out night dwindled and died and steadily brightening Glory went blushing up the east to flower the pathway for the footfalls of the Morning But as yet the farthermost outposts of Cumberland were miles beyond the range of vision so that the long tramp was by no means ended and feeling the necessity for covering as much ground as possible while the world at large was still in what Dollops was wont to allude to as the arms of Murphy s house the little party continued to press onward persistently By four o clock they were again off the moors and in the depths of craggy gorges by five they were on the borders of a deep still tarn and had called a halt to light a fire and get things out of the bag which Dollops carried things to eat and to drink and to wear and were enjoying a plunge in the ice cold water the while the coffee was boiling and by six gorged with food and soothed by tobacco they were lying sprawled out on the fragrant earth and blinking drowsily while their boots were drying before the fire And after that there was a long hiatus until Cleek s voice rapped out saying sharply Well I ll be dashed Rouse up there you lazy beggars Do you know that it s half past twelve and we ve been sleeping for hours They knew it then be assured and were up and on their way again with as little delay as possible Rested and refreshed they made such good time that two o clock found them in the Morcam Abbey district just over the borders of Cumberland and with appetites sharpened for luncheon bearing down on a quaint little hostlery whose signboard announced it as the Rose and Thistle Well there s hospitality if you like said Cleek as at their approach a cheery faced landlady bobbed up at an open window and seeing them bobbed away again and ran round to welcome them with smiles and curtseys delivered from the arch of a vine bowered door Welcome gentlemen welcome beamed she as they came up and joined her But however in the world did you manage to get over here so soon the train not being due at Shepperton Old Cross until five and twenty past one and that a good mile and a quarter away as the crow flies However better too early than too late Major Norcross and Lady Mary being already here and most anxious to meet you As it happened that neither Cleek nor mister Narkom had any personal acquaintance with the lady and gentleman mentioned it was so clearly a case of mistaken identity that the superintendent had it on the tip of his tongue to announce the fact when there clashed out the sound of a door opening and shutting rapidly a clatter of hasty footsteps along the passage and presently there came into view the figure of a bluff hearty florid faced man of about five and forty who thrust the landlady aside and threw a metaphorical bombshell by exclaiming excitedly My dear sir I never was so delighted Talk about English slowness Why this is prompt enough to satisfy a Yankee I never dispatched my letter to you until late yesterday afternoon mister Narkom and by the way which is mister Narkom and which that amazing mister Cleek Or never mind perhaps that clever johnnie will be coming later you can tell me all about that afterward For the present come along Let s not keep Lady Mary waiting she s anxious This way please Here as mister Narkom had lost no time in acknowledging his identity it being clear that no mistake had been made after all here he caught the superintendent by the arm whisked him down the passage and throwing open the door at the end of it announced excitedly All right Mary The Yard s answered the big reward s caught em as I knew it would and here s Narkom That chap Cleek will come by a later train no doubt The response to this came from an unexpected quarter Of a sudden the man he had left standing at the outer door under the impression that he was in no way connected with the superintendent but merely a gentleman who had reached the inn at the same time came down the passage to the open door brushed past him into the room and announced gravely Permit me to correct an error please Major The man Cleek is not coming later he is here and very much at your and Lady Mary Norcross service believe me I have long known the name of Major Seton Norcross as one which stands high in the racing world as that indeed of the gentleman who owns the finest stud in the kingdom and whose filly Highland Lassie is first favourite for the forthcoming Derby and I now have the honour of meeting the gentleman himself it seems The effect of this was somewhat disconcerting For as he concluded it he put out his hand and rested it upon mister Narkom s shoulder whereat Lady Mary half rose from her seat only to sit down again suddenly and look round at her liege lord with uplifted eyebrows and lips slightly parted Afterward she declared of the two men standing side by side in that familiar manner One reminded me of an actor trying to play the part of a person of distinction and the other of a person of distinction trying to play the part of an ordinary actor and not quite able to keep what he really was from showing through the veneer of what he was trying to be The major however was too blunt to bottle up his sentiments at any time and being completely bowled over in the present instance put them into bluff outspoken characteristic words Oh gum games he blurted out If you really are Cleek I really am mister Narkom will stand sponsor for that But good lud man Oh look here you know this is all tommyrot What under God s heaven has brought a chap like you down to this sort of thing Opinions differ upon that score Major said Cleek quietly So far from being brought down it is my good friend mister Narkom here who has brought me up to it and made me his debtor for life Debtor nothing Don t talk rubbish As if it were possible for a gentleman not to recognize a gentleman It would not be so easy I fear if he were a good actor and you have just done me the compliment of indirectly telling me that I must be one It is very nice of you but may we not let it go at that I fancy from what I hear that I too shall soon be in the position to pay compliments Major I hear on every side that Highland Lassie is sure to carry off the Derby in fact that unless a miracle occurs there ll be no horse in it but her Here both the major and his wife grew visibly excited Gad sir exclaimed he in a voice of deep despair I m afraid you will have to amend that statement so that it may read unless a miracle occurs there will be every horse in it but her every blessed one from Dawson Blake s Tarantula the second favourite down to the last also ran of the lot Good heavens The filly hasn t gone wrong suddenly has she She s done more than gone wrong she s gone altogether Some beastly low lived cur of a horse thief broke into the stables the night before last and stole her stole her sir body and bones and there s not so much as a hoofprint to tell what became of her Well I m blest Are you B gad then you re about the only one who knows about it that is For as if that wasn t bad enough I ve not only lost the best filly in England but the best trainer as well and the brute that carried off the one got at the other at the same time dash him What do you mean by got at the trainer Major Did the man take a bribe and sell you that way What Tom Farrow Never in God s world Not that kind of a chap by George The man that offered Tom Farrow a bribe would spend the rest of the week in bed gad yes A more faithful chap never drew the breath of life God only knows when or how the thing happened but Farrow was found on the moor yesterday morning quite unconscious and at death s door He had been bludgeoned in the most brutal manner imaginable Not only was his right arm broken but his skull was all but crushed in There was concussion of the brain of course Poor fellow he can t speak a word and the chances are that he never will be able to do so again Bad business that declared Cleek looking grave Any idea of who may possibly have been the assailant Local police picked up anything in the nature of a clue The local police know nothing whatsoever about it I have not reported the case to them Not reported H m rather unusual course that to pursue isn t it When a man has his place broken into a valuable horse stolen and his trainer all but murdered one would naturally suppose that his first act would be to set the machinery of the law in motion without an instant s delay That is unless H m Yes Just so What is just so inquired the major eagerly You seem to have hit upon some sort of an idea right at the start Mind telling me what it is Certainly not I could imagine that when a man keeps silent about such a thing at such a time there is a possibility that he has a faint idea of who the criminal may be and that he has excellent reasons for not wishing the world at large to share that idea In other words that he would sooner lose the value of the animal fifty times over than have the crime brought home to the person he suspects CHAPTER XII Lady Mary made a faint moaning sound The major s face was a study I don t know whether you are a wizard or not mister Cleek he said after a moment but you have certainly hit upon the facts of the matter It is for that very reason that I have refrained from making the affair public It is bad enough that Lady Mary and I should have our suspicions regarding the identity of the er person implicated without letting others share them There s Dawson Blake for one If he knew he d move heaven and earth to ruin him Dawson Blake repeated Cleek Pardon but will that be the particular Sir Gregory Dawson Blake the millionaire brewer who achieved a knighthood in the last Honours List and whose horse Tarantula is second favourite for the coming Derby Yes the very man He is almost what you might call a neighbour of ours mister Cleek His place Castle Claverdale is just over the border line of Northumberland and about five miles distant from Morcan Abbey His stables are if anything superior to my own and we both use the intervening moorland as a training ground Also it was Dawson Blake s daughter that Lieutenant Chadwick played fast and loose with Jilted her you know threw her over at the eleventh hour and married a chorus girl who had nothing to bless herself with but a pretty face and a long line of lodging house ancestry Not that Miss Dawson Blake lost anything by getting rid of such a man before she committed the folly of tying herself to him for life but her father never forgave Lieutenant Chadwick and would spend a million for the satisfaction of putting him behind bars I see And this Lieutenant Chadwick is whom may I ask The only son of my elder and only sister mister Cleek supplied Lady Mary with a faint blush She committed the folly of marrying her music master when I was but a little girl and my father died without ever looking at her again Subsequently her husband deserted her and went she never learnt where to the day of her death While she lived however both my brother Lord Chevelmere and I saw that she never wanted for anything We also supplied the means to put her son through Sandhurst after we had put him through college and hoped that he would repay us by achieving honour and distinction It was a vain hope He achieved nothing but disgrace Shortly after his deplorable marriage with the theatrical person for whom he threw over Miss Dawson Blake and who in turn threw him over when she discovered what a useless encumbrance he was he was cashiered from the army and has ever since been a hanger on at race meetings the consort of touts billiard markers card sharpers and people of that sort I had not seen him for six years when he turned up suddenly in this neighbourhood three days ago and endeavoured to scrape acquaintance with one of the Abbey grooms And under an assumed name mister Cleek supplemented the major somewhat excitedly He was calling himself John Clark and was trying to wheedle information regarding Highland Lassie out of my stable boys Fortunately Lady Mary caught sight of him without being seen and at once gave orders that he was to be turned off the premises and never allowed to come near them again He was known however to be in this neighbourhood up to dusk on the following evening but he has never been seen since Highland Lassie disappeared You know now perhaps why I have elected to conduct everything connected with this affair with the utmost secrecy Little as we desire to be in any way associated with such a man we cannot but remember that he is connected with us by ties of blood and unless Farrow dies of his injuries which God forbid we will hush the thing up cost what it may All that I want is to get the animal back not to punish the man if indeed he be the guilty party for there is really no actual proof of that But if Dawson Blake knew it would be different He would move heaven and earth to get the convict s broad arrow on him and to bring disgrace upon everybody connected with the man H m I see said Cleek puckering up his brows and thoughtfully stroking his chin So that naturally there is with this added to the rivalry of the two horses no very good blood existing between Sir Gregory Dawson Blake and yourself No there is not If apart from these things mister Cleek you want my private opinion of the man it can be summed up in the word Bounder There is not one instinct of the gentleman about him He is simply a vulgar money gilded low minded cad and I wouldn t put it beyond him to be mixed up in this disappearance of the filly himself but that I know Chadwick was about the place and for there to be anything between Chadwick and him is as impossible as it is for the two poles to come together or for oil to assimilate with water That is the one thing in this world that Dawson Blake would not do under any circumstances whatsoever Beyond that I put nothing beneath the man nothing too despicable for him to attempt in the effort to gain his own end and aim He races not for the sport of the thing but for the publicity the glory of getting talked about and of making the vulgar stare He wants the blue ribbon of the turf for the simple fame of the thing and he d buy it if buying it were possible and either bribes or trickery could carry off the race H m That s a sweeping assertion Major But made upon a basis of absolute fact mister Cleek He has twice endeavoured to buy Farrow to desert me by an offer of double wages and a pension and failing that only last week he offered my jockey Lten thousand cash on the nail to slip off over to France on the night before Derby Day and promised him a further five thousand if Tarantula carried off the race Oho said Cleek in two different tones and with a look of supremest contempt So our Tinplate Knight is that sort of a sportsman is he the cad And having failed to get hold of the rider H m Yes It is possible perhaps Chadwick s turning up at such a time might be a mere coincidence a mere tout s trick to get inside information beforehand or Well you never can tell Suppose Major you give me the facts from the beginning When was the animal s loss discovered and how Let me have the full particulars please The major sighed and dropped heavily into a chair For an affair of such far reaching consequences mister Cleek he said gloomily it is singularly bald of what might be called details I am afraid and beyond what I have already told you there is really very little more to tell When or how the deed was committed it is impossible to decide beyond the indefinite statement that it happened the night before last at some time after half past nine in the evening when the stable boy Dewlish before going home carried a pail of water at Farrow s request into the building where Highland Lassie s stall is located and five o clock the next morning when Captain MacTavish strolled into the stables and found the mare missing A moment please Who is Captain MacTavish And why should the gentleman be strolling about the Abbey stable yard at five o clock in the morning Both questions can be answered in a few words Captain MacTavish is a friend who is stopping with us He is a somewhat famous naturalist Writes articles and stories on bird and animal life for the magazines It is his habit to be up and out hunting for specimens and things of that sort every morning just about dawn At five he always crosses the stable yard on his way to the dairy where he goes for a glass of fresh milk before breakfast I see Captain a young man or an old one Oh young of course About two or three and thirty I should say Brother of a deceased army pal of mine Been stopping with us for the past two months Very brilliant and very handsome chap universal favourite wherever he goes Thanks Now just one more question before you proceed please About the trainer Farrow getting the stable boy to carry in that pail of water Would not that be a trifle unusual at such a time of the night I don t know Yes perhaps it would I never looked at it in that light before Very likely not Stables would be closed and all the grooms et cetera off duty for the night at that hour would they not Yes That is unless Farrow had reason for asking one of them to help him with something That s what he did by the way with the boy Dewlish Just so Any idea what he wanted with that pail of water at that hour of the night He couldn t be going to water one of the horses of course and it is hardly likely that he intended to take on a stableman s duties and wash up the place Oh gravy no He s a trainer not a slosh bucket I pay him eighteen hundred a year and give him a cottage besides Married man or a single one Single A widower About forty Lost his wife two years ago Rather thought he was going to take another one shortly from the way things looked But of late he and Maggie McFarland don t seem for some reason or another to be hitting it off together so well as they did Who s Maggie McFarland please One of the dairymaids A little Scotch girl from Nairn who came into service at the Abbey about a twelvemonth ago H m I see Then the filly isn t the only Highland Lassie in the case it would seem Pardon Oh nothing Merely a weak attempt to say something smart that s all Don t suppose that Maggie McFarland could by any possibility throw light upon the subject of that pail of water do you Major Good lud no Of course she couldn t What utter rot But see here come to think of it now perhaps I can It s as like as not that he wanted it to wash himself with before he went over to the shoer s at Shepperton Old Cross with Chocolate Maid I forgot to tell you mister Cleek that ever since Dawson Blake made that attempt to buy him off Farrow became convinced that it wouldn t be safe to leave Highland Lassie unguarded night or day for fear of that cad s hirelings getting at her in some way or another so he closed up his cottage and came to live in the rooms over the filly s stable so as to be on the spot for whatever might or might not happen at any hour He also bought a yapping little Scotch terrier that would bark if a match fell and kept it chained up in the place with him When the discovery of the filly s disappearance was made that dog was found still attached to its chain but as dead as Maria Martin It had been poisoned There was a bit of meat lying beside the body and it was literally smothered in strychnine Quite so Keep strychnine about the place for killing rats I suppose Yes of course They are a perfect pest about the granary and the fodder bins But of course it wouldn t be lying round loose a deadly thing like that Besides there never was any kept in that particular section of the stables so the dog couldn t have got hold of it by accident Then there s another thing I ought to tell you mister Cleek Highland Lassie never was stabled with the rest of the stud We have always kept her in one especial stable There are just two whacking big box stalls in the place She occupies one and Chocolate Maid the other Chocolate Maid is Lady Mary s personal property a fine blooded filly that will make a name for herself one of these days I fancy Dark coated and smooth as a piece of sealskin the beauty To day she is the only animal in that unlucky place Yes come to think of it mister Cleek he added with a sort of sigh that is probably what the poor fellow wanted the pail of water for to wash up and ride her over to the forge at Shepperton Old Cross Singular time to choose for such a proceeding wasn t it Major After half past nine o clock at night It would be if it were any other man and under any other circumstances But remember It is but three weeks to Derby Day and every hour of daylight is worth so much gold to us Farrow knew that he could not spare a moment of it for any purpose and he is most particular over the shoeing Will see it done himself and direct the operation personally Sort of mania with him Wouldn t let the best man that ever lived take one of the horses over for him Go himself no matter what inconvenience it put him to Farrier at Shepperton Old Cross knows his little fads and fancies and humours them at all times Would open the forge and fire up for him if it were two o clock in the morning I see And did he take Chocolate Maid over there on that night after all Yes Lady Mary and I attended a whist drive at Farmingdale Priory that evening but her ladyship was taken with a violent headache and we had to excuse ourselves and leave early It would be about a quarter to eleven o clock when we returned to the Abbey and met Farrow riding out through the gates on Chocolate Maid We stopped and spoke to him He was then going over to the shoer s with the mare How long would it take him to make the journey Oh about five and twenty minutes maybe half an hour certainly not more So then it would be about quarter past eleven when he arrived at the farrier s I see Any idea at what time he got back Not the ghost of one In fact we should never have known that he ever did get back for nobody heard a sound of his return the whole night long were it not that when Captain MacTavish crossed the stable yard at five o clock in the morning and seeing the door ajar looked in he found Chocolate Maid standing in her stall the dog dead and Highland Lassie gone Of course Chocolate Maid being there after we had passed Farrow on the road with her was proof that he did return at some hour of the night you know though when it was or why he should have gone out again heaven alone knows Personally you know I am of the opinion that Highland Lassie was stolen while he was absent that on returning he discovered the robbery and following the trail went out after the robbers and coming up with them got his terrible injuries that way H m Yes I don t think What trail was he to find please when you just now told me that there wasn t so much as a hoofprint to tell the tale Or was that an error No it wasn t The entire stable yard is paved with red tiles and we ve had such an uncommon spell of dry weather lately that the earth of the surrounding country is baked as hard as a brickbat An elephant couldn t make a footmark upon it much less a horse But gravy man instead of making the thing clearer I m blest if you re not adding gloom to darkness and rendering it more mysterious than ever What under the four corners of heaven could Farrow have followed then if the trail is to be eliminated entirely Maybe his own inclination Major maybe nothing at all said Cleek enigmatically If your little theory of his returning and finding Highland Lassie stolen were a thing that would hold water I am inclined to think that mister Tom Farrow would have raised an alarm that you could hear for half a mile and that if he had started out after the robbers he would have done so with a goodly force of followers at his heels and with all the lanterns and torches that could be raked and scraped together Good lud yes of course he would I never thought of that Did you Mary His whole heart and soul were bound up in the animal If he had thought that anything had happened to her if he had known that she was gone a pitful of raging devils would have been spirits of meekness beside him Man alive you make my head whiz For him to go off over the moor without word or cry at such a time I say mister Cleek For God s sake what do you make of such a thing as that at such a time eh Well Major replied Cleek I hate to destroy any man s illusions and to besmirch any man s reputation but que voulez vous If mister Tom Farrow went out upon that moor after the mare was stolen and went without giving an alarm or saying a word to anybody then in my private opinion your precious trainer is nothing in the world but a precious double faced double dealing dishonourable blackguard who treacherously sold you to the enemy and got just what he deserved by way of payment Major Norcross made no reply He simply screwed up his lips until they were a mere pucker of little creases and looked round at his wife with something of the pain and hopeless bewilderment of an unjustly scolded child You know Seton it was what Captain MacTavish suggested ventured she gently and regretfully And when two men of intellect Then she sighed and let the rest go by default Demmit Mary you don t mean to suggest that I haven t any do you No dear but Buts be blowed Don t you think I know a man when I run foul of him And if ever there was a square dealing honest chap on this earth Look here mister Cleek Gad you may be a bright chap and all that but you ll have to give me something a blessed sight stronger than mere suspicion before you can make me believe a thing like that about Tom Farrow I am not endeavouring to make you believe it Major I am merely showing you what would certainly be the absolute truth of the matter if Tom Farrow had done what you suggested and gone out on that moor alone and without a word or a cry when he discovered that the animal was stolen But my dear sir I incline to the belief that he never did go out there after any person or any living thing whatsoever Then dash it sir how in thunder are you going to explain his being there at all By the simple process Major of suggesting that he was on his way back to the Abbey at the time he encountered his unknown assailant In other words that he had not only never returned to the place after you and her ladyship saw him leaving it at a quarter to eleven but was never permitted to do so Oh come I say That s laying it on too thick How the dickens can you be sure of such a thing as that I m not I am merely laying before you the only two things possible to explain his presence there One or the other of them is the plain and absolute truth If the man went out there after the filly was stolen he is a scoundrel and a liar If he is innocent he met with his injuries on the way back to his quarters above Highland Lassie s stall But the other animal But Chocolate Maid How could she have got back to the stable then She couldn t have found her way back alone after Farrow was assaulted at least she could of course but not in the condition she was in when found next morning She had no harness of any sort upon her Her saddle was on its peg She was in her box tied up b gad and the door of the box was closed and bolted so that if by any chance Hullo I say What on earth are you smiling in that queer way for Hang it man do you believe that I don t know what I m talking about Oh yes Major It isn t that kind of a smile I have just discovered that four and four make eight when you add them up properly and the smile is one of consequent satisfaction A last question please At what time in the morning was Farrow found lying unconscious upon the moor Somewhere between six and seven o clock Why Oh nothing in particular Who found him Captain MacTavish No Maggie McFarland She was just coming back from milking when Hang it man I wish you wouldn t smile all up one side of your face in that confounded manner It makes me think that you must have something up your sleeve Well if I have Major suppose you drive me over to the stables and give me a chance to take it out suggested Cleek serenely A little poking about sometimes does wonders and a half hour in Highland Lassie s quarters may pick the puzzle to pieces a great deal sooner than you d believe Or stop Perhaps on second thought it will be better for you and her ladyship to go on ahead as I shall want to have a look at Tom Farrow s injuries as well so it will be best to have everything prepared in advance in order to save time No doubt mister Narkom and I can get a conveyance of some sort here At any rate h m it is now a quarter to three I see at any rate you may certainly expect us at quarter past five You and her ladyship may go back quite openly Major There will be no need to attempt to throw dust in Sir Gregory Dawson Blake s eyes any longer by keeping the disappearance of the animal a secret If he s had a hand in her spiriting away he knows of course that she s gone but if he hasn t oh well I fancy I know who did and that she will be in the running on Derby Day after all A few minutes in Highland Lassie s stable will settle that I feel sure Your ladyship my compliments Major good afternoon I hope if night overtakes us before we get at the bottom of the thing you can manage to put us up at the Abbey until to morrow that we may be on the spot to the last With pleasure mister Cleek said Lady Mary and bowed him out of the room CHAPTER XIII It was precisely ten minutes past five o clock and the long lingering May twilight was but just beginning to gather when the spring cart of the Rose and Thistle arrived at the Abbey stables and Cleek and mister Narkom descending therefrom found themselves the centre of an interested group composed of the major and Lady Mary the countryside doctor and Captain MacTavish The captain who had nothing Scottish about him but his name was a smiling debonnaire gentleman with flaxen hair and a curling fair moustache and Cleek catching sight of him as he stood leaning in a carefully studied pose against the stable door post with one foot crossed over the other one hand in his trousers pocket and the other swinging a hunting crop whose crook was a greyhound s head wrought in solid silver concluded that here was perhaps the handsomest man of his day and that in certain sections of society he might be guaranteed to break hearts by the hundred It must be said of him however that he carried his manifold charms of person with smooth serenity and perfect poise that if he realized his own beauty he gave no outward evidences of it He was calm serene well bred and had nothing of the Doll or the Johnny element in either his bearing or his deportment He was at once splendidly composed and almost insolently bland Pleased to meet you mister Cleek Read a great deal about you one way and another he said when the major made the introduction a performance which the captain evidently considered superfluous as between an army officer and a police detective Sorry I shan t be able to remain and study your interesting methods however Should have been rather pleased to do so otherwise And I for my part should have been pleased to have you do so Captain I assure you replied Cleek the first intonation of his voice causing the captain to twitch up his head and stare at him as if he were a monstrosity Shall you be leaving us then before the investigation is concluded Well I m blest Why how in the world oh er yes Obliged to go Wire from London this afternoon Regiment sails for India in two days Beastly nuisance Shall miss the Derby and all that By the way Norcross if this chap succeeds in finding the filly in time for the race that little bet of ours stands of course Of course agreed the major Ready are you mister Cleek Right you are come along And he forthwith led the way into the stable where Chocolate Maid like a perfect horse in French bronze stood munching hay in her box as contentedly as if there were no such things in the world as touts and swindlers and horse thieves and her companion of two days ago still shared the quarters with her Gad but she s a beauty and no mistake Major said Cleek as he went over and leaning across the low barrier of the enclosure patted the mare s shoulder and smoothed her glossy neck I don t wonder that you and her ladyship have such high hopes for her future The creature seems well nigh perfect Yes she is a pretty good bit of horseflesh replied he but not to be compared with Highland Lassie in speed wind or anything There she is mister Cleek and it s as natural as life the beauty Speaking he waved his hand toward a framed picture of the missing animal a coloured gift plate which had been given away with the Easter number of The Horseman and which Farrow had had glazed and hung just over her box Cleek following the direction of the indicating hand looked up and saw the counterfeit presentment of a splendidly proportioned sorrel with a splash of white on the flank and a white stocking on the left forefoot A beauty as you say Major agreed he but do you know that I for my part prefer the charms of Chocolate Maid May be bad judgment upon my part but there you are What a coat What a colour What splendid legs the beauty Mind if I step in for a moment and have a look at her The major did not so he went in forthwith and proceeded to look over the animal s points feeling her legs stroking her flanks examining her hoofs And it was then and then only that the major remembered about the visit to the farrier s over at Shepperton Old Cross and began to understand that it was not all simple admiration of the animal this close examination of her Oh by Jove I say he blurted out as he made with Cleek a sudden discovery his face going first red and then very pale under the emotions thus engendered She hasn t any new shoes on has she So she can t have been taken to the farrier s after all No said Cleek she can t I half suspected that she hadn t so well let it go Let s have a look round Highland Lassie s box please H m Yes Very nice very splendid everything of the best and all in apple pie order By the way Major you surely don t allow harness to be washed and oiled in here Certainly not What in the world could have put such an idea into your head Merely that bit of rag and that dirty sponge tucked in the corner over there and half covered by the bedding The major went over and touched the things with the toe of his boot It s one of those imps of stable boys the young vandals he declared as he kicked the rag and the sponge out of the box and across the stable floor It s well for them that Farrow isn t about or there would be some cuffed ears for that sort of presumption the young beggars Hullo Found something else No said Cleek That is nothing of any importance Merely a bit torn from an old handbill see It probably got mixed up with the bedding It s of no account anyhow Here he gave his hand a flirt as if flinging the bit of paper over the low barrier of the box instead of which he cleverly palmed it and afterward conveyed it unsuspected to his pocket You were right in what you declared this afternoon Major for a case of such far reaching effects it is singularly bald in the matter of detail At all events there s no more to be discovered here By the way Doctor am I privileged to go up and see the patient I should like to do so if I may By all means sir by all means replied the doctor I am happy to inform you that his condition has considerably improved since my visit at noon mister Cleek and I have now every hope that he may pull through all right Excellent said Cleek But I think I shouldn t let that good news go abroad just yet a while Doctor If you haven t taken anybody into your confidence regarding it as yet don t do so You haven t have you No That is nobody but those who are now present I told the major and her ladyship on their return this afternoon of course And naturally Captain MacTavish He was with me at the time I made the examination which led me to arrive at the conclusion that the man would survive Ah said Cleek and the curious one sided smile went slowly up his cheek Oh well everything is all right among friends of course but I shouldn t let it go any farther And now if you please let us go up to Farrow s room They went up forthwith Lady Mary alone refraining from joining the group and a moment or two later Cleek found himself standing beside the bed of the unconscious trainer He was a strong sturdily built man this Tom Farrow upon whose integrity the major banked so heavily in his warm trustful outspoken way and if the face is any index to the mind which in nine cases out of ten it isn t that trustfulness and confidence were not misplaced For Farrow s was a frank open countenance which suggested a clear conscience and an honest nature even though it was now pale and drawn with the lines that come of suffering and injury At Cleek s request the doctor removed the bandages and allowed him to inspect the wound at the back of the head H m Made with a heavy implement shaped somewhat after the fashion of a golf stick and almost as heavy as a sledge hammer he commented Arm broken too Probably that was done first and the man struck again after he was on the ground and unable to defend himself There are two blows you see this one just above the ear and that crushing one at the back of the head That s all I care to see Doctor thank you You may replace the bandages Nevertheless although he asserted this it was noticeable that his examination of the stricken trainer did not end here for while the doctor was busy replacing the bandages he took the opportunity to lift the man s hands and inspect them closely parting the fingers and looking at the thin loose folds of skin between them A few minutes later the bandages being replaced and the patient turned over to the nurse in charge the entire party left the room and filed down the stairs together Any ideas mister Cleek questioned the major eagerly Yes plenty of them replied he I rather fancy we shall not have to put you to the trouble of housing us at the Abbey to night Major The case is a shallower one than I fancied at first Shouldn t be surprised if we cleared it all up inside of the next two hours Well I ll be dithered exclaimed the major aghast Do you mean to tell me that you ve got at the bottom of the thing That you ve found something that leads you to suspect where the animal is More than suspect Major I know where she is By half past seven o clock to night if you want me to make you a promise I ll put her bridle into your hands and she will be at the other end of it You will I certainly will Major my word for it Well of all the dashed I m done I m winded I m simply scooped dry Where on earth did you get your clues man You never did anything but walk about that I could see and now to declare I say MacTavish did you hear that Did you hear what he has promised eh I heard responded the captain with a laugh But I ll believe when I see I say mister Inspector where did you find the secret Hidden between Farrow s fingers or wrapped around Chocolate Maid s legs Both said Cleek serenely Tell you something else if you care to hear it I know who poisoned the dog the other night Farrow did it himself The major s exclamation of indignation was quite lost in the peal of the captain s laughter Hawkshaw out Hawkshawed cried he derisively Find out that too from Farrow s fingers Oh no that would be impossible He washed them before he went out that night and they ve been washed by the nurse several times since I found it out from the dog himself and he s not the only dog in this little business believe me though I m willing to stake my reputation and my life upon it that neither one nor the other of them had any hand in spiriting away the missing horse Who did then mister Cleek who did Tom Farrow and Tom Farrow alone Major began Cleek and then stopped suddenly interrupted by a painful circumstance By this time they had reached the foot of the stairs and were filing out into the stable again and there by the open door Lady Mary Norcross was standing endeavouring to soothe and to comfort a weeping girl Maggie McFarland the dairymaid from Nairn Oh but say he winna dee say he winna she was crying out distressfully If I thoct the sin o that wad added to the sair conscience o me Then with a sudden intaking of the breath as if drowning and a sudden paleness that made her face seem ivory white she cowered away with hands close shut and eyes wide with fright as she looked up and saw the gentlemen descending It winna matter it winna matter I can come again my leddy she said in a frightened sort of whisper which rose suddenly to a sort of wailing cry as she faced round and ran like a thing pursued Cleek glanced round quietly and looked at Captain MacTavish He was still his old handsome debonnaire smiling self but there was a look in his eyes which did not make them a very pleasant sight at present Upon my word Seton I cannot make out what has come over that silly girl said Lady Mary as her liege lord appeared She came here begging to be allowed to go up and see Farrow and to be assured that he would live and then the moment you all put in an appearance she simply dashed away as you saw I really cannot understand what can be the matter with her Don t bother about that just now Mary don t bother about anything my dear but what this amazing man has promised exclaimed the major excitedly Do you know he has declared that if we give him until half past seven to night Here Cleek interrupted Your pardon Major I amend that he said I know all about the horse and it will not now take so long as I thought to know all about the dog as well Give me one hour Major just one gentlemen all and I will give you the answer to the riddle every part of it dog s part as well as horse s here on this spot so surely as I am a living man Major all I ask of you is one thing Let me have a couple of your grooms out there on the moor inside of the next fifteen minutes please May I have them Certainly mister Cleek as many as you want Two will do thanks Two are enough for fair play in any little bout and not going to stop and see the finish Captain It will all be over in an hour Sorry but I ve got my packing to attend to my man Ah to be sure Oh well it doesn t matter You know the proverb If the mountain will not come to Mahomet why Mahomet must go to the mountain of course said Cleek I ll just slip round to the dairy and have a glass of milk to brace me up for the business and then in one hour in just one by the watch you shall have the answer to the riddle here Then with a bow to Lady Mary he walked out of the stable and went round the angle of the building after Maggie McFarland CHAPTER XIV He lived up to the letter of his promise In an hour he had said when he walked out and it was an hour to the very tick of the minute when he came back mister Narkom knowing him so well knowing how in the final moments of his coups he was apt to become somewhat spectacular and theatrical looked for him to return with a flourish of trumpets and carry all before him with a whirlwind rush so that it came in the nature of a great surprise when with the calmness of a man coming in to tea he entered the stable with a large stone bottle in one hand and an hostler s sponge in the other Well gentlemen I am here you see he said with extreme calmness And indicating the bottle have brought something with me to do honour to the event No not to drink it is hardly that sort of stuff It is Spirit of Wine Major I found it over in Farrow s cottage and have brought it with me as he poor chap meant to do in time himself There are some wonderful things in Tom Farrow s cottage Major they will pay for looking into I assure you Pardon mister Narkom A criminal Oh no my friend a martyr A martyr Yes your ladyship yes Major a martyr A martyr to his love a martyr to his fidelity As square a man and as faithful a trainer as ever set foot in a stable yard that s Tom Farrow I take off my hat to him The world can do with more of his kind But my dear sir you said that it was he that spirited away the animal that it was he and he alone who was responsible for her disappearance Quite so and I say it again Gently gently Major I ll come to it in a minute Personally I should like to put it off to the last it s such a fine thing for a finish by Jove But well it can t be done under the circumstances In other words there is a part of this little business this evening which I must ask Lady Mary not to stop to either hear or see but as she is naturally interested in the matter of Highland Lassie s disappearance I will take up that matter first and ask her to kindly withdraw after the filly has been restored Gad you ve found her then You ve got her Yes Major I ve got her And as I promised that I would put her bridle into your hand with the animal herself at the other end of it why here you are Speaking he walked across to the box where the brown filly was tethered unbolted it unfastened the animal and led her out Here you are Major he said as he tendered him the halter Take hold of her the beauty and may she carry off the Derby Stakes with flying colours But good lud man what on earth are you talking about This is Chocolate Maid this is Lady Mary s horse Oh no Major oh no Chocolate Maid is in the stable at Farrow s cottage hidden away and half starved poor creature because he couldn t go back to feed and look after her This is your bonny Highland Lassie dyed to look like the other and to throw possible horse nobblers and thieves off the scent If you doubt it look here He uncorked the bottle poured some of the Spirit of Wine on the sponge and rubbed the animal s brown flank The dark colour came away the sorrel hide and the white splotch began to appear and before you could say Jack Robinson the major and Lady Mary had their arms about the animal s neck and were blubbing like a couple of children Oh my bully girl Oh my spiffing girl Oh Mary isn t it clinking dear The Lassie the Highland Lassie her own bonny self Yes her own bonny self Major said Cleek and you d never have had a moment s worry over her if that faithful fellow upstairs had been suffered to get back here that night and to tell you about it in the morning I ve had a little talk with oh well somebody who is in a position to give me information that corroborates my own little shots at the matter I ll tell you all about that later on and so am able to tell you a thing or two that you ought to have known before this I don t know whether Lieutenant Chadwick s coming here and prying about had any wish to do harm to the horse at the back of it or not I only know that Farrow thought it had and he played this little trick to block the game and to throw dust into the eyes of anybody that attempted to get at her What he did then was to dye her so that she might be mistaken for Chocolate Maid then to take Chocolate Maid over to his own stable and hide her there until the time came to start for Epsom That s what he wanted the pail of water for Major to mix the dye and to apply it I half suspected it from the beginning but I became sure of it when I found that scrap of paper in the bedding of the box It was still wet a bit of the label from the dye bottle which came off in the operation Between the poor chap s fingers I found stains of the dye still remaining Spirit of Wine would have removed it but washing in water wouldn t Pardon your ladyship When did I begin to suspect that Farrow was at the bottom of it Oh when first I heard of the poisoned dog Nobody ever heard it bark when the poisoner approached the stables That of course meant that the person who administered the poison must have been some one with whom it was familiar and also some one who was already inside the place since even the first approaching step of friend or foe would have called forth one solitary bark at least Farrow didn t do the thing by halves you see He meant it to look like a genuine case of horse stealing to outsiders and killing the dog gave it just that touch of actuality which carries conviction As for the rest the major must tell you that in private your ladyship The rest of this little matter is for men alone Lady Mary bowed and passed out into the fast coming dusk and in the stable the major Cleek and Narkom stood together waiting until she was well beyond earshot Now Major we will get down to brass tacks as our American cousins say said Cleek when that time at length came You would like to know I suppose how poor Farrow came by his injuries and from whose hand Well you shall He was coming back from his cottage after stabling the real Chocolate Maid there when the thing happened and he received those injuries for rushing to the defence of the woman he loved and attempting to thrash the blackguard who had taken advantage of her trust and belief in him to spoil her life forever The woman was of course Maggie McFarland The man was your charming guest Captain MacTavish Good God MacTavish MacTavish Yes Major the gallant captain who received such a sudden call to rejoin his regiment as soon as he knew that Tom Farrow was likely to recover and to speak Perhaps you can understand now why Farrow and the girl no longer seemed to hit it off together as formerly The gallant captain had come upon the boards Dazzled by the beauty of him tricked by the glib tongue of him deluded into the belief that she had actually caught a gentleman and that he really meant to make her his wife and take her away to India with him when he went the silly innocent confiding little idiot became his victim and threw over a good man s love for a handful of Dead Sea Fruit Never for one instant had Tom Farrow an idea of this but the night before last as he crossed the moor he knew In the darkness he stumbled upon the truth He heard her crying out to the fellow to do her justice to keep his word and make her the honest wife he had promised that she should be and he heard too the man s characteristic reply You can guess what happened Major when you know Tom Farrow In ten seconds he was up and at that fellow like a mad bull The girl terrified out of her life screamed and ran away seeing the brave captain laying about him with his heavy silver headed hunting crop as she fled She never saw the end of the fight she never dared but in the morning when there was no Tom Farrow to be seen she went out there on the moor and found him She would have spoken then had she dared poor creature but the man s threat was an effective one If she spoke he would do likewise If she kept silent she might go away and her disgrace be safely hidden Which she chose we know The damned hound Oh no Major oh no that s too hard on hounds The only houndlike thing about that interesting gentleman was that he made an attempt to get to cover and to run away I knew that he would I knew that that was his little dodge when he made that little excuse about having to pack up his effects He saw how the game was running and he meant to slip the cable and clear out while he had the chance And you let him do it you never spoke a word but let the blackguard do it Gad sir I m ashamed of you You needn t be Major on that score at least Please remember that I asked for a couple of grooms to be stationed on the moor I gave them their orders and then went on to Farrow s cottage alone If they have followed out those orders we shall soon see Here he stepped to the door of the stable put his two forefingers between his lips and whistled shrilly In half a minute more the two grooms came into the stable and between them the gallant captain tousled and rather dirty and with his beautiful hair and moustache awry Got him my lads I see said Cleek Yes sir Nabbed him sneakin out the back way like you thought he would sir and bein as you said it was the major s orders we copped him on the jump and have been holdin of him for further orders ever since Well you can let him go now said Cleek serenely And just give your attention to locking the door and lighting up Major Doctor mister Narkom pray be seated The dear captain is going to give you all a little entertainment and the performance is about to begin As good with your fists as you are with a metal headed hunting crop Captain None of your dashed business what I m good at replied the captain Look here Norcross You cut that at once roared the major If you open your head to me I ll bang it off you you brute Well then you mister Policeman Ready for you in a minute Captain don t get impatient said Cleek as he laid aside his coat and began to roll up his sleeves Rome wasn t built in a day though beauty may be wrecked in a minute You ll have the time of your life this evening You are really too beautiful to live Captain and I m going to come as near to killing you as I know how without actually completing the job You see that poor little Highland lassie hasn t a father or brother to do this business for her so she s kindly consented to my taking it on in her behalf I m afraid I shall break that lovely nose of yours my gay gallant and I don t give a damn if I do A brute that spoils a woman s life deserves to go through the world with a mark to record it and I m going to put one on you to the best of my ability All seated gentlemen Right you are Now then Captain come on Come on you swine It was twenty minutes later Lady Mary Norcross deep in the obligatory business of dressing for dinner had just taken up a powder puff and was assiduously dabbing the back of her neck when the door behind her opened softly and the voice of her liege lord travelled across the breadth of the room saying Mary May I come in a minute dear I just want to get my cheque book out of your writing desk that s all Yes certainly Come in by all means gave back her ladyship I m quite alone Springer has finished with me and oh Good heavens Seton My dear my dear All right Don t get frightened It isn t mine And it isn t his either much of it We ve been having a little set to at the stable and I got it hugging a policeman Seton Yes I know it s awful but I simply couldn t help it Demmit it Mary don t look so shocked I d have kissed the beggar as well if I thought I could acquire the trick of that heavenly jab with the left that way I haven t had such a beautiful time since the day I was twenty one darling he fights like a blooming angel that chap What chap What on earth are you talking about That man Cleek Weeping Widows It was the prettiest job you ever saw We re sending the beggar over to the hospital and Tell you all about it when I get back Can t stop just now dear Bye bye Then the door closed with a smack and man and cheque book were on their way downstairs CHAPTER XV It is a recognized fact in police circles that crime has a curious propensity for indulging in periodical outbursts of great energy great fecundity and then lapsing into a more or less sporadic condition for a time like a gorged tiger that drowses and stirs only to lick its chops after a hideous feast So that following the lines of these fixed principles the recent spell of criminal activity was succeeded by a sort of lull and the next two weeks were idle ones for Cleek Idle but idyllic from his point of view for he was back in the little house in the pleasant country lands now with his walled garden his ferns and his flowers and the full glory of tulip time was here And soon another glory would be here as well In twelve more days she would be back in England In twelve more days he and Dollops would move out and Ailsa Lorne would move in and this little Eden in the green and fragrant meadowlands would have another tenant from that time forth But hers would not be a lonely tenancy however for Captain Horatio Burdage had recently written to missus Condiment that as the Sleeping Mermaid seemed likely to prove an unprofitable investment after all and to bring her little reward for her labours he purposed relinquishing it and recalling Old Joseph to him and with that end in view had already secured for the good lady a position as companion housekeeper to one Miss Ailsa Lorne who in the early part of June would call upon her at her present quarters and personally conduct her and the deaf and dumb maid of all work to their future ones Here then in this bower of bloom would this dear girl of his heart await the coming of that glorious day when the last act of restitution had been made the last Vanishing Cracksman debt wiped off the slate and he could go to her clean handed at last to ask the fulfilment of her promise Remembering that it was a sheer delight to be free from all Yard calls for a time that he might give his whole attention to the work of getting the place ready for her and day after day he was busy in the high walled old world garden digging planting pruning that when she came it might be brimming over with flowers But although he devoted himself mind and body to this task and lived each day within the limits of that confining wall he had not wholly lost touch with the world at large for each morning the telephone installed against the time of Ailsa s tenancy put him into communication with mister Narkom at the Yard and each night a newspaper carried in to him by Dollops kept him abreast of the topics of the times It was over that telephone he received the first assurance that his haste in getting out of Yorkshire had not been an unnecessary precaution his suspicions regarding the probable action of the Nosworths not ill grounded for mister Narkom was able to inform him that carefully made inquiries had elicited the intelligence that within two days after the Round House affair men who were undoubtedly foreigners were making diligent inquiries throughout the West Riding regarding the whereabouts of two men and a boy who had been travelling about in a two horsed caravan That sudden bolt of ours was a jolly good move old chap said the superintendent when he made this announcement It did the beggars absolutely Shouldn t be a bit surprised if they d chucked the business as a bad job and gone back to the Continent disgusted At any rate none of my plain clothes men has seen hide nor hair of one of the lot since either in town or out Waldemar too seems to have hooked it and can t be traced so I reckon we ve seen the last of him But Cleek was not so sure of that He had his own ideas as to what this disappearance of the Apaches meant and did not allow himself to be lulled into any sense of security by it There were more ways than one in which to catch a weasel he recollected and determined not to relax his precautions in the smallest iota when next the Yard s call for his services should come That it would come soon he felt convinced as the days advanced that rounded out the end of his second week of freedom from it and what form it would take when it did come was a matter upon which he could almost have staked his life so sure he felt of it For a time of great national excitement great national indignation had arrived and the press had made him acquainted with all the circumstances connected therewith As why not when the whole country was up in arms over it and every newspaper in the land headlined it in double caps and poured forth the story in full detail It had its genesis in something which had happened at Gosport in the preceding week and happened in this startling manner In the waterway between Barrow Island and the extreme end of the Royal Clarence Victualling Yard there had been found floating the body of a man of about five and thirty years of age fully and fashionably clothed and having all those outward signs which betoken a person of some standing It was evident at once that death must have been the result of accident and that the victim had been unable to swim for the hands were encased in kid gloves the coat was tightly buttoned and a pair of field glasses in a leather case still hung from the long shoulder strap which supported the weight of them The victim s inability to swim was established by the fact that he had made no effort to rid himself of these hampering conditions and was clinging tightly to a foot long bit of driftwood which he must have clutched at as it floated by It was surmised therefore that the man must have fallen into the water in the dark either from the foreshore or from some vessel or small boat in which he was journeying at the time and had been carried away by the swift current and drowned without being missed the condition of the body clearly establishing the fact that it had been in the water for something more than a fortnight when found Later it was identified by one of the deck hands of the pleasure steamer which cruises round the Isle of Wight daily as being that of a man he had seen aboard that vessel on one of its night trips to Alum Bay between two and three weeks previously and still later it was discovered that a boatman in that locality had been hired to take a gentleman from the Needles to a yacht lying out to sea that selfsame night and that the gentleman in question never turned up What followed gave these two circumstances an appalling significance For when the body was carried to the mortuary and its clothing searched for possible clues to identification there was found upon it a sealed packet addressed simply A Steinmueller Koenigstrasse eight and inside that packet there were two unmounted photographs of the exterior of Blockhouse Fort and the Southsea Fort a more or less accurate ground plan drawing of the interior of the Portsmouth Dockyard together with certain secret information relative to supplies and to the proposed armament of cruisers now undergoing alteration and reequipment The wrath and amazement engendered by that discovery however were as nothing compared with the one which so swiftly followed Brought up before the Admiral Superintendent and the Board John Beachman the dock master who alone knew these things outside of the Admiralty was obliged to admit that one person and one only his eldest son was in a position to obtain admission to the safe in which he kept his private papers and that son was engaged to a young lady whom he had met during a holiday tour on the Continent English or foreign he was asked to which he replied that she was English or at least English by birth although her late father was a German He had become naturalized before his death and was wholly in sympathy with the country of his adoption He did not die in it however Circumstances had caused him to visit the United States and he had been killed in one of the horrible railway disasters for which that country was famous It was because the daughter was thus left orphaned and was so soon to become the wife of their son that he and missus Beachman had taken her into their home in advance of the marriage They did not think it right that she should be left to live alone and unprotected considering what she was so soon to become to them so they had taken her into the home and their son had arranged to sleep at an hotel in Portsmouth pending the date of the wedding The lady s name was Hilmann Miss Greta Hilmann She was of extremely good family and quite well to do in her own right She had never been to Germany since the date of the engagement She had relatives there however one in particular a Baron von Ziegelmundt and his son Axel The son had visited England twice once many months back and the last time some seven or eight weeks ago They liked him very much the bridegroom elect especially so They had become very great friends indeed No Axel von Ziegelmundt was no longer in England He had left it something like a month ago He was on a pleasure trip round the world he had heard but had no idea where he had gone when he left Portsmouth Two hours after this statement was made if the populace could have got hold of young Harry Beachman it would have torn him to pieces for it was then discovered that the drowned man was no less a person than this Herr Axel von Ziegelmundt and that they had not only spent the greater part of that particular day shut up in the former s room in the Portsmouth hotel but had been together up to the very moment when the excursion steamer had started on its moonlight trip to Alum Bay and to the bringing about of that providential accident which had prevented the State affairs of an unsuspecting nation from being betrayed to a secret foe What followed was in the face of this of course but natural John Beachman was suspended immediately and his son s arrest ordered It served no purpose that he denied indignantly the charge of being a traitor and swore by every sacred thing that the hours spent in his room at the hotel were passed in endeavouring to master the intricacies of the difficult German card game Skaat and that never in all their acquaintance had one word touching upon the country or the country s affairs passed between Axel von Ziegelmundt and himself so help him God It was in vain also that Greta Hilmann shouting hysterically her belief in him and begging wildly that if he must be put into prison she might be taken with him and murdered when you murder him if he is to be court martialled and shot you wretched blunderers it was in vain that Greta Hilmann clung to him and fought with all her woman s strength to keep the guard from laying hands upon him or to tear her from his side the outraged country demanded him and took him in spite of all Nor did it turn the current of sympathy in his direction that crazed when they tore him from her this frantic creature had gone from swoon to swoon until her senses left her entirely and the end was tragedy The full details were never forthcoming The bare facts were that she was carried back to Beachman s house in a state of hysteria bordering close upon insanity and that when under orders from the Admiralty that house and all its contents were impounded pending the fullest inquiry into the dock master s books and accounts the Admiral Superintendent and the appointed auditor entered into possession her condition was found to be so serious that it was decided not to insist upon her removal for a day or two at least A nurse was procured from the naval hospital and put in charge of her but at some period during the fourth night of that nurse s attendance and when she worn out by constant watching slept in her chair the half delirious patient arose and leaving a note to say that life had lost all its brightness for her and if they cared to find her they might look for her in the sea vanished entirely She could scarcely have hit upon a worse thing for the evil repute of her lover s name or her own For those who had never known her personally were quick to assert that this was proof enough of how the thing had been managed In short that she too was a spy and that she had adopted this subterfuge to get back to Germany before the scent grew hot and the law could lay a hand upon her Those who had known her took a more merciful view so far as she was concerned but one which made things look all the blacker for her lover What could her desperation and her utter giving up all hope even before the man was put on trial mean if it was not that she knew he was guilty knew he would never get off with his life and that her suicide was a tacit admission of this CHAPTER XVI Meanwhile public indignation ran high the investigation of the dock master s books papers and accounts proceeded in camera and all England waited breathlessly for the result to be made known Thus matters stood when on Thursday night at half past seven o clock exactly one week after the discovery of that packet on the body of the drowned man an amazing thing happened a thing which smacked almost of magic and put to shame all that had gone before in the way of mystery surprise and terror The wildest storm that had been known on that coast for years had been raging steadily ever since daybreak and was raging still A howling wind coming straight over the Channel from France was piling ink black seas against an ink black shore and all the devils of the pit seemed to be loose in the noisy darkness In the suspended dock master s house the Admiral Superintendent Sir Charles Fordeck together with his private secretary mister Paul Grimsdick and the auditor mister Alexander MacInery who had been continuing their investigations since morning were now coming within sight of the work s end the only occupants of a locked and guarded room outside of which a sentry was posted while round about the house in the stormy outer darkness other guards patrolled ceaselessly Over the books Sir Charles and the auditor bent at one end of the room at the other Paul Grimsdick tapped on his typewriter and made transcripts from the shorthand notes beside him It was at this instant just when the clock on the mantel was beginning to chime the half hour after seven that such a crash of thunder ripped out of the heavens that the very earth seemed to tremble with the force of it and the three men fairly jumped in their seats Gad that was a stunner if you like exclaimed Sir Charles with a laugh Something went down that time or I miss my guess Something had gone down gone down in black and white too at that and before another half hour had passed the mystery and the appalling nature of that something was made known to him and to his two companions The operator at the central telegraph office sitting beside a silent instrument with the key open deciphering a message which a moment before had come through jumped as they had jumped when that crash of thunder sounded then without hint or warning up spoke the open instrument beginning a sentence in the middle and chopping it off before it was half done Hullo that deflected something crossed communication or I m a Dutchman he said and bent over to take it In another moment he got more of a shock than twenty thunderbolts could possibly have given him For translated that interrupted communication ran thus and eight inch guns The floating conning tower s lateral plates of And there as abruptly as it began the communication left off Good God There s another damned German spy at it exclaimed the operator jumping from his seat and grabbing for his hat Gawdermity Hawkins take this instrument and watch for more Somebody s telegraphin naval secrets from the dockyard and the storm s tapped a wire somewhere and sent the message to us Then he flung himself out into the storm and darkness and ran and ran and ran But the mystery of the thing was all the greater when the facts came to be examined For those two parts of sentences were found to be verbatim copies of the shorthand notes which mister Paul Grimsdick had just taken down These notes had never left the sight of the three men in the guarded room of that guarded house for so much as one second since they were made No one but they had passed either in or out of that room during the whole seven days of the inquiry There was no telegraph instrument in the room in the house or within any possible reach from it Yet somebody in that building somebody who could only know the things by standing in that room and copying them for never once had they been spoken of by word of mouth some invisible impalpable superhuman body was wiring State secrets from it How And to whom Naturally this state of affairs set the whole country by the ears and evoked a panicky condition which was not lessened by the Press frothing and screaming Thus matters stood on the evening of Wednesday the twenty second of May and thus they still stood on the morning of the twenty third when the telephone rang and Dollops rushed into Cleek s bedroom crying excitedly and disjointedly mister Narkom sir Ringing up from his own house Wants you in a hurry National case he says and not a minute to lose Cleek was out of bed and at the instrument in a winking but he had no more than spoken the customary Hello into the receiver when the superintendent s voice cut in cyclonically and swept everything before it in a small tornado of excited words Call of the Country dear chap he cried That infernal dockyard business at Portsmouth Sir Charles Fordeck just sent through a call for you Rush like hell Don t stop for anything Train it over to Guildford if you have to charter a special Meet you there in the Portsmouth Road with the limousine at seven thirty We ll show em by God yes Good bye Then click went the instrument as the communication was cut off and away went Cleek like a gunshot on a wild rush for his clothes The sun was but just thrusting a crimson arc into view in the transfigured east when he left the house on a hard run for part at least of the way must be covered afoot and the journey was long but by four o clock it was almost as bright as midday and the possibility of securing a conveyance for the rest of the distance was considerably increased by that fact by five he had secured one and by seven he was in the Portsmouth Road at Guildford munching the sandwiches Dollops had thoughtfully slipped into his pocket and keeping a sharp lookout for the coming of the red limousine It swung up over the rise of the road and came panting toward him at a nerve racking pace while it still lacked ten minutes of being the appointed half hour and so wild was the speed at which Lennard in his furious interest was making it travel that Cleek could think of nothing to which to liken it but a red streak whizzing across a background of leaf green with splatters of mud flying about it and an owl eyed demon for pilot It pulled up with a jerk when it came abreast of him but so great was Lennard s excitement so deep seated his patriotic interest in the business he had in hand he seemed to begrudge even the half minute it took to get his man aboard and before you could have turned around twice the car was rocketing on again at a demon s pace Gad but he s full of it the patriotic beggar said Cleek with a laugh as he found himself deposited in Narkom s lap instead of on the seat beside him so sudden was the car s start the instant he was inside It might give our German friends pause don t you think mister Narkom if they could get an insight into the spirit of the race as a fighting unit It ll give em hell if they run up against it make no blooming error about that rapped out the superintendent too hot in the choler to be choice of words It s a nasty little handful to fall foul of when its temper is up and this damned spy business done behind a mask of friendship in times of peace Look here Cleek If it comes to the point just give me a gun with the rest I ll show the Government that I can lick something beside insurance stamps for my country s good by James yes Just so said Cleek with one of his curious crooked smiles He was used to these little patriotic outbursts on the part of mister Narkom whenever the German bogey was dragged out by the Press But let us hope it will not come to that It would be an embarrassment of riches so far as our friends the editors are concerned don t you think to have two wars on their hands at the same time And I see by papers that the long threatened Mauravanian revolution has broken out at last In short that our good friend Count Irma has made his escape from Sulberga put himself at the head of the Insurgents and is organizing a march on the capital Here he pulled himself up abruptly as if remembering something and before mister Narkom could put in a word launched into the subject of the case in hand and set him thinking and talking of other things CHAPTER XVII It had gone nine by all the reliable clocks in town when the wild race to the coast came to an end and after darting swallowlike through the wind swept streets of Portsmouth the limousine mud splashed and disreputable rushed up to the guarded entrance of the suspended dock master s house at Portsea and precisely one and a quarter minutes thereafter Cleek stood in the presence of the three men most deeply concerned in the clearing up of this mystifying affair He found Sir Charles Fordeck a dignified and courtly gentleman of polished manners and measured speech although now quite naturally labouring under a distress of mind which visibly disturbed him He found mister Paul Grimsdick his secretary a frank faced straight looking young Englishman of thirty mister Alexander MacInery a stolid unemotional Scotsman of middle age with a huge knotted forehead eyebrows like young moustaches and a face like a face of granite and he found too reason to believe that each of these was in his separate way a man to inspire confidence and respect I can hardly express to you mister Cleek how glad I am to meet you and to have you make this quick response to my appeal said the Admiral Superintendent offering him a welcoming hand I feel that if any man is likely to get to the bottom of this mysterious business you are that man And that you should get to the bottom of it quickly at whatever cost by whatever means is a thing to be desired not only in the nation s interest but for the honour of myself and my two colleagues I hardly think that your honour will be called into question Sir Charles replied Cleek liking him the better for the manliness which prompted him in that hour of doubt and difficulty to lay aside all questions of position and by the word colleague lift his secretary to the level of himself so that they might be judged upon a common plane as men and men alone It would be a madman indeed who would hint at anything approaching treason with regard to Sir Charles Fordeck No madder than he who would hint it of either of these said Sir Charles laying a hand upon the shoulder of the auditor and the secretary and placing himself between them I demand to be judged by the same rule set upon the same plane with them We three alone were in this house when that abominable thing happened we three alone had access to the records from which that information was wired It never for so much as the fraction of one second passed out of our keeping or our sight if it was wired at all it must have been wired from this house from that room and in that case one or other of us must positively have been the person to do so Well I did not MacInery did not Grimsdick did not And yet as you know the wiring was done we should never stand a chance of knowing to whom nor by whom but for the accident which deflected the course of the message H m Yes I don t think commented Cleek reflectively It won t wash that theory no decidedly it won t wash Pardon Oh no Sir Charles I am not casting any doubt upon the telegraph operator s statement of the manner in which he received the message it is his judgment that is at fault not his veracity Of course there have been cases very rare ones happily of one wire automatically tapping another through as he suggested there being a break and an overlapping of the broken wire on to the sound one but in the present instance there isn t a ghost of a chance of such a thing having happened In other words Sir Charles it is as unsound in theory as it is false in fact mister Narkom has been telling me on the way here that the operator accounted for the sudden starting of the message to the falling of a storm snapped wire upon an uninjured one and for its abrupt cessation to the slipping off of that broken wire under the influence of the strong gale Now as we entered the town and proceeded through it I particularly noted the fact that no broken wires were anywhere visible nor was there sight or sign of men being engaged in repairing one Ah yes agreed Sir Charles a trifle dubiously that may be quite so mister Cleek but if you will pardon my suggesting it is there not the possibility of a flaw in your reasoning upon that point The wire in question may not have been located in that particular district through which you were travelling I don t think there is any chance of my having made an error of that sort Sir Charles replied Cleek smiling Had I been likely to do so our friend the telegraph operator would have prevented it He recognized at once that the communication was coming over the wire from the dockyard I am told and I have observed that every one of the dockyard wires is intact I fancy when we come down to the bottom of it we shall discover that it was not the dockyard wire which tapped a message from some other but that the dockyard wire was being tapped itself and that the storm causing a momentary interruption in the carrying on of that tapping process allowed a portion of the message to slip past and continue to the wire s end the telegraph office Good lud Then in that case In that case mister Narkom there can be no shadow of a doubt that that message was sent by somebody in this house and over the dockyard s own private wire But how mister Cleek in the name of all that is wonderful how Ah that is the point Sir Charles I think we need not go into the matter of who is at the bottom of the whole affair but confine ourselves to the business of discovering how the thing was done and how much information has already gone out to the enemy I fancy we may set our minds at rest upon one point however namely the identity of the person whose hand supplied the drawing found upon the body of the drowned man That hand was a woman s that woman I feel safe in saying was Sophie Borovonski professionally known to the people of the underworld as La Tarantula I never heard of her mister Cleek Who is she Probably the most beautiful unscrupulous reckless dare devil spy in all Europe Sir Charles She is a Russian by birth but owns allegiance to no country and to no crown Together with her depraved brother Boris and her equally desperate paramour Nicolo Ferrand she forms one of the trio of paid bravos who for years have been at the beck and call of any nation despicable enough to employ them always ready for any piece of treachery or dirty work so long as their price is paid as cunning as serpents as slippery as eels as clever as the devil himself and as patient We shall not go far astray gentlemen if we assert that the lady s latest disguise was that of Miss Greta Hilmann Good God Young Beachman s fiancee Exactly Sir Charles I should not be able to identify her from a photograph were one obtainable which I doubt she is far too clever for that sort of thing but the evidence is conclusive enough to satisfy me at least of the lady s identity But how how mister Narkom will tell you Sir Charles that from our time of starting this morning to our arrival here we made but one stop That stop was at the Portsmouth mortuary before we appeared at this house I wished to see the body of the man who was drowned I have no hesitation Sir Charles in declaring that that man s name is not and never was Axel von Ziegelmundt The body is that of Nicolo Ferrand La Tarantula s clever lover The inference is obvious Miss Greta Hilmann s anguish and despair were real enough believe me that is why it deceived everybody so completely It is not however over the frightful position of young Beachman that she sorrowed but over the death of Ferrand Had he lived I believe she has daring enough to have remained here and played her part to the end but she either lost her nerve and her mental balance which by the way is not in the least like her under any circumstances whatsoever or some other disaster of which we know nothing overtook her and interfered with her carrying on the work in conjunction with her brother Her brother Yes He would be sure to be about They all three worked in concert Gad if I d only been here before the vixen slipped the leash if I only had Let us have the elder mister Beachman in if you please Sir Charles there s a word or so I want to have with him You ve had him summoned of course Yes he and the telegraph operator as well I thought you might wish to question both replied he Grimsdick go or no I ll go myself Beachman ought to know of this appalling thing and it is best that it should be broken by a friend Speaking he left the room coming back a few minutes later in company with the telegraph operator and the now almost hysterical dock master He waited not one second for introduction or permission or anything else that excited father but rushed at Cleek and caught him by the hand It s my boy and you re clearing him God bless you he exclaimed catching Cleek s hand and wringing it with all his strength It isn t in him to sell his country I d have killed him with my own hand years ago if I thought it was But it wasn t it never was My boy my boy my splendid loyal boy That s right old chap have it out Here on my shoulder if you want to daddy and don t be ashamed of it said Cleek and reached round his arm over the man s shoulder and clapped him on the back Let her go and don t apologize because it s womanish A man without a strain of the woman in him somewhere isn t worth the powder to blow him to perdition We ll have him cleared daddy gad yes And look here When he is cleared you take him by the ear and tell him to do his sweethearting in England the young jackass and to let foreign beauties alone they re not picking up with young Englishmen of his position for nothing especially if they are reputed to have money of their own and to be connected with titled families If you can t make him realize that by gentle means take him into the garden and bang it into him hard Thank you sir thank you I can see it now mister Cleek Not much use in shouting Rule Britannia if you re going to ship on a foreign craft is there sir But anybody would have been taken in with her she seemed such a sweet gentle little thing and had such winning ways And when she lost her father the wife and I simply couldn t help taking her to our hearts Quite so Ever see that father mister Beachman Yes sir once the day before he sailed or was supposed to have sailed for the States Short thick set man was he Carried one shoulder a little lower than the other and had lost the top of a finger on the left hand Yes sir the little finger That s him to a T Boris Borovonski declared Cleek glancing over at Sir Charles No going to the States for that gentleman with a deal like this on hand He d be close by and in constant touch with her Did she have any friends in the town mister Beachman No not one She appeared to be of a very retiring disposition and made no acquaintances whatsoever The only outside person I ever knew her to take any interest in was a crippled girl who lived with her bedridden mother and took in needlework Greta heard of the case and went to visit them Afterward she used to carry work to them frequently and sometimes fruit and flowers Ever see that bedridden woman or that cripple girl No sir never Harry and I would be busy here most of the days so she always went alone Did she ever ask missus Beachman to accompany her Not that I ever heard of sir But it would have been to no purpose if she had The wife is a very delicate woman she rarely ever goes anywhere Hum m m I see So then you really do not know if there actually was a woman or a girl at all Any idea where the persons were supposed to live Yes They hired a room on the top floor of a house adjoining the Ocean Billow Hotel sir At least Reggie that s my youngest son mister Cleek saw Greta go in there and look down from one of the top floor windows one day when he was on his way home from school He spoke to her about it at the dinner table that night and she said that that was where her pensioners lived Pretty good neighbourhood that by Jove for people who were pensioners to be living in commented Cleek The Ocean Billow Hotel is a modern establishment lifts electric lights liveried attendants and caters to people of substance and standing Yes admitted Beachman When I was suspended sir during the examination and this house taken over by Sir Charles I took missus Beachman and Reggie there and we have remained at the place nominally under guard ever since You see being convenient and in a straight line so to speak it offered extra advantages in case of my being summoned here at a moment s notice H m Yes I see said Cleek stroking his chin In a straight line from here eh House next door would of course offer the same advantages and from a room on the top floor a wire tapping device Yes just so I think Sophie I think I smell a very large mouse my dear and I shan t be surprised if we ve hit upon the place of reception for your messages the very first shot Messages mister Cleek Messages interposed Sir Charles You surely do not mean to infer that the woman telegraphed messages from this house Do you forget then that there is no instrument no wire attached to the place Cleek puckered up his brows For the moment he had forgotten that fact Still there are wires passing over it Sir Charles he said presently and if a means of communication with those were established the tapper at the other end could receive messages easily She is a devil of ingenuity is Sophie I wouldn t put it beyond her and her confederates to have rigged up a transmitting instrument of some sort which the woman could carry on her person and attach to the wire when needed Here Sir Charles threw in something which he felt to be in the nature of a facer Quite so he admitted But do not forget mister Cleek that the deflected message was sent last night and that the woman was not then in this house CHAPTER XVIII The queer little one sided smile cocked up the corner of Cleek s mouth Sure of that Sir Charles he inquired placidly Sure that she was not I am told it is true that she left the note saying she was going to drown herself and disappeared four nights ago I am also told that since the date of mister Beachman s suspension this place has been under constant guard night and day but I have not been told however that any of the guards saw her leave the place No no no Don t jump to conclusions so readily gentlemen She will be out of it now out and never likely to return the news of that miscarried message would warn her that something was wrong and she would be up and out of it like a darting swallow The question is how and when did she get out Let s have in the guard and see The sentries were brought in one after the other and questioned At no time since they were first put on guard they declared at no time either by day or by night had any living creature entered or left the house up to now except the Admiral Superintendent his secretary the auditor and the nurse who had been summoned to look after the stricken girl To that they one and all were willing to take solemn oath There is an old French proverb which says He that protests too much leads to the truth in spite of himself It was the last man to be called who did this No sir nobody passed either in or out I ll take my dying oath to that asserted he his feelings riled up by the thought that this constant questioning of his statement was a slur upon his devotion to his duty There aren t nobody going to hint as I m a slacker as don t know what he s a doing of or a blessed mug that don t obey orders no sir no fear Sir Charles s orders was Nobody in or out and nobody in or out it was my hat yuss Why sir turning to the dock master you must a known he must a told you I wouldn t allow even young Master Reggie in last night when he came a pleading to be let in to get the school books he d left behind When he what almost roared the dock master fairly jumping Good lord Marshall have you gone off your head Do you mean to claim that you saw my boy here last night Certainly sir Just after that awful clap of thunder it was say about eight or ten minutes after and what with that and the darkness and the way the wind was howling I never see nor heard nothing of him coming till I got to the door and there he was in them light coloured knickers and the pulled down wideawake hat I d seen him wear dozens of times with his coat collar turned up and a drippin umbrella over his head making like he was going up the steps to try and get in Who s there as I sings to him though I needn t for the little light was streaking out through the windows showed me what he was wearing and who it was well enough It s me Master Reggie Marshall he says I ve come to get my school books I left em behind in the hurry and father says he s sure you ll let me go in and get em Oh does he says I Well I m surprised at him and at you too Master Reggie a thinking I d go against orders Word is that nobody gets in and nobody does even the king hisself till them orders is changed So you just come away from that door and trot right away back to your pa I says to him and ask him from me what kind of a sentry he thinks Bill Marshall is Which sets him a snivelling and a pleading till I has to take him by the shoulder and fair drag him away before I could get him to go as he d been told Well done Sophie exclaimed Cleek Gad what a creature of resource the woman is and what an actress she would make the vixen No need to ask you if your son really did come over here last night mister Beachman your surprise and indignation have answered for you I should think it would by George rapped out the dock master What sort of an insane man must you have thought me Marshall to credit such a thing as that As if I d have been likely to let a delicate fifteen year old boy go out on an errand of any kind in a beast of a storm like last night s much less tell him that he was to ask a sentry in my name to disobey his orders Good God gentlemen it s simply monstrous Why look here Sir Charles look here mister Cleek Even if I d been guilty of such a thing and the boy was willing to go out he couldn t have done it to save his life The poor little chap met with an accident last night and he s been in bed ever since He was going down the stairs on his way to dinner when that terrific clap of thunder came and the blessed thing startled him so much that in the pitch darkness he missed his footing fell clear to the bottom of the staircase and broke his collar bone Poor little lad Too bad too bad sympathized Sir Charles feelingly and possibly would have said more but that Cleek s voice broke in softly but with a curiously sharp note underlying its sleekness In the pitch darkness mister Beachman it inquired The pitch darkness of a public hotel at dinner time Isn t that rather extraordinary It would be under any other circumstances sir but that infernal clap of thunder interfered in some way with the electric current and every blessed light in the hotel went smack out whisk like that and left the place as black as a pocket Everybody thought for the moment that the wires must have fused but it turned out that there was nothing the matter with them only that the current had been interrupted for a bit for the lights winked on again as suddenly as they had winked out By Jupiter Cleek cracked out the two words like the snapping of a whip lash then quickly turned round on his heel and looked straight and intently at the telegraph operator Speak up quick he said in the sharp staccato of excitement I am told that when that crash came and the diverted message began there was a force that almost knocked you off your stool Is that true Yes sir the man replied perfectly true It was something terrific The Lord only knows what it would have been if I d been touching the instrument You d have been as dead as Julius Caesar flung back Cleek No wonder she cut away to see what was wrong the vixen No wonder the lights went out mister Narkom the limousine quick Come along Sir Charles come along mister Beachman come along at once Where mister Cleek where To the top floor of the house next door to the Ocean Billow Hotel Sir Charles to see Miss Greta Hilmann s precious pensioners he made answer rather excitedly Unless I am wofully mistaken gentlemen one part of this little riddle is already solved and the very elements have conspired to protect England to become her foeman s executioner He was not mistaken not in any point with regard to that house and the part it had played in this peculiar case for when they visited it and demanded in the name of the law the right to enter and to interview the bedridden woman and the crippled girl who occupied the top floor they were met with the announcement that no such persons dwelt there nor had ever done so It is let to an invalid it is true the landlady a motherly unsuspecting old soul told them when they made the demand But it is a gentleman not a lady A professional gentleman I believe artist or sculptor something of that sort and never until last night has anybody been with him but his niece who makes occasional calls Last night however a nephew came just for a moment indeed it seemed to me that he had no more than gone upstairs before he came down again and went out Pardon No nobody has called to day neither has the gentleman left his room But he often sleeps until late He was sleeping forever this time For when they came to mount the stairs and force open the door of the room there under a half opened skylight a dead man lay one screwed up contracted hand still clutching the end of a flex which went up and out to the telegraph wires overhead On a table beside the body a fused and utterly demolished telegraph instrument stood and it was evident from the scrap of flex still clinging to this that it had once formed part of that which the dead hand held that it had snapped somehow and that the man was attempting to re attach it to the instrument when death overtook him Gentlemen the wire tapper Boris Borovonski said Cleek as he bent over and looked at him Step here mister Beachman and tell me if this is not the man who played the part of Miss Greta Hilmann s interesting papa Yes yes declared the dock master excitedly after he too had bent over and looked into the dead face It is the very man sir the very one But who but why but how He then looked upward in a puzzled way to where the flex went up and out through the skylight and threading through a maze of wires hooked itself fast to one Electrocuted said Cleek answering that inquiring glance A few thousand volts a flash of flame through heart and head and limbs and then this See his little game mister Narkom See it do you Sir Charles He was taking the message from the tapped wire with that flex and the fragment that reached the telegraph office only got through when the flex snapped The furious gale did that no doubt whipping it away from its moorings so to speak and letting the message flash on before he could prevent it Can t you read the rest when you look up and see that other wire the thick one with the insulated coating torn and frayed by contact with the chimney s rough edge It is not hard to reconstruct the tragedy when one sees that When the flex snapped he jumped up and grabbed it and was in the very act of again attaching it to the instrument when he became his own executioner Look for yourself The wild wind must either have blown the flex against the bared wire of the electric light or the bared wire against the flex that we shall never know and in the winking of an eye he was annihilated No wonder the lights in the hotel went out mister Beachman The whole strength of the current was short circuited through this man s body and it crumpled him up as a glove crumples when it is cast in the fire But the dead hand which had recovered the broken flex still held it you see and no more of the tapped message went down the dockyard wire So long as that message continued so long as the instrument which sent it continued to send it it was received here a mere silent unrecorded impotent thrill locked up in the grip of a dead man s hand And look there the pile of burnt paper beside the fused instrument and the cinder of a matchbox against it The force which obliterated life in him infused it into the dipped heads of those little wooden sticks and flashed them into flame So long as there was anything for that flame to feed upon it continued its work you see and Sophie Borovonski found nothing to take away with her after all Gentlemen the State secrets that were stolen will remain England s own the records were burnt and the dead cannot betray CHAPTER XIX It had gone two o clock The morning s work was done a hasty luncheon disposed of and the investigators were back in the dockmaster s house discussing the curious features of the case again And now gentlemen said Cleek to the unsolved part of the riddle the mysterious manner in which the messages were sent from this house For sent from here they undoubtedly were and by Sophie Borovonski but the question of how still remains to be discovered I make it that it s the devil s own work mister Cleek said MacInery and that there must have been some accident connected with it the same as with the taking off of the wire tapping chap Hardly that I m afraid replied Cleek I think it was accident which put a stop to the proceedings here not one which created them We now know perfectly well that the woman was in this house undiscovered and unsuspected for days and you may safely lay your life that she wasn t idle wasn t stopping here for nothing The pile of papers burnt shows very clearly that considerable intelligence had been forwarded to her brother so it is safe to infer that she was wiring it to him constantly But how was it possible for her to obtain that information queried Sir Charles I again declare to you most solemnly mister Cleek that no one entered or left the room that no word was spoken that could be said to have any bearing upon secret matters so nothing could possibly be overheard and how could the woman read documents which were never out of our sight for a minute Granted that she had some means of wiring intelligence to her brother indeed we now know that to have been the case how under God s heaven did she obtain that intelligence Well that s a facer certainly Sir Charles but with such a past mistress of ingenuity as she well you never know Sure she couldn t possibly have managed to get into the room and hide herself somewhere you think I am positive she couldn t The thing isn t possible There s no place where she could have hidden Come in and see He unlocked the door and followed by the rest led the way into the room where the inquiry into the dockmaster s affairs had been held A glance about it was sufficient to corroborate Sir Charles s statement On one side stood a large fireproof safe closely locked on the other were two windows iron grilled and with inside shutters of steel at one end was a large flat topped table at which Sir Charles and MacInery had conducted their investigation of the books et cetera and at the other a smaller writing table upon which stood a typewriter set on a sound deadening square of felt and over which hung a white disked electric bulb There were five chairs and not another mortal thing No cupboard no wardrobe no chest nothing under heaven in which a creature any bigger than a cat could have hidden You see said Sir Charles with a wave of the hand she couldn t have hidden in here neither could she have hidden outside and overheard for nothing was said that could have been of any use to her Quite confident of that Oh I can answer for that mister Cleek put in young Grimsdick We were so careful upon that point that Sir Charles never dictated even the smallest thing that he wanted recorded merely passed over the papers and said Copy that where I have marked it and to save my table from being overcrowded I scratched down the marked paragraphs in shorthand and prepared to transcribe them on the typewriter later Why sir look here the diabolical part of the mystery is that those two fragments of sentences flashed out at the telegraph office at the time of that frightful peal of thunder and at that very instant I was in the act of transcribing them on the typewriter Hello Hello rapped out Cleek twitching round sharply Sure of that are you absolutely sure Beyond all question mister Cleek Sir Charles will tell you that the thunder clap was so violent and so sudden that both he and mister MacInery fairly jumped As for me I was so startled that I struck a wrong letter by mistake and had to rub out a word and type it over again Come and see The paper is still on my table and I can show you the erasure and the alteration Now nobody could have seen that paper at that particular time not a solitary word had been spoken with regard to it and it wasn t more than half a minute before that Sir Charles himself had taken it out of the safe Look sir here s the paper and here s the place where I erased the word see Cleek walked over to the typewriter and looked at the paper saw the erasure lifted it looked at other typed sheets lying under it and then knotted up his brows H m he said reflectively and looked farther You ve got a devilish hard touch for a man who does this sort of thing constantly and ought therefore to be an adept in the art of typewriting evenly And there are other errors and erasures Look here my friend I don t believe you re used to this machine No sir I m not I m not accustomed to a shift key My own machine hasn t one Your own By Gad What are you using this machine for then if you ve got one of your own And why didn t you bring your own when you came here on important business like this I did but as we found this one already here I started in on it and when I found it difficult to work I went out to get my own which I d left in the outer room just as I d taken it from the carrier who brought it over But the careless beggar must have handled it as if it were a trunk for the spring was broken the carriage wouldn t work and two of the type bars were snapped off By Jupiter Cleek s voice struck in so suddenly and with such vehemence that it was almost a bark like that of a startled terrier and mister Narkom knowing the signs fairly jumped at him You ve found out something I know he cried What is it old chap eh Let me alone let me alone flung back Cleek irritably I want the dockmaster I want him at once Where is the man Oh there you are mister Beachman Speak up quickly Was that Hilmann woman ever allowed to enter this room Did she ever make use of this typewriter at any time Yes sir often he replied She was one of the best and most careful typists I ever saw Used to attend to all my correspondence for me and Good God man what are you doing Don t you know that that thing s Government property For Cleek not waiting for him to finish what he was saying had suddenly laid hands on the machine found it screwed fast to the table and catching up the nearest chair was now smashing and banging away at it with all his force Government destruction you mean he gave back sharply Didn t I tell you she was a very demon of ingenuity stupid Didn t I say Victory Now then look here all of you Here s a pretty little contrivance if you like He had battered the typewriter from its fastenings and sent it crashing to the floor a wreck not ten seconds before now his hand which immediately thereafter had been moving rapidly over the surface of the sound deadening square of felt beneath whisked that too from the table and let them all see the discovery he had made Protruding from the surface of that table and set at regular intervals there were forty two needle points of steel one for each key of the typewriter which a moment before had pierced the felt s surface just sufficient to meet the bottom of the key above it and to be driven downward when that key was depressed Spectacular as ever in these times he faced about and gave his hand an outward fling Gentlemen the answer to the riddle he said You have been supplying her with the needed information yourselves A ducat to a door knob every time a letter was struck on this machine its exact duplicate was recorded somewhere else Get a saw mister Beachman and let us see to what these steel points lead They led to a most ingenious contrivance as it turned out A highly sensitive spiral spring attached to an arm of thin tough steel beneath the surface of the table communicated with a rigid wire running down the wall behind one of that table s back legs and passing thence through a small gimlet hole in the floor descended and disappeared Following that wire s course they too descended until in the fulness of time the end was reached in a far corner of the cellar underneath the building There behind an upturned empty cask they came upon yet another wire which wound upward and was found afterward to travel out and up beside the leader until it joined the private wire of the dockyard just outside the dormer window of what had once been Miss Greta Hilmann s bedroom And to these wires the one descending and the other ascending from behind that empty cask in the cellar there was a singular contrivance attached To one a plain everyday instrument for dispatching telegrams by the Morse system to the other a curious little keyboard which was an exact counterpart of the keyboard to the typewriter upstairs and besides this there lay some remnants of food from the store cupboard of the house and a sheaf of paper leaves covered with typewritten characters Gentlemen the absolute end of the riddle at last said Cleek as he took up one of those leaves Look at them Government secrets every one And I like an ass forgot to remember that Nicolo Ferrand was one of the cleverest mechanicians and one of the craftiest wire workers that the underworld boasts Look Sir Charles look mister Narkom Every touch of a letter on the keyboard of the typewriter upstairs registered its exact duplicate on this infernal contrivance down here and fast as it was recorded that vixen wired it on to Boris Borovonski Can t you understand now why she left her post and flew to him The shock which killed him and travelled with lessened force down the wire to the telegraph operator was felt here and the instrument she used was in all probability disabled She knew then of course that something had happened to her brother and in a panic flew to find out what But even the shrewdest slip up sometimes and overlook things Her foolish slip lay in this that she forgot to take with her these original drafts of the intelligence she had wired to the dead man Ah weel said mister Alexander MacInery who like a true Scotsman never liked to be found at the small end of the horn upon any occasion after all tis no more than I expected I said it was accident that was at the bottom of it and accident it s turned out to be No doubt agreed Cleek with one of his peculiar smiles But personally I always like to think that there s a Power above and when men and nations have played the game squarely Shan t we be going upstairs Sir Charles mister Narkom and I have a long ride back to town and the afternoon is on the decline It was still farther on that road however before he was able to actually tear himself away from the dockyard and be off home for there were those little legal necessities which are the penalty of dealing with Government affairs to be attended to there was the boring business of meeting high officials and listening to compliments and congratulations and he was really glad when the limousine answering to orders rolled up the final good byes were said and he and mister Narkom swung off townward together But despite the fact that he had just carried to a successful conclusion a case which would go far to enhance his reputation and to hasten the day for which he had so long and so earnestly worked Cleek was singularly uncommunicative markedly abstracted as they rode back through the streets of Portsmouth Town on their way to the highroad and had the superintendent been more observant and less wrapped up in the glory that was to be theirs as the result of the day s adventure he might have discovered that while his ally seemed to be dozing stupidly when he was not leaning back in a corner and smoking he was all the time keeping a close watch of the crowded streets through which they were speeding as if looking for some one or something he expected to see Nor did he relax this peculiar system of vigilance even after the town itself had dropped away into the far distance and the car was scudding along over the broad stretches and the less frequented thoroughfares of the open country I shall not go all the way back with you if you don t mind mister Narkom he said breaking silence abruptly as they raced along Just set me down at the place where you picked me up this morning please and I will do the rest of the journey by train Cinnamon Why Oh just a mere whim of mine that s all No don t press me for an explanation please Where ignorance is bliss et cetera Besides I m a whimsical beggar at best you know and who bothers to inquire why a donkey prefers thistles to hay So just drop me down when we reach the outskirts of Guildford if you will be so kind mister Narkom was discreet enough to drop the subject at that and to make no further allusion to the matter until they came in the fulness of time to the place in question Here he called Lennard to a halt and Cleek alighted not furtively nor yet in haste and standing beside the car reached in and shook hands with him Until you want me again he smiled in his easy offhand way And if that turns out to be a long time off I shan t be sorry Meanwhile if you wish to do me a favour look about for a limousine of another make and a quite different colour I ve an odd idea that this one is fast coming to the end of its career of usefulness Good bye All right Lennard let her go Then the door of the car closed with a smack and he was off and away so openly and at such a leisurely pace that it was clear he had neither need nor desire to effect a getaway unobserved Well I ll be dashed was mister Narkom s unspoken comment upon the proceeding for under his hat he had come to the conclusion that Cleek had in some way by some unconfessed means learned that Waldemar or the Apache had come back into the game and were again on his heels but had said nothing for fear of worrying him Walking off as cool as you please and never the first attempt to come any of his old Vanishing Cracksman s dodges Amazing beggar What s he up to now I wonder It is just possible that could he have followed he would have wondered still more for Cleek was bearing straight down upon the populous portions of the town and about ten minutes after the two had parted struck into the High Street walked along it for a short distance studying the signs over the various buildings until sighting one which announced that it was the Guildford Office of the Royal British Life Assurance Society he crossed the street and with great deliberation passed in under it and disappeared from sight It was one of the contradictory points of his singularly contradictory character that whereas he had chafed under the delay in getting away from the Royal dockyard at Portsea because he was eager to get back to his work in the little old walled garden and all his thoughts were with the flowers he was preparing for her in the end he did not see the place until after the moon was up and all hope of gardening for that day had to be abandoned entirely yet he came back to Dollops whistling and as happy as a sandboy He was up with the first cock crow next morning and dawn found him plying fork and rake and trowel among the flowers and positively bubbling over with enthusiasm for the budding roses were just beginning to show colour and to give promise of full bloom for the day of days and more than that he did not ask of heaven Indeed it was written that he might not for the balance had again swung over the call of Nature again sounded and the Great Mother taking him to her bosom had again merged the Man in the Idealist and cradled him into forgetfulness of all spells but hers So that all through the day he went in and out among his flowers whistling and singing and living in a sort of ecstasy that ran on like a dream without end On the morrow the little garden was all finished and ready and nothing now remained but to sit in idleness and wait CHAPTER XX May had smiled itself out and June had blushed itself in the most wondrous June in Cleek s eyes the world had ever seen For the long waiting was over the old order of things had changed the little house in the meadowlands had its new tenant and she was in England again It did not fret him as it otherwise might have done that he and Dollops had been obliged to go back to the old business of lodging a week here and a week there in the heart of the town rather than within reach of the green trees and the fragrant meadows he loved for always there was the chance of stealing out to meet her in the glorious country lands when the evening came or of a whole day with her in the woods and fields when a whole day could be spared and to a nature such as his these things were recompense enough Not that many days could be spared at present for although nothing had been seen or heard of Waldemar or the Apaches for weeks on end these were strenuous times for mister Narkom and the forces of the Yard and what with the Coronation of his Majesty close at hand and every train discharging hordes of visitors into London day in and day out and crooks of every description homemade as well as imported from the swell mobsman down to the common lag making it the Mecca of an unholy pilgrimage they had their hands filled to overflowing and were worked to their utmost capacity The result so far as Cleek was concerned scarcely needs recording It was not in him to be guilty of that form of snobbishness which is known as standing on his dignity at such a time when the man who had stood his friend was in need of help indeed might lose his official head if he were found wanting in such a crisis so that naturally he came to mister Narkom s assistance and took a hand in the sorting out process in the manner yes and at times in the uniform too of the ordinary constable and proved of such invaluable aid in the matter of scenting out undesirables and identifying professional crooks that things speedily fell into a more orderly shape and he had just begun to look forward to a resumption of those happy days of wandering in the woods with Ailsa when out of the lull of coming peace there fell an official bombshell It took the form of a cablegram a belated cipher communication from the police of America to the police of Great Britain which on being decoded ran thus Just succeeded in tracing two hundred eighteen Sailed ten days ago on Tunisian Allan Line from Canada under name of Hammond Woman with him Handsome blonde Passing as sister Believed to be seven hundred seventy four Now as this little exchange of courtesies relative to the movements of the noted figures of the underworld is of almost daily occurrence between the police systems of the two countries in question mister Narkom had only to consult his Code Book to get at the gist of the matter and when he did get at it his little fat legs bent under him like a couple of straws his round little body collapsed into the nearest chair and he came within a hair s breadth of having a stroke For the Tunisian as it happened had docked and discharged her passengers exactly thirteen hours before so that it was safe to declare that the persons to whom those numerals alluded had unquestionably slipped unchallenged past the guardians of the port and were safely housed at this minute within the intricacies of that vast brick and mortar puzzle London yet here they were registered in the Code Book thus No two hundred eighteen Nicholas Hemmingway popularly known as Diamond Nick American Expert swindler confidence man and jewel thief Ex actor and very skilful at impersonation See Rogues Gallery for portrait No seven hundred seventy four Ella Plawsen variously known to members of the light fingered fraternity as Dutch Ella and Lady Bell German American Probably the most adroit female jewel thief in existence Highly educated exceedingly handsome and amazingly plausible and quick witted Usually does the society dodge Natural blonde and about twenty five years old No photograph obtainable Within forty five minutes after mister Narkom had mastered these facts he had rushed with them to Cleek and there was a vacancy in the list of special constables from that time forth Slipped in have they said Cleek when he heard Well be sure of one thing mister Narkom they will not have gone to a hotel at least in the beginning they are far too sharp for that Neither will they house themselves in any hole and corner where their sallying forth in fine feathers to make their little clean up would occasion comment and so lead to a clue Indeed I shouldn t be surprised if they were far too shrewd to remain together in any place but will elect to operate singly appear to have no connection whatsoever while they are here and to have a sort of happy reunion elsewhere after their little job has been pulled off successfully But in any case when we find them if we ever do depend upon it they will be located in some quiet respectable secluded district one of the suburbs for instance and living as circumspectly as the most prudish of prying neighbours could desire Let us then go in for a series of walking tours about the outlying districts mister Narkom and see if we can t stumble over something that will be worth while It is true I ve never met nor even seen Hemmingway but I fancy I should know if a man were made up or not for the role in which he appears I did however brush elbows with Dutch Ella once It was that time I went over to New York on that affair of the Amsterdam diamonds You remember When I split the reward with the fellow from Mulberry Street whose daughter wanted to study music as a profession and he couldn t afford to let her I hobnobbed with some acquaintances of the er old days over there and went one night to the big French Ball at the Academy of Music where my companion of the night told me there would be a smashing big clean up as half the swell crooks in town would be there for business They were I dare say for he kept pointing out this one and that to me and saying That s so and so as they danced past us I shouldn t know any of them again so far as looks are concerned for the annual French Ball in New York is a masked ball as you are perhaps aware and I shouldn t know Dutch Ella any better than the rest but for one thing although I danced with her Danced with her Cleek Danced Yes For the purpose of getting a line on her shape so to speak for possible future reference I couldn t see her face for she was masked to the very chin but there s a curious tumor like lump as big as a hen s egg just under her right shoulder blade and there s the scar of an acid burn on the back of her left hand that she ll carry to her grave I shall know that scar if ever I see it again And if by any chance I should run foul of a woman bearing one like it and that woman should prove to have also a lump under the right shoulder blade Come along Let s get out and see if we can find one Time flies as the anarchist said when he blew up the clock factory Let s toddle They toddled forthwith but on a fruitless errand as it proved Nevertheless they toddled again the next day as hopefully as ever and the next after that and the next again yet at the end of the fourth they were no nearer any clue to the whereabouts of Dutch Ella and Diamond Nick than they had been in the beginning If as Cleek sometimes fancied they had not merely passed through England on their way to the Continent but were still here housed like hawks in a safe retreat from which they made predatory excursions under the very noses of the police there was nothing to signalize it No amazing jewel theft no affair of such importance as one engineered by them would be sure to be had as yet been reported to the Yard and for all clue there was to their doings or their whereabouts one might as well have set out to find last summer s roses or last winter s snow as hope to pick it up by any method as yet employed Thus matters stood when on the morning of the fifth day Cleek elected to make Hampstead Heath and its environments the scene of their operations and at nine o clock set forth in company with the superintendent to put them into force in that particular locality with the result that by noontime they found themselves in the thick of as pretty a riddle as they had fallen foul of in many a day It came about in this way Turning out of saint Uldred s road into a quiet tree shaded avenue running parallel with the historic heath somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Vale of Health district they looked up to discover that there was but one building in the entire length of the thoroughfare a large imposing residence set back from the road proper and encircled by a high stone wall with curiously wrought iron gates leading into the enclosure and that before that building two copper skinned turbaned fantastically clothed Hindus were doing sentry duty in a manner peculiar unto themselves the one standing as motionless as a bronze image before the barred gateway and the other pacing up and down before him like a clockwork toy that had been well wound up The Punjab for a ducat declared Cleek as he caught sight of them And the insignia of the Ranee of Jhang or I m a Dutchman I knew the old girl was over here for the coronation to be sure but I d no idea of stumbling over some of her attendants in this quarter by Jip Not putting up out here of late is she mister Narkom No She s still at Kensington And what the dickens those johnnies are keeping guard over that place for beats us Know it don t you It s the residence of Sir Mawson Leake Leake Leake you know Jewellers Bond Street Fine old place isn t it Inherited it from his father as he did the business and What s that No not a young man not a young man by any means Grown children two sons One by his first wife and Hullo that s a rum trick by James See that did you old chap See what The manner in which that clockwork johnnie stopped in his tracks and eyed us as we passed No The woman All muffled up to the eyes and in weather like this Just stepped out of the house door saw those two niggers and then bolted back indoors as if the Old Boy was after her Caught sight of us very likely You know what high class Brahmans are where Europeans are concerned It will be the old Ranee herself three to one paying a morning visit to the jeweller in reference to some of her amazing gems That would explain the presence of the sentries She travels nowhere without a guard To be sure admitted the superintendent and walked on dropping the matter from his mind entirely Ten minutes later however it was brought back to it in a rather startling manner for upon rounding the end of the thoroughfare along which they had been walking and coming abreast of an isolated building which was clearly the stable of the house they had recently passed they were surprised to hear the sound of a muffled cry within to catch a whiff of charcoal smoke as the door was flung wildly open by the same muffled female mister Narkom had observed previously and something more than merely startled to have her rush at them the instant she caught sight of them crying out distractedly I was afraid of it I knew it I knew that he would Oh help me gentlemen help me for the love of God I can t lift him I can t drag him out he is too heavy for me My husband In there In there He ll die if you don t get him out They understood then and for the first time what she was driving at and rushed past her into the stable into what had once been designed for a coachman s bedroom to find an apartment literally reeking with the fumes that poured out from a charcoal furnace on the floor and beside that the body of a man inert crumpled up fast sinking into that hopeless state of unconsciousness which precedes asphyxiation by charcoal In the winking of an eye Cleek had caught up the deadly little firebrick furnace and sent it crashing through the plugged up window into the grounds behind letting a current of pure air rush through the place then while Narkom with one hand over his mouth and nostrils and the other swinging a pair of handcuffs by their chain was doing a like thing with another window in the front wall he gathered up the semi conscious man swung him sacklike over his shoulder carried him out into the roadway and propped him up against the side of the stable while he chafed his hands and smacked his cheeks and between times fanned him with his hatbrim and swore at him for a weak backed marrowless thing to call itself a man and yet go in for the poltroon s trick of suicide The woman was still there squeezing her hands and sobbing hysterically but although she had not as yet uncovered her face it did not need that to attest the fact that she was no Hindu but white like the man she had spoken of as her husband and at the very first words she uttered when she saw that he was beyond danger both Cleek and Narkom knew them for what they were Sir Mawson and Lady Leake Mawson how could you she said reproachfully going to him the very instant he was able to get on his feet and folding him to her in an agonized embrace I suspected it when you left the house but oh how could you I don t know he made answer somewhat shamefacedly yet with a note of agony in his voice that made one pity him in spite of all But it seemed too horrible a disgrace to be lived through And now I shall have to face it Oh my God Ada it is too much to ask a man to bear They are there on guard those Hindus protecting me and mine until the Ranee s steward comes to receive the Ladder of Light as promised at Sh h she struck in warningly remembering the presence of the others and clapping her hand over his mouth to stay any further admission for she had heard Cleek repeat after her husband but with a soft significant whistle The Ladder of Light and supplement that with Well I m dashed and turned round on him instantly with a forced smile upon her lips but the look of terror still lingering in her fast winking eyes It is rude of me gentlemen to forget to thank you for your kind assistance and I ask your forgiveness she said I owe you many many thanks and I am endeavouring to express them But as this is merely a little family affair I am sure you will understand It was a polite dismissal Narkom pivoted his little fat body on his heel and prepared to take it Cleek didn t Your pardon but the Ladder of Light can never be regarded as a family affair in any English household whatsoever he said blandly I can give you its exact history if you wish it It is a necklace said to have once been the property of the Queen of Sheba and worn by her at the court of King Solomon It is made up of twelve magnificent steel white diamonds cut semi square and each weighing twenty eight and one half carats They are joined together by slender gold links fitting into minute holes pierced through the edge of each stone It is valued at one million pounds sterling and is the property of the Ranee of Jhang who prizes it above all other of her marvellous and priceless jewels She is not a pleasant old lady to cross the Ranee She would be a shrieking devil if anything were to happen to that necklace your ladyship She had been slowly shrinking from him as the history of the Ladder of Light proceeded now she leaned back against her husband full of surprise and despairing terror and stared and stared in a silence that was only broken by little fluttering breaths of alarm It is uncanny she managed to say at last You know of that Of the necklace You know even me us and yet I have not uncovered my face nor given you my name Are you then gifted with clairvoyance mister mister Cleek he gave back making her a polite bow Cleek is the name Lady Leake Cleek of Scotland Yard That man Dear God that amazing man she cried her whole face lighting up her drooping figure springing erect revitalized At your ladyship s service he replied We are out this morning Superintendent Narkom and I in quest of what is probably the most skilful and audacious pair of jewel thieves in the world just the one particular pair in all the universe to whom a loot so valuable as the Ladder of Light would offer the strongest kind of an appeal So if by any chance something has occurred which threatens the safety of that amazing necklace and you and Sir Mawson are in a position to know the facts Come Take me into your confidence and perhaps Who knows Before he had fairly finished speaking Lady Leake caught up his hand and holding it fast squeezed in both her own looked up at him with bright wet eyes It must have been heaven itself that sent you to us this morning she cried If any man in the world can help us I believe in my soul that you are the man Mawson you hear dearest It is mister Cleek The wonderful mister Cleek Why didn t we think of him before Tell him Mawson tell him everything my dear Sir Mawson acted upon the suggestion instantly mister Cleek I beg I implore you to come to our assistance he exclaimed in a very transport of excitement Lady Leake is right If any man can you are he You ask if anything has happened with regard to that accursed necklace and if I can give you any information on the subject To both questions yes It is gone It is lost It is stolen What s that Stolen The Ladder of Light Good heavens When Where How Yesterday from my keeping From my house And God have mercy on me I have every reason to believe that the thief is my eldest son CHAPTER XXI It was a full minute later and in all that minute s length no one had spoken no one had made a single sound The shock the shame of such a confession telling as it did why he had attempted to destroy himself had crumpled the man up taken all the vitality out of him He faced round and leaned his bent arm against the wall of the stable hid his face in the crook of it and Cleek pitying him let him have that minute all to himself Then Come he said very gently going over to him and patting him on the shoulder Buck up Buck up There s nothing in all the world so deceptive as appearances Sir Mawson perhaps when I ve heard the facts Well haven t I told you that I am out for a pair of expert jewel thieves and that that necklace is just the sort of thing they d be likely to make play for How do you know then that they didn t I wish I could believe that I wish I could even hope it he gave back miserably But you don t know the facts mister Cleek To be sure I don t and they re what I m after Let s have them please To begin with how came the Ladder of Light to be in your possession at all It was brought to me yesterday for repairing by the Ranee s own major domo Not a mere cice mister Cleek but the most trusted of all her henchmen Three of the narrow gold links which hold the stones together had worn thin and needed strengthening It was four o clock in the afternoon when he arrived and the Ranee he said had selected our house for the work on the recommendation of royalty There was several hours work on the thing I saw that the instant I examined it But I was appalled by the fearful responsibility of having a jewel of such fabulous value on the premises with people constantly coming in and going out and determined therefore to take it home and do the repairs myself I informed the Ranee s major domo of that resolution and demanded of him a guard of the Ranee s own attendants to accompany me on the journey and to keep watch over my house until he should come in person to receive the necklace to day He accorded me this willingly departed still retaining possession of the jewel for I would not have it left with me at any cost returned with the guard an hour later handed me the case containing the necklace and I left for home a few minutes after five and the Hindu guard with me On arriving One moment please interposed Cleek Did you examine the case to see if the Ladder of Light was still there before you started Yes mister Cleek I have no very great faith in Hindus at any time so you may be sure I took that precaution the instant the man placed the case in my hands The necklace was there I even went further Before leaving my place of business I submitted the stones to chemical test to be sure that no substitution had been made They were absolutely genuine so that there can be no shadow of doubt that it was the Ladder of Light itself I carried home with me On arriving at my residence I stationed the two Hindu guards at the front gate entered the house and was upon the point of going immediately to my study to subject the stones to yet another chemical test to make sure that no trickery had been practised upon me by the Hindus on the journey when I was unexpectedly pounced upon in the main hallway by my son Henry who was in a greatly excited state and attempted to renew the subject of our unpleasant interview of the day before Here Sir Mawson s voice grew curiously thick and unsteady He paused a moment as if ashamed to go on then stiffened himself and continued mister Cleek he said agitatedly it is necessary that I should tell you at this point something with regard to those who make up the members of my household You needn t I have already heard Lady Leake is I believe your second wife and you have two sons No three he corrected Henry my eldest who is twenty four and is the only survivor of the children of my first and most unhappy marriage Curzon who is just entering his twenty first year and Bevis who has not yet turned seven and is of course still in the nursery I may as well admit to you mister Cleek that my first marriage was a failure that it was none of my own choosing but was consummated in deference to the will and wishes of my parents We were utterly unsuited to each other my first wife and I and it is no doubt only natural that the son she left me when death delivered us both from an irksome bondage should reflect in himself some of those points of difference which made our union a mistake Don t misunderstand me however He is very dear to me dear too to his stepmother who loves him as her own and the one strong feature in his character is the love he gives her in return Then too he is my first born my heir and no man fails to love that first child that ever called him father No man could fail to love this particular one at all events mister Cleek put in her ladyship Wild reckless extravagant yes But at heart the dearest boy Just so interposed Cleek But let us get on please So this dearest boy had an unpleasant interview with you the day before yesterday did he Sir Mawson What was it about The usual thing money He is extravagant to the point of insanity I ve paid his debts until my patience is quite worn out hoping against hope that he will reform At that interview however he asked for a thing I would not listen to Ltwo hundred to settle a gambling debt at his club to take up an I O U that would get him blacklisted as a defaulter if it were not met Then get blacklisted I said to him if there s no other way to cut you off from the worthless lot you associate yourself with You ll not get one farthing from me to settle any such disgraceful thing as a gambling debt rest assured of that Then I walked out of the room and left him and that was the last I saw of him until he pounced upon me in the hall yesterday when I was going to my study with the case containing the Ranee s necklace That was the subject he wanted to renew He d been to town he said and had had a talk with the man to whom he had given the I O U and dad if you ll only do it just this once just this one last once he was saying when I interrupted him I ve no time to listen now and no inclination I ve important business to attend to I said then waved him aside and went into the study and locked the door while I attended to the matter of applying the acid test to the diamonds for the second time Meanwhile he had gone up to Lady Leake s boudoir to implore her to use her influence with me and he was still there when after the stones had again answered to the acid test I carried the necklace up there to leave it in her charge for the brief time it would take me to prepare the tools and materials for the work in hand and told her all about it But I didn t know that at the time mister Cleek for he was sitting in a deep cushioned armchair at the far end of the room and the tall back of that chair was turned toward me Indeed I hadn t the faintest suspicion that there was anybody but Lady Leake and myself in the room until he got up suddenly and said Dad you aren t too busy to listen now Won t you let me ask you what I was going to do downstairs Won t you dad Please Illustration Cleek hears that the fabulous Ladder of Light is back in London again Illustration Young Mawson overhears his parents discussing the problem of the jewel He is extravagant to the point of insanity said Sir Mawson Of course he had heard what I had said mister Cleek although I never gave a thought to that at the time and as Lady Leake had womanlike taken the gorgeous necklace out of the case held it up to her neck and was then viewing herself in her dressing mirror it followed that he also saw But how could I dream of there being anything in that to regret and he a son of mine It was only afterward when it came back to my memory Good God it is too horrible to think of even now much less to talk about Steady steady Sir Mawson sounded Cleek s soothing voice Brakes on Sidetrack your emotions if you can and stick to the mainline Well what followed I have no very clear recollection mister Cleek for just then Lady Leake chose to add her entreaties to his and to ask me if I would permit her to draw her next quarter s pin money in advance and let her take up the I O U for him But I was so furious at the thought of his skulking in like a beggar and a cad and trying to bleed her that I flew into a violent rage ordered him out of the room instantly and forbade his stepmother to lend or give him one farthing either then or at any time thereafter There will be no gambler s I O U s taken up for you by anybody in this house I flung at him If you are in debt get out of it in your own way and as best you can I think that even then I was conscious of a sense of gratification at the way he took that ultimatum mister Cleek for instead of whining like a whipped cur he pulled himself up straight and strong clicked his heels together and said very quietly All right sir I ll take you at your word Thank you for past favours Good bye and then walked out of the room That was the last I have seen or heard of him H m Leave the house did he Yes but not then That was a few minutes before seven A servant saw him on the top landing coming out of his own room with something wrapped up in a parcel after that And another who was busy cleaning up in the lower hall saw him come down and go out at ten minutes past And in the meantime the Ladder of Light had vanished Yes After Henry had left the boudoir I had a few minutes heated argument with Lady Leake then remembering the work I had in hand I left the necklace in her charge and hurried away to rig up a temporary workshop It was about twenty minutes past seven when I finished doing that and went back to Lady Leake s boudoir to get the jewel I found her in a state of the wildest excitement flying about the room like an insane woman and searching everywhere The necklace was gone Only for one single minute of time had it been out of her sight yet in that minute it had vanished utterly and completely and there was not a trace of it to be found anywhere H m Just so Case gone too Sir Mawson No That was still there lying on her dressing table but it was empty I see So then it could not have been that that was wrapped up in the parcel your son was seen carrying Anybody in that room after Sir Mawson left you your ladyship Not a living soul mister Cleek Could no one have stolen it without your knowledge That would be impossible I locked the door the instant Sir Mawson left me Ah then of course Another question please Sir Mawson has spoken of there being one single minute when the necklace was not directly under your eyes When was that When I left the room mister Cleek Oho Then you did leave it eh Yes It was thoughtless of me of course but I only ran down to the foot of the staircase when I remembered and ran back in a perfect panic Still I had locked the door in going out even then and the key was in my hand It was still locked when I returned but in that one single minute the necklace had disappeared I was gratifying my woman s vanity by holding it up to my throat and viewing myself in the glass just an instant before and I remember perfectly laying it down on the velvet lining of its open case at the time I recollected the matter which caused me to leave the room May I ask what that matter was Yes A service I had promised to perform for Miss Eastman Miss Eastman Who is she My son s fiancee She and her father are visiting us at present Curzon met and became engaged to Miss Eastman on the occasion of her last visit to England and this time her father is accompanying her Her last visit Then the lady and her father are not English Oh dear no Americans They came over less than a week ago Pardon No I do not at the moment recall the name of the vessel mister Cleek but whichever one it was it seems to have been a very ill conditioned affair and gave them a very bad crossing indeed That is why I had to render Miss Eastman the service of which I spoke the sudden recollection of which caused me to lay down the necklace and hurry from the room I had forgotten all about it until I happened to see the roll of lint on my dressing table Lint Lady Leake What on earth had lint to do with the matter I had bought it for Miss Eastman when I was in town this morning She asked me to as she had used her last clean bandage yesterday She had a very bad fall on shipboard mister Cleek and injured her left hand severely Narkom made a curious sort of gulping sound whipped out his handkerchief and began to dab his bald spot and looked round at Cleek out of the tail of his eye But Cleek neither moved nor spoke nor made any sign merely pushed his lower lip out over his upper one and stood frowning at the stable door And here just here a strange and even startling thing occurred With just one hoarse Toot toot to give warning of its coming a public taxi swung round the curve of the road jerked itself up to a sudden standstill within a rope s cast of the spot where the four were standing and immediately there rang forth a rollicking happy youthful voice crying out as the owner of it stood up and touched an upright forefinger to his numbered cap in jolly mimicry of the Hanson cabman of other days Keb sir Keb mum Keb Keb and hard on the heels of that flung out a laughing Hullo mater Hullo dad you dear old Thunder Box I say How does this sort of thing get you as Katie Eastman says Buttons all over me like a blooming Bobby What And it needed no more than that to assure Cleek and mister Narkom that in the bright eyed bonny faced laughing young fellow who jumped down from the driver s seat at this and stood up straight and strong and displayed his taxicabman s livery unabashed and unashamed they were looking upon Sir Mawson Leake s eldest son and heir Henry The voice was Lady Leake s and there was pain and surprise and joy and terror all jumbled up in it curiously as she ran to him Henry Is it really you Sure thing to quote Katie again Just took a spin over to show myself off Plenty of brass trimmings What I thought dad you d like to be sure that I really am done with the clubs at last Not because they blacklisted me for they didn t but because oh well you know No taxicabmen need apply that sort of thing I ll be invited to resign from every blessed one of them to morrow and there s not a chap connected with any one of em who d be seen taking a match from me to light his cigarette with after this All the same though I go out of them with a clean slate and that s all I cared about I did get that two hundred after all pater Curzon and Katie raised it for me between them out of their own private accounts you know and as driving a car is the only thing I really do understand I m earning the money to pay them back this way That s the stuff by Jupiter That s the stuff rapped out Cleek impulsively You ought to have known from the first Sir Mawson that they don t make thieves of this sort of material Thieves What do you mean by thieves And who the dickens are you anyway I say dad who s this johnnie What s he driving at What does he mean by talking about thieves The necklace the Ranee s necklace The Ladder of Light bleated Sir Mawson feebly It is gone It is lost It went when you went There has been no trace of it since Then he joined Lady Leake and plucked at the boy s sleeve and between them out came the whole miserable story And you think that I stole it You dare to think that flung out his son jerking back from him and brushing aside Lady Leake s solicitous hand Very well then think what you jolly well please I m done with the lot of you And after that the Deluge Speaking he turned on his heel and rushed back to his taxi wrenched open its door revealing what none of them had suspected before because of the drawn curtains that the vehicle was occupied and sang out in a fine fury Pull up the blinds Curz Come out old chap Come out Major Come out Katie all of you at once There isn t going to be any jolly lark any pleasant surprise any killing of the fatted calf This isn t a comedy it s a tragedy Hop out lively the lot of you I m done with my father and I ve got to get back to my place in the ranks as fast as I can fly I ll pay you back Katie I ll pay you back Curz old chap Yes by God I will if I drive this thing night and day without sleeping Then came a sudden banging of the taxi s door a hoot from the horn as he jumped back to his seat and sounded a warning note and in the winking of an eye he was off and away and there in the road stood a stout pleasant faced old gentleman a youth with a budding moustache and a bright faced fairylike little lady of about eighteen all three of whom were standing stock still and staring after the vanishing taxi in the blankest of blank amazement Of a sudden however My goodness popper I guess Curzon and I have sort of muffed it somehow the little lady said forlornly I guess you have honey I guess you have Anyhow something s gone bust that s a sure thing Let s go and ask Sir Mawson what it s all about Yes let us by all means put in the younger man Come on mister Narkom who heard these things drew closer to Cleek looked up at him anxiously and contrived to whisper an inquiry which fell only upon his ally s ears Found out anything old chap Yes From their words it is clear that Sir Mawson has taken nobody in the house even his son Curzon into his confidence regarding the lost necklace I don t mean that I m alluding to the others Found out anything about them Yes and a very important thing too They are not Diamond Nick and Dutch Ella Not in the least like them neither are they disguised Also Miss Eastman s injury is only a sprained wrist it appears You observe she does not even attempt to cover the back of her hand I m afraid mister Narkom you ve been barking up the wrong tree CHAPTER XXII By this time the major his daughter and young Curzon Leake full of deep and earnest solicitude for the long erring Henry and fairly bristling with questions and entreaties had crossed the intervening space and were at Sir Mawson s side but as the details of what was said and done for the next ten minutes have no bearing upon the case in hand they may well be omitted from these records Suffice it then that on the plea of having some very important business with these gentlemen which will not permit of another moment s delay and promising to discuss the other matter later on Sir Mawson managed to get rid of them with the story of the lost necklace still unconfessed and was again free to return to the subject in hand Of course I can understand your reluctance with those Indian chaps about to take anybody into your confidence regarding the loss of the jewel Sir Mawson said Cleek as soon as the others were well out of hearing but sometimes a policy of silence is wise and sometimes it is a mistake For instance if any of a man s servants should know of a circumstance which might have a bearing upon a robbery they are not likely to mention it if they don t even know that a robbery has been committed However we shall know more about that after I ve been over the ground and poked about a bit So if you and her ladyship will be so kind I should like to have a look indoors particularly in Lady Leake s boudoir as soon as possible Upon what trivial circumstances do great events sometimes hinge Speaking he turned toward the curve of the road to go back to the guarded gates of the house which he had so recently passed when Lady Leake s hand plucked nervously at his sleeve Not that way Not for worlds with those Hindus on the watch she exclaimed agitatedly Heaven knows what they might suspect what word they might send to the Ranee s steward if they saw us returning to the house without having seen us leave it Come there is another and a safer way Through the grounds and round to the door of the music room at the back of the building Follow me They followed forthwith and in another moment were taking that other way with her pushing through a thick plantation crossing a kitchen garden cutting through an orchard and walking rapidly along an arboured path until they came at last to the final obstacle of all a large rock garden which barred their progress to the smooth close clipped lawn at whose far end the house itself stood This rock garden it was plain from the course she was taking it was Lady Leake s intention to skirt but Cleek noting that there was a path running through the middle of it pointed out that fact One moment he said As time is of importance would not this be the shorter and the quicker way Yes she gave back without however stopping in her progress around the tall rocks which formed its boundary But if we took it we should be sure to meet Bevis That is his especial playground you know and if he were to see his father and me we shouldn t be able to get rid of him again No Don t misunderstand mister Cleek I am not one of those mothers who find their children a nuisance in their nursery stage Bevis is the dearest little man But he is so full of pranks so full of questions so full of life and high spirits and I couldn t stand that this morning Besides he has no one to play with him to day This is Miss Miniver s half holiday Pardon Yes his nursery governess She won t be back until three I only hope he will stay in the rock garden and amuse himself with his pirates cave until then His Pirates cave Miss Miniver took him to a moving picture show one day He saw one there and nothing would do him but his father must let him have one for himself so the gardeners made one for him in the rock garden and he amuses himself by going out on what he calls treasure raids and carries his spoils in there His spoils eh H m I see Pardon me Lady Leake but do you think it is possible that this affair we are on may be only a wild goose chase after all In other words that not knowing the value of the Ranee s necklace your little son may have made that a part of his spoils and carried it off to his pirates cave No mister Cleek I do not Such a thing is utterly impossible For one thing the boudoir door was locked remember and for another Bevis had been bathed and put to bed before the necklace was lost He could not have got up and left his room as Miss Miniver sat with him until he fell asleep H m commented Cleek So that s barking up the wrong tree for a second time Still of course the necklace couldn t have vanished of its own accord Hum m m Just so Another question your ladyship You spoke of running down to the foot of the stairs with the lint for Miss Eastman and running back in a panic when you remembered the necklace How then did you get the lint to Miss Eastman after all I sent it to her with apologies for not being able to do the bandaging for her Sent it to her your ladyship By whom Jennifer one of the servants Oho said Cleek in two different tones So then you did unlock the door of your boudoir for a second time and somebody other than Sir Mawson and your stepson did see the inside of the room eh Your pardon mister Cleek but you are wrong in both surmises Jennifer was the servant who was working in the lower hall at the time the one who says he saw Henry leave the house at ten minutes past seven The instant I reached the foot of the stairs and thought of the necklace I called Jennifer to me gave him the lint with orders to take it at once to Miss Eastman s maid with the message mentioned and then turned round and ran back to my boudoir immediately H m I see I suppose your ladyship it isn t possible that this man Jennifer might in going to carry that message But no I recollect the door of your boudoir was locked So even if he had managed to outstrip you by going up another staircase Oh I see what you mean she declared as they reached the edge of the lawn and set out across it But mister Cleek such a thing would not bear even hinting at so far as Jennifer is concerned He is the soul of honesty for one thing and for another he couldn t have outstripped me as you put it had I returned at a snail s pace He is very old and near sighted There look That is he over there sweeping the leaves off the terrace You can see for yourself how impossible it would be for him to run upstairs Cleek did see Looking in the direction indicated he saw an elderly man employed as stated whose back was bowed and whose limping gait betokened an injury which had left him hopelessly lame His leg had to be amputated as the result of being run over by an omnibus in the streets of London explained her ladyship and in consequence he wears a wooden one He has been in the employ of the family for more than forty years Originally he was a gardener and after his accident Sir Mawson was for pensioning him off so that he could end his days in quiet and comfort But he quite broke down at the thought of leaving the old place and as he wouldn t listen to such a thing as being paid for doing nothing we humoured his whim and let him stay on as a sort of handy man I am sorry to say that Bevis little rogue takes advantage of his inability to run and plays no end of pranks upon him But he adores the boy and never complains Cleek who had been studying the man fixedly with his narrowed eyes and remembering what had been said of Diamond Nick s skill at impersonation the while they were crossing the lawn here twitched his head as if casting off a thought which annoyed him and turned a bland look upon Lady Leake One last question your ladyship he said I think you said that Jennifer was cleaning the hall at the time your stepson left the house and as presumably you wouldn t overwork a crippled old chap like that how happened it that he was still at his labours at ten minutes past seven o clock in the evening That s rather late to be cleaning up a hall isn t it Yes much too late she acknowledged But it couldn t be helped in the present instance The gasfitters didn t finish their work as early as we had hoped and as he couldn t begin until they had finished he was delayed in starting The gasfitters eh Oho So you had those chaps in the house yesterday did you Yes There had been an unpleasant leakage of gas in both the music room and the main hall for two or three days and as the men had to take down the fixtures to get to the seat of the trouble Jennifer improved the opportunity to give the chandelier and the brackets a thorough cleaning since he couldn t of course start to clear up the mess the workmen made until after they had finished and gone But mister Cleek They couldn t have had anything to do with the affair for they left the house at least ten minutes before the Ladder of Light came into it So naturally This is the door of the music room gentlemen Come in please The invitation was accepted at once and in another half minute Cleek and mister Narkom found themselves standing in a wonderful white and gold room under a huge crystal chandelier of silver and cut glass and looking out through an arched opening hung with sulphur coloured draperies into a sort of baronial hall equipped with armour and tapestries and broad enough to drive a coach through without danger to its contents From this hall as they discovered when Lady Leake led them without delay toward the scene of the necklace s mysterious vanishment a broad short flight of richly carpeted stairs led to a square landing and thence another and a longer flight striking off at right angles communicated with the passage upon which her ladyship s boudoir opened It was here that I stood mister Cleek when I recollected about the necklace as I called Jennifer to me she explained pausing on the landing at the foot of this latter flight of stairs just long enough to let him note over the broad rail of the banister that the great hall was clearly visible below He was there just under you drying the globes of the music room chandelier when I called to him Now come this way please and you will see how impossible it is for any one to have entered and left the boudoir during my brief absence without my seeing or hearing It was for the door of the boudoir which was entirely detached from the rest of the suite occupied by herself and her husband was immediately opposite the head of the staircase and clearly visible from the landing at its foot She unlocked this one solitary door and let them see that the only other means of possibly entering the room was by way of a large overhanging bay window overlooking the grounds But this was a good twenty feet above the surface of the earth and there was not a vine nor a tree within yards and yards of it and as the space beneath was so large and clear that no one could have manipulated a ladder without the certainty of discovery Cleek saw at a glance that the window might be dismissed at once as a possible point of entry Nor did anything else about the room offer a hint more promising All that he saw was just what one might have expected to see in such a place under such circumstances as these On the dressing table surrounded by a litter of silver and cut glass toilet articles lay the case which had once contained the famous necklace wide open and empty Over the back of a chair as if it had been thrown there under the stress of haste and great excitement hung a negligee of flowered white silk trimmed with cascades of rich lace and across a sofa at the far end of the room a dinner gown of gray satin was carefully spread out with a pair of gray silk stockings and gray satin slippers lying beside it Everything is exactly as it was mister Cleek at the time the necklace disappeared explained her ladyship noting the manner in which his glances went flickering about the room skimming the surface of all things but settling on none Everything that is but that negligee there Wasn t that in the room then Oh yes but it wasn t on the chair it was on me I had come up to dress for dinner a short time before Henry made his appearance indeed I had only just taken off my street costume and started to dress when he rapped at the door and implored me to let him come in and speak to me for a minute or two For God s sake mater was the way he put it and as haste seemed to be of vital importance I slipped on my negligee and let him in as quickly as I could Afterward when Sir Mawson came in with the wonderful necklace She stopped abruptly and her voice seemed to die away in her throat and when she spoke again it was in a sort of panic mister Cleek she cried Mr Cleek What is it What s the matter Good heavens Mawson has the man gone out of his mind In the circumstances the question was an excusable one A moment before she had seen Cleek walk in the most casual manner to the chair where the lace clouded negligee hung had seen him pick it up to look at the chair seat under it and was collectedly proceeding with the account of the events of yesterday when without hint or warning he suddenly yapped out a sound that was curiously like a dog that had mastered the trick of human laughter flung the negligee from him dropped on his knees and was now careering round the room like a terrier endeavouring to pick up a lost scent pushing aside tables throwing over chairs and yapping yapping Cleek old chap It was Narkom that spoke and the hard thick hammering of his heart made his voice shake Good lud man in the name of all that s wonderful Let me alone he bit in irritably Of all the asses Of all the blind mutton headed idiots then laughed that curious uncanny laugh again scrambled to his feet and made a headlong bolt for the door Wait for me all of you in the music room he threw back from the threshold Don t stir from it until I come I want that fellow Jennifer I want him at once And here turning sharply on his heel with yet another yapping sound he bolted across the passage ran down the staircase like an escaping thief and by the time the others could lock up the boudoir and get down to the music room there wasn t a trace of him anywhere CHAPTER XXIII It was a full half hour later and Sir Mawson and Lady Leake and mister Maverick Narkom were in the throes of the most maddening suspense when the door of the music room flashed open and flashed shut again and Cleek stood before them once more quite alone still but with that curious crooked smile which to Narkom stood for so much looping up the corner of his mouth and mutely foreshadowing the riddle s spectacular end Cleek dear chap The superintendent s voice was sharp and thin with excitement You ve found out something then I hope mister Narkom I have found out everything he replied with a marked emphasis on the word hope But as we are told when in doubt or in difficulty to look above for a way out permit me to follow that advice before proceeding any further with the subject Here he stepped to the centre of the room twitched back his head and with chin upslanted and eyes directed toward the ceiling moved slowly round in a narrow circle for a moment or two But of a sudden he came to a sharp standstill rapped out a short queer little laugh and altering these mysterious tactics looked down and across the room at Sir Mawson Leake I think the Ranee did not look to the security of those slim gold links a day too soon Sir Mawson he said It is too much to ask a man to risk his whole fortune on the tenacity of a bit of age worn wire as you have done and if I were in your shoes I d tell the old girl s major domo when he comes for the necklace to get it repaired somewhere else and be dashed to him Good Wouldn t I in a twinkling if I could only lay hands on the wretched thing again But I haven t it as you know Quite true But you are going to have it presently I know where it is mister Cleek Gently gently my friends Don t go quite off your heads with excitement I repeat I know where it is I have found it and mister Narkom Look sharp A chair for Lady Leake she s tottering Steady steady your ladyship it will only complicate matters to lose a grip on yourself now and you have kept up so brave a front all through it would be a pity to break down at the end I am not breaking down I am quite all right Please go on mister Cleek please do I can stand anything better than this Are you sure you have found it Are you sure Absolutely I have had a nice little talk with old Jennifer and a very satisfactory visit to Master Bevis Leake s interesting pirates cave and Gently gently Sir Mawson gently all of you Don t jump to conclusions too quickly No your ladyship I did not find the necklace in that cave and for the simple reason that it is not and never has been there in short neither your son Bevis nor the servant Jennifer has the least idea in the world where it is I have however and if in return for handing it over to him Sir Mawson will give me his promise to take that boy Henry back and give him another chance he shall have it in his hands ten seconds afterward I promise I promise I promise broke in Sir Mawson almost shouting in his excitement I give you my word mister Cleek I give you my solemn oath Right you are said Cleek in reply Then he twitched forward a chair stepped on the seat of it reached up into the midst of the chandelier s glittering cut glass lustres snapped something out from their sparkling festoons and added serenely Favour for favour there you are then as he dropped the Ladder of Light into Sir Mawson s hands And all in a moment what with Lady Leake laughing and crying at one and the same time her liege lord acting pretty much as if he had suddenly gone off his head and mister Maverick Narkom chiming in and asserting several times over that he d be jiggered there was the dickens and all to pay in the way of excitement Up in the chandelier exclaimed Lady Leake when matters had settled down a bit Up there where it might have remained unnoticed for months so like is it to the strings of lustres But how But when Oh mister Cleek who in the world put it there And why Jennifer he made answer No not for any evil purpose your ladyship He doesn t know even yet that it was there or that he ever in all his life held a thing so valuable in his hands All that he does know in connection with it is that while he was cleaning those lustres out there in the hallway yesterday afternoon between four and five o clock your son Bevis out on one of his treasure raids paid him a visit and that long after when the old fellow came to replace the lustres on the chandelier he discovered that one string was missing I knowed the precious little rascal had took it sir of course was the way he put it in explaining the matter to me and I felt sure I d be certain to find it in his pirates cave But Lord bless you it turned out as he hadn t took it there at all as I found out a goodish bit afterward when her ladyship comes down to the landing at the top of the first flight of stairs calls me up to give me the lint for Miss Eastman and then gives a jump and a cry like she d just recollected something and runs back upstairs as fast as she could fly For when I looks down there was the missing string of lustres lying on the landing right where her ladyship had been standing and where he little rascal had went and hid it from me So I picks it up and puts it back in its place on the chandelier just as soon as I d taken the lint to Miss Eastman like her ladyship told me In that Lady Leake lies the whole story of how it came to be where you saw me find it Jennifer is still under the impression that what he picked up on that landing was nothing more than the string of twelve cut glass lustres joined together by links of brass wire which is at this moment hanging among the treasures in your little son s pirates cave On the landing Lying on the landing do you say mister Cleek exclaimed her ladyship But heavens above how could the necklace ever have got there Nobody could by any possibility have entered the boudoir after I left it to run down to the landing with the lint You saw for yourself how utterly impossible such a thing as that would be To be sure he admitted It was the absolute certainty that nobody in the world could have actually forced the key to the solution upon me Since it was possible for only one solitary person to have entered and left that room since Sir Mawson placed the necklace in your charge clearly then that person was the one who carried it out Therefore there was but one conclusion namely that when your ladyship left that room the Ladder of Light left it with you on your person and Gently gently Lady Leake don t get excited I beg I shall be able in a moment to convince you that my reasoning upon that point was quite sound and to back it up with actual proof If you will examine the necklace Sir Mawson you will see that it has not come through this adventure uninjured in short that one of the two sections of its clasp is missing and the link that once secured that section to the string of diamonds has parted in the middle Perhaps a good deal which may have seemed to you sheer madness up to this point will be clearly explained when I tell you that when I lifted Lady Leake s negligee from that chair a while ago I found this thing clinging to the lace of the right sleeve Good heavens above Look Ada look The missing section of the clasp Exactly concurred Cleek And when you think of where I found it I fancy it will not be very difficult to reason out how the necklace came to be where Jennifer picked it up On your own evidence Lady Leake you hastily laid it down on your dressing table when the sight of the lint bandage recalled to your mind your promise to Miss Eastman and from that moment it was never seen again The natural inference then is so clear I think there can hardly be a doubt that when you reached over to pick up that bandage the lace of your sleeve caught on the clasp became entangled and that when you left the room you carried the Ladder of Light with you The great weight of the necklace swinging free as you ran down the staircase would naturally tell upon that weak link and no doubt when you leaned over the banister at the landing to call Jennifer that was so to speak the last straw The weak link snapped the necklace dropped away and the thick carpet entirely muffled the sound of its fall As for the rest The loud jangling of the door bell cut in upon his words He pulled out his watch and looked at it That will be the Ranee s major domo I fancy Sir Mawson he observed and with your kind permission mister Narkom and I will be going We have as I have already told you a little matter of importance still to attend to in the interest of the Yard and although I haven t the slightest idea we shall be able to carry it to a satisfactory conclusion for a very long time if ever we had better be about it Pardon Reward your ladyship Oh but I ve had that Sir Mawson has given me his promise to let that bonny boy have another chance That was all I asked remember There s good stuff in him but he stands at the crossroads and face to face with one of life s great crises Now is the time when he needs a friend Now is the time for his father to be a father and opportunity counts for so much in the devil s gamble for souls Get to him daddy get to him and stand by him and you ll have given me the finest reward in the world And here making his adieus to Lady Leake whose wet eyes followed him with something of reverence in them and shaking heartily the hand Sir Mawson held out he linked arms with Narkom and together they passed out leaving a great peace and a great joy behind them Gad what an amazing beggar you are declared the superintendent breaking silence suddenly as soon as they were at a safe distance from the house You ll end your days in the workhouse you know if you continue this sort of tactics Fancy chucking up a reward for the sake of a chap you never saw before and who treated you like a mere nobody Why man alive you could have had almost any reward a thousand pounds if you d asked it for finding a priceless thing like that I fancy I ve helped to find something that is more priceless still my friend and it s cheap at the price But a thousand pounds Cleek a thousand pounds God s truth man think what you could do with all that money think what you could buy To be sure but think what you can t Not one day of lost innocence not one hour of spoilt youth It isn t because they have a natural tendency toward evil that all men go wrong It is not what they possess but what they lack that s at the bottom of the downfall of four fifths of them Given such ingredients as a young chap suffering under a sense of personal injury a feeling that the world s against him that he has neither a home nor a friend to stand by him in his hour of need and the devil will whip up the mixture and manufacture a criminal in less than no time It is easier to save him while he s worth the saving than it is to pull him up after he has gone down the line mister Narkom and if by refusing to accept so many pounds shillings and pence a man can do the devil out of a favourable opportunity Oh well let it go at that Come on please We are still as far as ever from the game we set out to bag my friend and as this district seems to be as unpromising in that respect as all the others where next CHAPTER XXIV I m bothered if I know returned Narkom helplessly Gad I m at my wits end We seem to be as far as ever from any clue to that devilish pair and unless you can suggest something He finished the sentence by taking off his hat and looking up at Cleek hopefully and patting his bald spot with a handkerchief which diffused a more or less agreeable odour of the latest Parisian perfume H m said Cleek reflectively We might cross the Heath and have a look round Gospel Oak if you like It s a goodish bit of a walk and I ve no idea that it will result in anything I frankly admit but it is one of the few places we have not tried so we might have a go at that if you approve By James yes The very thing There s always a chance you know so long as it s a district we ve never done Gospel Oak it is then And look here I ll tell you what You just stop here a bit and wait for me old chap while I nip back to the house and ask Sir Mawson s permission to use his telephone to ring up the Yard as usual you know and tell them in what quarter we re operating in case there should be reason to send anybody out to find me in a hurry Back with you in no time and then we ll be off to Gospel Oak like a shot Right you are I ll stop here under the trees and indulge in a few comforting whiffs while you are about it Get along Narkom paused a moment to grip his cuff between finger tips and palm and run his coat sleeve round the shiny surface of his topper then shook out his handkerchief and returned it to his pocket jerked down his waistcoat and gave it one or two sharp flicks with the backs of his nails and before a second diffusion of scent had evaporated or the whimsical twist it called to Cleek s lips had entirely vanished the scene presented nothing more striking than an ordinary man leaning back against a tree and engaged in scratching a match on the side of an ordinary wooden matchbox The Yard s Gentleman had gone It was full ten minutes later when he lurched into view again coming down the garden path at top speed with one hand on his hat s crown and the other holding the flapping skirts of his frock coat together and Cleek could tell from the expression of his round pink face that something of importance had occurred It had and he blurted it out in an outburst of joyous excitement the moment they again stood together The search for Dutch Ella and Diamond Nick was at an end The police of Paris had cabled news of their location and arrest that very morning in the French capital and would hold them under lock and key until the necessary preliminaries were over relative to their deportation as undesirables and their return to Canada The news arrived less than an hour ago he finished and that wideawake young beggar Lennard thought it was so important that I ought to know it as soon as possible so he hopped on to the limousine and put off as fast as he could streak it He s up here in this district now this minute hunting for us Come on let s go and find him By James it s a ripping end to the business what That depends replied Cleek without much enthusiasm Which limousine is Lennard using to day The new blue one Cinnamon no That won t be delivered until the day after to morrow So it will be the good old red one of course Will it matter Come and see said Cleek swinging out of the grounds into the public highway again and walking fast At all events an ounce of certainty is worth a pound of suspicion and this little faux pas will decide the question They are no fools those Apaches and Waldemar knows how to wait patiently for what he wants Waldemar The Apaches Good lud man what are you talking about You are not worrying over that business again I hope Haven t I told you over and over again that we couldn t find one trace of them anywhere in London that they cleared out bag and baggage after that fruitless trip to Yorkshire The whole truth of the matter to my way of thinking is that they awoke then to the fact that you had dropped to their being after you and knowing you weren t to be caught napping gave it up as a bad job Or altered their tactics and set out to follow some one else Some one else Good lud don t talk rubbish What good would following some one else do if they were after you Come and see said Cleek again and would say no more but merely walked on faster than ever up one thoroughfare and down another flicking eager glances to right and to left in search of the red limousine In the thick of the High Street they caught sight of it at last tooling about aimlessly while Lennard kept constant watch on the crowd of shoppers that moved up and down the pavement Cut ahead and stop it and we shall see what we shall see mister Narkom I ll join you presently said Cleek and he stood watching while the superintendent forged ahead in the direction of the limousine and continued watching even after he saw him reach it and bring it to a halt and stand at the kerb talking earnestly with Lennard But of a sudden the old crooked smile looped up the corner of his mouth he stood at attention for a moment or two breathing hard through his nostrils and moving not at all until abruptly starting into activity he walked rapidly down the pavement and joined Narkom Well queried the superintendent looking up at him quizzically Come to any decision old chap Yes and so will you in a second Don t turn don t do anything hastily Just look across the street at the jeweller s window opposite and tell me what you think of it Narkom s swift sidelong glance travelled over the distance like a gunshot arrowed through the small collection of persons gathered about the shop window inspecting the display of trinkets and every nerve in his body jumped Good God Waldemar he said under his breath Exactly I told you he knew how to wait Now look farther along the kerb on this side The closed carriage waiting there It was dawdling along and keeping pace with him when I saw it first The man on the box is a fellow named Serpice an Apache Chut Be still will you and look the other way They will do me no harm here It isn t their game and besides they daren t It is too public too dangerous It will be done when it is done in the dark when I m alone and none can see And Waldemar will not be there He will direct but not participate But it won t be to day nor yet to night I promise you I shall slip them this time if never again The superintendent spoke but the hard hammering of his heart made his voice scarcely audible How he asked How Come and see said Cleek for yet a third time Then with an abruptness and a swiftness that carried everything before it he caught Narkom by the arm swept him across the street and without hint or warning tapped Waldemar upon the shoulder Ah bon jour Monsieur le Comte he said airily as the Mauravanian swung round and looked at him blanching a trifle in spite of himself So you are back in England it seems Ah well we like you so much tell his Majesty when next you report that this time we shall try to keep you here Taken thus by assault the man had no words in which to answer but merely wormed his way out of the gathering about him and panic stricken obliterated himself in the crowd of pedestrians teeming up and down the street You reckless devil wheezed Narkom as he was swept back to the limousine in the same cyclonic manner he had been swept away from it You might have made the man savage enough to do something to you even in spite of the publicity by such a proceeding as that That is precisely what I had hoped to do my friend but you perceive he is no fool to be trapped into that We should have had some excuse for arresting him if he had done a thing of that sort some charge to prefer against him whereas as matters stand there s not one we can bring forward that holds good in law or that we could prove if our lives depended upon it You see now I hope mister Narkom why you have seen nothing of him lately No why You have not used the red limousine and he has been lying low ready to follow that just as I suspected he would If he couldn t trace where Cleek goes to meet the red limousine clearly then the plan to be adopted must be to follow the red limousine and see where it goes to meet Cleek and then to follow that much wanted individual when he parts from you and makes his way home That is the thing the fellow is after To find out where I live and to get me some night out there But my friend turn about is fair play the world over and having had his inning at hunting me I m going in for mine at hunting him I ll get him I ll trap him into something for which he can be turned over to the law make no mistake about that My hat What do you mean to do First and foremost make my getaway out of the present little corner he replied and then rely upon your assistance in finding out where the beggar is located We re not done with him even for to day He will follow either he or Serpice perhaps both the instant Lennard starts off with us You are going back with us in the limousine then Yes part of the way Drive on Lennard until you can spot a plain clothes man then give him the signal to follow us At the first station on the Tube or the Underground pull up sharp and let me out You mister Narkom alight with me and stand guard at the station entrance while I go down to the train If either Waldemar or an Apache makes an attempt to follow arrest him on the spot on any charge you care to trump up it doesn t matter so that it holds him until my train goes and as soon as it has gone call up your plain clothes man point out Serpice to him and tell him to follow and to stick to the fellow until he meets Waldemar if it takes a week to accomplish it and then to shadow his precious countship and find out where he lives Tell him for me that there s a ten pound note in it for him the moment he can tell me where Waldemar is located and to stick to his man until he runs him down Now then hop in mister Narkom and let s be off The other chap will follow be assured All right Lennard Let her go Lennard let her go forthwith and a quarter of an hour later saw the programme carried out in every particular only that it was not Waldemar who made an attempt to follow when the limousine halted at the Tube station and Cleek jumped out and ran in the count was far too shrewd for that it was a rough looking Frenchman who had just previously hopped out of a closed carriage driven by a fellow countryman only to be nabbed at the station doorway by Narkom and turned over to the nearest constable on the charge of pocket picking The charge however was so manifestly groundless that half a dozen persons stepped forward and entered protest but the superintendent was so pig headed that by the time he could be brought to reason and the man was again at liberty to take his ticket and go down in the lift to the train the platform was empty the train gone and Cleek already on his way A swift short flight under the earth s surface carried him to another station in quite another part of London a swift short walk thence landed him at his temporary lodgings in town and four o clock found him exchanging his workaday clothes for the regulation creased trousers and creaseless coat of masculine calling costume and getting ready to spend the rest of the day with her CHAPTER XXV The sky was all aflame with the glory of one of late June s gorgeous sunsets when he came up over the long sweep of meadowland and saw her straying about and gathering wild flowers to fill the vases in the wee house s wee little drawing room and singing to herself the while in a voice that was like honey thin but very very sweet and at the sight something seemed to lay hold of his heart and quicken its beating until it interfered with his breathing yet brought with it a curious sense of joy Good afternoon Mistress of the Linnets he called out to her as he advanced for she had neither seen nor heard his coming with the big sheaf of roses he had brought held behind him and the bracken and kingcups smothering him in green and gold up to the very thighs She turned at the sound her face illumined her soft eyes very bright those wondrous eyes that had lit a man s way back from perdition and would light it onward and upward to the end and greeted him with a smile of happy welcome Oh it is you at last she said looking at him as a woman looks at but one man ever Is this your idea of spending the afternoon with one turning up when tea is over and twilight about to begin Do you know I am a very busy young woman these days blushing rosily and might have spent a whole day in town shopping but that Dollops brought me word that I might look for you But of course No I shan t say it It might make you vain to hear that you had the power to spoil my day Not any vainer than you have made me by telling me other things he retorted with a laugh I am afraid I have spoiled a good many days for you in my time Ailsa But please God I shall make up for them all in the brightness of the ones that are to come I couldn t help being late to day I ll tell you all about that presently but may I offer something in atonement Please will you add these to your bouquet and forgive me Roses Such beauties How good of you Just smell How divine Meaning the flowers or their donor quizzically Or no Don t elucidate Leave me in blissful ignorance You have hurt my vanity quite enough as it is I was deeply mortified cut to the quick I may say if that will express my sense of grovelling shame any clearer when I arrived here and saw what you were doing Please mum touching his forelock and scraping his foot backward after the manner of a groom did I make such a bad job of my work in that garden that when you want a bouquet you have to come out here and gather wild flowers I put fifty eight standard roses on that terrace just under your bedroom window and surely there must be a bloom or two that you could gather As if I would cut one of them for anything in the world she gave back indignantly Then she laughed and blushed and stepped back from his impetuous advance No please You fished for that so adroitly that you landed it before I thought Be satisfied Besides missus Condiment is at her window and I want to preserve as much as possible of her rapidly depreciating estimate of me She thinks me a very frivolous young person to allow that young mister Hamilton to call so frequent miss and if you ll allow me to say it at such unseemly hours I don t think as dear Captain Burbage would quite approve of it if he knew Gad that s rich What a mimic you are It was the dear old girl to the life She hasn t an inkling of the truth then Not one She doesn t quite approve of you either I likes to see a gent more circumpec miss and a trifle more reserved when he s gettin on his thirties Muckin about with a garden fork and such among a trumpery lot of roses and racin here there and everywhere over them medders after ferns and things like a schoolboy on a holiday aren t what I calls dignified deportment in full grown men and in my day they didn t use to do it Sometimes I am in mortal terror that she intends to give me notice and to leave me bag and baggage for she is always saying that she s sure dear Captain Burbage couldn t have known what he was a doing of poor innocent kind hearted gentleman and him so much of a gent too and so wonderful quiet and sedate Poor old girl said Cleek laughing What a shock to her if she knew the truth And what on earth would you do if she were to chance to get a peep at Dollops But then of course there s no fear of that the young beggar s too careful I told him never to come near the house when he carries any notes And he never does Always leaves them under the stone in the path through the woods I go there of course twice every day and I never know that he has been about until I find one I am always glad to get them but to day s one made me very very happy indeed Because I told you you might expect me Yes But not that alone I think I cried a little and I know I went down on my knees right there out in those woods when I read those splendid words There is but one more debt to be paid The some day of my hopes is near to me at last Her voice died off He uncovered his head and a stillness came that was not broken by any sound or any movement until he felt her hand slip into his and remain there Walk with me he said closing his fingers around hers and holding them fast Walk with me always My God I love you so Always she made answer in her gentle voice and with her hand shut tight in his passed onward with him over the green meadows and into the dim still woods and out again into the flower filled fields beyond where all the sky was golden after the fierce hues of the sunset had drained away into the tender gleam of twilight and there was not one red ray left to cross the path of him You have led me this way from the first he said breaking silence suddenly Out of the glare of fire through the dark into peaceful light I had gone down to hell but for you but that you stooped and lifted me God he threw back his head and looked upward with his hat in his hand and the light on his face God forget me if ever I forget that Amen he added very quietly very earnestly then dropped his chin until it rested on his breast and was very still for a long time Yes he said taking up the thread of conversation where it had been broken so long a time ago there is but one more debt to be cleared off the value of the Princess Goroski s tiara A thousand pounds will wipe that off it was not a very expensive one and I could have had that sum to day if I had thought of myself alone mister Narkom thinks me a fool I wonder what you will think when you hear And forthwith he told her If you are again fishing she replied with a quizzical smile then again you are going to be successful I think you a hero Kiss me please I am very very proud of you And that was what made you late in coming was it Not altogether that I might have been earlier but that we ran foul of Waldemar and the Apaches again and I had to lose time in shaking them off But I ought not to have told you that You will be getting nervous It was a shock to mister Narkom He was so sure they had given up the job and returned home I too was sure I should have thought that the rebellion would have compelled that in Count Waldemar s case at least she answered gravely And particularly in such a grave crisis as his country is now called upon to face Have you seen to day s papers They are full of it Count Irma and the revolutionists have piled victory on victory They are now at the very gates of the capital the royal army is disorganized its forces going over in hordes to the insurgents the king is in a very panic and preparing it is reported to fly before the city falls A judgment Alburtus a judgment Cleek cried with such vehemence that it startled her Your son drinks of the cup you prepared for Karma s The same cup the same result dethronement flight exile in the world s wildernesses and perhaps death Well done Irma A judgment on you Mauravania You pay You pay How wonderful you are you seem to know everything declared Ailsa But in this at least you appear to be misinformed dear I have been reading the reports faithfully and it seems that death was not the end of all who shared in Queen Karma s exile and flight Count Irma is telling a tale which is calling recruits to the standard of the revolutionists hourly The eldest son the Crown Prince Maximilian is still alive The count swears to that swears that he has seen him that he knows where to find him at any moment The special correspondent of the Times writes that everywhere the demand is for the Restoration the battle cry of the insurgents Maximilian and the whole country ringing with it I can quite believe it he said with one of his queer crooked smiles They are an excitable people the Mauravanians but unfortunately a fickle one as well It is up to day and down to morrow with them At present the cry is for Maximillian this time next month it may be for Irma and a republican form of government and Maximillian may go hang for all they want of him Still if they maintain the present cry and the House of Alburtus falls and the followers of Irma win But what s the use of bothering about it Let us talk of things that have a personal interest for us dear Give me to morrow if you can I shall have a whole day s freedom for the first time in weeks The water lilies are in bloom in the upper reaches of the Thames and my soul is simply crying for the river s solitudes the lilies the silence and you I want you all to myself up there among God s things Give me the day if you can She gave him not one but many as it turned out for that one day proved such a magic thing that she was only too willing to repeat it and as the Yard had no especial need of him and the plain clothes man who had been set upon Waldemar s track had as yet nothing to report it grew to be a regular habit with him to spend the long days up in the river solitudes with Ailsa picnicking among the swans and to come home to Dollops at night tired but very happy It went on like this for more than ten days uninterruptedly but at length there came a time when an entry in his notebook warned him that there was something he could not put off any longer something that must certainly be attended to to morrow in town early and he went to bed that night with the melancholy feeling that the next day could only be a half holiday not a whole one and that his hours with her would be few But when that to morrow came he knew that even these were to be denied him for the long deferred call of the Yard had come and Narkom ringing him up at breakfast time asked for an immediate meeting In town dear chap as near to Liverpool Street and as early as you can possibly make it Well I can t make it earlier than half past ten I ve got a little private business of my own to attend to as it happens mister Narkom he replied I d put it off if I could but I can t To day before noon is the last possible hour But look here I can meet you at half past ten in Bishopsgate Street between saint Ethelburga s Church and Bevis Narks if that will do Will eh All right Be on the lookout for me there then What The new blue limousine eh Right you are I m your man to the tick of the half hour Good bye And he was as it turned out For the new blue limousine a glistening spic span sixty horsepower machine perfect in every detail had no more than come to a standstill at the kerb in the exact neighbourhood stated at the exact half hour agreed upon when open whisked the door and in jumped Cleek with the swiftness and agility of a cat CHAPTER XXVI Good morning my friend I hope I haven t taken you too much by surprise he said as the limousine sprang into activity the instant he closed the door and settled himself down beside the superintendent Not more than usual dear chap But I shall never get quite used to some of your little tricks Gad You re the most abnormally prompt beggar that ever existed I do believe You absolutely break all records Well I certainly came within a hair s breadth of losing my reputation this morning then he answered cheerily as he fumbled in his pockets for a match It was a hard pull to cover the distance and get through the business in time I can tell you with the brief margin I had But fortunately Here Take charge of that will you And read it over while I m getting a light That was a long legal looking envelope which he had whisked out of his pocket and tossed into Narkom s lap Royal British Life Assurance Society repeated he reading off the single line printed on the upper left hand corner of the envelope What the dickens I say is it a policy Aha assented Cleek with his mouth full of smoke The medico who put me through my paces some time ago reported me sound in wind and limb and warranted not to bite shy or kick over the traces and I was duly ordered to turn up at the London office before noon on a given day to sign up and pay down and receive that interesting document otherwise my application would be void et cetera This as it happens is the given day in question and as the office doesn t open for business before ten A M and there wasn t the least likelihood of my being able to get back to it before noon when you were calling for me there you have the whole thing in a nutshell as the old woman said when she poisoned the filberts Meanwhile Narkom had opened the envelope and glanced over the document it contained He now sat up with a jerk and voiced a cry of amazement Good Lord deliver us he exclaimed In favour of Dollops Yes said Cleek He s a faithful little monkey and I ve nothing else to leave him There s always a chance you know with Margot s lot and Waldemar s I shouldn t like to think of the boy being forced back into the streets if anything should happen to me Well I ll be What a man What a man Cleek my dear dear friend my comrade my pal Chuck it Scotland Yard with the snuffles is enough to make the gods shriek you dear old footler Why God bless your old soul I Brakes on Let s talk about the new limousine She s a beauty isn t she Locker mirror just like the old red one and Hello I say you are taking me into the country I perceive we ve left the town behind us Yes we re bound for Darsham Darsham That s in Suffolk isn t it And about ninety five miles from Liverpool Street Station as the crow flies So our little business to day is to be an out of town affair eh Well let s have it What s the case Burglary No murder Happened last night Got the news over the telephone this morning Nearly bowled me over when I heard it by James for I saw the man alive in town only the day before yesterday It s a murder of a peculiarly cunning and cleverly contrived character Cleek with no apparent motive and absolutely no clue as to what means the assassin used to kill his victim nor how he managed to get in and out of the place in which the crime was committed There isn t the slightest mark on the body The man was not shot not stabbed not poisoned nor did he die from natural causes There is no trace of a struggle yet the victim s face shows that he died in great agony and was beyond all question the object of a murderous attack Hum m said Cleek stroking his chin Sounds interesting at all events Let s have the facts of the case please But first who was the victim Anybody of importance Of very great importance in the financial world replied Narkom He is or rather was an American multi millionaire inventor to speak by the card of numerous electrical devices which brought him wealth beyond the dreams of avarice and carried his fame all over the civilized world You will no doubt have heard of him His name is Jefferson P Drake Oho said Cleek arching his eyebrows That man eh Oh yes I ve heard of him often enough very nearly everybody in England has by this time Chap who conceived the idea of bettering the conditions of the poor by erecting art galleries that were to be filled and supported out of the rates and more or less modestly to be known by the donor s name That s the man isn t it Yes that s the man Just so Stop a bit Let s brush up my memory a trifle Of English extraction wasn t he And having made his money in his own native country came to that of his father to spend it Had social aspirations too I believe and while rather vulgar in his habits and tastes was exceedingly warm hearted indeed actually lovable and made up for his own lack of education by spending barrels of money upon that of his son Came to England something more than a year ago if I remember rightly bought a fine old place down in Suffolk and proceeded forthwith to modernize it after the most approved American ideas steam heat electric lights a refrigerating plant for the purpose of supplying the ice and the creams and the frozen sweets so necessary to the American palate all that sort of thing and set out forthwith to establish himself as a sumptuous entertainer on the very largest possible scale That s the lay of the land isn t it Yes that s it precisely The estate he purchased was Heatherington Hall formerly Lord Fallowfield s place The entail was broken ages ago but no Fallowfield ever attempted to part with the place until his present lordship s time And although he has but one child a daughter I don t suppose that he would have been tempted to do so either but that he was badly crippled almost ruined in fact last year by unlucky speculations in the stock market with the result that it was either sell out to Jefferson P Drake or be sold out by his creditors Naturally he chose the former course That it turned out to be a most excellent thing for him you will understand when I tell you that Drake conceived an almost violent liking for him and his daughter Lady Marjorie Wynde and not only insisted upon their remaining at Heatherington Hall as his guests in perpetuity but designed eventually to bring the property back into the possession of the original line by a marriage between Lady Marjorie and his son Effective if not very original commented Cleek with one of his curious one sided smiles And how did the parties most concerned view this promising little plan Were they agreeable to the arrangement Not they As a matter of fact both have what you may call a heart interest elsewhere Lady Marjorie who although she is somewhat of a Yes papa and Please papa young lady and could no doubt be induced to sacrifice herself for the family good is it appears engaged to a young lieutenant who will one day come in for money but hasn t more than enough to pay his mess bills at present I believe As for young Jim Drake why matters were even worse with him It turns out that he d found the girl he wanted before he left the States and it took him just about twenty seconds to make his father understand that he d be shot hanged drawn quartered or even reduced to mincemeat before he d give up that girl or marry any other at any time or at any cost from now to the Judgment Day Bravo said Cleek slapping his palms together That s the spirit That s the boy for my money mister Narkom Get a good woman and stick to her through thick and thin at all hazards and at any cost The jockey who swaps horses in the middle of a race never yet came first under the wire nor won a thing worth having Well what was the result of this plain speaking on the young man s part Pleasant or unpleasant Oh decidedly unpleasant The father flew into a rage swore by all that was holy and by a great deal that wasn t that he d cut him off without one red cent whatever that may mean if he ever married that particular girl and as that particular girl who is as poor as Job s turkey by the way happened by sheer perversity of fortune to have landed in England that very day in company with an eminent literary person whose secretary she had been for some two or three years past away marched the son took out a special license and married her on the spot Well done independence I like that boy more than ever mister Narkom What followed Did the father relent or did he invite the pair of them to clear out and hoe their own row in future He did neither he simply ignored their existence Young Drake brought his wife down to Suffolk and took rooms at a village inn and then set out to interview his father When he arrived at the Hall he was told by the lodgekeeper that strangers weren t admitted and on his asking to have his name sent in was informed that the lodgekeeper had never heard of no sich person as mister James Drake that there wasn t none and that the master said there never had been neither and promptly double locked the gates What young James Drake did after that it appears that nobody knows for nobody saw him again until this morning and it was only yesterday I must tell you that he made that unsuccessful attempt to get into the place to see his father He says however that he spent the time in going over to Ipswich and back in the hope of seeing a friend there to whom he might apply for work He says too that when he got there he found that that friend an American acquaintance had given up his rooms the day before and rushed off to Italy in answer to a cable from his sister or so at least the landlady told him Which of course the landlady can be relied upon to corroborate if there is any question regarding the matter Is there Well he seems to think that there may be He s the client you must know It was he that gave me the details over the telephone and asked me to put you on the case As he says himself it s easy enough to prove about his having gone to Ipswich to see his friend but it isn t so easy to prove about his coming back in the manner he did It seems he was too late for any return train that he hadn t money enough left in the world to waste any by taking a private conveyance so he walked back and that as it s a goodish stretch of country and he didn t know the way and couldn t at night find anybody to ask he lost himself more than once with the consequence that it was daylight when he got back to the inn where his frightened wife sat awaiting him never having gone to bed nor closed an eye all night poor girl fearing that some accident had befallen him But be that as it may Cleek during those hours he was absent his father was mysteriously murdered in a round box of a room in which he had locked himself and to which owing to structural arrangements it would seem impossible for anything to have entered and as young Drake rightly says the worst of it is that the murder followed so close upon the heels of his quarrel and promised disinheritance that his father had no time to alter the will which left him sole heir to everything so that possibly people will talk Undoubtedly agreed Cleek And yet you said there was no motive and absolutely no clue M yes I wonder if I shall like this independent young gentleman quite so well after I have seen him Oh my dear fellow Good heavens man you can t possibly think of suspecting him Remember it is he himself who brings the case that the Yard would never have had anything to do with it but for him Quite so But the local constabulary would and the simplest way to blind a jackass is to throw dust in his eyes They are natural born actors the Americans they are good schemers and fine planners Their native game is bluff and they are very very careful in the matter of detail Then he pinched up his chin and sat silent for a moment watching the green fields and the pleasant farmlands as the limousine went pelting steadily on CHAPTER XXVII Suppose now that you have succeeded in putting the cart before the horse mister Narkom Cleek said suddenly 
2607-87140-0000	train-other-500	you proceed to give me not the ramifications of the case but the case itself You have repeatedly spoken of the murder having taken place in some place which is difficult of access and under most mystifying circumstances
2607-87140-0001	train-other-500	Now if you don t mind I should like to hear what those circumstances are All right old chap I ll give you the details as briefly as possible
2607-87140-0002	train-other-500	In the first place you must know that Heatherington Hall is a very ancient place dating back indeed to those pleasant times when a nobleman s home had to be something of a fortress as well
2607-87140-0003	train-other-500	if he didn t want to wake up some fine morning and find his place sacked his roof burnt over his head and himself and his lady either held for ransom or freed from any possibility of having headaches thereafter
none	none	 Now a round tower with only one door by which to enter and no windows other than narrow slits through which the bowmen could discharge their shafts at an attacking party without exposing themselves to the dangers of a return fire 
2607-87140-0004	train-other-500	was the usual means of defence adopted you ll see dozens of them in Suffolk dear chap but whether for reasons of economy or merely to carry out some theory of his own
2607-87140-0005	train-other-500	the first lord of Heatherington Hall did not stick to the general plan In brief instead of building a tall tower rising from the ground itself
2607-87140-0006	train-other-500	he chose to erect upon the roof of the west wing of the building a lower but more commodious one than was customary
none	none	 That is to say that while his tower was less than half the height of any other in the country 
2607-87140-0007	train-other-500	its circumference was twice as great and by reason of the double supply of bowman s slits equally as effective in withstanding a siege
2607-87140-0008	train-other-500	and indeed doubly difficult to assault as before an invading force could get to the door of the place it would have to fight its way up through the main building to reach the level of it
2607-87140-0009	train-other-500	Now owing to the peculiarity of its construction it is not more than eighteen feet high the fact that it contained but one circular room and all those bowman slits in the walls of it
2607-87140-0010	train-other-500	this unusual tower gained an equally unusual name for itself and became known everywhere as the Stone Drum of Heatherington
2607-87140-0011	train-other-500	and is even mentioned by that name in the Inquisitio Eliensis of the Domesday Book
none	none	 which as you doubtless know is the particular volume of that remarkable work which records the survey et cetera of the counties of Cambridge Hertford Essex Norfolk Suffolk and Huntingdon 
2607-87140-0012	train-other-500	I see said Cleek with an amused twinkle in his eye You are getting on mister Narkom We shall have you lecturing on archaeology one of these fine days
2607-87140-0013	train-other-500	But to return to our mutton or rather our stone drum was it in that place then that the murder was committed Yes
2607-87140-0014	train-other-500	It is one of the few very few parts of the building to which mister Jefferson P Drake did nothing in the way of modernizing and added nothing in the way of improvements
2607-87140-0015	train-other-500	That probably was because as it stood it offered him a quiet secluded and exclusive retreat for the carrying on of his experiments for wealth had brought with it no inclination to retire
2607-87140-0016	train-other-500	and he remained to the last in the lists of the world s active forces
none	none	 As a general thing he did not do much in the way of burning the midnight oil 
2607-87140-0017	train-other-500	but conducted most of his experiments in the daytime But last night was an exception
2607-87140-0018	train-other-500	It may be that the news of his son s appeal to the lodgekeeper that afternoon had upset him for he was restless and preoccupied all the evening Lord Fallowfield says
none	none	 or at least so young Drake reports him as having said and instead of retiring with the rest of the house party when bedtime came and his Japanese valet carried up his customary carafe of ice water Oh he has a Japanese valet has he But of course 
2607-87140-0019	train-other-500	in these days no American gentleman with any pretence to distinction whatsoever would be without one Go on please His Japanese valet carried up the ice water and then what
2607-87140-0020	train-other-500	Then he suddenly announced his intention of going into the Stone Drum and working for a few hours Lord Fallowfield it appears tried his best to dissuade him but to no purpose
2607-87140-0021	train-other-500	Why did he do that Or don t you know Yes I asked that very question myself I was told that it was because his lordship saw very plainly that he was labouring under strong mental excitement
2607-87140-0022	train-other-500	and he thought that rest would be the best thing for him in the circumstances Then too his lordship and he are warmly attached to each other In fact the earl was as fond of him as if he had been a brother
2607-87140-0023	train-other-500	As well he ought to be by James when you recollect that before he got the idea into his head of marrying his son to Lady Marjorie he added a codicil to his will bequeathing the place to Lord Fallowfield
2607-87140-0024	train-other-500	together with all the acres and acres of land he had added to it and all the art treasures he had collected absolutely free from death duties Oho said Cleek then smiled and pinched his chin and said no more
none	none	 Well it appears that when his lordship found that he couldn t make the stubborn old johnnie change his mind he accompanied him to the Stone Drum together with the valet to see that everything was as it should be 
2607-87140-0025	train-other-500	and that nothing was wanting that might tend to the comfort and convenience of a night worker When there was nothing more that could be done the valet was dismissed his lordship said good night to his friend and left him there alone
2607-87140-0026	train-other-500	hearing as he passed along the railed walk over the roof of the wing to the building proper a matter of some twenty odd feet the sound of the bolt being shot the bar put on and the key being turned as mister Drake locked himself in
none	none	 What happened from that moment Cleek nobody knows 
2607-87140-0027	train-other-500	At seven o clock this morning the valet going to his master s room with his shaving water found that he had never gone to bed at all
2607-87140-0028	train-other-500	and on hastening to the Stone Drum found that a light was still burning within and faintly illuminating the bowman s slits but although he knocked on the door and called again and again to his master he could get no answer
2607-87140-0029	train-other-500	Alarmed he aroused the entire household but despite the fact that a dozen persons endeavoured to get word from the man within not so much as a whisper rewarded them
2607-87140-0030	train-other-500	The bolt was still shot the bar still on the key still turned on the inner side of the door so they could force no entry to the place
2607-87140-0031	train-other-500	and it was never until the village blacksmith had been called in and his sledge had battered down the age weakened masonry in which that door was set
2607-87140-0032	train-other-500	that any man knew for certain what that burning light and that unbroken silence portended
2607-87140-0033	train-other-500	When however they finally got into the place there lay the once famous inventor at full length on the oaken floor close to the barred door as dead as George Washington
2607-87140-0034	train-other-500	and with never a sign of what killed him either on the body or in any part of the place Yet the first look at his distorted features was sufficient to prove that he had died in agony
2607-87140-0035	train-other-500	and the position of the corpse showed clearly that when the end came he was endeavouring to get to the door Heart failure possibly said Cleek Not a hope of it replied Narkom
2607-87140-0036	train-other-500	A doctor was sent for immediately fortunately one of the most famous surgeons in England happened to be in the neighbourhood at the time
none	none	 called down from town to perform an operation 
2607-87140-0037	train-other-500	He is willing so young mister Drake tells me to stake his professional reputation that the man s heart was as sound as a guinea that he had not imbibed one drop of anything poisonous
2607-87140-0038	train-other-500	that he had not been asphyxiated as of course he couldn t have been for the bowman s slits in the wall gave free ventilation to the place if nothing more
2607-87140-0039	train-other-500	that he had not been shot stabbed or bludgeoned but nevertheless he had died by violence and that violence was not and could not be attributed to suicide for there was everything to prove to the contrary
2607-87140-0040	train-other-500	In short that whatever had attacked him had done so unexpectedly and while he was busy at his work table for there was the chair lying on its back before it just as it had fallen over when he jumped up from his seat
2607-87140-0041	train-other-500	and there on the working plan he was drawing up was the pen lying on a blob of India ink just as it had dropped from his hand when he was stricken
2607-87140-0042	train-other-500	Some murderous force had entered that room and passed out of it again leaving the door barred bolted and locked upon the inside
2607-87140-0043	train-other-500	Some weapon had been used and yet no weapon was there and no trace upon the body to indicate what its character might be
2607-87140-0044	train-other-500	Indeed everything in the room was precisely as it had been when Lord Fallowfield walked out last night and left him
2607-87140-0045	train-other-500	beyond the fact of the overturned chair and a little puddle of clear water lying about a yard or so from the work table and owing to the waxing and polishing not yet absorbed by the wood of the floor
none	none	 As no one could account for the presence of that and as it was the only thing there which might offer a possible clue to the mystery 
2607-87140-0046	train-other-500	the doctor took a small sample of that water and analyzed it It was simply plain everyday common or garden pure water and nothing more
2607-87140-0047	train-other-500	without the slightest trace of any foreign matter or of any poisonous substance in it whatsoever There old chap that s the case that s the little riddle you re asked to come down and solve
none	none	 What do you make of it eh Tell you better when I ve seen mister James Drake and Lord Fallowfield 
2607-87140-0048	train-other-500	and the doctor
none	none	 said Cleek and would say no more than that for the present CHAPTER XXVIII It was somewhere in the neighbourhood of half past three when the opportunity to interview those three persons was finally vouchsafed him and it may be recorded at once that the meeting did some violence to his emotions In short he found mister James Drake far from being the frank faced impulsive lovable young pepper pot which his actions and words would seem to stand sponsor for a rather retiring young man of the pale and studious order absolutely lacking in personal magnetism and about the last person in the world one would expect to do the all for love business of the average hero in the manner he had done On the other hand he found the Earl of Fallowfield an exceedingly frank pleasant mannered rather boyish looking gentleman whose many attractions rendered it easy to understand why the late mister Jefferson P Drake had conceived such a warm affection for him and was at such pains to have him ever by his side It seemed indeed difficult to believe that he could possibly be the father of Lady Marjorie Wynde for his manner and appearance were so youthful as to make him appear to be nothing closer than an elder brother The doctor that eminent Harley Street light mister John Strangeways Hague he found to be full of Harley Street manners and Harley Street ideas eminently polite eminently cold and about as pleased to meet a detective police officer as he would be to find an organ grinder sitting on his doorstep Have you come to any conclusions as to the means of death Doctor asked Cleek after he had been shown into the Stone Drum where the body of the dead man still lay and where the local coroner and the local J P were conducting a sort of preliminary examination prior to the regulation inquest which must of course follow The general appearance would suggest asphyxia if asphyxia were possible Which it is not volunteered Doctor Hague with the geniality of a snowball You have probably observed that the many slits in the wall permit of free ventilation and asphyxia with free ventilation is an impossibility Quite so agreed Cleek placidly But if by any chance those slits could have been closed from the outside I observe that at some period and for some purpose mister Drake has made use of a charcoal furnace indicating it by a wave of the hand and apparently with no other vent to carry off the fumes than that supplied by the slits Now if they were closed and the charcoal left burning the result would be an atmosphere charged with carbon monoxide gas and a little more than one per cent of that in the air of a room deprived of ventilation would in a short time prove fatal to any person breathing that air The doctor twitched round an inquiring eye and looked him over from head to foot Yes he said remembering that after all there were Board Schools and even the humblest might sometimes learn parrot like to repeat the things that are in books But we happen to know that the slits were not closed and that neither carbon oxide nor carbon monoxide was the cause of death You have taken samples of the blood of course to establish that fact beyond question as one could so readily do ventured Cleek suavely The test for carbon monoxide is so simple and so very certain that error is impossible It combines so tensely if one may put it that way with the blood that the colouring of the red corpuscles is utterly overcome and destroyed My good sir those are elementary facts of which I do not stand in need of a reminder Quite so quite so But in my profession Doctor one stands in constant need of reminders A speck a spot a pin prick each and all are significant and But is this not a slight abrasion on the temple here bending over and with his glass examining a minute reddish speck upon the dead man s face Hum m m I see I see Have you investigated this thing Doctor It is interesting I fail to see the point of interest then replied Doctor Hague bending over and examining the spot The skin is scarcely more than abraded evidently by the finger nail scratching off the head of some infinitesimal pustule Possibly agreed Cleek but on the other hand it may be something of a totally different character for one thing the possible point at which contact was established between the man s blood and something of a poisonous character An injection of cyanide of potassium for instance would cause death and account in a measure for this suggestion of asphyxia conveyed by the expression of the features True my good sir but have the goodness to ask yourself who could get into the place to administer such hypodermic And if self administered what can have become of the syringe If thrown from one of the bowman s slits it could only have fallen upon the roof of the wing and I assure you that was searched most thoroughly long before your arrival I don t think you will go so far as to suggest that it was shot in attached to some steel missile capable of making a wound for no such missile is as you see embedded in the flesh nor was one lying anywhere about the floor The cyanide of potassium theory is ingenious but I m afraid it won t hold water Hold water The phrase brought Cleek s thoughts harking back to what he had been told regarding the little puddle of water lying on the floor and of a sudden his eyes narrowed and the curious one sided smile travelled up his cheek No I suppose not he said replying to the doctor s remark Besides your test tubes would have settled that when it settled the carbon monoxide question Had cyanide been present the specimens of blood would have been clotted and blue Of a sudden it seemed to dawn upon the doctor that this didn t smack quite so much of Board School intelligence as he had fancied and facing round he looked at Cleek with a new born interest I beg your pardon he said but I don t think I caught your name mister er er Cleek Doctor Hamilton Cleek at your service Good Lord That is I er er my dear sir my dear mister Cleek if there is any intelligence I can possibly supply pray command me With pleasure Doctor and thank you very much indeed for the kind offer I have been told that there was a little puddle of water on the floor at the time the murder was discovered also that you took a sample of it for analysis As I don t see any sign of that puddle now would you mind telling me what that analysis established I have heard I may tell you that you found the water to contain no poisonous substance but I should be obliged if you can tell me if it was water drawn from a well or such as might have been taken from a river or pond As a matter of fact my dear mister Cleek I don t think it came from any of the three Hum m m A manufactured mineral water then No not that either If it had been raining and there was any hole or leak in this roof I should have said it was rainwater that had dripped in and formed a little puddle on the floor If it had been winter I should have said it was the result of melted snow As a matter of fact I incline more to the latter theory than to any other although it is absurd of course to think of snow being obtainable anywhere in England in the month of July Quite so quite so unless it doesn t matter That s all thank you Doctor and very many thanks A word please mister Cleek interposed the doctor as he turned to move away and leave him I am afraid I was not very communicative nor very cordial when you asked me if I had any idea of the means employed to bring about the unfortunate man s death may I hope that you will be better mannered than I mister Cleek if I ask you if you have Thanks very much Then have you Yes said Cleek And so too will you if you will make a second blood test with the specimens you have at a period of about forty eight hours after the time of decease It will take quite that before the presence of the thing manifests itself under the influence of any known process or responds to any known test And even then it will only be detected by a faintly alcoholic odour and excessively bitter taste The man has been murdered done to death by that devil s drug woorali if I am not mistaken But who administered it and how it was administered are things I can t tell you yet Woorali Woorali That is the basis of the drug curarin produced by Roulin and Boussingault in eighteen twenty eight from a combination of the allied poisons known to the savages of South America and of the tropics by the names of corroval and vao is it not Yes And a fiend s thing it is too A mere scratch from anything steeped in it is enough to kill an ox almost immediately The favourite native manner of using the hellish thing is by means of a thorn and a blowpipe But no such method has been employed in this case No thorn nor indeed any other projectile has entered the flesh nor is there one lying anywhere about the floor Be sure I looked Doctor the instant I suspected that woorali had been used Pardon me but that must be all for the present I have other fish to fry CHAPTER XXIX The frying of them took the shape of first going outside and walking round the Stone Drum and then of stepping back to the door and beckoning Narkom and Lord Fallowfield and young James Drake out to him Anybody in the habit of sitting out here to read or paint or anything of that sort he asked abruptly Good gracious no replied Lord Fallowfield Whatever makes you ask such a thing as that mister Cleek Nothing only that I have found four little marks disposed of at such regular distances that they seem to have been made by the four legs of a chair resting with a rather heavy weight upon it on the leads of the roof and immediately under one of the bowman s slits in the Stone Drum A chair with casters I should imagine from the character of the marks We are on a level with the sleeping quarters of the servants in the house proper I believe and chairs with casters are not usual in servants bedrooms in most houses Are they so here Certainly not put in young Drake Why I don t believe there is a chair with casters on the whole blessed floor Is there Lord Fallowfield You ought to know Yes there is Jim There are three in fact they all are in the old armoury Been there a dog s age and they so matched the old place your poor father never had them taken out The old armoury What s that your lordship may I ask Oh a relic of the old feudal times mister Cleek You see on account of the position of the Stone Drum the weapon room or arming room had to be up here on a level with the wing roof instead of below stairs as in the case of other towers That s the place over there the window just to the left of the door leading into the building proper It is full of the old battle flags knights pennants shields cross bows and the Lord knows what of those old days of primitive warfare We Fallowfields always preserved it just as it was in the days of its usefulness for its historical interest and its old association with the name Like to have a look at it Very much indeed replied Cleek and two minutes later he was standing in the place and revelling in its air of antiquity As Lord Fallowfield had declared the three old chairs which supplied seating accommodation were equipped with casters but although these were the prime reason for Cleek s visit to the place he gave them little more than a passing glance bestowing all his attention upon the ancient shields and the quaint old cross bows with which the walls were heavily hung in tier after tier almost to the groined ceiling Primitive times mister Narkom when men used to go out with these jimcrack things and bang away at each other with skewers he said taking one of them down and examining it in a somewhat casual manner turning it over testing its weight looking at its catch and running his fingers up and down the propelling string Fancy a chap with one of these things running up against a modern battery or sailing out into a storm of shrapnel Back to your hook grandfather hanging it up again times change and we with time By the way your lordship I hope you will be better able to give an account of your whereabouts last night than I hear that mister Drake here is able to do regarding his I Good heavens man what do you mean flung out his lordship so taken aback by the abruptness of the remark that the very breath seemed to be knocked out of him Upon my soul mister Cleek Gently gently your lordship You must certainly realize that in the circumstances the same necessity must exist for you to explain your movements as exists for mister Drake I am told that in the event of the elder mister Drake s death this property was to come to you wholly unencumbered by any charge or any restrictions whatsoever Good God So it was Upon my soul I d forgotten all about that exclaimed his lordship with such an air that he was either speaking the absolute truth or was a very good actor indeed Jim My boy Oh good heavens I never gave the thing a thought never one No mister Cleek I can give no account of my movements other than to say that I went to bed directly I left the Stone Drum Or yes I can prove that much by George I can indeed Ojeebi was with me or at least close at my heels at the time and he saw me go into my room and must have heard me lock the door Ojeebi Who is he My father s Japanese valet put in young Drake Been with him for the past five years If he tells you that he saw Lord Fallowfield go into his room and lock the door after him you can rely upon that as an absolute and irrefutable truth Whitest little yellow man that ever walked on two feet faithful as a dog and as truthful as they make em And they don t make em any too truthful as a rule in his country by Jove said Cleek Still of course as he could not possibly have anything to gain Call him up will you and let us hear what he has to say with regard to Lord Fallowfield s statement Young Drake rang for a servant issued the necessary order and some five or six minutes later a timid little yellow man with the kindest face and the most gentle step a man could possess came into the room his soft eyes reddened with much weeping and tear stains marking his sallow cheeks Oh mister Jim Oh mister Jim the dear kind old boss He gone he gone he broke out disconsolately as he caught sight of his late master s son and made as if to prostrate himself before him That s all right Ojeebi that s all right old man interrupted young Drake with a smothered blub in his voice and a twitching movement of his mouth Cut it out I m not iron Say this gentleman wants to ask you a few questions Ojeebi deliver the goods just as straight as you know how Me mister Jim Gentleman want question me The small figure turned the kindly face lifted and the sorrowful eyes looked up into Cleek s unemotional ones Yes said he placidly and forthwith told him what Lord Fallowfield claimed That very true declared Ojeebi The lord gentleman he right ahead of me I see him go into his room and hear him lock door That very true indeed H m Any idea of the time Yes much idea Two minutes a past twelve I see clock as I go past Lady Marj ie s room What were you doing knocking about that part of the house at that hour of the night Your room s up here in the servant s quarters isn t it Yes sir But I go take ice water to the boss s room Boss never go to bed nights without ice water handy sir Merican boss never do Yes Quite so quite so Where did you get the ice from and how Chop it from a big cake No sir It always froze to fit bottle I get him from the ice make room downstairs He means the refrigerating room mister Cleek explained young Drake You know I take it what a necessary commodity we Americans hold ice to be Indeed the dear old dad wouldn t think a dinner was a dinner without ice water on the table and ice cream for the final course And as there was no possibility of procuring a regular and adequate supply in an out of the way spot like this he had a complete artificial ice making plant added to the place and overcame the difficulty in that way That is what Ojeebi means by the ice make room What he means about its being frozen to fit the bottles is this The ice which is to be used for drinking purposes is manufactured in forms or vessels which turn it out in cubes so that whenever it is wanted all that a servant has to do is to go to the plant and the man in charge supplies him with all the cubes required Ah I see said Cleek and stroked his chin Well that s all I reckon for the time being Ojeebi has certainly backed up your statement to the fullest your lordship so we can dispense with him entirely And now if I have your permission gentlemen I should like to feel myself privileged to go poking about the house and grounds for the next hour or so in quest of possible clues At the end of that time I will rejoin you here and shall hope to have something definite to report So if you don t mind my going Thanks very much Come along mister Narkom I ve a little something for you to do and an hour will do it or I m a dogberry With that he took his departure from the armoury and with the superintendent following went down through the house to the grounds and out into the screen of close crowding view defying trees Here he paused a minute to pull out his notebook and scribble something on a leaf and then to tear out that leaf and put it into mister Narkom s hand Rush Lennard off to the post office with that will you and have it wired up to town as soon as possible he said Prepay the reply and get that reply back to me as soon as telegraph and motor can get it here Then he swung off out of the screen of the trees and round the angle of the building and set about hunting for the refrigerating plant CHAPTER XXX It was five and after when the superintendent pale and shaking with excitement came up the long drive from the Hall gates and found Cleek lounging in the doorway of the house placidly smoking a cigarette and twirling a little ball of crumpled newspaper in his hand Right was I mister Narkom he queried smilingly Good God yes Right as rain old chap Been carrying it for upward of a twelvemonth and no doubt waiting for an opportunity to strike Good And while you have been attending to your little part of the business I ve been looking out for mine dear friend Look said Cleek and opened up the little ball of paper sufficiently to show what looked like a cut glass scent bottle belonging to a lady s dressing bag close stoppered with a metal plug sealed round with candle wax Woorali my friend and enough in it to kill an army Come along we ve got to the bottom of the thing let us go up and report The gentlemen will be getting anxious They were for on reaching the armoury they found young Drake and Lord Fallowfield showing strong traces of the mental strain under which they were labouring and talking agitatedly with Lady Marjorie Wynde who had in the interim come up and joined them and was herself apparently in need of something to sustain and to strengthen her for Ojeebi was standing by with an extended salver from which she had just lifted to her lips a glass of port Good God I never was so glad to see anybody in my life gentlemen broke out young Drake as they appeared It s beyond the hour you asked for ages beyond and my nerves are almost pricking their way through my skin mister Cleek mister Narkom speak up for heaven s sake Have you succeeded in finding out anything We ve done better than that mister Drake replied Cleek for we have succeeded in finding out everything Look sharp there mister Narkom and shut that door Lady Marjorie looks as if she were going to faint and we don t want a whole houseful of servants piling in here That s it Back against the door please her ladyship seems on the point of crumpling up No no I m not indeed I m not protested Lady Marjorie with a forced smile and a feeble effort to hold her galloping nerves in check I am excited and very much upset of course but I am really much stronger than you would think Still if you would rather I should leave the room mister Cleek Oh by no means your ladyship I know how anxious you are to learn the result of my investigations And by that token somebody else is anxious too the doctor Call him in will you mister Drake He is still with the others in the Stone Drum I assume He was and he came out of it with them at young Drake s call and joined the party in the armoury Doctor said Cleek looking up as he came in we ve got to the puzzle s unpicking and I thought you d be interested to hear the result I was right about the substance employed for I ve found the stuff and I ve nailed the guilty party It was woorali and the reason why there was no trace of a weapon was because the blessed thing melted It was an icicle my friend an icicle with its point steeped in woorali and if you want to know how it did its work why it was shot in there from the cross bow hanging on the wall immediately behind me and the person who shot it in was so short that a chair was necessary to get up to the bowman s slit when No you don t my beauty There s a gentleman with a noose waiting to pay his respects to all such beasts as you Speaking he sprang with a sharp flashing movement that was like to nothing so much as the leap of a pouncing cat and immediately there was a yap and a screech a yell and a struggle a click of clamping handcuffs and a scuffle of writhing limbs and a moment later they that were watching saw him rise with a laugh and stand with his hands on his hips looking down at Ojeebi lying crumpled up in a heap with gyves on his wrists and panic in his eyes at the foot of the guarded door Well my pleasant faced agreeable little demon it ll be many a long day before the spirits of your ancestors welcome you back to Nippon Cleek said as the panic stricken Jap realizing what was before him began to shriek and shriek until his brain and nerves sank into a collapse and he fainted where he lay I ve got you and I ve got the woorali I went through your trunk and found it as I knew I should from the moment I clapped eyes upon you If the laws of the country are so lax that they make it possible for you to do what you have done they also are stringent enough to make you pay the price of it with your yellow little neck In the name of heaven mister Cleek spoke up young Drake breaking silence suddenly what can the boy have done You speak as if it were he that murdered my father but man why should he What had he to gain What motive could a harmless little chap like this have for killing the man he served The strongest in the world my friend the greed of gain said Cleek What he could not do in your father s land it is possible for him to do in this one which foolishly allows its subjects to insure even the life of its ruler without his will knowledge or consent For nearly a twelvemonth this little brute has been carrying a heavy insurance upon the life of Jefferson P Drake but thank God he ll never live to collect it What s that Doctor How did I find that out By the simplest means possible my dear sir For a reason which concerns nobody but myself I dropped in at the Guildford office of the Royal British Life Assurance Society in the latter part of last May and upon that occasion I marked the singular circumstance that a Japanese was then paying the premium of an already existing policy Why I speak of it as a singular circumstance and why I let myself be impressed by it lie in the fact that as the Japanese regard their dead ancestors with absolute veneration and the privilege of being united with them a boon which makes death glorious life assurance is not popular with them since it seems to be insulting their ancestors and makes joining them tainted with the odour of baser things Consequently I felt pretty certain that it was some other life than his own he was there to pay the regularly recurring premium upon The chances are Doctor that in the ordinary run of things I should never have thought of that man or that circumstance again But it so happens that I have a very good memory for faces and events so when I came down here to investigate this case and in the late mister Drake s valet saw that Japanese man again voila I should have been an idiot not to put two and two together The remainder a telegram inquiring if an insurance upon the life of Jefferson P Drake the famous inventor had been effected by anybody but the man himself settled the thing beyond question As for the rest it is easy enough to explain Your remark that the little puddle found upon the floor of the Stone Drum appeared to you to bear a distinct resemblance to the water resulting from melted snow added to what I already knew regarding the refrigerating plant installed here put me on the track of the ice and as the small spot on the temple was of so minute a character I knew that the weapon must have been pointed A pointed weapon of ice leaves but one conclusion possible Doctor I have since learned from the man in charge of the refrigerating plant that this yellow blob of iniquity here was much taken by the icicles which the process of refrigeration caused to accumulate in the place and upon the machine itself during rotation and that last night shortly after twelve o clock he came down and broke off and carried away three of them How I came to know what motive power he employed to launch the poisoned shaft can be explained in a word Most of the weapons indeed all but one hanging on the wall of this armoury are lightly coated with dust showing that it must be a week or more since any housemaid s work was attended to in this particular quarter One of them is not dusty Furthermore when I took it down for the purpose of examining it I discovered that although smeared with ink or paint to make it look as old as the others the bowstring was of fresh catgut and there was a suspicious dampness about the catch which suggested either wet hands or the partial melting under the heat of living flesh of the shaft which had been an icicle That s all Doctor that s all mister Drake that s quite all Lord Fallowfield A good true hearted young chap will get both the girl he wants and the inheritance which should be his by right a good true friend will get back the ancestral home he lost through misfortune and has regained through chance and a patient and faithful lady will in all probability get the man she loves without now having to wait until he comes into a dead man s shoes Lady Marjorie my compliments Doctor my best respects and gentlemen all good afternoon And here with that weakness for the theatrical which was his besetting sin he bowed to them with his hat laid over his heart and walked out of the room CHAPTER XXXI No mister Narkom no As an instrument of death the icicle is not new said Cleek answering the superintendent s question as the limousine swung out through the gates of Heatherington Hall and faced the long journey back to London If you will look up the records of that energetic female Catherine de Medici Queen of France you will find that she employed it in that capacity upon two separate occasions and coming down to more modern times you will also find that in the year eighteen seventy two the Russian Lydia Bolorfska used it at Galitch in the province of Kostroma to stab her sleeping husband But as a projectile it is new as a successful projectile I mean for there have been many attempts made owing to its propensity to dissolve after use to discharge it from firearms but never in one single instance have those attempts resulted in success The explosion has always resulted in shivering and dispersing it in a shower of splinters as it leaves the muzzle of the weapon There can be no doubt however that could it be propelled in a perfectly horizontal position the power behind it would in spite of its brittle nature drive it through a pine board an inch thick But as I have said the motive power always defeats the object by landing it against the target in a mass of splinters I see And the Jap got over that by employing a cross bow and that of course did the trick No I doubt if he would have been able to put enough power behind that to drive it into the man s body with deadly effect if indeed he could make it enter it at all Where Ojeebi scored over all others lay in the fact that with his plan there was no necessity to have the icicle enter the victim s body at all He required nothing more than just sufficient power of propulsion to break the skin and establish contact with the blood and then that hellish compound on the point of the projectile could be depended upon to do the rest It did as you know and then dropped to the floor and melted away leaving nothing but a little puddle of water behind it But Cleek my dear chap how do you account for the fact that when the doctor came to analyze that water he found no trace of the poison in it He did mister Narkom only that he didn t recognize it Woorali is extremely volatile for one thing and evaporates rapidly For another there was a very small quantity used a very small quantity necessary so malignant it is and the water furnished by the melting icicle could dilute that little tremendously It would not be able to obliterate all trace of it however but the infinitesimal portion remaining would make spring water give the same answer in analysis as that given by the water resulting from melted snow It was when Doctor Hague mentioned the fact that if it wasn t for the utter absurdity of looking for such a substance in England in July he should have said it was melted snow that I really got my first clue Later however when But come let s chuck it I ve had enough of murder and murderers for one day let s talk of something else Our new turnout here for instance You have done yourself proud this time and no mistake she certainly is a beauty mister Narkom By the way what have you done with the old red one Sold it Not I indeed I know a trick worth two of that I send it out empty every day in the hope of having those Apache johnnies follow it and have a plain clothes man trailing along behind in a taxi ready to nip in and follow them if they do But they don t that is they haven t up to the present but there s always hope you know Not in that direction I m afraid Waldemar s a better general than that believe me Knowing that we have discovered his little plan of following the red limousine just as we discovered his other of following me he will have gone off on another tack believe me Scotland You don t think do you that he can possibly have found out anything about the new one and has set in to follow this No I do not As a matter of fact I fancy he has started to do what he ought to have done in the beginning that is to keep a close watch on the criminal news in the papers day by day and every time a crime of any importance crops up pay his respects to the theatre of it and find out who is the detective handling the case A ducat to a doughnut he d have been on our heels down here to day if this little business of the Stone Drum had been made public in time to get into the morning papers He means to have me mister Narkom if having me is possible and he s down to the last ditch and getting desperate Yesterday s cables from Mauravania are anything but reassuring I know They say that unless something happens very shortly to turn the tide in Ulric s favour and quell the cries for Restoration the King s downfall and expulsion are merely a matter of a few days at most But what s that got to do with it that you suggest its bearing upon any need for haste on Waldemar s part Only that with matters in such a state he cannot long defer his return to the army of his country and the defence of its king replied Cleek serenely And every day he loses in failing to pay his respects to your humble servant in the manner he desires to do increases the strain of the situation and keeps him from the service of his royal master Well I wish to God something would happen to blow him and his royal master and their blooming royal country off the map dammem blazed out Narkom too savage to be choice of words We ve never had a moment s peace you and I since the dashed combination came into the game And for what I should like to know Not that it s any use asking you You re so devilish close mouthed a man might as well ask questions of a ton of coal for all answer he may hope to get I shall always believe however that you did something pretty dashed bad to the King of Mauravania that time you were over there on that business about the Rainbow Pearl to make the beggar turn against you as I believe he has Then you will always believe what isn t true replied Cleek lighting a fresh cigarette I simply restored the pearl and his Majesty s letter to the hands of Count Irma and did not so much as see the King while I was there Why should I a mere police detective who had been hired to do a service and paid for it like any other hireling I took my money and I went my way that s all there was about it If it has pleased Count Waldemar to entertain an ugly feeling of resentment toward me I can t help that can I now Oh then it s really a personal affair between you and him after all Something like that He doesn t approve of my er knowing things that I do know and it would be the end of a very promising future for him if I told Here have a cigarette and smoke yourself into a better temper You look savage enough to bite a nail in two I d bite it in four if it looked anything like that Waldemar johnnie by James asserted the superintendent vigorously And if ever he lays a hand on you Look here Cleek I know it sounds un English very Continental rotten soft from one man to another but dammit Cleek I love you I d go to hell for you I d die fighting for you Do you understand Perfectly said Cleek then he put out his hand and took mister Narkom s in a hard firm grip and added gently My friend my comrade my pal Side by side together to the end And the car ran on for a good half mile before either spoke again CHAPTER XXXII mister Narkom It was an hour later and Cleek s voice broke the silence abruptly He had taken out his notebook and had been scribbling in it for some little time but now as he spoke he tore out the written leaf and passed it over to the superintendent mister Narkom I refused in the beginning to give you the address of the little house at which I was located Here it is Put it in your pocketbook against future need will you Yes certainly But cinnamon old chap what good is it to me now when you ve left the place You will understand perhaps when I tell you that Miss Lorne is its present occupant It was for that I took it in the beginning There may come a need to communicate with her there may come a need for her to communicate with you There s always a chance you know that a candle may be put out when the wind blows at it from all directions and if anything should happen I mean if er anything having a bearing upon me personally that you think she ought to be told should come to pass well just go to her at once will you there s a dear friend That s the address don t lose it and full directions how to get there speedily I am giving it to you now as we shall soon be in town again and I shall leave you directly we arrive there I m in haste to get back to Dollops and see if between us we can t hit upon some plan he and I to get at the whereabouts of Waldemar That plain clothes man of yours is like the butler with the bottle of cider he doesn t seem to get any forrarder Kibblewhite blurted out the superintendent sitting up sharply Well of all the born jackasses of all the mutton heads in this world Well he doesn t seem to be very bright I must say He Lud I wasn t talking about him I was talking about myself I had something to tell you to day and this blessed business drove it clean out of my head Kibblewhite had the dickens and all of a time trying to get at that chap Serpice as you may remember I do in a measure Succeeded in finding out finally that the carriage he drove was one he hired from a liveryman by the month I think was the last report you gave me but couldn t get any further with the business because Serpice took it into his head not to call for the carriage again and made off this Kibblewhite chap didn t know where and appears never to have found a means of discovering No he didn t But ten days ago he got word from the liveryman that Serpice had just turned up and was about to make use of the carriage again and off Kibblewhite cut hotfoot in the hope of being able to follow him No go however By the time he arrived at the stable Serpice had already gone so there was nothing left for the poor disappointed chap to do but to go out on the hunt and see if he couldn t pick him up somewhere in the streets Which he didn t of course Excuse me which he did But it was late in the afternoon and he was coming back to the stable with the carriage empty Also it was in the thick of the traffic at Ludgate Circus and Kibblewhite was so afraid the fellow might mix himself up in it and give him the slip that he took a chance shot to prevent it Nipping up the officer on point he made himself and his business known and in a winking in nips the constable hauls mister Serpice up sharp and arrests him for driving a public vehicle without a license Well played Kibblewhite approved Cleek That of course meant that the fellow would be arrested and have to give his address and all the rest of it So Kibblewhite himself thought but what does the beggar do but turn the tables on him in the most unexpected manner by absolutely refusing to do anything of the kind and as he did not have a license and would not call anybody to pay his fine the magistrate finished the business by committing him to jail for ten days in default And here s the thing I was ass enough to forget His ten days imprisonment was up this morning Kibblewhite in disguise was to be outside the jail to follow him when he was discharged and see where he went and he told me to look for him to turn up at the Yard before six this evening with a full report of the result of his operations Bravo said Cleek leaning back in his seat with a sigh of satisfaction I ve changed my mind about leaving you mister Narkom we will go on to the Yard together As in all probability after ten days without being able to communicate with his pals or with Waldemar our friend Serpice will be hot to get to them at once and explain the cause of his long absence the chances are that Kibblewhite will have something of importance to report at last He had as they found out when in the fulness of time they arrived at the Yard and were told that he was waiting for them in the superintendent s office and in his excitement he almost threw it at them so eager he was to report I ve turned the trick at last Superintendent he cried The silly josser played straight into my hands sir The minute he was out of jail he made a beeline for Soho and me after him and there he takes to earth in a rotten little restaurant in the worst part of the district and when I nips over and has a look inside there he was shakin hands with a lot of Frenchies of his own kind and them all prancin about and laughin like they d gone off their bloomin heads I sees there aren t no back door to the place and I knows from that that he d have to come out the same way as he went in so off I nips over to the other side of the street and lays in wait for him After about ten minutes or so out he comes him and another of the lot moppin of his mouth with his coat sleeve and off they starts in a great hurry and me after them They goes first to a barber shop where the man I was followin nips in has a shave a hair cut and a wash up while the chap that was with him toddles off and fetches him a clean shirt and a suit of black clothes In about fifteen minutes out my man comes again makin a tolerable respectable appearance sir after his barberin and in his clean linen and decent clothes Him and his mate stands talkin and grinnin for a minute or so then they shakes hands and separates and off my man cuts it westward Sir I sticks to him like a brother I follers him smack across to the Strand and along that to the Hotel Cecil and there the beggar nips in and goes up the courtyard as bold as you please sends up his name to a gent the gent sends down word for him to be showed up at once and in that way I spots my man For when I goes up to the clerk and shows my badge and asks who was the party my johnnie had asked for he tells me straight and clear Gentleman he s making a suit of clothes for Baron Rodolf de Montravenne an Austrian nobleman who has been stopping here for weeks Cleek twitched round his eye and glanced at Narkom Things least hidden are best hidden he quoted smiling The dear count knows a thing or two you perceive You have done very well indeed Kibblewhite Here is your ten pound note and many thanks for your services Good evening Kibblewhite took the money and his departure immediately but so long as he remained within hearing distance so long as the echo of his departing steps continued to sound Cleek remained silent and the curious crooked smile made a loop in his cheek But of a sudden mister Narkom he said quietly I shan t be found in any of my usual haunts for the next few days If however you should urgently need me call at the Hotel Cecil and ask for Captain Maltravers and call in disguise please our friend the count is keen Remember the name Or better still write it down But good God Cleek such a risk as that No please don t attempt to dissuade me I want that man and I ll get him if getting him be humanly possible That s all Thanks very much Good bye Then the door opened and shut and by the time mister Narkom could turn round from writing down the name he had been given he was quite alone in the room CHAPTER XXXIII Num bah Nine ninety two Captain Maltravers please Nine ninety two Num bah Nine ninety two Thrice the voice of the page moving and droning out his words in that perfunctory manner peculiar unto the breed of hotel pages the world over sounded its dreary monotone through the hum of conversation in the rather crowded tearoom without producing the slightest effect then of a sudden the gentleman seated in the far corner reading the daily paper a tall fair haired fair moustached gentleman with The Army written all over him in capital letters twitched up his head listened until the call was given for the fourth time and thereupon snapped his fingers sharply elevated a beckoning digit and called out crisply Here my boy over here this way The boy went to him immediately extended a small circular metal salver and then lifting the thumb which held in position the hand written card thereon allowed the slip of pasteboard to be removed Gentleman sir waiting in the office he volunteered Captain Maltravers glanced at the card frowned rose with it still held between his fingers and within the space of a minute s time walked into the hotel s public office and the presence of a short stout full bearded dumpling of a man with the florid complexion and the country cut clothes of a gentleman farmer who half sat and half leaned upon the arm of a leather covered settle nervously tapping with the ferule of a thick walking cane a boot whose exceedingly high sole and general construction mutely stood sponsor for a withered and shortened leg My dear Yard I am delighted to see you exclaimed the captain as he bore down on the little round man and shook hands with him heartily Grimshaw told me that you would be coming up to London shortly but I didn t allow myself to hope that it would be so soon as this Gad it s a dog s age since I ve seen you Come along up to my own room and let us have a good old fashioned chat Key of Nine ninety two please clerk Thanks very much Come along Yard this way old chap With that he linked his arm in his caller s bore him clumping and wobbling to the nearby lift and thence in due course to the door of number Nine ninety two and the seclusion which lay behind it He was still chattering away gayly as the lift dropped down out of sight and left them upon which he shut the door locked it upon the inside and stopping long enough to catch up a towel and hang it over the keyhole turned on his heel and groaned What am I not to have even a two days respite you indefatigable machine he said as he walked across the room and threw himself into a chair with a sigh of annoyance Think it was only this morning that I ventured upon the first casual bow of a fellow guest with the dear Baron only at luncheon we exchanged the first civil word But the ice was broken and I should have had him roped in by teatime I am sure of it And now you come and nip my hopes in the bud like this And in a disguise that a fellow as sharp as he would see through in a wink if he met you It was the best I could do Cleek I m not a dabster in the art of making up as you know mister Narkom s voice was like his air duly apologetic Besides I hung around until I saw him go out before I ventured in although I was on thorns the whole blessed time I had to see you old chap I simply had to and every minute was of importance I shouldn t have ventured to come at all if it hadn t been imperative I m sure of that said Cleek recovering his good humour instantly Don t mind my beastly bad temper this afternoon there s a good friend It s a bit of a disappointment of course after I d looked forward to a clear field just as soon as Waldemar should return but It is you first and foremost at all times and under all circumstances Other matters count as nothing with me when you call Always remember that I do old chap It s because I do that I went to the length of promising Miss Larue that I d lay the case before you Miss Larue A moment please Will the lady to whom you refer be Miss Margaret Larue the celebrated actress The one in question who treated me so cavalierly last August in that business regarding the disappearance of that chap James Colliver Yes He was her brother you recollect and don t get hot about it Cleek I know she treated you very badly in that case and so does she but She treated me abominably interposed Cleek with some heat First setting me on the business and then calling me off just as I had got a grip on the thing and was within measuring distance of the end I can t forgive that and I never could fathom her reason for it If it was as you yourself suggested at the time because she shrank from the notoriety that was likely to accrue to her from letting everybody in the world know that Jimmy the Shifter was her own brother she ought to have thought of that in the beginning when she acknowledged it so openly instead of making such an ass of me by her high handed proceeding of calling me off the scent at its hottest as if I were a tame puppy to be pulled this way and that with a string I object to being made a fool of mister Narkom and there s no denying the fact that Miss Larue treated me very badly in that James Colliver case very badly and very cavalierly indeed Unquestionably Miss Larue had Even mister Narkom had to admit that for the facts which lay behind these heated remarks were not such as are calculated to make any criminal investigator pleased with his connection therewith Clearly set forth those facts were as follows On the nineteenth day of the preceding August James Colliver had disappeared as suddenly and as completely and with as little trace left behind as does a kinematograph picture when it vanishes from the screen Now the world at large had never heard of James Colliver until he did disappear and it is extremely doubtful if it would have done so even then but that circumstances connected with his vanishment brought to light the startling disclosure that the worthless dissolute hulk of a man who was known to the habitues of half the low class public houses in Hoxton by the pseudonym of Jimmy the Shifter was not only all that time and drink had left of the once popular melodramatic actor Julian Monteith but that he was in addition thereto own brother to Miss Margaret Larue the distinguished actress who was at that moment electrifying London by her marvellous performance of the leading role in The Late missus Cavendish The reasons which impelled Miss Larue to let the public discover that her real name was Maggie Colliver and that Jimmy the Shifter was related to her by such close ties of blood were these The Late missus Cavendish was nearing the close of its long and successful run at the Royalty and its successor was already in rehearsal for early production That successor was to be a specially rewritten version of the old time favourite play Catharine Howard or The Tomb the Throne and the Scaffold with Miss Larue of course in the part of the ambitious and ill fated Catharine Preparations were on foot for a production which would be splendidly elaborate as to scenery and effects and absolutely accurate as to detail For instance the costume which Henry VIII had worn at the time of his marriage with Catharine Howard was copied exactly down to the minute question of the gaudy stitchery on the backs of the gloves and the toes of the shoes and permission had been obtained to make the mimic betrothal ring which the stage Henry was to press upon the finger of the stage Catharine an exact replica of the real one as preserved among the nation s historic jewels Not to be outdone in this matter of accuracy Miss Larue naturally aimed to have the dresses and the trinkets she wore as nearly like those of the original Catharine as it was possible to obtain As her position in the world of art was now so eminent and had brought her into close touch with the elect it was not difficult for the lady to borrow dresses and even jewels of the exact period from the heirlooms treasured by members of the nobility that these might be copied in mimic gems for her by the well known theatrical and show supply company of Henry Trent Son Soho To this firm which was in full charge of the preparation of dresses properties and accessories for the great production was also entrusted the making of a cast of Miss Larue s features and the manufacture therefrom of a wax head with which it was at first proposed to lend a touch of startling realism to the final scene of the execution of Catharine on Tower Hill but which was subsequently abandoned after the first night as being unnecessarily gruesome and repulsive It was during the course of the final rehearsals for this astonishing production and when the army of supers who had long been drilling for it at other hours was brought for the first time into contact with the principals that Miss Larue was horrified to discover among the members of that army her dissolute brother Jimmy the Shifter For years out of sheer sympathy for the wife who clung to him to the last and the young son who was growing up to be a fine fellow despite the evil stock from which he had sprung Miss Larue had continuously supplied this worthless brother with money enough to keep him with the strict proviso that he was never to come near any theatre where she might be performing nor ever at any time to make known his relationship to her She now saw in this breaking of a rule which heretofore he had inviolably adhered to clear evidence that the man had suddenly become a menace and she was in great haste to get him out of touch with her colleagues before anything could be done to disgrace her In so sudden and so pressing an emergency she could think of no excuse but an errand by which to get him out of the theatre and of no errand but one the stage jewels which Messrs Trent Son were making for her She therefore sat down quickly at the prompt table and drawing a sheet of paper to her wrote hurriedly Messrs Trent Son GENTLEMEN Please give the bearer my jewels or such of them as are finished if you have not done with all that he may bring them to me immediately as I have instant need of them Yours faithfully MARGARET LARUE This she passed over to the stage manager with a request to Please read that mister Lampson and certify over your signature that it is authentic and that you vouch for having seen me write it After which she got up suddenly and said as calmly as she could mister Super Master I want to borrow one of your men to go on an important errand to Trent Son for me This one will do signalling out her brother Spare him please This way my man come quickly With that she suddenly caught up the note she had written and which the stage manager had as requested certified and beckoning her brother to follow walked hurriedly off the stage to a deserted point in the wings Why have you done this dreadful thing she demanded in a low fierce tone as soon as he came up with her Are you a fool as well as a knave that you come here and risk losing your only support by a thing like this I wanted to see you I had to see you and it was the only way he gave back in the same guarded tone The wife is dead She died last night and I ve got to get money somewhere to bury her I d no one to send since you ve taken Ted away and sent him to school so I had to come myself The knowledge that it was for no more desperate reason than this that he had forced himself into her presence came as a great relief to Miss Larue She hastened to get rid of him by sending him to Trent Son with the note that she had written and to tell him to carry the parcel that would be handed to him to the rooms she was occupying in Portman Square and which she made up her mind to vacate the very next day and there to wait until she came home from rehearsal He took the note and left the theatre at once upon which Miss Larue considerably relieved returned to the duties in hand and promptly banished all thought of him from her mind It was not until something like two hours afterward that he was brought back to mind in a somewhat disquieting manner I say Miss Larue said the stage manager as she came off after thrice rehearsing a particularly trying scene and with a weary sigh dropped into a vacant chair at his table aren t you worried about that chap you sent with the note to Trent Son There s been time for him to go and return twice over you know and I observe that he s not back yet Aren t you a bit uneasy No Why should I be Well for one thing I should say it was an extremely risky business unless you knew something about the man Suppose for instance he should make off with the jewels A pretty pickle you d be in with the parties from whom you borrowed them by Jove Good gracious you don t suppose I sent him for the originals do you said Miss Larue with a smile Trent Son would think me a lunatic to do such a thing as that What I sent him for was of course merely the paste replicas The originals I shall naturally go for myself God bless my soul The paste replicas do you say blurted in mister Lampson excitedly Why I thought Trent Son will be sure to think so themselves under the circumstances They can t possibly think otherwise Under the circumstances Think otherwise repeated Miss Larue facing round upon him sharply What do you mean by that mister Lampson Good heavens not that they could possibly be mad enough to give the man the originals Yes certainly Good Lord what else can they think what else can they give him They sent the paste duplicates here by their own messenger this morning They are in the manager s office in his safe at this very minute and I was going to bring them round to you as soon as the rehearsal is over Consternation followed this announcement of course The rehearsal was called to an abrupt halt mister Lampson and Miss Larue flew round to the front of the house in a sort of panic got to the telephone and rang up Trent Son who confirmed their worst fears Yes the man had arrived with the note from Miss Larue something over an hour ago and they had promptly handed him over the original jewels Not all of them of course but those which they had finished duplicating and of which they had sent the replicas to the theatre by their own messenger that morning Surely that was what Miss Larue meant by the demand was it not No other explanation seemed possible after they had sent her the copies and Good Lord hadn t heard about it Meant the imitations Heavens above what an appalling mistake What was that The man Oh yes he took the things after mister Trent senior had removed them from the safe and handed them over to him and he had left mister Trent s office directly he received them Miss Larue could ascertain exactly what had been delivered to him by examining the duplicates their messenger had carried to the theatre Miss Larue did discovering to her dismay that they represented a curious ruby necklace of which the original had been lent her by the Duchess of Oldhampton a stomacher of sapphires and pearls borrowed from the Marquise of Chepstow and a rare Tudor clasp of diamonds and opals which had been lent to her by the Lady Margery Thraill In a panic she rushed from the theatre called a taxi and hoping against hope whirled off to her rooms at Portman Square No mister James Colliver had been there Nor did he come there ever Neither did he return to the squalid home where his dead wife lay nor did any of his cronies nor any of his old haunts see hide or hair of him from that time Furthermore nobody answering to his description had been seen to board any train steamship or sailing vessel leaving for foreign parts nor could there be found any hotel lodging house furnished or even unfurnished apartment into which he had entered that day or upon any day thereafter In despair Miss Larue drove to Scotland Yard and put the matter into the hands of the police offering a reward of Lone thousand for the recovery of the jewels and through the medium of the newspapers promised mister James Colliver that she would not prosecute but would pay that Lone thousand over to him if he would return the gems that she might restore them to their rightful owners mister James Colliver neither accepted that offer nor gave any sign that he was aware of it It was then that Scotland Yard in the person of Cleek stepped in to conduct the search for both man and jewels and within forty eight hours some amazing circumstances were brought to light First and foremost mister Henry Trent who said he had given the gems over to Colliver and that the man had immediately left the office was unable through the fact of his son s absence from town to give any further proof of that statement than his own bare word for there was nobody but himself in the office at the time whereas the door porter who distinctly remembered James Colliver s entrance into the building as distinctly remembered that up to the moment when evening brought knocking off time James Colliver had never to his certain knowledge come out of it The next amazing fact to be unearthed was that one of the office cleaners had found tucked under the stairs leading up to the top floor a sponge which had beyond all possible question been used to wipe blood from something and had evidently been tucked there in a great hurry The third amazing discovery took the astonishing shape of finding in an East End pawnbroker s shop every one of the missing articles and positive proof that the man who had pledged them was certainly not in the smallest degree like James Colliver but was evidently a person of a higher walk in life and more prosperous in appearance than the missing man had been since the days when he was a successful actor These circumstances Cleek had just brought to light when Miss Larue having found the gems determined to drop the case and refused thereafter so much as to discuss it with any living soul That her reason for taking this unusual step had something behind it which was of more moment than the mere fact that the jewels had been recovered and returned to their respective owners there could hardly be a doubt for from that time onward her whole nature seemed to undergo a radical change and from being a brilliant vivacious cheery hearted woman whose spirits were always of the highest and whose laughter was frequent she developed suddenly into a silent smileless mournful one who shrank from all society but that of her lost brother s orphaned son and who seemed to be oppressed by the weight of some unconfessed cross and the shadow of some secret woe Such were the facts regarding the singular Colliver case at the time when Cleek laid it down unprobed unsolved as deep a mystery in the end as it had been in the beginning and such they still were when on this day at this critical time and after an interval of eleven months mister Maverick Narkom came to ask him to pick it up again And with an element of fresh mystery added to complicate it more than ever dear chap he declared rather excitedly For as the father vanished eleven months ago so yesterday the son too disappeared In the same manner from the same point in the selfsame building and in the same inexplicable and almost supernatural way Only that in this instance the mystery is even more incomprehensible more like magic than ever For the boy is known to have been shown by a porter into a room almost entirely surrounded by glass a room whose interior was clearly visible to two persons who were looking into it at the time and then and there to have completely vanished without anybody knowing when where or how CHAPTER XXXIV What s that rapped out Cleek sitting up sharply His interest had been trapped just as mister Narkom knew that it would Vanished from a glass room into which people were looking at the time And yet nobody saw the manner of his going do you say That s it precisely But the most astonishing part of the business is the fact that whereas the porter can bring at least three witnesses to prove that he showed the boy into that glass room and at least one to testify that he heard him speak to the occupant of it the two watchers who were looking into the place at the time are willing to swear on oath that he not only did not enter the place but that the room was absolutely vacant at the period and remained so for at least an hour afterward If that isn t a mystery that will want a bit of doing to solve dear chap then you may call me a Dutchman Hum m m said Cleek reflectively How then am I to regard the people who give this cross testimony as lunatics or liars Neither b gad asseverated Narkom emphatically I ll stake my reputation upon the sanity and the truthfulness of every mother s son and every father s daughter of the lot of them The porter who says he showed the boy into the glass room I ve known since he was a nipper his dad was one of my Yard men years ago and the two people who were looking into the place at the time and who swear that it was absolutely empty and that the lad never came into it Look here old chap I ll let you into a bit of family history One of them is a distant relative of missus Narkom an aunt in fact who s rather down in the world and does a bit of dressmaking for a living The other is her daughter They are two of the straightest living most upright and truly religious women that ever drew the breath of life and they wouldn t either of em tell a lie for all the money in England There s where the puzzle of the thing comes in You simply have got to believe that that porter showed the boy into that room for there are reliable witnesses to prove it and he has no living reason to lie about it and you have got to believe that those two women are speaking the truth when they say that it was empty at that period and remained empty for an hour afterward Also if you will take on the case and solve at the same time the mystery attending the disappearance of both father and son you will have to find out where that boy went to through whose agency he vanished and for what cause A tall order that said Cleek with one of his curious one sided smiles Still of course mysteries which are humanly possible of creation are humanly possible of solution and there you are Who is the client Miss Larue If so how is one to be sure that she will not again call a halt and spoil a good case before it is halfway to completion For the best of reasons replied Narkom earnestly Hers is not the sole say in the present case Added to which she is now convinced that her suspicions in the former one were not well grounded The truth has come out at last Cleek She stopped all further inquiry into the mysterious disappearance of her brother because she had reason to believe that the elder mister Trent had killed him for the purpose of getting possession of those jewels to tide over a financial crisis consequent upon the failure of some heavy speculations upon the stock market She held her peace and closed up the case because she loves and is engaged to be married to his son and she would have lost everything in the world sooner than hurt his belief in the honour and integrity of his father What a ripping girl Gad but there are some splendid women in the world are there not mister Narkom What has happened dear friend to change her opinion regarding the elder mister Trent s guilt The disappearance of the son under similar circumstances to that of the father and from the same locality She knows now that the elder mister Trent can have no part in the matter since he is at present in America the financial crisis has been safely passed and the son who could have no possible reason for injuring the lad who is indeed remarkably fond of him and by whose invitation he visited the building is solely in charge and as wildly anxious as man can be to have the abominable thing cleared up without delay He now knows why she so abruptly closed up the other case and he is determined that nothing under heaven shall interfere with the prosecution of this one to the very end It is he who is the client and both he and his fiancee will be here presently to lay the full details before you Here Cleek leaned forward in his chair with a sort of lunge as he flung out the word and there was a snap in his voice that fairly stung Good heavens above man They mustn t come here Get word to them at once and stop them It wouldn t be any use trying I m afraid old chap I expect they are here already At all events I told them to watch from the other side of the way until they saw me enter and then to come in and go straightway to the public tearoom and wait until I brought you to them Well of all the insane Whatever prompted you to do a madman s trick like that A public character like Miss Larue a woman whom half London knows by sight who will be the target for every eye in the tearoom and the news of whose presence in the hotel will be all over the place in less than no time Were you out of your head Good lud Why I thought I d be doing the very thing that would please you dear chap bleated the superintendent despairingly It seemed to me such a natural thing for an actress to take tea at a hotel that it would look so innocent and open that nobody would suspect there was anything behind it And you always say that things least hidden are hidden the most of all Cleek struck his tongue against his teeth with a sharp clicking sound indicative of mild despair There were times when mister Narkom seemed utterly hopeless Well if it s done it s done of course and there seems only one way out of it he said Nip down to the tearoom as quickly as possible and if they are there bring them up here It s only four o clock and there s a chance that Waldemar may not have returned to the hotel yet Heaven knows I hope not He d spot you in a tick in a weak disguise like that Then why don t you go down yourself and fetch them up old chap He d never spot you Lord your own mother wouldn t know you from Adam in this spiffing get up And it wouldn t matter a tinker s curse then if Waldemar was back or not It would matter a great deal my friend don t deceive yourself upon that point For one thing Captain Maltravers is registered at the office as having just arrived from India after a ten years absence and ten years ago Miss Margaret Larue was not only unknown to fame but must have been still in pinafores so how was he to have made her acquaintance Then too she doesn t expect to see me without you so I should have to introduce myself and stop to explain matters yes and even risk her companion getting excited and saying something indiscreet and those are rather dangerous affairs in a public tearoom with everybody s eyes no doubt fixed upon the lady No you must attend to the matter yourself my friend so nip off and be about it If the lady and her companion are there just whisper them to say nothing but follow you immediately If they are not there slip out and warn them not to come Look sharp the situation is ticklish And just how ticklish mister Narkom realized when he descended and made his way to the public tearoom For the usual four o clock gathering of shoppers and sightseers was there in full force the well filled room was like a hive full of buzzing bees who were engaged in imparting confidences to one another the name of Margaret Larue was being whispered here there and everywhere and all eyes were directed toward a far corner where at a little round table Margaret Larue herself sat in company with mister Harrison Trent engaged in making a feeble pretence of enjoying a tea which neither of them wanted and upon which neither was bestowing a single thought Narkom spotted them at once made his way across the crowded room said something to them in a swift low whisper and immediately became at once the most envied and most unpopular person in the whole assembly for Miss Larue and her companion arose instantly and leaving some pieces of silver on the table walked out with him and robbed the room of its chief attraction All present had been deeply interested in the entire proceeding but none more so than the tall distinguished looking foreign gentleman seated all alone at the exactly opposite end of the room from the table where Miss Larue and her companion had been located for his had been the tensest kind of interest from the very instant mister Narkom had made his appearance and remained so to the last Illustration Count Irma has told said Narkom It s all out at last and I know now I m to lose you Even after the three persons had vanished from the room he continued to stare at the doorway through which they had passed and the rather elaborate tea he had ordered remained wholly untouched A soft step sounded near him and a soft voice broke in upon his unspoken thoughts Is not the tea to Monsieur s liking it inquired with all the deference of the Continental waiter And that awoke him from his abstraction Yes quite thank you By the way that was Miss Larue who just left the room was it not Philippe Yes Monsieur the great Miss Larue the most famous of all English actresses So I understand And the lame man who came in and spoke to her who is he Not a guest of the hotel I am sure since I have never seen him here before I do not know Monsieur who the gentleman is It shall be the first I shall see of him ever It may be however that he is a new arrival They would know at the office if Monsieur le Baron desires me to inquire Yes do I fancy I have seen him before Find out for me who he is Philippe disappeared like a fleet shadow After an absence of about two minutes he came back with the desired intelligence No Monsieur le Baron the gentleman is not a guest he announced But he is visiting a guest The name is Yard He arrived about a quarter of an hour ago and sent his card in to Captain Maltravers who at once took him up to his room Captain Maltravers So That will be the military officer from India will it not Yes Monsieur the one with the fair hair and moustache who lunched to day at the table adjoining Monsieur le Baron s own Ah to be sure And passed the time of day with me as they say in this peculiar language I remember the gentleman perfectly Thank you very much There s something to pay you for your trouble Monsieur le Baron is too generous Is there any other service No no nothing thank you I have all that I require interposed the Baron with a gesture of dismissal And evidently he had for five minutes later he walked into the office of the hotel and said to the clerk Make out my bill please I shall be leaving England at once and immediately thereafter walked into a telephone booth consulted his notebook and rang up two hundred fifty three thousand four hundred eighty Soho and on getting it began to talk rapidly and softly to some one who understood French Meantime mister Narkom unaware of the little powder train he had unconsciously lighted had gone on up the stairs with his two companions purposely avoiding the lift that he might explain matters as they went piloted them safely to the suite occupied by Captain Maltravers and at the precise moment when Baron Rodolf de Montravanne walked into the telephone booth Cleek was meeting Miss Larue for the first time since those distressing days of eleven months ago and meeting mister Harrison Trent for the first time ever Chapter XXXV Cleek found young Trent an extremely handsome man of about three and thirty of a highly strung nervous temperament and with an irritating habit of running his fingers through his hair when excited Also it seemed impossible for him to sit still for half a minute at a stretch he must be constantly hopping up only to sit down again and moving restlessly about as if he were doing his best to retain his composure and found it difficult with Cleek s calm eyes fixed constantly upon him I want to tell you something about that bloodstained sponge business mister Cleek he said in his abrupt jerky uneasy manner I never heard a word about it until last night when Miss Larue confessed her former suspicions of my dear old dad and gave me all the details of the matter That sponge had nothing to do with the affair at all It was I that tucked it under the staircase where it was found and I did so on the day before James Colliver s disappearance The blood that had been on it was mine not his I see said Cleek serenely The explanation of course is the good old tried and true refuge of the story writers namely a case of nose bleeding is it not Yes admitted Trent But with this difference mine wasn t an accidental affair at all it was the result of getting a jolly good hiding and I made an excuse to get away and hop out of town so that the dad wouldn t know about it nor see how I d been battered The fact is I met one of our carmen in the upper hall He was as drunk as a lord and when I took him to task about it and threatened him with discharge he said something to me that I thought needed a jolly sight more than words by way of chastisement so I nipped off my coat and sailed into him It turned out that he was the better man and gave me all that I d asked for in less than a minute s time so I shook hands with him told him to bundle off home and sleep himself sober and that if he wouldn t say anything about the matter I wouldn t either and he could turn up for work in the morning as usual Then I washed up shoved the sponge under the staircase and nipped off out of town because you know it would make a deuced bad impression if any of the other workmen should find out that a member of the firm had been thrashed by one of the employees and Draycott had done me up so beautifully that I was a sight for the gods The thing had been so frankly confessed that in spite of the fact of having in the beginning been rather repelled by him Cleek could not but experience a feeling of liking for the man So that s how it happened is it he said with a laugh It is a brave man mister Trent that will resist the opportunity to make himself a hero in the presence of the lady he loves and I hope I may be permitted to congratulate Miss Larue on the wisdom of her choice But now if you please let us get down at once to the details of the melancholy business we have in hand mister Narkom has been telling me the amazing story of the boy s visit to the building and of his strange disappearance therein but I should like to have a few further facts if you will be so kind What took the boy to the building in the first place I am told he went there upon your invitation but I confess that that seems rather odd to me Why should a man of business want a boy to visit him during business hours Good Lord man I couldn t have let him see what he wanted to see if he didn t come during business hours could I But that s rather ambiguous so I ll make haste to put it plainer Young Stan his Christian name is Stanley as I suppose you know young Stan is mad to learn the business of theatrical property making and particularly that of the manufacture of those wax effigies et cetera which we supply for the use of drapers in their show windows and as he is now sixteen and of an age to begin thinking of some trade or profession for the future I thought it would save Miss Larue putting up a jolly big premium to have him taught outside if we took him into our business free so I invited him to come and look round and see if he thought he d like it when he came to look into the messy details Well he came rather late yesterday afternoon and I d taken him round for just about ten or a dozen minutes when word was suddenly brought to me that the representative of one of the biggest managers in the country had just called with reference to an important order so of course I put back to the office as quickly as I could foot it young Stan quite naturally following me as he didn t know his way about the place alone and being a modest retiring sort of boy didn t like facing the possibility of blundering into what might prove to be private quarters and things of that sort He said as much to me at the time Well when I got back to the office I soon found that the business with my visitor was a matter that would take some time to settle you can t give a man an estimate all on a jump and without doing a bit of figuring you know so I told young Stan that he might cut off and go over the place on his own if he liked as it had been arranged that when knocking off time came I was to go back with him to Miss Larue s flat where we all were to have supper together When I told him that he asked eagerly if he might go up to the wax figure department as he was particularly anxious to see Loti at work and so Loti Cleek flung in the word so sharply that Trent gave a nervous start Just a moment please before you go any further mister Trent Sorry to interrupt but tell me please is the man who models your show window effigies named Loti then Is eh Hum m Any connection by chance with that once famous Italian worker in wax Giuseppe Loti chap that used to make those splendid wax tableaux for the Eden Musee in Paris some eighteen or twenty years ago Same chap Went all to pieces all of a sudden clear off his head for a time I ve heard in the very height of his career because his wife left him Handsome French woman years younger than he ran off with another chap and took every blessed thing of value she could lay her hands upon when but maybe you ve heard the story I have said Cleek It is one that is all too common on the Continent Also it happened that I was in Paris at the time of the occurrence And so you have that great Giuseppe Loti at the head of your waxwork department eh What a come down in the world for him Poor devil I thought he was dead ages ago He dropped out suddenly and disappeared from France entirely after that affair with his unfaithful wife The rumour was that he had committed suicide although that seemed as improbable as it now turns out to be in the face of the fact that on the night after his wife left him he turned up at the Cafe Royal and publicly No matter Go on with the case please What about the boy Let s see now where was I said Trent knotting up his brow Oh ah I recollect just where he asked me if he could go up and see Loti at work Of course I said that he could there wasn t any reason why I shouldn t as the place is open to inspection always so I opened the door and showed him the way to the staircase leading up to the glass room and then went to the speaking tube and called up to Loti to expect him and to treat him nicely as he was the nephew of the great Miss Larue and would in time be mine also Was there any necessity for taking that precaution mister Trent Yes Loti has developed a dashed bad temper since last autumn and is very eccentric very irritable not a bit like the solemn sedate old johnnie he used to be Even his work has deteriorated I think but one daren t criticise it or he flies into a temper and threatens to leave And you don t wish him to of course his name must stand for something It stands for a great deal It s one of our biggest cards We can command twice as much for a Loti figure as for one made by any other waxworker So we humour him in his little eccentricities and defer to him a great deal Also as he prefers to live on the premises he saves us money in other ways Serves for a watchman as well you understand Oh he lives on the premises does he Where In the glass room Oh no that would not be possible The character as well as the position of that renders it impossible as a place of habitation He uses it after hours as a sort of sitting room to be sure and has partly fitted it up as one but he sleeps eats and dresses in a room on the floor below Not an adjoining one Oh no an adjoining room would be an impossibility Our building is an end one standing on the corner of a short passage which leads to nothing but a narrow alley running along parallel with the back of our premises and the glass room covers nearly the entire roof of it As a matter of fact mister Cleek although we call it that at the works the term Glass Room is a misnomer In reality it s nothing more nor less than a good sized lean to greenhouse that the dad bought and had taken up there in sections and its rear elevation rests against the side wall of a still higher building than ours next door the premises of Storminger the carriage builder to be exact But look here perhaps I can make the situation clearer by a rough sketch Got a lead pencil and a bit of paper anybody Oh thanks very much dear One can always rely upon you Now look here mister Cleek this is the way of it You mustn t mind if it s a crude thing because you know I m a rotten bad draughtsman and can t draw for nuts But all the same this will do at a pinch Here he leaned over the table in the centre of the room and taking the pencil and the blank back of the letter which Miss Larue had supplied made a crude outline sketch thus Illustration of a group of houses There you are he said suddenly laying the crude drawing on the table before Cleek and with him bending over it You are supposed to be looking at the houses from the main thoroughfare don t you know and therefore at the front of them This tall building on the left marked one is Storminger s the low one number two adjoining is ours and that cagelike looking thing three on the top of it is the glass room Now along the front of it here where I have put the long line with an X on the end there runs a wooden partition with a door leading into the room itself so that it s impossible for anybody on the opposite side of the main thoroughfare to see into the place at all But that is not the case with regard to people living on the opposite side of the short passage this is here that I ve marked four because there s nothing to obstruct the view but some rubbishy old lace curtains which Loti in his endeavour to make the place what he calls homelike would insist upon hanging and they are so blessed thin that anybody can look right through them and see all over the place Of course though there are blinds which he can pull down on the inside if the sun gets too strong and when they are down nobody can see into the glass room at all Pardon Oh we had it constructed of glass mister Narkom because of the necessity for having all the light obtainable in doing the minute work on some of the fine tableaux we produce for execution purposes We are doing one now The Relief of Lucknow for the big exhibition that s to be given next month at Olympia and The place marked six at the back of our building Oh that s the narrow alley of which I spoke We ve a back door opening into it but it s practically useless because the alley is so narrow one can t drive a vehicle through it It s simply a right of way that can t legally be closed and runs from Croom Street on the right just along as far as Sturgiss Lane on the left Not fifty people pass through it in a day s time But to come back to the short passage mister Cleek Observe there are no windows at all on the side of our building here Number two There were once upon a time but we had them bricked up as we use that side for a paint frame with a movable bridge so that it can be used for the purpose of painting scenery and drop curtains But there are windows in the side of the house marked five and directly opposite the point where I ve put the arrow there is one which belongs to a room occupied by a missus Sherman and her daughter people who do bushel work for wholesale costume houses Now it happens that at the exact time when the porter says he showed young Stan into the glass room those two women were sitting at work by that window and the blinds not being drawn could see smack into the place and are willing to take their oath that there was no living soul in it How do they fix it as being as you say the exact time mister Trent If they couldn t see the porter come up to the glass room with the boy how can they be sure of that Oh that s easily explained There s a church not a great way distant It has a clock in the steeple which strikes the hours halves and quarters missus Sherman says that when it chimed half past four she was not only looking into the glass room but was calling her daughter s attention to the fact that whereas some few minutes previously she had seen Loti go out of the place leaving a great pile of reference plates and scraps of material all over the floor and he had never to her positive knowledge come back into it there was the room looking as tidy as possible and in the middle of it a table with a vase of pink roses upon it which she certainly had not seen there when he left Hallo Hallo interjected Cleek rather sharply Let s have that again please and he sat listening intently while Trent repeated the statement then of a sudden he gave his head an upward twitch slapped his thigh and leaning back in his seat added with a brief little laugh Well of all the blithering idiots And a simple little thing like that Like what mister Cleek queried Trent in amazement You don t surely mean to say that you can make anything important out of a table and a vase of flowers Because I may tell you that Loti is mad on flowers and always has a vase of them in the room somewhere Does he indeed Natural inclination of the artistic temperament I dare say But never mind get on with the story missus Sherman fixes the hour when she noticed this as half past four you say How then does the porter who showed the boy into the glass room fix it may I ask By the same means precisely the striking of the church clock He remembers hearing it just as he reached the partition door and was indeed at particular pains to take out his watch to see if it tallied with it Also three of our scene painters were passing along the hall at the foot of the short flight of steps leading up to the glass room at the time They were going out to tea and one of them sang out to him laughingly Hallo Ginger how does that two shilling turnip of yours make it Time for tea at Buckingham Palace for he had won the watch at a singing contest only the night before and his mates had been chaffing him about it all day In that manner the exact time of his going to the door with the boy is fixed and with three persons to corroborate it A second later the porter saw the boy push open the swing door and walk into the place and as he turned and went back downstairs he distinctly heard him say Good afternoon sir mister Trent said I might come up and watch if you don t mind Did he hear anybody reply No he did not He heard no one speak but the boy I see So then there is no actual proof that Loti was in there at the time which of course makes the testimony of missus Sherman and her daughter appear reliable when they say that the room was empty Still the boy was there if Loti wasn t mister Cleek There s proof enough that he did go into the place even though those two women declare that the room was empty Quite so quite so And when two and two don t make four there s something rotten in the state of Denmark What does Loti himself say with regard to the circumstance Or hasn t he been spoken to about it My hat yes I went to him about it the very first thing He says the boy never put in an appearance to his knowledge that he never saw him In fact that just before half past four he was taken with a violent attack of sick headache the result of the fumes rising from the wax he was melting to model figures for the tableau together with the smell of the chemicals used in preparing the background and that he went down to his room to lie down for a time and dropped off to sleep As a matter of fact he was there in his room sleeping when at half past six I went for the boy and finding the glass room vacated naturally set out to hunt up Loti and question him about the matter When you called up to the glass room through the speaking tube to say that the boy was about to go up who answered you Loti Yes At what time was that Or can t you say positively Not to the fraction of a moment But I should say that it was about four or five minutes before the boy got there say about five and twenty minutes past four It wouldn t take him longer to get up to the top of the house I fancy and he certainly did not stop at any of the other departments on the way Queer isn t it that the man should not have stopped to so much as welcome the boy after you had been at such pains to tell him to be nice to him Does he offer any explanation on that score Yes He says that as his head was so bad he knew that he would probably be cross and crotchety so as I had asked him to be kind he thought the best thing he could do was to leave a note on the table for the boy telling him to make himself at home and to examine anything he pleased but to be sure not to touch the cauldron in which the wax was simmering as it tilted readily and he might get scalded He was sorry to have to go but his head ached so badly that he really had to lie down for a while That note I may tell you was lying on the table when I went up to the glass room and failed to find the boy It was that which told me where to go in order to find Loti and question him I ll do him the credit of stating that when he heard of the boy s mysterious disappearance he flung his headache and his creature comforts to the winds and joined in the eager hunt for him as excitedly and as strenuously as anybody He went through the building from top to bottom he lifted every trapdoor crept into every nook and corner and hole and box into which it might be possible for the poor little chap to have fallen But it was all useless mister Cleek every bit of it The boy had vanished utterly and completely from the minute the porter saw him pass the swing door and go into the glass room we never discovered even the slightest trace of him nor have we been able to do so since He has gone he has vanished as completely as if he had melted into thin air and if there is any ghost of a clue to his whereabouts existing Let us go and see if we can unearth it interrupted Cleek rising mister Narkom is the limousine within easy reach Yes waiting in Tavistock Street dear chap I told Lennard to be on the lookout for us Good Then if Miss Larue will allow mister Trent to escort her as far as the pavement and he will then go on alone to his place of business and await us there you and I will leave the hotel by the back way and join him as soon as possible Leave by the front entrance if you be so kind and pardon one last word mister Trent before you go At the time when this boy s father vanished in much the same way eleven months ago you had I believe a door porter at your establishment name Felix Murchison Is that man still in your employ No mister Cleek He left about a week or so after James Colliver s disappearance Know where he is Not the slightest idea As a matter of fact he suddenly inherited some money and said he was going to emigrate to America But I don t know if he did or not Why Oh nothing in particular only that I shouldn t be surprised if the person who supplied that money was the pawnbroker who received in pledge the jewels which your father handed over to James Colliver and that the sum which Felix Murchison inherited so suddenly was the Lone hundred fifty advanced upon those gems How utterly absurd My dear mister Cleek you must surely remember that the pawnbroker said the chap who pawned the jewels was a gentlemanly appearing person of good manners and speech and Murchison is the last man in the world to answer to that description A great hulking bull necked illiterate animal of that sort without an H in his vocabulary and with no more manners than a pig Precisely why I feel so certain now that the pawnbroker s advance was paid over to him said Cleek with a twitch of the shoulder Live and learn my friend live and learn Eleven months ago I couldn t for the life of me understand why those jewels had been pawned at all to day I realize that it was the only possible course Miss Larue my compliments Au revoir And he bowed her out of the room with the grace of a courtier standing well out of sight from the hallway until the door had closed behind her and her companion and he was again alone with the superintendent Now for it as they used to say in the old melodramas he laughed stepping sharply to a wardrobe and producing first a broad brimmed cavalry hat which he immediately put on and then a pair of bright steel handcuffs We may have use for this very effective type of wristlets mister Narkom so it s well to go prepared for emergencies Now then off with you while I lock the door That s the way to the staircase Nip down it to the American bar There s a passage from that leading out to the Embankment Gardens A taxi from there will whisk us along Savoy Street across the Strand and up Wellington Street to Tavistock in less than no time so we may look to be with Lennard inside of another ten minutes Righto gave back the superintendent And I can get rid of this dashed rig as soon as we re in the limousine But I say any ideas old chap eh Yes two or three One of them is that this is going to be one of the simplest cases I ever tackled Lay you a sovereign to a sixpence mister Narkom that I solve the riddle of that glass room before they ring up the curtain of any theatre in London to night What s that Lying No certainly not There s been no lying in the matter at all it isn t a case of that sort The pawnbroker did not lie the porter who says he showed the boy into the room did not lie and the two women who looked into it and saw nothing but an empty room did not lie either The only thing that did lie was a vase of pink roses a bunch of natural Ananiases that tried to make people believe that they had been blooming and keeping fresh ever since last August Good Lord you don t surely think that that Loti chap Gently gently my friend don t let yourself get excited Besides I may be all at sea for all my cocksureness I don t think I am but one never knows I ll tell you one thing however The man with whom Madame Loti eloped had for the purpose of carrying on the intrigue enlisted as a student under her husband and gulled the poor fool by pretending that he wished to learn waxwork making when his one desire was to make love to the man s worthless wife When they eloped and Loti knew for the first time what a dupe he had been he publicly swore in the open room of the Cafe Royal that he would never rest until he had run that man down and had exterminated him and every living creature in whose veins his blood flowed The man was an English actor mister Narkom He posed under the nom de theatre of Jason Monteith his real name was James Colliver Step livelier please we re dawdling CHAPTER XXXVI They that climb the highest have the farthest to fall It was after five o clock when the limousine arrived at the premises of Trent Son and Cleek guided by the junior member of the firm and accompanied by Superintendent Narkom climbed the steep stairs to the housetop and was shown into the glass room His first impression as the door swung inward was of a scent of flowers so heavy as to be oppressive his second of entering into a light so brilliant that it seemed a very glare of gold for the low dropped sun which yellowed all the sky flooded the place with a radiance which made him blink and it was some little time before his eyes could accustom themselves to it sufficient to let him discover that the old Italian waxworker was there busy on his latest tableau Cleek blinked and looked at the old man serenely at first then blinked and looked again conscious of an overwhelming sense of amazement and defeat for just one fraction of a minute and that some of his cocksure theories regarding the case had suddenly been knocked into a cocked hat No wonder mister Harrison Trent had spoken of deterioration in the art of this once celebrated modeller No wonder The man was not Giuseppe Loti at all not that world famed worker in wax who had sworn in those bitter other days to have the life of the vanished James Colliver CHAPTER XXXVII Cleek s equanimity did not desert him however It was one of his strong points that he always kept his mental balance even when his most promising theories were deracinated He therefore showed not the slightest trace of the disappointment with which this utterly unexpected discovery had filled him but with the most placid exterior imaginable suffered himself to be introduced to the old waxworker who was at the time working assiduously upon the huge tableau piece designed for the forthcoming Indian Exhibition a well executed assembly of figures which occupied a considerable portion of the rear end of the glass room and represented that moment when the relief force burst through the stockade at Lucknow and came to the rescue of the beleaguered garrison A couple of gentlemen from Scotland Yard Loti who have come to look into the matter of young Colliver s disappearance was the way in which Trent made that introduction You can go on with your work they won t interfere with you Welcome gentlemen most welcome said Loti with that courtesy which Continental people never quite forget then nodded and went on with his work as he had been told adding with a mournful shake of the head Ah a strange business that signori an exceedingly strange business Very agreed Cleek off handedly and from the other end of the room Rippin quarters these signor and now that I ve seen em I don t mind confessing that my pet theory has gone all to smash and I m up a gum tree so to speak I d an idea you know that there might be a sliding panel or a trapdoor which you chaps here might have overlooked and down which the boy might have dropped or maybe gone on a little explorin expedition of his own don t you know and hadn t been able to get back Well of all the idiotic ideas began Trent but was suffered to get no further Yes isn t it agreed Cleek with his best blithering idiot air I realize that now that I see your floor s of concrete Necessary I suppose on account of the chemicals and the inflammable nature of the wax You could have a rippin old flare up here if that stuff was to catch fire from a dropped match or anything of that sort eh what Blest if I can see turning slowly on his heel and looking all round the room a ghost of a place where the young nipper could have got It s a facer for me But I say as if suddenly struck with an idea you don t think that he nipped something valuable and cut off with it do you Didn t miss any money or anything of that sort which you d left lying about did you mister er Lotus eh Loti if you please signor I had indeed hoped that my name was well known enough to Pouffe No I miss nothing I miss not so much as a pin I am told he shall not have been that kind of a boy And then with a shake of the head and a pitying glance toward the author of these two asinine theories regarding the strange disappearance returned to his work of putting the finishing touches to a recumbent figure representing a dead soldier lying in the foreground of the tableau Oh well you never can tell what boys will do and it s an old saying that a good booty makes many a thief replied Cleek airily Reckon I ll have to hunt up something a bit more promising then Don t mind my poking about a bit do you Not in the slightest signor replied the Italian and glanced sympathizingly up at Trent and gave his shoulders a significant shrug as if to say Is this the best that Scotland Yard can turn out when Cleek began turning over costume plates and looking under books and scraps of material which lay scattered about the floor and even took to examining the jugs and vases and tumblers in which the signor s bunches of cut flowers were placed There were many of them on tables and chairs and shelves and even on the platform of the tableau itself so many in fact that he was minded by their profusion of what Trent had said regarding the old waxworker s great love of flowers He looked round the room in an apparently perfunctory manner but in reality with a photographic eye for its every detail finding that it agreed in every particular with the description which Trent had given him There were the cheap lace curtains all along the glazed side which overlooked the short passage leading down to the narrow alley but they were of so thin a quality and so scantily patterned that the mesh did not obstruct the view in any manner merely rendering it a trifle hazy for he could himself see from where he stood the window in the side of the house opposite and seated at that window missus Sherman and her daughter busy at their endless sewing And there too were the blinds strong blue linen ones running on rings and cords with which as he had been told it was possible to arrange the light as occasion required They were fashioned somewhat after the manner of those seen in the studios of photographers several sectional ones overhead and one long one for that side of the room which overlooked the short passage and as showing how minute was Cleek s inspection for all its seeming indifference it may be remarked that he observed a peculiarity regarding that long blind which not one person in a hundred would have noticed That is to say that whereas when one looks at a window from the interior of a room one invariably finds that the blinds are against the glass and that the curtains are so hung as to be behind them when viewed from the street here was a case of the exactly opposite arrangement being put into force to wit It was the lace curtains which hung against the window panes and the big blind which was next the room so that if pulled down a person standing within would see no lace curtains at all while at the same time they would remain distinctly visible to anybody standing without If this small discrepancy called for any comment Cleek made none audibly merely glanced at the blind and glanced away again and went on examining the books and the vases of flowers and continued his apparently aimless wandering about the room Of a sudden however he did a singular thing one which was fraught with much significance to mister Narkom who knew the signs so well His wandering had brought him within touching distance of the busy waxworker who just at that moment half turned and stretched forth his hand to pick up a tool which had fallen to the floor the act of recovering which sent his wrist protruding a bit beyond the cuff of his working blouse What Narkom saw was the quick twitch of Cleek s eye in the direction of that hand then its swift travelling to the man s face and travelling off again to other things and he knew what was coming when his great ally began to pat his pockets and rummage about his person as if endeavouring to find something My luck said Cleek with an impatient jerk of the head Not a blessed cigarette with me mister Narkom and you know what a duffer I am if I can t smoke when I m trying to think I say nip out will you and get me a packet There scribbling something on a leaf from his notebook and pushing it into the superintendent s hand that s the brand I like It s no use bringing me any other Look em up for me will you There s a good friend Narkom made no reply but merely left the room with the paper crumpled in his shut hand and went downstairs as fast as he could travel What he did in the interval is a matter for further consideration At present it need only be said that had any one looked across the short passage some eight or ten minutes after his departure Narkom might have been seen standing in the background of the room at whose window missus Sherman and her daughter still sat sewing Meanwhile Cleek appeared to have forgotten all about the matter which was the prime reason for his presence in the place and to have become absorbingly interested in the business of tableau making for he plied the old Italian with endless questions relative to the one he was engaged in constructing Jip You don t mean to tell me that you make the whole blessed thing yourself do you model the figures group em paint the blessed background and all said he with yokel like amazement You do My hat but you re a wonder That background s one of the best I ve ever clapped eyes on And the figures I could swear that that fellow bursting in with a sword in his hand was alive if I didn t know better and as for this dead johnnie here in the foreground that you re working on he s a marvel What do you stuff the blessed things with Or don t you stuff em at all Oh yes signor they are stuffed all of them There is a wicker framework covered with canvas and inside cotton waste old paper straw You don t mean it Well I m blest Nothing but waste stuff and straw Why that fellow over there the Sepoy chap with the gun in his hands Oh good Lord just my blessed luck I hope to heaven I haven t spoilt anything For in leaning over to indicate the figure alluded to he had blundered against the edge of the low platform lost his balance and sprawled over so awkwardly and abruptly that but for the fact that the figure of the dead soldier was there for his hand to fall upon in time to check it he must have pitched headlong into the very heart of the tableau and done no end of damage Fortunately however not a figure had been thrown down and even the dead soldier had stood the shock uncommonly well not even a dent showing though Cleek had come down rather heavily and his palm had struck smack on the figure s chest Tut tut tut tut exclaimed the Italian with angry impatience Oh do have a little care signor The bull in a china shop is alone like this And he turned his back upon this stupid blunderer even though Cleek was profuse in his apologies and looked as sorry as he declared After a time however he went off on another tack for his quick travelling glance had shown him mister Narkom in the house across the passage and he turned on his heel and walked away rapidly Tell you what it is it s this blessed glare of light that s accountable he said A body s likely to stumble over anything with the light streaming into the place in this fashion What you want in here is a bit of shade like this Here he crossed the room hastily and reaching up pulled down the long window blind with a sudden jerk But before either Trent or the Italian could offer any objection to this interference with the conditions under which the waxworker chose to conduct his labours he seemed himself to realize that the proceeding did not mend matters and releasing his hold upon the blind let the spring of the roller carry it up again to its original position As he did this he said with a peculiarly asinine air That s a bit worse than the other by Jip Makes the blessed place too dashed dark altogether so it s not the light that s to blame after all I should have thought even a fool might have known that gave back the waxworker almost savagely The light is poor enough as it is Look for yourself It is only the afterglow and even that is already declining Pouffe And here as if in disgust too great for words he blew the breath from his lips with a sharp short gust and facing about again went back to his work on the tableau Cleek made no response nor yet did Trent By this time even he had begun to think that accident more than brains must have been at the bottom of the man s many successes that he was in reality nothing more than a blundering muddler and after another ten minutes of putting up with his crazy methods had just made up his mind to appeal to Narkom for the aid of another detective when the end which was all along being prepared came with such a rush that it fairly made his head swim All that he was ever able clearly to recall of it was that there came a sudden sound of clattering footsteps rushing pell mell up the staircase that the partition door was flung open abruptly to admit mister Maverick Narkom with three or four of the firm s employees pressing close upon his heels that the superintendent had but just cried out excitedly Yes man yes when there arose a wild clatter of falling figures a snarl a scuffle a cry and that when he faced round in the direction of it there was the Lucknow tableau piled up in a heap of fallen scenery and smashed waxworks and in the middle of the ruin there was the signor lying on his back with a band of steel upon each wrist and over him Cleek with a knee on the man s chest and the look of a fury in his eyes crying aloud Come out of it Come out of it you brute beast Your little dodge has failed And hard on the heels of that shock mister Trent received another For of a sudden he saw Cleek pluck a wig from the man s head and leave a white line showing above the place where the joining paste once had met the grease paint with which the fellow s face was coloured and heard him say as he tossed that wig toward him and rose Out of your own stage properties mister Trent borrowed to be returned like this Heaven above man said Trent in utter bewilderment what s the meaning of it all Who is that man then since it s clear he s not Loti A very excellent actor in his day mister Trent his name is James Colliver replied Cleek I came to this place fully convinced that Loti had murdered him I now know that he murdered Loti and that to that crime he has added a yet more abominable one by killing his own son It s a lie It s a lie I didn t I didn t I never saw the boy screeched out Colliver in a very panic of terror I ve never killed any one Loti sold out to me Loti went back to France I pawned the jewels to get the money to pay him to go Oh no you didn t my friend said Cleek You performed that operation to shut Felix Murchison s mouth the one man who could swear and did swear that James Colliver never left this building on the day of his disappearance and who probably would have said more if you hadn t made it worth his while to shut his mouth and to disappear You and I know my friend that Loti was the last man on this earth with whom you could come to terms upon anything He had publicly declared that he would have your life and he d have kept his word if you hadn t turned the tables and killed him You stole his wife and you were never even man enough to marry her even though she had borne you a son and clung to you to the end poor wretch You killed Loti and you killed your own son No doubt he is better off poor little chap to be dead and gone rather than to live with the shadow of illegitimacy upon him and no doubt either that when he came up here yesterday to meet Giuseppe Loti he saw what I saw to day and knew you as I knew you then the scar on the wrist which was one of the marks of identification given me at the time I was sent to hunt you up And you killed him to shut his mouth I didn t I didn t he protested wildly I never saw him He wasn t here The women in the house across the way will swear that they saw the empty room Not now declared Cleek with emphasis I ve convinced them to the contrary mister Trent let a couple of your men come over here and take charge of this fellow please and I will convince you as well That s right my lads Lay hold of the beggar and don t let him get a chance to make a dash for the stairs Got him fast have you Good Now then mister James Colliver this is what those deluded women saw this little dodge which is going to help Jack Ketch to come into his own Speaking he walked rapidly across to the long blind pulled it down to its full length then with a wrench tore it wholly from the roller and whirled it over so that they who were within could now see the outer side It bore painted upon it a perfect representation of the interior of the glass room even to the little spindle legged table with a vase of pink roses upon it which now stood at that room s far end A clever idea Colliver and a good piece of painting he said It took me in once last August just as it took in missus Sherman and her daughter yesterday The mistiness of the lace curtains falling over it lent just the effect of distance that was required to perfect the illusion and to prevent anybody from detecting the paint As for the boy Gently lads gently Don t let the beggar in his struggles make you step on that dead soldier Under the thick coating of wax a human body lies the boy s Hullo Gone off his balance eh at the knowledge that the game is entirely up This as Colliver with a terrible cry collapsed suddenly and fell to the floor shrieking and grovelling They are a cowardly lot these brute beast men when it comes to the wall and the final corner mister Trent break this to Miss Larue as gently as you can She has suffered a great deal poor girl and it is bound to be a shock She doesn t know that the woman he called his wife never really was his wife she doesn t know about Loti or his threat If she had she d have told me and I might have got on the trail in the first case instead of waiting to pick it up like this He paused and held up his hand Through all this Colliver had not once ceased grovelling and screaming but it was not his cries that had drawn that gesture from Cleek It was the sound of some one racing at top speed up the outer stairs and with it the jar of many excited voices mingled in a babble of utter confusion The door of the glass room swung inward abruptly and the head bookkeeper looked in with a crowd of clerks behind him mister Trent sir whatever is the matter Is anybody hurt I never heard such screams The whole place is ringing with them and there s a crowd gathering about the door Cleek left the junior partner to explain the situation stepped to the side of the glass room looked down saw that the statement was quite true and stepped sharply back again We shall have to defer removing our prisoner until it gets dark I fancy mister Narkom he said serenely And with mister Trent s permission we will make use of the door leading into the alley at the back when that time comes Bookkeeper Yes sir You might explain to the constable on duty in the neighbourhood if he comes to inquire that is the cause of the disturbance and that Scotland Yard is in charge and Superintendent Narkom already on the premises That s all thank you You may close the door and take your colleagues below Hullo our prisoner seems to be subsiding into something akin to gibbering idiocy mister Trent Fright has turned his brain apparently Let us make use of the respite from his shrieks You will of course wish to hear how I got on the track of the man and what were the clues which led up to the solving of the affair Well you shall Sit down and while we are waiting for the darkness to come I ll give you the complete explanation CHAPTER XXXVIII Colliver who had now sunk into a state of babbling incoherence lay on his face in the wreck of the tableau rolling his head from side to side and clasping and unclasping his manacled hands Trent turned his back upon the unpleasant sight and placing three chairs at the opposite end of the room dropped into one and lifted an eager countenance to Cleek Tell me first of all he asked how under heaven you came to suspect how the disappearance of the boy was managed It seems like magic to me When in the world did you get the first clue to it mister Cleek Never until I heard of those two women looking into this room and seeing the vase of pink roses standing on a spindle legged table in the centre of it he replied You see even in the old days when I had the other case in hand and was searching for a clue to Colliver s disappearance never had any one mentioned the name of Loti to me I knew of course that you made wax figures here but I never heard until this afternoon that Loti was the man who was employed to model them I also knew about the existence of the glass room and its position for I had been at the pains of inspecting it from the outside That came about in this way Just before Miss Larue closed up the case of James Colliver I had obtained the first actual clue to his movements after he left mister Trent senior and came out of the office That clue came from the door porter Felix Murchison What careful pumping got out of him was that when James Colliver left the office he had asked him Murchison which was the way to the place where they made the waxworks as he d heard that they were making a head of Miss Larue to be used in the execution scene of Catharine Howard and he d like to have a look at it Murchison said that he told him the figures were made in a glass room on the top of the house and directed him how to reach it He went up the stairs and that was the last that was seen of him Naturally when I heard that I thought I d like to see the exterior of the building to ascertain if there was any opening door or window by which he could have left the upper floor without coming down the main staircase That led me to beg permission of the people in the house across the passage there to look from one of the side windows and so gave me my first view of the glass room What I saw was exactly what missus Sherman and her daughter saw yesterday namely that spick and span room with the table in the centre and the vase of pink roses standing on it Need I go further than to say that when I heard of those women seeing a room that was badly littered a few minutes before suddenly become a tidy one with a table and a vase of roses standing in the middle of it without anybody having come into the place for the purpose of making the change I instantly remembered my own experience and suspected a painted blind When I entered this room to day and saw the peculiar position of that blind I became almost certain I had hit upon the truth and sent mister Narkom to the house across the way to test it That s why I pulled the blind down Why I stumbled and nearly fell into the tableau was because I had a faint suspicion of the horrible truth when I noticed how abominably thick the neck hands and ankles of that dead soldier were and I wanted to test the truth or falseness of the straw stuffing assertion by actual touch particularly as I felt sure that the presence of all these strongly scented flowers was for the purpose of covering less agreeable odours should the heat of the weather cause decomposition to set in before he could dispose of the body I don t think he ever was mad enough to intend letting the thing remain a part of the tableau I fancy he would have found an excuse to get it out somehow and to make away with it entirely as no doubt he did with the body of Loti What s that mister Narkom No I don t think that Murchison had any actual hand in the crime or really knew the identity of the man I fancy he must have gone up to tell the fictitious Loti that he knew James Colliver had entered that glass room and never come out of it and Colliver of course had to shut his mouth by buying him off and sending him out of the country That is why he took yet another disguise and pawned the jewels He had to get the money some way As for the rest I imagine that when Colliver went up to the room to see that wax head and Loti caught sight of him the old Italian jumped on him like a mad tiger and seeing that it was Loti s life or his own Colliver throttled him When that was done the necessity for disposing of the body arose and the imposture was the actual outcome of a desire to save his own neck That s all I think mister Narkom so you may revise your notes and mark down the Colliver case as solved at last and the mystery of it cleared up after all Three hours of patient waiting had passed and gone The darkness had fallen the streets were still save for the faint hum of life coming from districts afar and the time for action had come at last Cleek rose and put on his hat I think we may safely venture to remove our prisoner now mister Narkom he said and if you will slip out the back way and get Lennard to bring the limousine around to the head of that narrow alley They re there already dear chap I stationed Lennard there when I went across to look into that business about the painted blind It seemed the least conspicuous place for him to wait Excellent Then if you will run on ahead and have the door of it open for me and everything ready so that we may whisk him in and be off like a shot and mister Trent will let one of these good chaps here run down to the man s room and fetch him a hat I ll attend to his removal Here s one here sir that ll do at a pinch and save time suggested one of the men picking up a cavalryman s hat from the wreck of the ruined tableau and dusting it by slapping it against his thigh I don t think he ll resist much sir he seems to have gone clear off his biscuit and not to know enough for that but if you d like me and my mate to lend a hand No thanks I shall be able to manage him myself I fancy said Cleek serenely Get him on his feet please That s the business Now then mister Narkom nip off I m following mister Narkom nipped off without an instant s delay and two minutes later saw him slipping out through the rear door of the building with Cleek and the jabbering unresisting prisoner at the bottom of the last flight of stairs not twenty yards behind But the passage of the next half minute saw something of more moment still for as Narkom ran on tiptoe up the dim alley to the waiting limousine standing at its western end and unlatching the vehicle s door swung it open to be ready for Cleek out of the stillness there roared suddenly the shrill note of a dog whistle and all in a moment there was mischief A crowd of quick moving Apache figures sprang up from sheltering doors and scudding past him headed full tilt down the narrow alley calling out as they ran that piercing La la loi which is the war cry of their kind A blind rage all the more maddening in that it was impotent since he had neither weapon to defend nor the power to slay swept down upon the superintendent as he realized the import of that mad rush and ducking down his head he bolted after them into the thick of them punching banging slogging shouting swearing an incarnate Passion the Epitome of Man s love for Man a little fat Fury that was all a whirl of flying fists as it swept onward and that seemed to go absolutely insane at what he looked up the alley and saw Get back Cleek Get back for God s sake he yelled in a very panic of fear and dismay then cleft his way with beating arms and kicking feet through the hampering crowd arrowed out of its midst and bore down upon the cavalry hatted figure that had stepped out of the dark doorway of Trent Son s building and was standing flattened against the rear wall of it He reached out his hand and made a blind clutch at it and while he was yet far out of reaching distance of it faced round and made a wild effort to cover it with his short fat body and his arms outflung like a crucifix and looked at the Apaches and swore without one thought of being profane Me you damned devils Me me not him Not him damn you damn you damn you he cried hoarse throated and said no more The scuttling crowd came up with him broke about him swept past him A loud explosion sounded a flare of light broke full against the cavalry hat a stifling odour of picric acid filled the air and gripped the throat and with its coming man and hat slid down the wall and dropped at its foot a crumpled heap that never in this world would stand erect again Killed Killed half cried half groaned the superintendent staggering a bit as the crowd flew on up the alley and vanished around the corner of the street into which it merged Oh my God After all my care after all my love for him Killed like a dog Oh Cleek Oh Cleek The dearest friend the finest pal the greatest detective genius of the age And then swinging his arm up and across his eyes and holding it there made a queer choking sound behind the sheltering crook of it But of a sudden a voice spoke up from the darkness of the open door near by and said quietly That s the finest compliment I ever had paid me in all my life mister Narkom Don t worry over me dear friend I m still able to sit up and take nourishment The Apaches have saved the public executioner a morning s work Colliver has parted with his brains forever and may God have mercy on his soul Cleek mister Narkom scarcely knew his own voice such a screaming thing it was Cleek dear chap is it you To be sure Come inside here if you doubt it Come quickly there s a crowd of quite a different sort coming the report of that bomb has aroused the neighbourhood and I have quite enough of crowds for one evening thank you Narkom was inside the building before you could have said Jack Robinson pump handling Cleek with all his might and generally deporting himself like a man gone daft I thought they d finished you I thought they d done you in It was the Apache you know and that infernal scoundrel Waldemar he must have found out somehow he said excitedly But we ve got it on him at last Cleek he s come within the law s reach after all To be sure but I doubt if the law will be able to find him mister Narkom He will have left the country before the trap was actually sprung believe me or failing that will be well on his way out of it But perhaps not absolutely out of it dear chap There are the ports you know and so long as he is on English soil Come and see Come and see We may be able to head him off Let s get out by way of the front of the building Cleek and if I can once get to the telegraph and wire to the coast and he hasn t yet sailed Come on come on Or no wait a moment That s a constable out there asking for information I ll nip out and let him know that the Yard s on the case and give him a few orders about reporting it Wait for me at the front door old chap With you in a winking He stepped out into the alley as he spoke and mingled with the gathering crowd But Cleek did not stir The alley was no longer dark for with the gathering of the crowd lights had come and he stood for many minutes staring into it and breathing hard and the colour draining slowly out of his face until it was like a thing of wax Outside in the narrow alley the gathering of curious ones which the sound of the explosion and the sight of a running policeman had drawn to the place was every moment thickening and with the latest addition to it there had come hurrying into the narrow space a morbid minded newsboy with the customary bulletin sheet pinned over his chest The Evening News Six o clock edition that bulletin was headed and under that heading there was set forth in big black type END OF THE MAURAVANIAN REVOLUTION FALL OF THE CAPITAL FLIGHT OF THE DEPOSED KING OVERWHELMING SUCCESS OF IRMA S TROOPS mister Narkom said Cleek when at the end of ten minutes the superintendent came bustling back hot and eager to begin the effort to head off Count Waldemar mister Narkom dear friend the days of trouble and distress are over and the good old times you have so often sighed for have come back Look at that newsboy s bulletin Waldemar is too late in all things and we have seen the last of him forever EPILOGUE The Affair of the Man Who Was Found mister Maverick Narkom glanced up at the calendar hanging on the office wall saw that it recorded the date as August eighteenth and then glanced back to the sheet of memoranda lying on his desk and forthwith began to scratch his bald spot perplexedly I wonder if I dare do it he queried of himself in the unspoken words of thought It seems such a pity when the beggar s wedding day is so blessed near and a man wants his last week of single blessedness all to himself by James if he can get it Still it s a case after his own heart the reward s big and would be a nice little nest egg to begin married life upon Besides he s had a fairly good rest as it is when I come to think of it Nothing much to do since the time when that Mauravanian business came to an end I fancy he rather looked to have something come out of that in the beginning from the frequent inquiries he made regarding what that johnnie Count Irma and the new Parliament were doing but it never did And now after all that rest and this a case of so much importance Gad I believe I ll risk it He can t do any more then decline Yes by James I will His indecision once conquered he took the plunge instantly caught up the desk telephone called for a number and two minutes later was talking to Cleek thus I say old chap don t snap my head off for suggesting such a thing at such a time but I ve a most extraordinary case on hand and I hope to heaven that you will help me out with it What s that Oh come now that s ripping of you old chap and I m as pleased as Punch What Oh get along with you No more than you d do for me under the same circumstances I ll be sworn Yes to day as early as possible Right you are Then could you manage to meet me in the bar parlour of a little inn called the French Horn out Shere way in Surrey about four o clock Could eh Good man Oh by the way come prepared to meet a lady of title old chap she s the client Thanks very much Good bye Then he hung up the receiver rang for Lennard and set about preparing for the journey forthwith And this if you please was how it came to pass that when mister Maverick Narkom turned up at the French Horn that afternoon he found a saddle horse tethered to a post outside and Cleek looking very much like one of the regular habitues of Rotten Row who had taken it into his mind to canter out into the country for a change standing in the bar parlour window and looking out with appreciative eyes upon the broad stretch of green downs that billowed away to meet the distant hills My dear chap how on earth do you manage it said the superintendent eying him with open approval not to say admiration I don t mean the mere putting on the clothes and looking the part I ve seen dozens in my time who could do that right enough but the beggars always fell down when it came to the acting and the talking while you I don t know what the dickens it is nor how you manage to get it but there s a certain something or other in your bearing your manner your look when you tackle this sort of thing that I always believed a man had to be born to and couldn t possibly acquire in any other way There you are wrong my dear friend It is possible as you see That is what makes the difference between the mere actor and the real artiste replied Cleek with an air of conceited self appreciation which was either a clever illusion or an exhibition of great weakness If one man might not do these things better than another man we should have no Irvings to illuminate the stage and acting would drop at once from its place among the arts to the undignified level of a tawdry trade And now as our American cousins say Let s come down to brass tacks What s the case and who s the lady The widow of the late Sir George Essington and grandmother of the young gentleman in whose interest you are to be consulted Grandmother eh Then the lady is no longer young Not as years go although to look at her you would hardly suspect that she is a day over five and thirty The Gentleman with the Hour Glass has dealt very very lightly with her Where he has failed to be considerate however the ladies who conduct certain parlours in Bond Street have come to the rescue in fine style Oh she is that kind of woman is she said Cleek with a pitch of the shoulders I have no patience with the breed As if there was anything more charming than a dear wrinkly old grandmother who bears her years gracefully and fusses over her children s children like an old hen with a brood of downy chicks But a grandmother who goes in for wrinkle eradicators cream of lilies skin tighteners milk of roses and things of that kind faugh It has been my experience mister Narkom that when a woman has any real cause for worrying over the condition of her face she usually has a just one to be anxious over that of her soul So this old lady is one of the face painters is she My dear chap let me correct an error a grandmother her ladyship may be but she is decidedly not an old one I believe she was only a mere girl when she married her late husband At any rate she certainly can t be a day over forty five at the present moment A frivolous and a recklessly extravagant woman she undoubtedly is indeed her extravagances helped as much as anything to bring her husband into the bankruptcy court before he died but beyond that I don t think there s anything particularly wrong with her soul Possibly not There s always an exception to every rule said Cleek Her ladyship may be the shining exception to this unpleasant one of the face painters Let us hope so English is she Oh yes that is her father was English and she herself was born in Buckinghamshire Her mother however was an Italian a lineal descendant of a once great and powerful Roman family named de Catanei Which supplemented Cleek with one of his curious one sided smiles through an ante papal union between Pope Alexander VI and the beautiful Giovanna de Catanei otherwise Vanozza gave to the world those two arch poisoners and devils of iniquity Caesar and Lucretia Borgia Lady Essington s family tree supplies a mixture which is certainly unique a fine fruity English pie with a rotten apple in it Hum m m if her ladyship has inherited any of the beauty of her famous ancestress for in fourteen ninety when she flourished Giovanna de Catanei was said to be the most beautiful woman in the world she should be something good to look upon She is replied Narkom You ll find her when she comes one of the handsomest and most charming women you ever met Ah then she has inherited some of the attractions and accomplishments of her famous forbears I wonder if there has also come down to her as well the formula of those remarkable secret poisons for which Lucretia Borgia and her brother Caesar were so widely famed They were marvellous things those Borgia decoctions marvellous and abominable Horrible agreed Narkom a curious shadow of unrest coming over him at this subject rising at this particular time Modern chemistry has I believe been quite unable to duplicate them There is for instance that appalling thing the aqua tofana the very fumes of which caused instant death Aqua tofana was not a Bornean poison my friend said Cleek with a smile It was discovered more than two hundred years after their time in sixteen sixty eight to be exact by one Jean Baptiste de Gaudin Signeur de saint Croix the paramour and accomplice of that unnatural French fiend Marie Marquise de Brinvilliers Its discoverer himself died through dropping the glass mask from his face and inhaling the fumes while he was preparing the hellish mixture The secret of its manufacture did not however die with him Many chemists can to day reproduce it Indeed I myself could give you the formula were it required You Gad man what don t you know In heaven s name Cleek what caused you to dip into all these unholy things The same impulse which causes a drowning man to grip at a straw mister Narkom the desire for self preservation Remember what I was in those other days and with whom I associated Believe me the statement that there is honour among thieves is a pleasant fiction and nothing more for once a man sets out to be a professional thief he and honour are no longer on speaking terms I never could be wholly sure with that lot and my biggest coups were always a source of danger to me after they had been successfully completed It became necessary for me to study all poisons all secret arts of destruction that I might guard against them and might know the proper antidote As for the rest Sh Mumm s a fine wine Here comes the landlady with the tea We ll drop the case until afterward Now tell me said Cleek after the landlady had gone and they were again in sole possession of the room what is it this Lady Essington wants of me And what sort of a chap is this grandson in whose interest she is acting Is he with her in this appeal to the Yard Certainly not my dear fellow Why he s little more than a baby not over three at the most Ever hear anybody speak of the Golden Boy old chap What The baby Earl of Strathmere The little chap who inherited a title and a million through the drowning of his parents in the wreck of the yacht Mystery That s the little gentleman the Right Honourable Cedric Eustace George Carruthers twenty seventh Earl Strathmere variously known as the Millionaire Baby and the Golden Boy His mother was Lady Essington s only daughter She was only eighteen when she married Strathmere only twenty two when she and her husband were drowned a little over a year ago Early enough to go out of the world that poor girl said Cleek sympathetically And to leave that little shaver all alone robbed at one blow of both father and mother Hard lines my friend hard lines It is fair to suppose is it not that with the death of his parents the care and guidance of his little lordship fell to the lot of his grandmother Lady Essington No it did not replied Narkom One might have supposed that it would seeing that there was no paternal grandmother but well the fact of the matter is Cleek that the late Lord Strathmere did not altogether approve of his mother in law s method of living he was essentially a quiet home loving man and had little patience with frivolity of any sort and it occasioned no surprise among those who knew him when it was discovered that he had made a will leaving everything he possessed to his little son and expressly stipulating that the care and upbringing of the boy were to be entrusted to his younger brother the Honourable Felix Camour Paul Carruthers who was to enjoy the revenue from the estate until the child attained his majority I see I see said Cleek appreciatively Then that did her extravagant ladyship out of a pretty large and steady income for a matter of seventeen or eighteen years Humm m Wise man always of course provided that he didn t save the boy from the frying pan only to drop him into the fire What kind of a man is this brother this Honourable Felix Carruthers into whose hands he entrusted the future of his little son I seem to have a hazy recollection of hearing that name somewhere or somehow in connection with some other affair Wise choice was it mister Narkom Couldn t have been better to my thinking I know the Honourable Felix quite well a steady going upright honourable young fellow he isn t over two or three and thirty who being a second son naturally inherited his mother s fortune and that being considerable he really did not need the income from his little nephew s in the slightest degree However he undertook the charge willingly for he is much attached to the boy and he and his wife to whom he was but recently married by the way entered into residence at his late brother s splendid property Boskydell Priory just over on the other side of those hills you can see from the window there where they are at present entertaining a large house party among whom are Lady Essington and her son Claude Oho Then her ladyship has a son has she The daughter who died was not her only child No The son was born about a year after the daughter A nice lad bright clever engaging fond of all sorts of dumb animals birds monkeys white mice all manner of such things and as tender hearted as a girl Wouldn t hurt a fly Carruthers is immensely fond of him and has him at the Priory whenever he can That of course means having the mother too which is a bit of a trial in a way for I don t believe that her ladyship and missus Carruthers care very much for each other But that s another story Now then let s see where was I Oh ah about the house party at the Priory and Carruthers fondness for the boy You can judge of my surprise my dear Cleek when last night s post brought me a private letter from Lady Essington asking me to meet her here at this inn which by the way belongs to the Strathmere estate and is run by a former servant at the Priory and stating that she wished me to bring one of the shrewdest and cleverest of my detectives as she was quite convinced there was an underhand scheme afoot to injure his little lordship in short she had every reason to believe that somebody was secretly attacking the life of the Golden Boy She then went on to give me details of a most extraordinary and bewildering nature Indeed What were those details mister Narkom Let her tell you for herself here she is replied the superintendent as a veiled and cloaked figure moved hurriedly past the window and he and Cleek had barely more than pushed back their chairs and risen when that figure entered the room A sweep of her hand carried back her veil and Cleek looking round saw what he considered one of the handsomest women he had ever beheld a good woman too for all her frivolous life and her dark ancestry if clear straight looking eyes could be taken as a proof which he knew that they could not for he had seen men and women in his day as crafty as the fox and as dangerous as the serpent who could look you straight in the eyes and never flinch while others as true as steel and as clean lifed as saints would send shifting glances flicking all round the room and could no more fix those glances on the face of the person to whom they were talking than they could take unto themselves wings and fly But good or ill whichever the future might prove this lovely lady to be one thing about her was certain she was violently agitated and nervousness was making her shake perceptibly and breathe hard like a spent runner It is good of you to come mister Narkom she said moving forward with a grace which no amount of excitement could dispel or diminish the innate grace of the woman born to her station and schooled by Mother Nature s guiding hand I had hoped that I might steal away and come here to meet you unsuspected But secretly as I wrote carefully as I planned this thing I have every reason to believe that my efforts are suspected and that I have indeed been followed So then this interview must be a very hurried one and you must not be surprised if it becomes necessary for me to run off without a moment s notice for believe me I am quite quite sure that the Honourable mister Felix Carruthers is already following me The Honourable my dear Lady Essington you don t mean to suggest that he he of all men God bless my soul Oh it may well amaze you mister Narkom It well nigh stupefied me when I first began to suspect Indeed I can t do any more than suspect even yet Perhaps it is he perhaps that abominable woman he has married You must decide that when you have heard I perceive glancing over at Cleek you have been unable to bring a detective police officer to listen to what I have to say but if you and your friend will listen carefully and convey the story to one in due course Pardon your ladyship but my companion is a detective officer interposed Narkom So if you will state the case at once he will be able to advise A detective You She flashed round on Cleek and looked at him in amazement her lower lip indrawn a look almost of horror in her eyes One may not tell a lion that another lion is a jackass though he masquerade in the skin of one Birth spoke to Birth She saw she knew she understood By what process could such as you she began then stopped and made a slight inclination of the head Pardon she continued that was rude Your private affairs are of course your own mister er Headland your ladyship supplied Cleek My name is George Headland And Narkom knew from that that for all her grace and charm he neither liked nor trusted her soft eyed ladyship Thank you said Lady Essington accepting this self introduction with a graceful inclination of the head No doubt mister Narkom has given you some idea of my reason for consulting you mister Headland but as time is very short let me give you the further details as briefly as possible I am convinced beyond any shadow of a doubt that some one who has an interest in his death is secretly attacking the life of my little grandson and I have every reason to believe that the some one is either the Honourable Felix Carruthers or his wife But to what purpose your ladyship People do not commit so desperate an act as murder without some powerful motive either of gain or revenge behind it and from what I have heard neither the uncle nor the aunt can have anything to win by injuring his little lordship Can they not she answered with a despairing gesture How little you know missus Carruthers is an ambitious woman mister Headland and like all women of the class from which she was recruited she aspires to a title She was formerly an actress The Honourable Felix married and took her from the theatre It is abominable that a person of that type should be foisted upon society and brought into contact with her betters Oho that s where the shoe pinches is it thought Cleek but aloud he merely said The day has long passed your ladyship when the followers of Thespis have to apologize for their existence There are many ladies of the stage in these times whose lives are exemplary and whose names call forth nothing but respect and admiration and so long as this particular lady bore an unblemished reputation Did she Oh yes There was never a word against her in that respect Felix would never have married her if there had been But I believe in persons of that class remaining in their own circle and not intruding themselves into others to which they were not born She is an ambitious woman as I have told you She aspires to a title as well as to riches and if little Lord Strathmere should die her husband would inherit both Surely that is motive enough for a woman of that type As for her husband There I am afraid your suspicion confounds itself your ladyship interrupted Cleek I am told that the Honourable mister Carruthers is extremely fond of the boy besides which being rich in his own right he has no reason to covet the riches of his brother s baby son Pardon me was rich is the proper expression not is mister Headland The failure a fortnight or so ago of the West Coast Diamond Mining Company in which the greater part of his fortune was invested and of which he was the chairman has sadly crippled his resources and he has now nothing but the income from his nephew s estate to live upon Hum m m Ah Just so said Cleek pinching his chin Now I recollect what made the name seem familiar mister Narkom I remember reading of the failure and of the small hope that was held out of anything being saved from the wreckage Still the income from the Strathmere estate is enormous and by dint of care in the seventeen or eighteen years which must elapse before his little lordship comes of age He will never come of age He will be killed first he is being killed now interposed Lady Essington agitatedly Oh mister Headland help me I love the boy he is my own child s child I love him as I never loved anything else in all the world and if he were to die Dear God what should I do And he is dying I tell you he is And they won t let me go near him they won t let me have him all to myself these two If his cries in the night wring my heart and I run to his nursery one or the other of them is always there and never for one moment will they let me hold him in my arms nor be with him alone Hum m m Cries out in the night does he your ladyship What kind of cries Those of fright or of pain Of pain of excruciating pain it would wring the heart of a stone to hear him and though there is never a spot of blood nor a sign of violence he declares that some one comes in the night and sticks something into his neck something which in his baby way he likens to a long long needle that goes yite froo my neck and sets uvver needles prickin and prickin all down my arm Hello what s that Let s have that again please rapped out Cleek before he thought then recollected himself and added apologetically I beg your ladyship s pardon but I am apt to get a little excited at times Something like a needle being run into his neck eh And other needles continuing the sensation down the arm Hum m m Had a doctor called in No I wished to but neither the uncle nor aunt would let me do so They say it is nothing a mere growing pain which he will overcome in time But it is not I know it is not If it were natural why did it never manifest itself before the failure of that wretched diamond company Why did it wait to begin until after the Honourable Felix Carruthers had lost his money And why is it going on night after night ever since Why has he begun to fail in health to change from a happy laughing healthy child into a peevish fretful constantly complaining one I tell you they are killing him those two I tell you they are using some secret diabolical thing which is sapping his very life and if She stopped and sucked her breath in with a little gasp of fright and whisking down her veil turned and made hurriedly for the door I told you he guessed I told you I should be followed she said in a shaking voice He is coming that man along the road there look through the window and you will see Oh come to my assistance mister Headland Find some way to do it for God s sake Good bye Then the door opened and shut and she was gone darting out from the rear of the inn into the shelter of the scattered clumps of furze bushes and the thick growth of bracken which covered the downs and running like a hare pursued Well what do you make of it old chap asked Narkom anxiously turning to Cleek after ascertaining past all doubt that the Honourable Felix Carruthers was riding up the road toward the French Horn Oh a crime beyond doubt he replied But whose I am in no position to determine at present A hundred things might produce that stabbing sensation in the neck from the prick of a pin point dipped in curare to a smear of the Pope s balm that hellish ointment of the Borgias Hum m m And so that s the Honourable Felix Carruthers is it Keep back from the window my friend When you are out gunning for birds it never does to raise an alarm And we should be hard put to it to explain our presence here at this particular time if he were to see you My dear chap you don t surely mean that you think he is really at the bottom of it began Narkom in surprise but before he could say a word further that surprise was completely overwhelmed by another and a greater one For the Honourable Felix had reined in and dismounted at the French Horn s door and with a clear voiced No don t put him up I shan t be long Betty Just want a word or two with some friends I m expecting walked straightway into the bar parlour and advanced toward the superintendent with hand outstretched Thank God you got my letter in time mister Narkom he said with a breath of intense relief Although I sent it by express messenger it was after three o clock and I was afraid you wouldn t What a friend you are to come to my relief like this I shall owe you a debt no money can repay This then is the great and amazing Cleek is it I thank you mister Cleek I thank you from the bottom of my heart for accepting the case Now we shall get to the bottom of the mystery I am sure It was upon the tip of Narkom s tongue to inquire what he meant by all this but Cleek rightly suspecting that the letter to which he alluded had been delivered at the Yard after the superintendent s departure jumped into the breach and saved the situation Very good of you indeed to place such great reliance in me mister Carruthers he said We had to scramble for it mister Narkom and I the letter was so late in arriving but thank fortune we managed to get here as you see And now please may I have the details of the case He spoke guardedly lest it should be upon some matter other than the interest of the Golden Boy and to prevent the Honourable Felix from guessing that he had already been approached upon that subject by Lady Essington It was not some other matter however It was again the mystery of the secret attacks upon his little lordship he was asked to dispel and the Honourable Felix plunging forthwith into the details connected with it gave him exactly the same report as Lady Essington had done Come to the rescue mister Cleek he finished rather excitedly Both my wife and I feel that you and you alone are the man to get at the bottom of this diabolical thing and the boy is as dear to us as if he were our own Help me to get proof unimpeachable proof of the hand which is engineering these diabolical attacks that we may not only put an end to them before they go too far but may avert the disgrace which publicity must inevitably bring Publicity mister Carruthers What publicity are you in dread of please That which could only bring shame to a dear lovable young fellow if any hint of what I believe to be the truth should get out mister Cleek he replied To you I may confess it I appeal to no medical man because I fear for young Claude s sake that investigation may lead to a discovery of the truth for both my wife and I feel indeed we almost know that it is his own grandmother Lady Essington who is injuring the boy and that it will not be long before she attempts to direct suspicion against us Indeed For what purpose To have us removed by the courts as not being fit to have the care of the child and to get him transferred to her care that she may enjoy the revenue from his estate Phew whistled Cleek softly Well done my lady We do our best to keep her from getting at him went on the Honourable Felix but she succeeds in spite of us His nursery was on the same floor as her rooms but for greater safety I last night had him carried to my own bedchamber and double locked all the windows and doors I said to myself that nothing could get to him then but it did just the same In the middle of the night he woke up screaming and crying out that some one had come and stuck a long needle in his neck and then for the first time God I nearly went off my head when I saw it for the first time mister Cleek there was a mark upon him three red raw little spots just over the collarbone on the left side of the neck as if a bird had pecked him Hum m m And all the windows closed you say All but one the window of my dressing room but as that is barred so that nobody could possibly get in I thought it did not matter and so left it partly open for the sake of air I see said Cleek I see Hum m m A fortnight without any outward sign and then of a sudden three small raw spots Indented in the centre are they and much inflamed about the edges Thanks Quite so quite so And the doors locked and all the windows but one closed and secured on the inside so that no human body What s that Take the case Certainly I will mister Carruthers You are entertaining a house party at present I hear Now if you can make it convenient to put me up in the Priory for a night or two and will inform your guests that an old Varsity friend named er let s see Oh ah Deland that will do as well as any Lieutenant Arthur Deland home on leave from India if you will inform your guests that that friend will join the house party to morrow afternoon I ll be with you in time for lunch and will bring my man servant with me Thank you thank you said the Honourable Felix wringing his hand I ll do exactly as you suggest mister Cleek and rooms shall be ready for you when you arrive And the matter being thus arranged the Honourable Felix took his departure and Cleek calling the landlady to furnish him with pen ink and paper sat down then and there to write a private note to Lady Essington telling her to look out for mister George Headland to put in an appearance at the Priory in three days time It was exactly half past one o clock when Lieutenant Arthur Deland a big handsome fair haired fair moustached fellow with the stamp of the Army all over him turned up at Boskydell Priory with an undersized Indian servant and an oversized kit and was presented to his hostess and to the several members of the house party by all of whom he was voted a decided acquisition before he had been an hour under the Priory s roof It is odd how one s fancies sometimes go He found the Honourable missus Carruthers a sweet gentle dovelike little woman for whom he did not care in the least degree and he found Lady Essington s son a rollicking bubbling overgrown boy of two and twenty whom in spite of frivolous upbringing and a rather pronounced brusqueness toward his mother he fancied very much indeed In fact he played right up to mister Claude Essington as our American cousins say and mister Claude Essington fancying him hugely took him to his heart forthwith and blurted out his sentiments with almost small boy candour I say Deland you re a spiffing sort I like you he said bluntly after they d played one or two sets of tennis with the ladies and done their social duties generally If things look up a bit and I m able to go back to Oxford for the next term and the Lord knows how I shall if the mater doesn t succeed in touching Carruthers for some money for we re jolly near broke and up to our eyes in debt but if I do go back and you re in England still I ll have you up for the May week and give you the time of your life Oh Lord here s the mater coming now Let s hook it Come round to the stables will you and have a look at my collection Pippin lot they ll interest you They did for on investigation the collection proved to be made up of pigeons magpies parrakeets white mice monkeys and even a tame squirrel all of which came forth at their master s call and swarmed or flocked all over him Now then Dolly Varden you keep your thieving tongs away from my scarfpin old lady exclaimed this enthusiast to a magpie which perched upon his shoulder and immediately made a peck at the small pearl in his necktie Awfullest old thief and vagrant that ever sprouted a feather this beauty he explained to Cleek as he smoothed the magpie s head Steal your eye teeth if she could get at them and goes off on the loose like a blessed wandering gypsy Lost her for three days and nights a couple of weeks ago and the Lord knows where the old vagrant put in her time What s that The white stuff on her beak Blest if I know Been pecking at a wall or something I reckon and hullo There s Carruthers and his little lordship strolling about hand in hand Let s go and have a word with them Strathmere s amazingly fond of my mice and birds With that he walked away with the mice and the monkeys and the squirrel clinging to him and those of the birds that were not perched upon his shoulders or his hands circling round his head with a flurry of moving wings Cleek followed A word in private with the Honourable Felix was accountable for his appearance in the grounds with the boy and Cleek was anxious to get a good look at him without exciting any possible suspicion in Lady Essington s mind regarding the Lieutenant s interest in him He was a bonny little chap this last Earl of Strathmere with a head and face that might have done duty for one of Raphael s Cherubim and the big wonder eyes that make baby faces so alluring Strathmere this is Lieutenant Deland come all the way from India to visit us said the Honourable Felix as Cleek went down on his knees and spoke to the boy examining him carefully the while Won t you tell him you are pleased to see him Pleased to see oo said the boy then broke into a shout of glee as he caught sight of young Essington with the animals and birds Pitty birdies pitty mouses Give give he exclaimed eagerly stretching forth his little hands Certainly Which will you have old chap magpie parrakeet pigeon monkey or mice said young Essington gayly Here take the lot and be happy Then he made as if to bundle them all into the child s arms and might have succeeded in doing so but that Cleek rose up and came between them and the boy Do have some sense Essington he rapped out sharply Those things may not bite nor claw you but one can t be sure when they are handled by some one else Besides the boy is not well and he ought not to be frightened Sorry old chap always puttin my foot into it But Strathmere likes em don t you bonny boy and I didn t think Take them back to the stables and let s have a go at billiards for an hour or two before tea said Cleek turning as Essington walked away and looking after him with narrowed eyes and lips indrawn When man and birds were out of sight however he made a sharp and sudden sound and almost in a twinkling his Indian servant slipped into sight from behind a nearby hedge Get round there and examine those birds after he s left them said Cleek in a swift whisper There s one a magpie with something smeared on its beak Find out what it is and bring me a sample Look sharp Right you are sir answered in excellent Cockney the undersized person addressed I ll spread one of me famous Tickle Tootsies and nip in and ketch the bloomin awk as soon as the josser s back is turned guv ner I m off as the squib said to the match when it started blowin of him up Then the face disappeared again and the child and the two men were again alone together Good God man exclaimed the Honourable Felix in a lowered voice of strong excitement You can t possibly believe that he that dear lovable boy Oh it is beyond belief Nothing is beyond belief in my line my friend Recollect that even Lucifer was an angel once I know the means employed to bring about this touching softly the three red spots on his little lordship s neck but I have yet to decide how the thing is administered and by whom Frankly I do not believe it is done with a bird s beak though that too is possible wild as it seems but by this time to morrow I promise you the riddle shall be solved Sh h Don t speak he s coming back Take the boy into your own room to night but leave the door unfastened I m coming down to watch by him with you Let him first be put into the regular nursery however then take him out without the knowledge of any living soul of any you hear and I will be with you before midnight That night two curious things happened The first was that at a quarter to seven when Martha the nursemaid coming up into the nursery to put his little lordship to bed found Lieutenant Deland who was supposed to be dressing for dinner at the time standing in the middle of the room looking all about the place Don t be startled Nurse he said as he looked round and saw her Your master has asked me to design a new decoration for this room and I m having a peep about in quest of inspiration Ah Strathmere Dustman s time I see Pleasant dreams to you old chap See you in the morning when you re awake Say good night to the gentleman your lordship said the nurse laying both hands on his shoulders and leading him forward whereupon he began to whine sleepily Want Sambo Want Sambo and to rub his fists into his eyes Yes dearie Nanny ll get Sambo for your lordship after your lordship has said good night to the gentleman soothed the nurse and held him gently until he had done so Good night old chap said Cleek Hello Nurse got a sore finger have you eh How did that happen It looks painful It is sir though I can t for the life of me think whatever could have made a thing so bad from just scratching one s finger unless it could have happened that there was something poisonous on the wretched magpie s claws One never can be sure where those nasty things go nor what they dip into The magpie repeated Cleek What do you mean by that Nurse Have you had an unpleasant experience with a magpie then Yes sir that big one of mister Essington s the nasty creature that s always flying about It was a fortnight ago sir Mistress pet dog had got into the nursery and laid hold of Sambo which is his lordship s rag doll sir as he never will go to sleep without tore it well nigh to pieces did the dog and knowing how his lordship would cry and mourn if he saw it like that I fetched in my work basket and started to mend it I d just got it pulled into something like shape and was about to sew it up when I was called out of the room for a few minutes and when I came back there was that wretched Magpie that had been missing for several days right inside my work basket trying to steal my reels of cotton sir It had come in through the open window like it so often does nasty thing I loathe magpies and I believe that that one knows it Anyway when I caught up a towel and began to flick at it to get it out of the room it turned on me and scratched or pecked my finger and it s been bad ever since Cook says she thinks I must have touched it against something poisonous after the skin was broken Maybe I did sir but I can t think what Cleek made no comment merely turned on his heel and walked out of the room The second curious thing occurred between nine o clock and half past when the gentlemen of the party were lingering at the table over post prandial liqueurs and cigars and the ladies had adjourned to the drawing room A recollection of having carelessly left his kit bag unlocked drew Cleek to invent an excuse for leaving the room for a minute or two and sent him speeding up the stairs The gas in the upper halls had been lowered while the members of the household were below the passages were dim and shadowy and the thick carpet on halls and stairs gave forth never a murmur of sound from under his feet nor from under the feet of yet another person who had gone like he but by a different staircase to the floors above It was therefore only by the merest chance that he looked down one of the passages in passing and saw a swift moving figure a woman s cross it at the lower end and pass hastily into the nursery of the sleeping boy And whether her purpose was a good or an evil one it was something of a shock to realize that the woman who was doing this was the Honourable missus Carruthers He locked the kit bag and went back to the dining room just as the little gathering was breaking up and mister Claude Essington who always fed his magpies and his other pets himself was bewailing the fact that he had forgotten the beauties until this minute and was smoothing out an old newspaper in which to wrap the scraps of cheese and meat he had sent the butler to the kitchen to procure The Honourable Felix looked up at Cleek with a question in his eye No he contrived to whisper in reply It was not anything poisonous merely candle wax The bird had flown in through the store room window and the housekeeper caught it carrying away candles one by one The Honourable Felix made no response nor would it have been heard had he done so for just at that moment young Essington whose eye had been caught by something in the paper burst out into a loud guffaw I say this is rich Listen here you fellows Lay you a tenner that the chap who wrote this was a Paddy Whack for a finer bull never escaped from a Tipperary paddock Lost Somewhere between Portsmouth and London or some other spot on the way a small black leather bag containing a death certificate and some other things of no value to anybody but the owner Finder will be liberally rewarded if all contents are returned intact to D J O M four hundred twenty five Savile Row West There s a beautiful example of English as she is advertised for you and if Hullo Deland old chap what s the matter with you For Cleek had suddenly jumped up and catching the Honourable Felix by the shoulder was hurrying him out of the room Just thought of something that s all Got to make a run be with you again before bedtime he answered evasively But once on the other side of the door Write me down an ass he quoted turning to his host No don t ask any questions Lend me your auto and your chauffeur Call up both as quickly as possible Wait up for me and keep your wife and Lady Essington and her son waiting up too I said to morrow I would answer the riddle did I not Well then if I m not the blindest bat that ever flew I ll give you that answer to night Then he turned round and raced upstairs for his hat and coat and ten minutes later was pelting off London ward as fast as a Lone thousand Panhard could carry him It was close to one o clock when he came back and walked into the drawing room of the Priory accompanied by a sedate and bespectacled gentleman of undoubted Celtic origin whom he introduced as Doctor James O Malley ladies and gentlemen M D Dublin Lady Essington and her son acknowledged the introduction by an inclination of the head the Honourable Felix and missus Carruthers ditto then her ladyship s son spoke up in his usual blunt outspoken way I say Deland what s in the wind he asked What lark are you up to now Felix says you ve got a clinking big surprise for us all and here we are dear boy all primed and ready for it Let s have it there s a good chap Very well so you shall he replied But first of all let me lay aside a useless mask and acknowledge that I am not an Indian army officer I am a simple police detective sometimes called George Headland your ladyship and sometimes George Headland she broke in sharply getting up and then sitting down again pale and shaken And you came you came after all Oh thank you thank you I know you would not confess this unless you have succeeded Oh you may know at last you may know she added turning upon the Honourable Felix and his wife I sent for him I brought him here I want to know and I will know whose hand it is that is striking at Strathmere s life my child s child the dearest thing to me in all the world I don t care what I suffer I don t care what I lose I don t care if the courts award him to the veriest stranger so that his dear little life is spared and he is put beyond all danger for good and all Real love shone in her face and eyes as she said this and it was the certainty of that which surprised Carruthers and his wife as much as the words she spoke Good heavens is this thing true The Honourable Felix turned to Cleek as he spoke Were you in her pay too Was she also working for the salvation of the boy Yes he made answer I entered into her service under the name of George Headland mister Carruthers the service of a good woman whom I misjudged far enough to give her a fictitious name I entered into yours by one to which I have a better right Hamilton Cleek Cleek Both her ladyship and her son were on their feet like a flash there was a breath of silence and then Well I m dashed blurted out young Essington Cleek eh the great Cleek Scotland And sat down again overcome Yes Cleek my friend Cleek ladies and gentlemen all And now that the mask is off let me tell you a short little story which no Pardon mister Essington don t leave the room please I wish you too to hear Wasn t going to leave it only going to shut the door Ah I see Allow me It is now ladies and gentlemen exactly fourteen days since our friend Doctor O Malley here coming up from Portsmouth on his motorcycle after attending a patient who that day had died was overcome by the extreme heat and the exertion of trying to fight off a belligerent magpie which flew out of the woods and persistently attacked him and falling to the ground lost consciousness When he regained it he was in the Charing Cross Hospital and all that he knew of his being there was that a motorist who had picked him and his cycle up on the road had carried him there and turned him over to the authorities He himself was unable however to place the exact locality in which he was travelling at the time of the accident otherwise we should not have had that extremely interesting advertisement which mister Essington read out this evening For the doctor had lost a small black bag containing something extremely valuable which he was carrying at the time and which supplies the solution to this interesting riddle How do you ask Come with me all of you to mister Carruthers room where his little lordship is sleeping and learn that for yourselves They rose at his word and followed him upstairs and there in a dimly lit room the sleeping child lay with an old rag doll hugged up close to him its painted face resting in the curve of his little neck You want to know from where proceed these mysterious attacks who and what it is that harms the child said Cleek as he went forward on tiptoe and gently withdrawing the doll held it up Here it is then this is the culprit this thing here You want to know how Then by this means look See He thrust the blade of a pocket knife into the doll and with one sweep ripped it open and dipping in his fingers drew from cotton wool and rags with which the thing was stuffed a slim close stoppered glass vial in which something that glowed and gave off constant sparks of light shimmered and burnt with a restless fire Is this it Doctor he said holding the thing up Yes Oh my God yes he cried out as he clutched at it A wonder of the heavens sure that the child wasn t disfigured for life or perhaps kilt forever A half grain of it a half grain of radium ladies and gentlemen enough to burn a hole through the divvle himself if he lay long enough agin it Radium The word was voiced on every side and the two women and two men crowded close to look at the thing Radium in the doll Radium I say Deland I mean to say mister Cleek in God s name who could have put the cursed thing there Your magpie mister Essington replied Cleek and with that brief preface told of Martha the nurse and of the torn doll and of the magpie that flew into the room while the girl was away The wretched thing must have picked it up when the doctor fell and lost consciousness and the open bag lay unguarded he said And with its propensity for stealing and hiding things it flew with it into the nursery and hid it in the torn doll Martha did not see it of course when she sewed the doll up but the scratch she received from the magpie presented a raw surface to the action of the mineral and its effect was instant and most violent What s that No mister Carruthers no one is guilty no one has even tried to injure his lordship Chance only is to blame and Chance cannot be punished As for the rest do me a favour dear friend in place of any other kind of reward Look to it that this young chap here gets enough out of the income of the estate to continue his course at Oxford and that s all It was not however for while he was still speaking a strange and even startling interruption occurred A liveried servant pushing the door open gently stepped into the room bearing a small silver salver upon which a letter lay Well upon my word Johnston this is rather an original sort of performance isn t it exclaimed Carruthers indignant over the intrusion I beg your pardon sir but I did knock he apologized I knocked twice in fact but no one seemed to hear and as I had been told it was a matter of more than life and death I presumed Letter for Lieutenant Deland sir A gentleman of the name of Narkom in a motor sir at the door asked me to deliver it at once and under any and all circumstances Cleek looked at the letter saw that it was enclosed in a plain unaddressed envelope asked to be excused and stepped out into the passage with it That Narkom should have come for him like this should have risked the upsetting of a case by appearing before he knew if it was settled or indeed likely to be could mean but one thing that his errand was one of overwhelming importance of more moment than anything else in the world He tore off the envelope with hands that shook and spread open the sheet of paper it contained There was but one single line upon it but that line penned in that hand would have called him from the world s end Come to me at once Ailsa he read and was on his way downstairs like a shot In the lower hall the butler stood holding his hat and coat ready for him to jump into them at once My er young servant quick as you can said Cleek grabbing the hat and hurrying into the coat Already outside sir in the motor with the gentleman the butler gave back then opened the door and stepped aside holding it back for him and bowing deferentially and the light of the hall streaking out into the night showed a flight of shallow steps the blue limousine at the foot of them with Lennard in the driver s seat and Dollops beside him and standing on the lowest step of all mister Narkom holding open the car s door and looking curiously pale and solemn What is it Is she hurt Has anything happened to her Cleek jumbled the three questions into one unbroken breath as he came running down the steps and caught at the superintendent s arm Speak up Don t stand looking at me like a dumb thing Is anything wrong with Miss Lorne Nothing nothing at all Thank God Then why Why For what reason has she sent for me Where is she Speak up In town Waiting for you At the Mauravanian embassy At the Good God How comes she to be there I took her You told me if anything happened to you that I thought she ought to know Please get in and let us be off sir Sire whichever it ought to be I don t know the proper form of address I ve never had any personal dealings with royalty before The hand that rested on his arm tightened its grip the very instant that word royalty passed his lips Now it relaxed suddenly dropped away and he scarcely recognized the voice that spoke next so unlike to Cleek s it was so thick was the tremulous note that pulsated through it Royalty it repeated Speak up please What have you found out What do you know of me that you make use of that term What everybody in the world will know by to morrow Count Irma has told Count Irma has come as the special envoy of the people for Queen Karma s son For the King they want For you flung out Narkom getting excited as he proceeded It s all out at last and I know now Everybody does I m to lose you Mauravania is to take you from me after all A palace is to have you not the Yard Get in please sir Sire your Majesty Get in They re waiting for you at the embassy Get in and go Good luck to you God bless you I mean that It s just about going to break my heart Cleek but I mean it every word Mind the step Sire Make room for me on the seat there you two and then off to the embassy as fast as you can streak it Lennard His Majesty is all ready to start Not yet please a voice said quietly then a hand reached out from the interior of the limousine dropped upon mister Narkom s shoulder and tightening there drew him over the step and into the car Your old seat my friend Here beside me My memory is not a short one and my affections not fickle All right now Lennard Let her go Then the door closed with a smack the limousine came round with a swing and just as in those other days when it was the Law that called not the trumpet peal from a throne the car went bounding off at the good old mile a minute clip on its fly away race for London It ended that race in front of the Mauravanian embassy and Cleek s love for the spectacular must have come near to being surfeited that night for the building was one blaze of light one glamour of flags and flowers and festooned bunting and looking up the steps down which a crimson carpet ran across the pavement to the very kerbstone he could see a double line of soldiers in the glittering white and silver of the Mauravanian Royal Guard plumed and helmeted standing with swords at salute waiting to receive him and over the arched doorway the royal arms emblazoned and above them picked out in winking gas jets a wreath of laurel surrounding the monogram M R which stood for Maximilian Rex aflame against a marble background Here we are at last sir said Narkom as the car stopped he had learned by this time that Sire belonged to the stage and the Middle Ages and alighting held back the door that Cleek might get out Afterward he declared that that was the proudest moment of his life for if it was not the proudest of Cleek s his looks belied him For as his foot touched the crimson carpet a band within swung into the stately measure of the Mauravanian National Anthem an escort came down the hall and down the steps and lined up on either side of him and if ever man looked proud of his inheritance that man was he He went on up the steps and down the long hall with a chorus of Vivat Maximilian Vivat le roi following him and the sound of the National Anthem ringing in his ears then all of a moment the escort fell back doors opened he found himself in a room that blazed with lights that echoed with the sound of many vivats the stir of many bodies and looking about saw that he was surrounded by a kneeling gathering and that one man in particular was at his feet sobbing He looked down and saw that that man was Irma and smiled and put out his hand The count bent over and touched it with his lips Majesty I never forgot Majesty I worked for it fought for it ever since that night he said I would have fought for it ever if it need have been But it was not See it was not It was God s will and it was our people s My people s Cleek repeated his head going back his eyes lighting with a pride and a happiness beyond all telling Oh Mauravania Dear land Dear country Mine again But hardly had the ecstasy of that thought laid its spell upon him when there came another not less divine and his eyes went round the gathering in quest of one who should be here at his side to share this glorious moment with him She had come for that purpose Narkom had said so Where was she then Why did she hold herself in the background at such a time as this He saw her at that very moment The gathering had risen and she with them holding aloof at the far end of the room There was a smile on her lips but even at that distance he could see that she was very very pale and that there was a shadow of pain in her dear eyes We both have battled for an ideal Count he said with a happy little laugh Here is mine Here is what I have fought for and crossing the room he went straight to Ailsa with both hands outstretched to her and his face fairly beaming But it needed not the little shocked breath he heard upon all sides to dash that bright look from his face and to bring him to a sudden halt For at his coming Ailsa had dropped the deep curtsey which is the due of royalty and was moving away from him backward which is royalty s due also Ailsa he said moving toward her with a sharp and sudden step Ailsa don t be absurd It is too silly to think that forms should stand with you too Take my hand take it Your Majesty Take it I tell you he repeated almost roughly Good God do you think that this can make any difference Take my hand Do you hear She obeyed him this time but as her fingers rested upon his he saw that they were quite ringless that the sign of their engagement had been removed and caught her to him with a passionate sort of fierceness that was a reproach in itself Could you think so meanly of me Could you he cried Where is the ring In my pocket I took it off when I heard Put it on again Or no Give it to me and let me do that myself here before them all Kings must have queens must they not You were always mine you are always going to be Even the day of our wedding is not to be changed Oh hush she made answer One s duty to one s country must always stand first with kings Must it Kings after all are only men and a man s first duty is to the one woman of his heart Not with kings There is a different rule a different law Oh let me go please I know I fully realize it would be different with you if it were possible But it is the penalty one must pay for kingship dear Royalty must mate with royalty not with a woman of the people It is the law of all kingdoms the immutable law It was He had forgotten that and it came upon him now with a shock of bitter recollection For a moment he stood silent the colour draining out of his face the light fading slowly from his eyes then of a sudden he looked over the glittering room and across its breadth at Irma It would not be possible then he asked Not as a royal consort sir The people s choice in that respect would lie with the hereditary princess of Danubia I have already explained that to Mademoiselle But if it should be your Majesty s pleasure to take a morganatic wife Cut that rapped in Cleek s voice like the snap of a whiplash So then one is to sell one s honour for a crown break a woman s life for a kingdom and become a royal adulterer for the sake of a throne and sceptre But Majesty one s duty to one s country is a sacred thing Not so sacred as one s redeemer Count and under God here is mine he threw back heatedly Mauravania forgot once she will forget again She must forget My lords and gentlemen I decline her flattering offer My only kingdom is here in this dear woman s arms Walk with me Ailsa walk with me always You said you would Walk with me dear as my queen and my wife And putting his arm about her and holding her close and setting his back to the lights and the flags and the glittering Guard he passed with head erect through the murmuring gathering and went down and out with her to the blue limousine to the Yard s service again and to those better things which are the true crown of a man s life At the foot of the steps Narkom and Dollops caught up with him and the boy s eager hand plucked at his sleeve Guv ner Gawd love yer Gawd love yer sir you re a man you are he said with a sort of sob in his voice I m glad you chucked it It was breakin my heart to think that I d have to call you Sire all the rest of my days sir like as if you was a bloomin horse Transcriber s note Spelling and
