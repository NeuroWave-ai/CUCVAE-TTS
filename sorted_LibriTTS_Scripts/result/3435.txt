Foreword This work labourious as it may appear has been to me a labour of love an unfailing source of solace and satisfaction During my long years of official banishment to the luxuriant and deadly deserts of Western Africa and to the dull and dreary half clearings of South America it proved itself a charm a talisman against ennui and despondency Impossible even to open the pages without a vision starting into view with out drawing a picture from the pinacothek of the brain without reviving a host of memories and reminiscences which are not the common property of travellers however widely they may have travelled From my dull and commonplace and respectable surroundings the Jinn bore me at once to the land of my pre direction Arabia a region so familiar to my mind that even at first sight it seemed a reminiscence of some by gone metem psychic life in the distant Past Again I stood under the diaphanous skies in air glorious as aether whose every breath raises men s spirits like sparkling wine Once more I saw the evening star hanging like a solitaire from the pure front of the western firmament and the after glow transfiguring and transforming as by magic the homely and rugged features of the scene into a fairy land lit with a light which never shines on other soils or seas Then would appear the woollen tents low and black of the true Badawin mere dots in the boundless waste of lion tawny clays and gazelle brown gravels and the camp fire dotting like a glow worm the village centre Presently sweetened by distance would be heard the wild weird song of lads and lasses driving or rather pelting through the gloaming their sheep and goats and the measured chant of the spearsmen gravely stalking behind their charge the camels mingled with bleating of the flocks and the bellowing of the humpy herds while the reremouse flitted overhead with his tiny shriek and the rave of the jackal resounded through deepening glooms and most musical of music the palm trees answered the whispers of the night breeze with the softest tones of falling water And then a shift of scene The Shaykhs and white beards of the tribe gravely take their places sitting with outspread skirts like hillocks on the plain as the Arabs say around the camp fire whilst I reward their hospitality and secure its continuance by reading or reciting a few pages of their favourite tales The women and children stand motionless as silhouettes outside the ring and all are breathless with attention they seem to drink in the words with eyes and mouths as well as with ears The most fantastic flights of fancy the wildest improbabilities the most impossible of impossibilities appear to them utterly natural mere matters of every day occurrence They enter thoroughly into each phase of feeling touched upon by the author they take a personal pride in the chivalrous nature and knightly prowess of Taj al Muluk they are touched with tenderness by the self sacrificing love of Azizah their mouths water as they hear of heaps of untold gold given away in largesse like clay they chuckle with delight every time a Kazi or a Fakir a judge or a reverend is scurvily entreated by some Pantagruelist of the Wilderness and despite their normal solemnity and impassibility all roar with laughter sometimes rolling upon the ground till the reader s gravity is sorely tried at the tales of the garrulous Barber and of Ali and the Kurdish Sharper To this magnetising mood the sole exception is when a Badawi of superior accomplishments who sometimes says his prayers ejaculates a startling Astagh faru llah I pray Allah s pardon for listening not to Carlyle s downright lies but to light mention of the sex whose name is never heard amongst the nobility of the Desert Nor was it only in Arabia that the immortal Nights did me such notable service I found the wildlings of Somali land equally amenable to its discipline no one was deaf to the charm and the two women cooks of my caravan on its way to Harar were in continently dubbed by my men Shahrazad and Dinazad It may be permitted me also to note that this translation is a natural outcome of my Pilgrimage to Al Medinah and Meccah Arriving at Aden in the so called winter of eighteen fifty two I put up with my old and dear friend Steinhaeuser to whose memory this volume is inscribed and when talking over Arabia and the Arabs we at once came to the same conclusion that while the name of this wondrous treasury of Moslem folk lore is familiar to almost every English child no general reader is aware of the valuables it contains nor indeed will the door open to any but Arabists Before parting we agreed to collaborate and produce a full complete unvarnished uncastrated copy of the great original my friend taking the prose and I the metrical part and we corresponded upon the subject for years But whilst I was in the Brazil Steinhaeuser died suddenly of apoplexy at Berne in Switzerland and after the fashion of Anglo India his valuable MSS left at Aden were dispersed and very little of his labours came into my hands Thus I was left alone to my work which progressed fitfully amid a host of obstructions At length in the spring of eighteen seventy nine the tedious process of copying began and the book commenced to take finished form But during the winter of eighteen eighty one eighty two I saw in the literary journals a notice of a new version by mister John Payne well known to scholars for his prowess in English verse especially for his translation of The Poems of Master Francis Villon of Paris Being then engaged on an expedition to the Gold Coast for gold which seemed likely to cover some months I wrote to the Athenaeum Nov thirteen eighteen eighty one and to mister Payne who was wholly unconscious that we were engaged on the same work and freely offered him precedence and possession of the field till no longer wanted He accepted my offer as frankly and his priority entailed another delay lasting till the spring of eighteen eighty five These details will partly account for the lateness of my appearing but there is yet another cause Professional ambition suggested that literary labours unpopular with the vulgar and the half educated are not likely to help a man up the ladder of promotion But common sense presently suggested to me that professionally speaking I was not a success and at the same time that I had no cause to be ashamed of my failure In our day when we live under a despotism of the lower middle class Philister who can pardon anything but superiority the prizes of competitive services are monopolized by certain pets of the Mediocratie and prime favourites of that jealous and potent majority the Mediocrities who know no nonsense about merit It is hard for an outsider to realise how perfect is the monopoly of common place and to comprehend how fatal a stumbling stone that man sets in the way of his own advancement who dares to think for himself or who knows more or who does more than the mob of gentlemen employee who know very little and who do even less Yet however behindhand I may be there is still ample room and verge for an English version of the Arabian Nights Entertainments Our century of translations popular and vernacular from Professor Antoine Galland s delightful abbreviation and adaptation A D seventeen oh four in no wise represent the eastern original The best and latest the reverend mister Foster s which is diffuse and verbose and mister G Moir Bussey s which is a re correction abound in gallicisms of style and idiom and one and all degrade a chef d oeuvre of the highest anthropological and ethnographical interest and importance to a mere fairy book a nice present for little boys After nearly a century had elapsed doctor Jonathan Scott LL D H E I C s S Persian Secretary to the G G Bengal Oriental Professor et cetera et cetera printed his Tales Anecdotes and Letters translated from the Arabic and Persian Cadell and Davies London A D eighteen hundred and followed in eighteen eleven with an edition of The Arabian Nights Entertainments from the MS of Edward Wortley Montague in six vols small eightvo London Longmans et cetera This work he and he only describes as Carefully revised and occasionally corrected from the Arabic The reading public did not wholly reject it sundry texts were founded upon the Scott version and it has been imperfectly reprinted four vole eightvo Nimmo and Bain London eighteen eighty three But most men little recking what a small portion of the original they were reading satisfied themselves with the Anglo French epitome and metaphrase At length in eighteen thirty eight mister Henry Torrens B A Irishman lawyer of the Inner Temple and Bengal Civilian took a step in the right direction and began to translate The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night one vol eightvo Calcutta W Thacker and company from the Arabic of the AEgyptian MS edited by mister afterwards Sir William H Macnaghten The attempt or rather the intention was highly creditable the copy was carefully moulded upon the model and offered the best example of the verbatim et literatim style But the plucky author knew little of Arabic and least of what is most wanted the dialect of Egypt and Syria His prose is so conscientious as to offer up spirit at the shrine of letter and his verse always whimsical has at times a manner of Hibernian whoop which is comical when it should be pathetic Lastly he printed only one volume of a series which completed would have contained nine or ten That amiable and devoted Arabist the late Edward William Lane does not score a success in his New Translation of the Tales of a Thousand and One Nights London Charles Knight and company MDCCCXXXIX of which there have been four English editions besides American two edited by E S Poole He chose the abbreviating Bulak Edition and of its two hundred tales he has omitted about half and by far the more characteristic half the work was intended for the drawing room table and consequently the workman was compelled to avoid the objectionable and aught approaching to licentiousness He converts the Arabian Nights into the Arabian Chapters arbitrarily changing the division and worse still he converts some chapters into notes He renders poetry by prose and apologises for not omitting it altogether he neglects assonance and he is at once too Oriental and not Oriental enough He had small store of Arabic at the time Lane of the Nights is not Lane of the Dictionary and his pages are disfigured by many childish mistakes Worst of all the three handsome volumes are rendered unreadable as Sale s Koran by their anglicised Latin their sesquipedalian un English words and the stiff and stilted style of half a century ago when our prose was perhaps the worst in Europe Their cargo of Moslem learning was most valuable to the student but utterly out of place for readers of The Nights re published as these notes have been separately London Chatto eighteen eighty three they are an ethnological text book mister John Payne has printed for the Villon Society and for private circulation only the first and sole complete translation of the great compendium comprising about four times as much matter as that of Galland and three times as much as that of any other translator and I cannot but feel proud that he has honoured me with the dedication of The Book of The Thousand Nights and One Night His version is most readable his English with a sub flavour of the Mabinogionic archaicism is admirable and his style gives life and light to the nine volumes whose matter is frequently heavy enough He succeeds admirably in the most difficult passages and he often hits upon choice and special terms and the exact vernacular equivalent of the foreign word so happily and so picturesquely that all future translators must perforce use the same expression under pain of falling far short But the learned and versatile author bound himself to issue only five hundred copies and not to reproduce the work in its complete and uncastrated form Consequently his excellent version is caviaire to the general practically unprocurable And here I hasten to confess that ample use has been made of the three versions above noted the whole being blended by a callida junctura into a homogeneous mass But in the presence of so many predecessors a writer is bound to show some raison d etre for making a fresh attempt and this I proceed to do with due reserve Briefly the object of this version is to show what The Thousand Nights and a Night really is Not however for reasons to be more fully stated in the Terminal Essay by straining verbum reddere verbo but by writing as the Arab would have written in English On this point I am all with Saint Jerome Pref in Jobum Vel verbum e verbo vel sensum e sensu vel ex utroque commixtum et medic temperatum genus translationis My work claims to be a faithful copy of the great Eastern Saga book by preserving intact not only the spirit but even the mecanique the manner and the matter Hence however prosy and long drawn out be the formula it retains the scheme of The Nights because they are a prime feature in the original The Rawi or reciter to whose wits the task of supplying details is left well knows their value the openings carefully repeat the names of the dramatic personae and thus fix them in the hearer s memory Without the Nights no Arabian Nights Moreover it is necessary to retain the whole apparatus nothing more ill advised than doctor Jonathan Scott s strange device of garnishing The Nights with fancy head pieces and tail pieces or the splitting up of Galland s narrative by merely prefixing Nuit et cetera ending moreover with the ccxxxivth Night yet this has been done apparently with the consent of the great Arabist Sylvestre de Sacy Paris Ernest Bourdin Moreover holding that the translator s glory is to add something to his native tongue while avoiding the hideous hag like nakedness of Torrens and the bald literalism of Lane I have carefully Englished the picturesque turns and novel expressions of the original in all their outlandishness for instance when the dust cloud raised by a tramping host is described as walling the horizon Hence peculiar attention has been paid to the tropes and figures which the Arabic language often packs into a single term and I have never hesitated to coin a word when wanted such as she snorted and sparked fully to represent the original These like many in Rabelais are mere barbarisms unless generally adopted in which case they become civilised and common currency Despite objections manifold and manifest I have preserved the balance of sentences and the prose rhyme and rhythm which Easterns look upon as mere music This Saj a or cadence of the cooing dove has in Arabic its special duties It adds a sparkle to description and a point to proverb epigram and dialogue it corresponds with our artful alliteration which in places I have substituted for it and generally it defines the boundaries between the classical and the popular styles which jostle each other in The Nights If at times it appear strained and forced after the wont of rhymed prose the scholar will observe that despite the immense copiousness of assonants and consonants in Arabic the strain is often put upon it intentionally like the Rims cars of Dante and the Troubadours This rhymed prose may be un English and unpleasant even irritating to the British ear still I look upon it as a sine qua non for a complete reproduction of the original In the Terminal Essay I shall revert to the subject On the other hand when treating the versical portion which may represent a total of ten thousand lines I have not always bound myself by the metrical bonds of the Arabic which are artificial in the extreme and which in English can be made bearable only by a tour de force I allude especially to the monorhyme Rim continuat or tirade monorime whose monotonous simplicity was preferred by the Troubadours for threnodies It may serve well for three or four couplets but when it extends as in the Ghazal cannon to eighteen and in the Kasidah elegy or ode to more it must either satisfy itself with banal rhyme words when the assonants should as a rule be expressive and emphatic or it must display an ingenuity a smell of the oil which assuredly does not add to the reader s pleasure It can perhaps be done and it should be done but for me the task has no attractions I can fence better in shoes than in sabots Finally I print the couplets in Arab form separating the hemistichs by asterisks And now to consider one matter of special importance in the book its turpiloquium This stumbling block is of two kinds completely distinct One is the simple naive and child like indecency which from Tangiers to Japan occurs throughout general conversation of high and low in the present day It uses like the holy books of the Hebrews expressions plainly descriptive of natural situations and it treats in an unconventionally free and naked manner of subjects and matters which are usually by common consent left undescribed As Sir William Jones observed long ago that anything natural can be offensively obscene never seems to have occurred to the Indians or to their legislators a singularity pervading their writings and conversation but no proof of moral depravity Another justly observes Les peuples primitifs n y entendent pas malice ils appellent les choses par leurs noms et ne trouvent pas condamnable ce qui est naturel And they are prying as children For instance the European novelist marries off his hero and heroine and leaves them to consummate marriage in privacy even Tom Jones has the decency to bolt the door But the Eastern story teller especially this unknown prose Shakespeare must usher you with a flourish into the bridal chamber and narrate to you with infinite gusto everything he sees and hears Again we must remember that grossness and indecency in fact les turpitudes are matters of time and place what is offensive in England is not so in Egypt what scandalises us now would have been a tame joke tempore Elisoe Withal The Nights will not be found in this matter coarser than many passages of Shakespeare Sterne and Swift and their uncleanness rarely attains the perfection of Alcofribas Naiser divin maitre et atroce cochon The other element is absolute obscenity sometimes but not always tempered by wit humour and drollery here we have an exaggeration of Petronius Arbiter the handiwork of writers whose ancestry the most religious and the most debauched of mankind practised every abomination before the shrine of the Canopic Gods In accordance with my purpose of reproducing the Nights not virginibus puerisque but in as perfect a picture as my powers permit I have carefully sought out the English equivalent of every Arabic word however low it may be or shocking to ears polite preserving on the other hand all possible delicacy where the indecency is not intentional and as a friend advises me to state not exaggerating the vulgarities and the indecencies which indeed can hardly be exaggerated For the coarseness and crassness are but the shades of a picture which would otherwise be all lights The general tone of The Nights is exceptionally high and pure The devotional fervour often rises to the boiling point of fanaticism The pathos is sweet deep and genuine tender simple and true utterly unlike much of our modern tinsel Its life strong splendid and multitudinous is everywhere flavoured with that unaffected pessimism and constitutional melancholy which strike deepest root under the brightest skies and which sigh in the face of heaven Vita quid est hominis Viridis floriscula mortis Sole Oriente oriens sole cadente cadens Poetical justice is administered by the literary Kazi with exemplary impartiality and severity denouncing evil doers and eulogising deeds admirably achieved The morale is sound and healthy and at times we descry through the voluptuous and libertine picture vistas of a transcendental morality the morality of Socrates in Plato Subtle corruption and covert licentiousness are utterly absent we find more real vice in many a short French roman say La Dame aux Camelias and in not a few English novels of our day than in the thousands of pages of the Arab Here we have nothing of that most immodest modern modesty which sees covert implication where nothing is implied and improper allusion when propriety is not outraged nor do we meet with the Nineteenth Century refinement innocence of the word not of the thought morality of the tongue not of the heart and the sincere homage paid to virtue in guise of perfect hypocrisy It is indeed this unique contrast of a quaint element childish crudities and nursery indecencies and vain and amatorious phrase jostling the finest and highest views of life and character shown in the kaleidoscopic shiftings of the marvellous picture with many a rich truth in a tale s presence pointed by a rough dry humour which compares well with wut the alternations of strength and weakness of pathos and bathos of the boldest poetry the diction of Job and the baldest prose the Egyptian of today the contact of religion and morality with the orgies of African Apuleius and Petronius Arbiter at times taking away the reader s breath and finally the whole dominated everywhere by that marvellous Oriental fancy wherein the spiritual and the supernatural are as common as the material and the natural it is this contrast I say which forms the chiefest charm of The Nights which gives it the most striking originality and which makes it a perfect expositor of the medieval Moslem mind Explanatory notes did not enter into mister Payne s plan They do with mine I can hardly imagine The Nights being read to any profit by men of the West without commentary My annotations avoid only one subject parallels of European folklore and fabliaux which however interesting would overswell the bulk of a book whose speciality is anthropology The accidents of my life it may be said without undue presumption my long dealings with Arabs and other Mahommedans and my familiarity not only with their idiom but with their turn of thought and with that racial individuality which baffles description have given me certain advantages over the average student however deeply he may have studied These volumes moreover afford me a long sought opportunity of noticing practices and customs which interest all mankind and which Society will not hear mentioned Grate the historian and Thackeray the novelist both lamented that the begueulerie of their countrymen condemned them to keep silence where publicity was required and that they could not even claim the partial licence of a Fielding and a Smollett Hence a score of years ago I lent my best help to the late doctor James Hunt in founding the Anthropological Society whose presidential chair I first occupied pp two four Anthropologia London Balliere vol i No I eighteen seventy three My motive was to supply travellers with an organ which would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters out of place in the popular book intended for the Nipptisch and indeed better kept from public view But hardly had we begun when Respectability that whited sepulchre full of all uncleanness rose up against us Propriety cried us down with her brazen blatant voice and the weak kneed brethren fell away Yet the organ was much wanted and is wanted still All now known barbarous tribes in Inner Africa America and Australia whose instincts have not been overlaid by reason have a ceremony which they call making men As soon as the boy shows proofs of puberty he and his coevals are taken in hand by the mediciner and the Fetisheer and under priestly tuition they spend months in the bush enduring hardships and tortures which impress the memory till they have mastered the theorick and practick of social and sexual relations Amongst the civilised this fruit of the knowledge tree must be bought at the price of the bitterest experience and the consequences of ignorance are peculiarly cruel Here then I find at last an opportunity of noticing in explanatory notes many details of the text which would escape the reader s observation and I am confident that they will form a repertory of Eastern knowledge in its esoteric phase The student who adds the notes of Lane Arabian Society et cetera before quoted to mine will know as much of the Moslem East and more than many Europeans who have spent half their lives in Orient lands For facility of reference an index of anthropological notes is appended to each volume The reader will kindly bear with the following technical details Steinhaeuser and I began and ended our work with the first Bulak Bul Edition printed at the port of Cairo in A H twelve fifty one A D eighteen thirty five But when preparing my MSS for print I found the text incomplete many of the stories being given in epitome and not a few ruthlessly mutilated with head or feet wanting Like most Eastern scribes the Editor could not refrain from improvements which only debased the book and his sole title to excuse is that the second Bulak Edition four vols A H twelve seventy nine A D eighteen sixty three despite its being revised and corrected by Sheik Mahommed Qotch Al Adewi is even worse and the same may be said of the Cairo Edit four vols A H twelve ninety seven A D eighteen eighty one The Calcutta Calc Edition with ten lines of Persian preface by the Editor Ahmed al Shirwani A D eighteen fourteen was cut short at the end of the first two hundred Nights and thus made room for Sir William Hay Macnaghten s Edition four vols royal fourto of eighteen thirty nine forty two This Mac as by far the least corrupt and the most complete has been assumed for my basis with occasional reference to the Breslau Edition Bres wretchedly edited from a hideous Egyptian MS by doctor Maximilian Habicht eighteen twenty five forty three The Bayrut Text Alif Leila we Leila four vols at eightvo Beirut eighteen eighty one eighty three is a melancholy specimen of The Nights taken entirely from the Bulak Edition by one Khalil Sarkis and converted to Christianity beginning without Bismillah continued with scrupulous castration and ending in ennui and disappointment I have not used this missionary production As regards the transliteration of Arabic words I deliberately reject the artful and complicated system ugly and clumsy withal affected by scientific modern Orientalists Nor is my sympathy with their prime object namely to fit the Roman alphabet for supplanting all others Those who learn languages and many do so by the eye as well as by the ear well know the advantages of a special character to distinguish for instance Syriac from Arabic Gujrati from Marathi Again this Roman hand bewitched may have its use in purely scientific and literary works but it would be wholly out of place in one whose purpose is that of the novel to amuse rather than to instruct Moreover the devices perplex the simple and teach nothing to the learned Either the reader knows Arabic in which case Greek letters italics and upper case diacritical points and similar typographic oddities are as a rule with some exceptions unnecessary or he does not know Arabic when none of these expedients will be of the least use to him Indeed it is a matter of secondary consideration what system we prefer provided that we mostly adhere to one and the same for the sake of a consistency which saves confusion to the reader I have especially avoided that of mister Lane adopted by mister Payne for special reasons against which it was vain to protest it represents the debased brogue of Egypt or rather of Cairo and such a word as Kemer ez Zeman would be utterly un pronounceable to a Badawi Nor have I followed the practice of my learned friend Reverend G P Badger in mixing bars and acute accents the former unpleasantly remind man of those hateful dactyls and spondees and the latter should in my humble opinion be applied to long vowels which in Arabic double or should double the length of the shorts doctor Badger uses the acute symbol to denote accent or stress of voice but such appoggio is unknown to those who speak with purest articulation for instance whilst the European pronounces Mus cat and the Arab villager Mas kat the Children of the Waste on whose tongues Allah descended articulate Mas kat I have therefore followed the simple system adopted in my Pilgrimage and have accented Arabic words only when first used thinking it unnecessary to preserve throughout what is an eyesore to the reader and a distress to the printer In the main I follow Johnson on Richardson a work known to every Anglo Orientalist as the old and trusty companion of his studies early and late but even here I have made sundry deviations for reasons which will be explained in the Terminal Essay As words are the embodiment of ideas and writing is of words so the word is the spoken word and we should write it as pronounced Strictly speaking the e sound and the o sound viz the Italian o sound not the English which is peculiar to us and unknown to any other tongue are not found in Arabic except when the figure Imalah obliges hence they are called Ya al Majhul and Waw al Majhul the unknown y i and u But in all tongues vowel sounds the flesh which clothes the bones consonants of language are affected by the consonants which precede and more especially which follow them hardening and softening the articulation and deeper sounds accompany certain letters as the sad compared with the sin None save a defective ear would hold as Lane does Maulid birth festival more properly pronounced Molid Yet I prefer Khokh peach and Jokh broad cloth to Khukh and Jukh Ohod mount to Uhud Obayd a little slave to Ubayd and Hosayn a fortlet not the P N Al Husayn to Husayn As for the short e in such words as Memluk for Mamluk a white slave Eshe for Asha supper and Yemen for Al Yaman I consider it a flat Egyptianism insufferable to an ear which admires the Badawi pronunciation Yet I prefer Shelebi a dandy from the Turkish Chelebi to Shalabi Zebdani the Syrian village to Zabdani and Fes and Miknes by the figure Imalah to Fas and Miknas our Fez and Mequinez With respect to proper names and untranslated Arabic words I have rejected all system in favour of common sense When a term is incorporated in our tongue I refuse to follow the purist and mortify the reader by startling innovation For instance Aleppo Cairo and Bassorah are preferred to Halab Kahirah and Al Basrah when a word is half naturalised like Alcoran or Koran Bashaw or Pasha which the French write Pacha and Mahomet or Mohammed for Muhammad the modern form is adopted because the more familiar But I see no advantage in retaining simply because they are the mistakes of a past generation such words as Roc for Rikh Khalif a pretentious blunder for Kalifah and better written Caliph and genie Jinn a mere Gallic corruption not so terrible however as a Bedouin Badawi As little too would I follow mister Lane in foisting upon the public such Arabisms as Khuff a riding boot Mikra ah a palm rod and a host of others for which we have good English equivalents On the other hand I would use but use sparingly certain Arabic exclamations as Bismillah in the name of Allah and Inshallah if Allah please which have special applications and which have been made familiar to English ears by the genius of Fraser and Morier I here end these desultory but necessary details to address the reader in a few final words He will not think lightly of my work when I repeat to him that with the aid of my annotations supplementing Lane s the student will readily and pleasantly learn more of the Moslem s manners and customs laws and religion than is known to the average Orientalist and if my labours induce him to attack the text of The Nights he will become master of much more Arabic than the ordinary Arab owns This book is indeed a legacy which I bequeath to my fellow countrymen in their hour of need Over devotion to Hindu and especially to Sanskrit literature has led them astray from those so called Semitic studies which are the more requisite for us as they teach us to deal successfully with a race more powerful than any pagans the Moslem Apparently England is ever forgetting that she is at present the greatest Mohammedan empire in the world Of late years she has systematically neglected Arabism and indeed actively discouraged it in examinations for the Indian Civil Service where it is incomparably more valuable than Greek and Latin Hence when suddenly compelled to assume the reins of government in Moslem lands as Afghanistan in times past and Egypt at present she fails after a fashion which scandalises her few very few friends and her crass ignorance concerning the Oriental peoples which should most interest her exposes her to the contempt of Europe as well as of the Eastern world When the regrettable raids of eighteen eighty three eighty four culminating in the miserable affairs of Tokar Teb and Tamasi were made upon the gallant Sudani negroids the Bisharin outlying Sawakin who were battling for the holy cause of liberty and religion and for escape from Turkish task masters and Egyptian tax gatherers not an English official in camp after the death of the gallant and lamented Major Morice was capable of speaking Arabic Now Moslems are not to be ruled by raw youths who should be at school and college instead of holding positions of trust and emolument He who would deal with them successfully must be firstly honest and truthful and secondly familiar with and favourably inclined to their manners and customs if not to their law and religion We may perhaps find it hard to restore to England those pristine virtues that tone and temper which made her what she is but at any rate we myself and a host of others can offer her the means of dispelling her ignorance concerning the Eastern races with whom she is continually in contact In conclusion I must not forget to notice that the Arabic ornamentations of these volumes were designed by my excellent friend Yacoub Artin Pasha of the Ministry of Instruction Cairo with the aid of the well known writing artist Shayth Mohammed Muunis the Cairene My name Al Hajj Abdullah the Pilgrim Abdallah was written by an English calligrapher the lamented Professor Palmer who found a premature death almost within sight of Suez RICHARD F BURTON Wanderers Club August

take warning and that they may peruse the annals of antique peoples and all that hath betided them and be thereby ruled and restrained Praise therefore be to Him who hath made the histories of the Past an admonition unto the Present Now of such instances are the tales called A Thousand Nights and a Night together with their far famed legends and wonders Therein it is related but Allah is All knowing of His hidden things and All ruling and All honoured and All giving and All gracious and All merciful FN one that in tide of yore and in time long gone before there was a King of the Kings of the Banu Sasan in the Islands of India and China a Lord of armies and guards and servants and dependents FN two He left only two sons one in the prime of manhood and the other yet a youth while both were Knights and Braves albeit the elder was a doughtier horseman than the younger So he succeeded to the empire when he ruled the land and forded it over his lieges with justice so exemplary that he was beloved by all the peoples of his capital and of his kingdom His name was King Shahryar FN three and he made his younger brother Shah Zaman hight King of Samarcand in Barbarian land These two ceased not to abide in their several realms and the law was ever carried out in their dominions and each ruled his own kingdom with equity and fair dealing to his subjects in extreme solace and enjoyment and this condition continually endured for a score of years But at the end of the twentieth twelvemonth the elder King yearned for a sight of his younger brother and felt that he must look upon him once more So he took counsel with his Wazir FN four about visiting him but the Minister finding the project unadvisable recommended that a letter be written and a present be sent under his charge to the younger brother with an invitation to visit the elder Having accepted this advice the King forthwith bade prepare handsome gifts such as horses with saddles of gem encrusted gold Mamelukes or white slaves beautiful handmaids high breasted virgins and splendid stuffs and costly He then wrote a letter to Shah Zaman expressing his warm love and great wish to see him ending with these words We therefore hope of the favour and affection of the beloved brother that he will condescend to bestir himself and turn his face us wards Furthermore we have sent our Wazir to make all ordinance for the march and our one and only desire is to see thee ere we die but if thou delay or disappoint us we shall not survive the blow Wherewith peace be upon thee Then King Shahryar having sealed the missive and given it to the Wazir with the offerings aforementioned commanded him to shorten his skirts and strain his strength and make all expedition in going and returning Harkening and obedience quoth the Minister who fell to making ready without stay and packed up his loads and prepared all his requisites without delay This occupied him three days and on the dawn of the fourth he took leave of his King and marched right away over desert and hill way stony waste and pleasant lea without halting by night or by day But whenever he entered a realm whose ruler was subject to his Suzerain where he was greeted with magnificent gifts of gold and silver and all manner of presents fair and rare he would tarry there three days FN five the term of the guest rite and when he left on the fourth he would be honourably escorted for a whole day s march As soon as the Wazir drew near Shah Zaman s court in Samarcand he despatched to report his arrival one of his high officials who presented himself before the King and kissing ground between his hands delivered his message Hereupon the King commanded sundry of his Grandees and Lords of his realm to fare forth and meet his brother s Wazir at the distance of a full day s journey which they did greeting him respectfully and wishing him all prosperity and forming an escort and a procession When he entered the city he proceeded straightway to the palace where he presented himself in the royal presence and after kissing ground and praying for the King s health and happiness and for victory over all his enemies he informed him that his brother was yearning to see him and prayed for the pleasure of a visit He then delivered the letter which Shah Zaman took from his hand and read it contained sundry hints and allusions which required thought but when the King had fully comprehended its import he said I hear and I obey the commands of the beloved brother adding to the Wazir But we will not march till after the third day s hospitality He appointed for the Minister fitting quarters of the palace and pitching tents for the troops rationed them with whatever they might require of meat and drink and other necessaries On the fourth day he made ready for wayfare and got together sumptuous presents befitting his elder brother s majesty and stablished his chief Wazir viceroy of the land during his absence Then he caused his tents and camels and mules to be brought forth and encamped with their bales and loads attend ants and guards within sight of the city in readiness to set out next morning for his brother s capital But when the night was half spent he bethought him that he had forgotten in his palace somewhat which he should have brought with him so he re turned privily and entered his apartments where he found the Queen his wife asleep on his own carpet bed embracing with both arms a black cook of loathsome aspect and foul with kitchen grease and grime When he saw this the world waxed black before his sight and he said If such case happen while I am yet within sight of the city what will be the doings of this damned whore during my long absence at my brother s court So he drew his scymitar and cutting the two in four pieces with a single blow left them on the carpet and returned presently to his camp without letting anyone know of what had happened Then he gave orders for immediate departure and set out at once and began his travel but he could not help thinking over his wife s treason and he kept ever saying to himself How could she do this deed by me How could she work her own death till excessive grief seized him his colour changed to yellow his body waxed weak and he was threatened with a dangerous malady such an one as bringeth men to die So the Wazir shortened his stages and tarried long at the watering stations and did his best to solace the King Now when Shah Zaman drew near the capital of his brother he despatched vaunt couriers and messengers of glad tidings to announce his arrival and Shahryar came forth to meet him with his Wazirs and Emirs and Lords and Grandees of his realm and saluted him and joyed with exceeding joy and caused the city to be decorated in his honour When however the brothers met the elder could not but see the change of complexion in the younger and questioned him of his case whereto he replied Tis caused by the travails of wayfare and my case needs care for I have suffered from the change of water and air but Allah be praised for reuniting me with a brother so dear and so rare On this wise he dissembled and kept his secret adding O King of the time and Caliph of the tide only toil and moil have tinged my face yellow with bile and hath made my eyes sink deep in my head Then the two entered the capital in all honour and the elder brother lodged the younger in a palace overhanging the pleasure garden and after a time seeing his condition still unchanged he attributed it to his separation from his country and kingdom So he let him wend his own ways and asked no questions of him till one day when he again said O my brother I see thou art grown weaker of body and yellower of colour O my brother replied Shah Zaman I have an internal wound FN six still he would not tell him what he had witnessed in his wife Thereupon Shahryar summoned doctors and surgeons and bade them treat his brother according to the rules of art which they did for a whole month but their sherbets and potions naught availed for he would dwell upon the deed of his wife and despondency instead of diminishing prevailed and leach craft treatment utterly failed One day his elder brother said to him I am going forth to hunt and course and to take my pleasure and pastime maybe this would lighten thy heart Shah Zaman however refused saying O my brother my soul yearneth for naught of this sort and I entreat thy favour to suffer me tarry quietly in this place being wholly taken up with my malady So King Shah Zaman passed his night in the palace and next morning when his brother had fared forth he removed from his room and sat him down at one of the lattice windows overlooking the pleasure grounds and there he abode thinking with saddest thought over his wife s betrayal and burning sighs issued from his tortured breast And as he continued in this case lo a pastern of the palace which was carefully kept private swung open and out of it came twenty slave girls surrounding his bother s wife who was wondrous fair a model of beauty and comeliness and symmetry and perfect loveliness and who paced with the grace of a gazelle which panteth for the cooling stream Thereupon Shah Zaman drew back from the window but he kept the bevy in sight espying them from a place whence he could not be espied They walked under the very lattice and advanced a little way into the garden till they came to a jetting fountain amiddlemost a great basin of water then they stripped off their clothes and behold ten of them were women concubines of the King and the other ten were white slaves Then they all paired off each with each but the Queen who was left alone presently cried out in a loud voice Here to me O my lord Saeed and then sprang with a drop leap from one of the trees a big slobbering blackamoor with rolling eyes which showed the whites a truly hideous sight FN seven He walked boldly up to her and threw his arms round her neck while she embraced him as warmly then he bussed her and winding his legs round hers as a button loop clasps a button he threw her and enjoyed her On like wise did the other slaves with the girls till all had satisfied their passions and they ceased not from kissing and clipping coupling and carousing till day began to wane when the Mamelukes rose from the damsels bosoms and the blackamoor slave dismounted from the Queen s breast the men resumed their disguises and all except the negro who swarmed up the tree entered the palace and closed the postern door as before Now when Shah Zaman saw this conduct of his sister in law he said in himself By Allah my calamity is lighter than this My brother is a greater King among the kings than I am yet this infamy goeth on in his very palace and his wife is in love with that filthiest of filthy slaves But this only showeth that they all do it FN eight and that there is no woman but who cuckoldeth her husband then the curse of Allah upon one and all and upon the fools who lean against them for support or who place the reins of conduct in their hands So he put away his melancholy and despondency regret and repine and allayed his sorrow by constantly repeating those words adding Tis my conviction that no man in this world is safe from their malice When supper time came they brought him the trays and he ate with voracious appetite for he had long refrained from meat feeling unable to touch any dish however dainty Then he returned grateful thanks to Almighty Allah praising Him and blessing Him and he spent a most restful night it having been long since he had savoured the sweet food of sleep Next day he broke his fast heartily and began to recover health and strength and presently regained excellent condition His brother came back from the chase ten days after when he rode out to meet him and they saluted each other and when King Shahryar looked at King Shah Zaman he saw how the hue of health had returned to him how his face had waxed ruddy and how he ate with an appetite after his late scanty diet He wondered much and said O my brother I was so anxious that thou wouldst join me in hunting and chasing and wouldst take thy pleasure and pastime in my dominion He thanked him and excused himself then the two took horse and rode into the city and when they were seated at their ease in the palace the food trays were set before them and they ate their sufficiency After the meats were removed and they had washed their hands King Shahryar turned to his brother and said My mind is overcome with wonderment at thy condition I was desirous to carry thee with me to the chase but I saw thee changed in hue pale and wan to view and in sore trouble of mind too But now Alham dolillah glory be to God I see thy natural colour hath returned to thy face and that thou art again in the best of case It was my belief that thy sickness came of severance from thy family and friends and absence from capital and country so I refrained from troubling thee with further questions But now I beseech thee to expound to me the cause of thy complaint and thy change of colour and to explain the reason of thy recovery and the return to the ruddy hue of health which I am wont to view So speak out and hide naught When Shah Zaman heard this he bowed groundwards awhile his head then raised it and said I will tell thee what caused my complaint and my loss of colour but excuse my acquainting thee with the cause of its return to me and the reason of my complete recovery indeed I pray thee not to press me for a reply Said Shahryar who was much surprised by these words Let me hear first what produced thy pallor and thy poor condition Know then O my brother rejoined Shah Zaman that when thou sentest thy Wazir with the invitation to place myself between thy hands I made ready and marched out of my city but presently I minded me having left behind me in the palace a string of jewels intended as a gift to thee I returned for it alone and found my wife on my carpet bed and in the arms of a hideous black cook So I slew the twain and came to thee yet my thoughts brooded over this business and I lost my bloom and became weak But excuse me if I still refuse to tell thee what was the reason of my complexion returning Shahryar shook his head marvelling with extreme marvel and with the fire of wrath flaming up from his heart he cried Indeed the malice of woman is mighty Then he took refuge from them with Allah and said In very sooth O my brother thou hast escaped many an evil by putting thy wife to death FN nine and right excusable were thy wrath and grief for such mishap which never yet befel crowned King like thee By Allah had the case been mine I would not have been satisfied without slaying a thousand women and that way madness lies But now praise be to Allah who hath tempered to thee thy tribulation and needs must thou acquaint me with that which so suddenly restored to thee complexion and health and explain to me what causeth this concealment O King of the Age again I pray thee excuse my so doing Nay but thou must I fear O my brother lest the recital cause thee more anger and sorrow than afflicted me That were but a better reason quoth Shahryar for telling me the whole history and I conjure thee by Allah not to keep back aught from me Thereupon Shah Zaman told him all he had seen from commencement to con elusion ending with these words When I beheld thy calamity and the treason of thy wife O my brother and I resected that thou art in years my senior and in sovereignty my superior mine own sorrow was belittled by the comparison and my mind recovered tone and temper so throwing off melancholy and despondency I was able to eat and drink and sleep and thus I speedily regained health and strength Such is the truth and the whole truth When King Shahryar heard this he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and rage was like to strangle him but presently he recovered himself and said O my brother I would not give thee the lie in this matter but I cannot credit it till I see it with mine own eyes An thou wouldst look upon thy calamity quoth Shah Zaman rise at once and make ready again for hunting and coursing FN ten and then hide thyself with me so shalt thou witness it and thine eyes shall verify it True quoth the King whereupon he let make proclamation of his in tent to travel and the troops and tents fared forth without the city camping within sight and Shahryar sallied out with them and took seat amidmost his host bidding the slaves admit no man to him When night came on he summoned his Wazir and said to him Sit thou in my stead and let none wot of my absence till the term of three days Then the brothers disguised themselves and returned by night with all secrecy to the palace where they passed the dark hours and at dawn they seated themselves at the lattice overlooking the pleasure grounds when presently the Queen and her handmaids came out as before and passing under the windows made for the fountain Here they stripped ten of them being men to ten women and the King s wife cried out Where art thou O Saeed The hideous blackamoor dropped from the tree straightway and rushing into her arms without stay or delay cried out I am Sa ad al Din Saood FN eleven The lady laughed heartily and all fell to satisfying their lusts and remained so occupied for a couple of hours when the white slaves rose up from the handmaidens breasts and the blackamoor dismounted from the Queen s bosom then they went into the basin and after performing the Ghusl or complete ablution donned their dresses and retired as they had done before When King Shahryar saw this infamy of his wife and concubines he became as one distraught and he cried out Only in utter solitude can man be safe from the doings of this vile world By Allah life is naught but one great wrong Presently he added Do not thwart me O my brother in what I propose and the other answered I will not So he said Let us up as we are and depart forthright hence for we have no concern with Kingship and let us overwander Allah s earth worshipping the Almighty till we find some one to whom the like calamity hath happened and if we find none then will death be more welcome to us than life So the two brothers issued from a second private postern of the palace and they never stinted wayfaring by day and by night until they reached a tree a middle of a meadow hard by a spring of sweet water on the shore of the salt sea Both drank of it and sat down to take their rest and when an hour of the day had gone by lo they heard a mighty roar and uproar in the middle of the main as though the heavens were falling upon the earth and the sea brake with waves before them and from it towered a black pillar which grew and grew till it rose skywards and began making for that meadow Seeing it they waxed fearful exceedingly and climbed to the top of the tree which was a lofty whence they gazed to see what might be the matter And behold it was a Jinni FN twelve huge of height and burly of breast and bulk broad of brow and black of blee bearing on his head a coffer of crystal He strode to land wading through the deep and coming to the tree whereupon were the two Kings seated himself beneath it He then set down the coffer on its bottom and out it drew a casket with seven padlocks of steel which he unlocked with seven keys of steel he took from beside his thigh and out of it a young lady to come was seen white skinned and of winsomest mien of stature fine and thin and bright as though a moon of the fourteenth night she had been or the sun raining lively sheen Even so the poet Utayyah hath excellently said She rose like the morn as she shone through the night And she gilded the grove with her gracious sight From her radiance the sun taketh increase when She unveileth and shameth the moonshine bright Bow down all beings between her hands As she showeth charms with her veil undight And she foodeth cities FN thirteen with torrent tears When she flasheth her look of levee light The Jinni seated her under the tree by his side and looking at her said O choicest love of this heart of mine O dame of noblest line whom I snatched away on thy bride night that none might prevent me taking thy maidenhead or tumble thee before I did and whom none save myself hath loved or hath enjoyed O my sweetheart I would fief sleep a little while He then laid his head upon the lady s thighs and stretching out his legs which extended down to the sea slept and snored and sparked like the roll of thunder Presently she raised her head towards the tree top and saw the two Kings perched near the summit then she softly lifted off her lap the Jinni s pate which she was tired of supporting and placed it upon the ground then standing upright under the tree signed to the Kings Come ye down ye two and fear naught from this Ifrit FN fourteen They were in a terrible fright when they found that she had seen them and answered her in the same manner Allah upon thee FN fifteen and by thy modesty O lady excuse us from coming down But she rejoined by saying Allah upon you both that ye come down forthright and if ye come not I will rouse upon you my husband this Ifrit and he shall do you to die by the illest of deaths and she continued making signals to them So being afraid they came down to her and she rose be fore them and said Stroke me a strong stroke without stay or delay otherwise will I arouse and set upon you this Ifrit who shall slay you straightway They said to her O our lady we conjure thee by Allah let us off this work for we are fugitives from such and in extreme dread and terror of this thy husband How then can we do it in such a way as thou desires Leave this talk it needs must be so quoth she and she swore them by Him FN sixteen who raised the skies on high without prop or pillar that if they worked not her will she would cause them to be slain and cast into the sea Whereupon out of fear King Shahryar said to King Shah Zaman O my brother do thou what she biddeth thee do but he replied I will not do it till thou do it before I do And they began disputing about futtering her Then quoth she to the twain How is it I see you disputing and demurring if ye do not come forward like men and do the deed of kind ye two I will arouse upon you the If rit At this by reason of their sore dread of the Jinni both did by her what she bade them do and when they had dismounted from her she said Well done She then took from her pocket a purse and drew out a knotted string whereon were strung five hundred and seventy FN seventeen seal rings and asked Know ye what be these They answered her saying We know not Then quoth she These be the signets of five hundred and seventy men who have all futtered me upon the horns of this foul this foolish this filthy Ifrit so give me also your two seal rings ye pair of brothers When they had drawn their two rings from their hands and given them to her she said to them Of a truth this If rit bore me off on my bride night and put me into a casket and set the casket in a coffer and to the coffer he affixed seven strong padlocks of steel and deposited me on the deep bottom of the sea that raves dashing and clashing with waves and guarded me so that I might remain chaste and honest quotha none save himself might have connexion with me But I have lain under as many of my kind as I please and this wretched Jinni wotteth not that Des tiny may not be averted nor hindered by aught and that whatso woman willeth the same she fulfilleth however man nilleth Even so saith one of them Rely not on women Trust not to their hearts Whose joys and whose sorrows Are hung to their parts Lying love they will swear thee Whence guile ne er departs Take Yusuf FN eighteen for sample Ware sleights and ware smarts Iblis FN nineteen ousted Adam See ye not thro their arts And another saith Stint thy blame man Twill drive to a passion without bound My fault is not so heavy as fault in it hast found If true lover I become then to me there cometh not Save what happened unto many in the bygone stound For wonderful is he and right worthy of our praise Who from wiles of female wits kept him safe and kept him sound Hearing these words they marvelled with exceeding marvel and she went from them to the Ifrit and taking up his head on her thigh as before said to them softly Now wend your ways and bear yourselves beyond the bounds of his malice So they fared forth saying either to other Allah Allah and There be no Majesty and there be no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great and with Him we seek refuge from women s malice and sleight for of a truth it hath no mate in might Consider O my brother the ways of this marvellous lady with an Ifrit who is so much more powerful than we are Now since there hath hap pened to him a greater mishap than that which befel us and which should bear us abundant consolation so return we to our countries and capitals and let us decide never to intermarry with womankind and presently we will show them what will be our action Thereupon they rode back to the tents of King Shahryar which they reached on the morning of the third day and having mustered the Wazirs and Emirs the Chamberlains and high officials he gave a robe of honour to his Viceroy and issued orders for an immediate return to the city There he sat him upon his throne and sending for the Chief Minister the father of the two damsels who Inshallah will presently be mentioned he said I command thee to take my wife and smite her to death for she hath broken her plight and her faith So he carried her to the place of execution and did her die Then King Shahryar took brand in hand and repairing to the Serraglio slew all the concubines and their Mamelukes FN twenty He also sware himself by a binding oath that whatever wife he married he would abate her maidenhead at night and slay her next morning to make sure of his honour For said he there never was nor is there one chaste woman upon face of earth Then Shah Zaman prayed for permission to fare homewards and he went forth equipped and escorted and travelled till he reached his own country Mean while Shahryar commanded his Wazir to bring him the bride of the night that he might go in to her so he produced a most beautiful girl the daughter of one of the Emirs and the King went in unto her at eventide and when morning dawned he bade his Minister strike off her head and the Wazir did accordingly for fear of the Sultan On this wise he continued for the space of three years marrying a maiden every night and killing her the next morning till folk raised an outcry against him and cursed him praying Allah utterly to destroy him and his rule and women made an uproar and mothers wept and parents fled with their daughters till there remained not in the city a young person fit for carnal copulation Presently the King ordered his Chief Wazir the same who was charged with the executions to bring him a virgin as was his wont and the Minister went forth and searched and found none so he returned home in sorrow and anxiety fearing for his life from the King Now he had two daughters Shahrazad and Dunyazad hight FN twenty one of whom the elder had perused the books annals and legends of preceding Kings and the stories examples and instances of by gone men and things indeed it was said that she had collected a thousand books of histories relating to antique races and departed rulers She had perused the works of the poets and knew them by heart she had studied philosophy and the sciences arts and accomplish meets and she was pleasant and polite wise and witty well read and well bred Now on that day she said to her father Why do I see thee thus changed and laden with cark and care Concerning this matter quoth one of the poets Tell whoso hath sorrow Grief never shall last E en as joy hath no morrow So woe shall go past When the Wazir heard from his daughter these words he related to her from first to last all that had happened between him and the King Thereupon said she By Allah O my father how long shall this slaughter of women endure Shall I tell thee what is in my mind in order to save both sides from destruction Say on O my daughter quoth he and quoth she I wish thou wouldst give me in marriage to this King Shahryar either I shall live or I shall be a ransom for the virgin daughters of Moslems and the cause of their deliverance from his hands and thine FN twenty two Allah upon thee cried he in wrath exceeding that lacked no feeding O scanty of wit expose not thy life to such peril How durst thou address me in words so wide from wisdom and un far from foolishness Know that one who lacketh experience in worldly matters readily falleth into misfortune and whoso considereth not the end keepeth not the world to friend and the vulgar say I was lying at mine ease nought but my officiousness brought me unease Needs must thou she broke in make me a doer of this good deed and let him kill me an he will I shall only die a ransom for others O my daughter asked he and how shall that profit thee when thou shalt have thrown away thy life and she answered O my father it must be come of it what will The Wazir was again moved to fury and blamed and reproached her ending with In very deed I fear lest the same befal thee which befel the Bull and the Ass with the Husband man And what asked she befel them O my father Whereupon the Wazir began the Tale of the Bull FN twenty three and the Ass Know O my daughter that there was once a merchant who owned much money and many men and who was rich in cattle and camels he had also a wife and family and he dwelt in the country being experienced in husbandry and devoted to agriculture Now Allah Most High had endowed him with under standing the tongues of beasts and birds of every kind but under pain of death if he divulged the gift to any So he kept it secret for very fear He had in his cow house a Bull and an Ass each tethered in his own stall one hard by the other As the merchant was sitting near hand one day with his servants and his children were playing about him he heard the Bull say to the Ass Hail and health to thee O Father of Waking FN twenty four for that thou enjoyest rest and good ministering all under thee is clean swept and fresh sprinkled men wait upon thee and feed thee and thy provaunt is sifted barley and thy drink pure spring water while I unhappy creature am led forth in the middle of the night when they set on my neck the plough and a something called Yoke and I tire at cleaving the earth from dawn of day till set of sun I am forced to do more than I can and to bear all manner of ill treatment from night to night after which they take me back with my sides torn my neck flayed my legs aching and mine eyelids sored with tears Then they shut me up in the byre and throw me beans and crushed straw FN twenty five mixed with dirt and chaff and I lie in dung and filth and foul stinks through the livelong night But thou art ever in a place swept and sprinkled and cleansed and thou art always lying at ease save when it happens and seldom enough that the master hath some business when he mounts thee and rides thee to town and returns with thee forthright So it happens that I am toiling and distress while thou takest thine ease and thy rest thou sleepest while I am sleepless I hunger still while thou eatest thy fill and I win contempt while thou winnest good will When the Bull ceased speaking the Ass turned to wards him and said O Broad o Brow FN twenty six zero thou lost one he lied not who dubbed thee Bull head for thou O father of a Bull hast neither forethought nor contrivance thou art the simplest of simpletons FN twenty seven and thou knowest naught of good advisers Hast thou not heard the saying of the wise For others these hardships and labours I bear And theirs is the pleasure and mine is the care As the bleacher who blacketh his brow in the sun To whiten the raiment which other men wear FN twenty eight But thou O fool art full of zeal and thou toilest and moilest before the master and thou tearest and wearest and slayest thy self for the comfort of another Hast thou never heard the saw that saith None to guide and from the way go wide Thou wendest forth at the call to dawn prayer and thou returnest not till sundown and through the livelong day thou endurest all manner hardships to wit beating and belabouring and bad language Now hearken to me Sir Bull when they tie thee to thy stinking manger thou pawest the ground with thy forehand and rashest out with thy hind hoofs and pushest with thy horns and bellowest aloud so they deem thee contented And when they throw thee thy fodder thou fallest on it with greed and hastenest to line thy fair fat paunch But if thou accept my advice it will be better for thee and thou wilt lead an easier life even than mine When thou goest a field and they lay the thing called Yoke on thy neck lie down and rise not again though haply they swinge thee and if thou rise lie down a second time and when they bring thee home and offer thee thy beans fall backwards and only sniff at thy meat and withdraw thee and taste it not and be satis fied with thy crushed straw and chaff and on this wise feign thou art sick and cease not doing thus for a day or two days or even three days so shalt thou have rest from toil and moil When the Bull heard these words he knew the Ass to be his friend and thanked him saying Right is thy rede and prayed that all blessings might requite him and cried O Father Wakener FN twenty nine thou hast made up for my failings Now FN thirty the merchant O my daughter understood all that passed between them Next day the driver took the Bull and settling the plough on his neck FN thirty one made him work as wont but the Bull began to shirk his ploughing according to the advice of the Ass and the ploughman drubbed him till he broke the yoke and made off but the man caught him up and leathered him till he despaired of his life Not the less however would he do nothing but stand still and drop down till the evening Then the herd led him home and stabled him in his stall but he drew back from his manger and neither stamped nor ramped nor butted nor bellowed as he was wont to do whereat the man wondered He brought him the beans and husks but he sniffed at them and left them and lay down as far from them as he could and passed the whole night fasting The peasant came next morning and seeing the manger full of beans the crushed straw untasted and the ox lying on his back in sorriest plight with legs outstretched and swollen belly he was concerned for him and said to himself By Allah he hath assuredly sickened and this is the cause why he would not plough yesterday Then he went to the merchant and reported O my master the Bull is ailing he refused his fodder last night nay more he hath not tasted a scrap of it this morning Now the merchant farmer understood what all this meant because he had overheard the talk between the Bull and the Ass so quoth he Take that rascal donkey and set the yoke on his neck and bind him to the plough and make him do Bull s work Thereupon the ploughman took the Ass and worked him through the live long day at the Bull s task and when he failed for weakness he made him eat stick till his ribs were sore and his sides were sunken and his neck was hayed by the yoke and when he came home in the evening he could hardly drag his limbs along either fore hand or hind legs But as for the Bull he had passed the day lying at full length and had eaten his fodder with an excellent appetite and he ceased not calling down blessings on the Ass for his good advice unknowing what had come to him on his ac count So when night set in and the Ass returned to the byte the Bull rose up before him in honour and said May good tidings gladden thy heart O Father Wakener through thee I have rested all this day and I have eaten my meat in peace and quiet But the Ass returned no reply for wrath and heart burning and fatigue and the beating he had gotten and he repented with the most grievous of repentance and quoth he to himself This cometh of my folly in giving good counsel as the saw saith I was in joy and gladness nought save my officiousness brought me this sadness But I will bear in mind my innate worth and the nobility of my nature for what saith the poet Shall the beautiful hue of the Basil FN thirty two fail Tho the beetle s foot o er the Basil crawl And though spider and fly be its denizens Shall disgrace attach to the royal hall The cowrie FN thirty three I ken shall have currency But the pearl s clear drop shall its value fall And now I must take thought and put a trick upon him and return him to his place else I die Then he went aweary to his manger while the Bull thanked him and blessed him And even so O my daughter said the Wazir thou wilt die for lack of wits therefore sit thee still and say naught and expose not thy life to such stress for by Allah I offer thee the best advice which cometh of my affection and kindly solicitude for thee O my father she answered needs must I go up to this King and be married to him Quoth he Do not this deed and quoth she Of a truth I will whereat he rejoined If thou be not silent and bide still I will do with thee even what the merchant did with his wife And what did he asked she Know then answered the Wazir that after the return of the Ass the merchant came out on the terrace roof with his wife and family for it was a moonlit night and the moon at its full Now the ter race overlooked the cowhouse and presently as he sat there with his children playing about him the trader heard the Ass say to the Bull Tell me O Father Broad o Brow what thou purposest to do to morrow The Bull answered What but continue to follow thy counsel O Aliboron Indeed it was as good as good could be and it hath given me rest and repose nor will I now depart from it one little so when they bring me my meat I will refuse it and blow out my belly and counterfeit crank The Ass shook his head and said Beware of so doing O Father of a Bull The Bull asked Why and the Ass answered Know that I am about to give thee the best of counsel for verily I heard our owner say to the herd If the Bull rise not from his place to do his work this morning and if he retire from his fodder this day make him over to the butcher that he may slaughter him and give his flesh to the poor and fashion a bit of leather FN thirty four from his hide Now I fear for thee on account of this So take my advice ere a calamity befal thee and when they bring thee thy fodder eat it and rise up and bellow and paw the ground or our master will assuredly slay thee and peace be with thee Thereupon the Bull arose and lowed aloud and thanked the Ass and said To morrow I will readily go forth with them and he at once ate up all his meat and even licked the manger All this took place and the owner was listening to their talk Next morning the trader and his wife went to the Bull s crib and sat down and the driver came and led forth the Bull who seeing his owner whisked his tail and brake wind and frisked about so lustily that the merchant laughed a loud laugh and kept laughing till he fell on his back His wife asked him Whereat laughest thou with such loud laughter as this and he answered her I laughed at a secret something which I have heard and seen but cannot say lest I die my death She returned Perforce thou must discover it to me and disclose the cause of thy laughing even if thou come by thy death But he rejoined I cannot re veal what beasts and birds say in their lingo for fear I die Then quoth she By Allah thou liest this is a mere pretext thou laughest at none save me and now thou wouldest hide somewhat from me But by the Lord of the Heavens an thou disclose not the cause I will no longer cohabit with thee I will leave thee at once And she sat down and cried Whereupon quoth the merchant Woe betide thee what means thy weeping Bear Allah and leave these words and query me no more questions Needs must thou tell me the cause of that laugh said she and he replied Thou wottest that when I prayed Allah to vouchsafe me understanding of the tongues of beasts and birds I made a vow never to disclose the secret to any under pain of dying on the spot No matter cried she tell me what secret passed between the Bull and the Ass and die this very hour an thou be so minded and she ceased not to importune him till he was worn out and clean distraught So at last he said Summon thy father and thy mother and our kith and kin and sundry of our neighbours which she did and he sent for the Kazi FN thirty five and his assessors intending to make his will and reveal to her his secret and die the death for he loved her with love exceeding because she was his cousin the daughter of his father s brother and the mother of his children and he had lived with her a life of an hundred and twenty years Then having assembled all the family and the folk of his neighbourhood he said to them By me there hangeth a strange story and tis such that if I discover the secret to any I am a dead man Therefore quoth every one of those present to the woman Allah upon thee leave this sinful obstinacy and recognise the right of this matter lest haply thy husband and the father of thy children die But she rejoined I will not turn from it till he tell me even though he come by his death So they ceased to urge her and the trader rose from amongst them and repaired to an out house to per form Wuzu ablution FN thirty six and he purposed thereafter to return and to tell them his secret and to die Now daughter Shahrazad that mer chant had in his out houses some fifty hens under one cock and whilst making ready to farewell his folk he heard one of his many farm dogs thus address in his own tongue the Cock who was flapping his wings and crowing lustily and jumping from one hen s back to another and treading all in turn saying O Chanti clear how mean is thy wit and how shameless is thy conduct Be he disappointed who brought thee up FN thirty seven Art thou not ashamed of thy doings on such a day as this And what asked the Rooster hath occurred this day when the Dog answered Doss thou not know that our master is this day making ready for his death His wife is resolved that he shall disclose the secret taught to him by Allah and the moment he so doeth he shall surely die We dogs are all a mourning but thou clappest thy wings and clarionest thy loudest and treadest hen after hen Is this an hour for pastime and pleasuring Art thou not ashamed of thyself FN thirty eight Then by Allah quoth the Cock is our master a lack wit and a man scanty of sense if he cannot manage matters with a single wife his life is not worth prolonging Now I have some fifty Dame Partlets and I please this and provoke that and starve one and stuff another and through my good governance they are all well under my control This our master pretendeth to wit and wisdom and he hath but one wife and yet knoweth not how to manage her Asked the Dog What then O Cock should the master do to win clear of his strait He should arise forthright answered the Cock and take some twigs from yon mulberry tree and give her a regular back basting and rib roasting till she cry I repent O my lord I will never ask thee a question as long as I live Then let him beat her once more and soundly and when he shall have done this he shall sleep free from care and enjoy life But this master of ours owns neither sense nor judgment Now daughter Shahrazad continued the Wazir I will do to thee as did that husband to that wife Said Shahrazad And what did he do He replied When the merchant heard the wise words spoken by his Cock to his Dog he arose in haste and sought his wife s chamber after cutting for her some mulberry twigs and hiding them there and then he called to her Come into the closet that I may tell thee the secret while no one seeth me and then die She entered with him and he locked the door and came down upon her with so sound a beating of back and shoulders ribs arms and legs saying the while Wilt thou ever be asking questions about what concerneth thee not that she was well nigh senseless Presently she cried out I am of the repentant By Allah I will ask thee no more questions and indeed I repent sincerely and wholesomely Then she kissed his hand and feet and he led her out of the room submissive as a wife should be Her parents and all the company rejoiced and sadness and mourn ing were changed into joy and gladness Thus the merchant learnt family discipline from his Cock and he and his wife lived together the happiest of lives until death And thou also O my daughter continued the Wazir Unless thou turn from this matter I will do by thee what that trader did to his wife But she answered him with much decision I will never desist O my father nor shall this tale change my purpose Leave such talk and tattle I will not listen to thy words and if thou deny me I will marry myself to him despite the nose of thee And first I will go up to the King myself and alone and I will say to him I prayed my father to wive me with thee but he refused being resolved to disappoint his lord grudging the like of me to the like of thee Her father asked Must this needs be and she answered Even so Hereupon the Wazir being weary of lamenting and contending persuading and dissuading her all to no purpose went up to King Shahryar and after blessing him and kissing the ground before him told him all about his dispute with his daughter from first to last and how he designed to bring her to him that night The King wondered with exceeding wonder for he had made an especial exception of the Wazir s daughter and said to him O most faithful of Counsellors how is this Thou wottest that I have sworn by the Raiser of the Heavens that after I have gone in to her this night I shall say to thee on the morrow s morning Take her and slay her and if thou slay her not I will slay thee in her stead without fail Allah guide thee to glory and lengthen thy life O King of the age answered the Wazir it is she that hath so determined all this have I told her and more but she will not hearken to me and she persisteth in passing this coming night with the King s Majesty So Shahryar rejoiced greatly and said Tis well go get her ready and this night bring her to me The Wazir returned to his daughter and reported to her the command saying Allah make not thy father desolate by thy loss But Shah razed rejoiced with exceeding joy and get ready all she required and said to her younger sister Dunyazad Note well what directions I entrust to thee When I have gone in to the King I will send for thee and when thou comest to me and seest that he hath had his carnal will of me do thou say to me O my sister an thou be not sleepy relate to me some new story delectable and delightsome the better to speed our waking hours and I will tell thee a tale which shall be our deliverance if so Allah please and which shall turn the King from his blood thirsty custom Dunyazad answered With love and gladness So when it was night their father the Wazir carried Shahrazad to the King who was gladdened at the sight and asked Hast thou brought me my need and he answered I have But when the King took her to his bed and fell to toying with her and wished to go in to her she wept which made him ask What aileth thee She replied O King of the age I have a younger sister and fief would I take leave of her this night before I see the dawn So he sent at once for Dunyazad and she came and kissed the ground between his hands when he permitted her to take her seat near the foot of the couch Then the King arose and did away with his bride s maidenhead and the three fell asleep But when it was midnight Shahrazad awoke and signalled to her sister Dunyazad who sat up and said Allah upon thee O my sister recite to us some new story delightsome and delectable wherewith to while away the waking hours of our latter night FN thirty nine With joy and goodly gree answered Shahrazad if this pious and auspicious King permit me Tell on quoth the King who chanced to be sleepless and restless and therefore was pleased with the prospect of hearing her story So Shahrazad rejoiced and thus on the first night of the Thousand Nights and a Night she began with the TALE OF THE TRADER AND THE JINNI It is related O auspicious King that there was a merchant of the merchants who had much wealth and business in various cities Now on a day he mounted horse and went forth to re cover monies in certain towns and the heat sore oppressed him so he sat beneath a tree and putting his hand into his saddle bags took thence some broken bread and dry dates and began to break his fast When he had ended eating the dates he threw away the stones with force and lo an Ifrit appeared huge of stature and brandishing a drawn sword wherewith he approached the mer chant and said Stand up that I may slay thee even as thou slewest my son Asked the merchant How have I slain thy son and he answered When thou atest dates and threwest away the stones they struck my son full in the breast as he was walking by so that he died forthwith FN forty Quoth the merchant Verily from Allah we proceeded and unto Allah are we re turning There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great If I slew thy son I slew him by chance medley I pray thee now pardon me Rejoined the Jinni There is no help but I must slay thee Then he seized him and dragged him along and casting him to the earth raised the sword to strike him whereupon the merchant wept and said I commit my case to Allah and began repeating these couplets Containeth Time a twain of days this of blessing that of bane And holdeth Life a twain of halves this of pleasure that of pain See saint not when blows the hurricane sweeping stark and striking strong None save the forest giant feels the suffering of the strain How many trees earth nourisheth of the dry and of the green Yet none but those which bear the fruits for cast of stone complain See saint not how corpses rise and float on the surface of the tide While pearls o price lie hidden in the deepest of the main In Heaven are unnumbered the many of the stars Yet ne er a star but Sun and Moon by eclipse is overta en Well judgedst thou the days that saw thy faring sound and well And countedst not the pangs and pain whereof Fate is ever fain The nights have kept thee safe and the safety brought thee pride But bliss and blessings of the night are genderers of bane When the merchant ceased repeating his verses the Jinni said to him Cut thy words short by Allah needs must I slay thee But the merchant spake him thus Know O thou Ifrit that I have debts due to me and much wealth and children and a wife and many pledges in hand so permit me to go home and dis charge to every claimant his claim and I will come back to thee at the head of the new year Allah be my testimony and surety that I will return to thee and then thou mayest do with me as thou wilt and Allah is witness to what I say The Jinni took sure promise of him and let him go so he returned to his own city and transacted his business and rendered to all men their dues and after informing his wife and children of what had betided him he appointed a guardian and dwelt with them for a full year Then he arose and made the Wuzu ablution to purify himself before death and took his shroud under his arm and bade farewell to his people his neighbours and all his kith and kin and went forth despite his own nose FN forty one They then began weeping and wailing and beating their breasts over him but he travelled until he arrived at the same garden and the day of his arrival was the head of the New Year As he sat weeping over what had befallen him behold a Shaykh FN forty two a very ancient man drew near leading a chained gazelle and he saluted that merchant and wishing him long life said What is the cause of thy sitting in this place and thou alone and this be a resort of evil spirits The merchant related to him what had come to pass with the Ifrit and the old man the owner of the gazelle wondered and said By Allah O brother thy faith is none other than exceeding faith and thy story right strange were it graven with gravers on the eye corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned Then seating himself near the merchant he said By Allah O my brother I will not leave thee until I see what may come to pass with thee and this Ifrit And presently as he sat and the two were at talk the merchant began to feel fear and terror and exceeding grief and sorrow beyond relief and ever growing care and extreme despair And the owner of the gazelle was hard by his side when behold a second Shaykh approached them and with him were two dogs both of greyhound breed and both black The second old man after saluting them with the salam also asked them of their tidings and said What causeth you to sit in this place a dwelling of the Jann FN forty three So they told him the tale from beginning to end and their stay there had not lasted long before there came up a third Shaykh and with him a she mule of bright bay coat and he saluted them and asked them why they were seated in that place So they told him the story from first to last and of no avail O my master is a twice told tale There he sat down with them and lo a dust cloud advanced and a mighty send devil appeared amidmost of the waste Presently the cloud opened and behold within it was that Jinni hending in hand a drawn sword while his eyes were shooting fire sparks of rage He came up to them and haling away the merchant from among them cried to him Arise that I may slay thee as thou slewest my son the life stuff of my liver FN forty four The merchant wailed and wept and the three old men began sighing and crying and weeping and wailing with their companion Presently the first old man the owner of the gazelle came out from among them and kissed the hand of the Ifrit and said O Jinni thou Crown of the Kings of the Jann were I to tell thee the story of me and this gazelle and thou shouldst consider it wondrous wouldst thou give me a third part of this merchant s blood Then quoth the Jinni Even so O Shaykh if thou tell me this tale and I hold it a marvellous then will I give thee a third of his blood Thereupon the old man began to tell The First Shaykh s Story Know O Jinni that this gazelle is the daughter of my paternal uncle my own flesh and blood and I married her when she was a young maid and I lived with her well nigh thirty years yet was I not blessed with issue by her So I took me a concubine FN forty five who brought to me the boon of a male child fair as the full moon with eyes of lovely shine and eyebrows which formed one line and limbs of perfect design Little by little he grew in stature and waxed tall and when he was a lad fifteen years old it became needful I should journey to certain cities and I travelled with great store of goods But the daughter of my uncle this gazelle had learned gramarye and egromancy and clerkly craft FN forty six from her childhood so she bewitched that son of mine to a calf and my handmaid his mother to a heifer and made them over to the herdsman s care Now when I returned after a long time from my journey and asked for my son and his mother she answered me saying Thy slave girl is dead and thy son hath fled and I know not whither he is sped So I remained for a whole year with grieving heart and streaming eyes until the time came for the Great Festival of Allah FN forty seven Then sent I to my herdsman bidding him choose for me a fat heifer and he brought me one which was the damsel my handmaid whom this gazelle had ensorcelled I tucked up my sleeves and skirt and taking a knife proceeded to cut her throat but she lowed aloud and wept bitter tears Thereat I marvelled and pity seized me and I held my hand saying to the herd Bring me other than this Then cried my cousin Slay her for I have not a fatter nor a fairer Once more I went forward to sacrifice her but she again lowed aloud upon which in ruth I refrained and commanded the herdsman to slay her and flay her He killed her and skinned her but found in her neither fat nor flesh only hide and bone and I repented when penitence availed me naught I gave her to the herdsman and said to him Fetch me a fat calf so he brought my son ensorcelled When the calf saw me he brake his tether and ran to me and fawned upon me and wailed and shed tears so that I took pity on him and said to the herdsman Bring me a heifer and let this calf go Thereupon my cousin this gazelle called aloud at me saying Needs must thou kill this calf this is a holy day and a blessed whereon naught is slain save what be perfect pure and we have not amongst our calves any fatter or fairer than this Quoth I Look thou upon the condition of the heifer which I slaughtered at thy bidding and how we turn from her in disappointment and she profited us on no wise and I repent with an exceeding repentance of having killed her so this time I will not obey thy bidding for the sacrifice of this calf Quoth she By Allah the Most Great the Compassionating the Compassionate there is no help for it thou must kill him on this holy day and if thou kill him not to me thou art no man and I to thee am no wife Now when I heard those hard words not knowing her object I went up to the calf knife in hand And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say FN forty eight Then quoth her sister to her How fair is thy tale and how grateful and how sweet and how tasteful And Shahrazad answered her What is this to that I could tell thee on the coming night were I to live and the King would spare me Then said the King in himself By Allah I will not slay her until I shall have heard the rest of her tale So they slept the rest of that night in mutual em brace till day fully brake Then the King went forth to his audience hall FN forty nine and the Wazir went up with his daughter s shroud under his arm The King issued his orders and promoted this and deposed that until the end of the day and he told the Wazir no whit of what had happened But the Minister wondered thereat with exceeding wonder and when the Court broke up King Shahryar entered his palace When it was the Second Night said Dunyazad to her sister Shahrazad O my sister finish for us that story of the Merchant and the Jinni and she answered With joy and goodly gree if the King permit me Then quoth the King Tell thy tale and Shahrazad began in these words It hath reached me O auspicious King and Heaven directed Ruler that when the merchant purposed the sacrifice of the calf but saw it weeping his heart relented and he said to the herdsman Keep the calf among my cattle All this the old Shaykh told the Jinni who marvelled much at these strange words Then the owner of the gazelle continued O Lord of the Kings of the Jann this much took place and my uncle s daughter this gazelle looked on and saw it and said Butcher me this calf for surely it is a fat one but I bade the herdsman take it away and he took it and turned his face homewards On the next day as I was sitting in my own house lo the herdsman came and standing before me said O my master I will tell thee a thing which shall gladden thy soul and shall gain me the gift of good tidings FN fifty I answered Even so Then said he O merchant I have a daughter and she learned magic in her childhood from an old woman who lived with us Yesterday when thou gavest me the calf I went into the house to her and she looked upon it and veiled her face then she wept and laughed alternately and at last she said O my father hath mine honour become so cheap to thee that thou bringest in to me strange men I asked her Where be these strange men and why wast thou laughing and crying and she answered Of a truth this calf which is with thee is the son of our master the merchant but he is ensorcelled by his stepdame who bewitched both him and his mother such is the cause of my laughing now the reason of his weeping is his mother for that his father slew her unawares Then I marvelled at this with exceeding marvel and hardly made sure that day had dawned before I came to tell thee When I heard O Jinni my herdsman s words I went out with him and I was drunken without wine from the excess of joy and gladness which came upon me until I reached his house There his daughter welcomed me and kissed my hand and forthwith the calf came and fawned upon me as before Quoth I to the herdsman s daughter Is this true that thou sayest of this calf Quoth she Yea O my master he is thy son the very core of thy heart I rejoiced and said to her O maiden if thou wilt release him thine shall be whatever cattle and property of mine are under thy father s hand She smiled and answered O my master I have no greed for the goods nor will I take them save on two conditions the first that thou marry me to thy son and the second that I may bewitch her who bewitched him and imprison her otherwise I cannot be safe from her malice and malpractices Now when I heard O Jinni these the words of the herdsman s daughter I replied Beside what thou askest all the cattle and the house hold stuff in thy father s charge are thine and as for the daughter of my uncle her blood is lawful to thee When I had spoken she took a cup and filled it with water then she recited a spell over it and sprinkled it upon the calf saying If Almighty Allah created thee a calf remain so shaped and change not but if thou be enchanted return to thy whilom form by command of Allah Most Highest and lo he trembled and became a man Then I fell on his neck and said Allah upon thee tell me all that the daughter of my uncle did by thee and by thy mother And when he told me what had come to pass between them I said O my son Allah favoured thee with one to restore thee and thy right hath returned to thee Then O Jinni I married the herdsman s daughter to him and she transformed my wife into this gazelle saying Her shape is a comely and by no means loathsome After this she abode with us night and day day and night till the Almighty took her to Himself When she deceased my son fared forth to the cities of Hind even to the city of this man who hath done to thee what hath been done FN fifty one and I also took this gazelle my cousin and wandered with her from town to town seeking tidings of my son till Destiny drove me to this place where I saw the merchant sitting in tears Such is my tale Quoth the Jinni This story is indeed strange and therefore I grant thee the third part of his blood There upon the second old man who owned the two greyhounds came up and said O Jinni if I recount to thee what befel me from my brothers these two hounds and thou see that it is a tale even more wondrous and marvellous than what thou hast heard wilt thou grant to me also the third of this man s blood Replied the Jinni Thou hast my word for it if thine adventures be more marvellous and wondrous Thereupon he thus began The Second Shaykh s Story Know O lord of the Kings of the Jann that these two dogs are my brothers and I am the third Now when our father died and left us a capital of three thousand gold pieces FN fifty two I opened a shop with my share and bought and sold therein and in like guise did my two brothers each setting up a shop But I had been in business no long while before the elder sold his stock for a thousand diners and after buying outfit and merchandise went his ways to foreign parts He was absent one whole year with the caravan but one day as I sat in my shop behold a beggar stood before me asking alms and I said to him Allah open thee another door FN fifty three Whereupon he answered weeping the while Am I so changed that thou knowest me not Then I looked at him narrowly and lo it was my brother so I rose to him and welcomed him then I seated him in my shop and put questions concerning his case Ask me not answered he my wealth is awaste and my state hath waxed unstated So I took him to the Hammam bath FN fifty four and clad him in a suit of my own and gave him lodging in my house Moreover after looking over the accounts of my stock in trade and the profits of my business I found that industry had gained me one thousand diners while my principal the head of my wealth amounted to two thousand So I shared the whole with him saying Assume that thou hast made no journey abroad but hast remained at home and be not cast down by thine ill luck He took the share in great glee and opened for himself a shop and matters went on quietly for a few nights and days But presently my second brother yon other dog also setting his heart upon travel sold off what goods and stock in trade he had and albeit we tried to stay him he would not be stayed he laid in an outfit for the journey and fared forth with certain wayfarers After an absence of a whole year he came back to me even as my elder brother had come back and when I said to him O my brother did I not dissuade thee from travel he shed tears and cried O my brother this be destiny s decree here I am a mere beggar penniless FN fifty five and without a shirt to my back So I led him to the bath O Jinni and clothing him in new clothes of my own wear I went with him to my shop and served him with meat and drink Furthermore I said to him O my brother I am wont to cast up my shop accounts at the head of every year and whatso I shall find of surplusage is between me and thee FN fifty six So I proceeded O Ifrit to strike a balance and finding two thousand diners of profit I returned praises to the Creator be He extolled and exalted and made over one half to my brother keeping the other to my self Thereupon he busied himself with opening a shop and on this wise we abode many days After a time my brothers began pressing me to travel with them but I refused saying What gained ye by travel voyage that I should gain thereby As I would not give ear to them we went back each to his own shop where we bought and sold as before They kept urging me to travel for a whole twelvemonth but I refused to do so till full six years were past and gone when I consented with these words O my brothers here am I your companion of travel now let me see what monies you have by you I found however that they had not a doit having squandered their substance in high diet and drinking and carnal delights Yet I spoke not a word of reproach so far from it I looked over my shop accounts once more and sold what goods and stock in trade were mine and finding myself the owner of six thousand ducats I gladly proceeded to divide that sum in halves saying to my brothers These three thousand gold pieces are for me and for you to trade withal adding Let us bury the other moiety underground that it may be of service in case any harm befal us in which case each shall take a thousand wherewith to open shops Both replied Right is thy recking and I gave to each one his thousand gold pieces keeping the same sum for myself to wit a thousand diners We then got ready suitable goods and hired a ship and having embarked our merchandise proceeded on our voyage day following day a full month after which we arrived at a city where we sold our venture and for every piece of gold we gained ten And as we turned again to our voyage we found on the shore of the sea a maiden clad in worn and ragged gear and she kissed my hand and said O master is there kindness in thee and charity I can make thee a fitting return for them I answered Even so truly in me are benevolence and good works even though thou render me no return Then she said Take me to wife O my master and carry me to thy city for I have given myself to thee so do me a kindness and I am of those who be meet for good works and charity I will make thee a fitting return for these and be thou not shamed by my condition When I heard her words my heart yearned towards her in such sort as willed it Allah be He extolled and exalted and took her and clothed her and made ready for her a fair resting place in the vessel and honourably entreated her So we voyaged on and my heart became attached to her with exceeding attachment and I was separated from her neither night nor day and I paid more regard to her than to my brothers Then they were estranged from me and waxed jealous of my wealth and the quantity of merchandise I had and their eyes were opened covetously upon all my property So they took counsel to murder me and seize my wealth saying Let us slay our brother and all his monies will be ours and Satan made this deed seem fair in their sight so when they found me in privacy and I sleeping by my wife s side they took us both up and cast us into the sea My wife awoke startled from her sleep and forthright becoming an Ifritah FN fifty seven she bore me up and carried me to an island and disappeared for a short time but she returned in the morning and said Here am I thy faithful slave who hath made thee due recompense for I bore thee up in the waters and saved thee from death by command of the Almighty Know that I am a Jinniyah and as I saw thee my heart loved thee by will of the Lord for I am a believer in Allah and in His Apostle whom Heaven bless and preserve Thereupon I came to thee conditioned as thou sawest me and thou didst marry me and see now I have saved thee from sinking But I am angered against thy brothers and assuredly I must slay them When I heard her story I was surprised and thanking her for all she had done I said But as to slaying my brothers this must not be Then I told her the tale of what had come to pass with them from the beginning of our lives to the end and on hearing it quoth she This night will I fly as a bird over them and will sink their ship and slay them Quoth I Allah upon thee do not thus for the proverb saith O thou who doest good to him that cloth evil leave the evil doer to his evil deeds Moreover they are still my brothers But she rejoined By Allah there is no help for it but I slay them I humbled myself before her for their pardon whereupon she bore me up and flew away with me till at last she set me down on the terrace roof of my own house I opened the doors and took up what I had hidden in the ground and after I had saluted the folk I opened my shop and bought me merchandise Now when night came on I went home and there I saw these two hounds tied up and when they sighted me they arose and whined and fawned upon me but ere I knew what happened my wife said These two dogs be thy brothers I answered And who hath done this thing by them and she rejoined I sent a message to my sister and she entreated them on this wise nor shall these two be released from their present shape till ten years shall have passed And now I have arrived at this place on my way to my wife s sister that she may deliver them from this condition after their having endured it for half a score of years As I was wending onwards I saw this young man who acquainted me with what had befallen him and I determined not to fare hence until I should see what might occur between thee and him Such is my tale Then said the Jinni Surely this is a strange story and therefor I give thee the third portion of his blood and his crime Thereupon quoth the third Shaykh the master of the mare mule to the Jinni I can tell thee a tale more wondrous than these two so thou grant me the remainder of his blood and of his offense and the Jinni answered So be it Then the old man began The Third Shaykh s Story Know O Sultan and head of the Jann that this mule was my wife Now it so happened that I went forth and was absent one whole year and when I returned from my journey I came to her by night and saw a black slave lying with her on the carpet bed and they were talking and dallying and laughing and kissing and playing the close buttock game When she saw me she rose and came hurriedly at me with a gugglet FN fifty eight of water and muttering spells over it she besprinkled me and said Come forth from this thy shape into the shape of a dog and I became on the instant a dog She drove me out of the house and I ran through the doorway nor ceased running until I came to a butcher s stall where I stopped and began to eat what bones were there When the stall owner saw me he took me and led me into his house but as soon as his daughter had sight of me she veiled her face from me crying out Doss thou bring men to me and dost thou come in with them to me Her father asked Where is the man and she answered This dog is a man whom his wife hath ensorcelled and I am able to release him When her father heard her words he said Allah upon thee O my daughter release him So she took a gugglet of water and after uttering words over it sprinkled upon me a few drops saying Come forth from that form into thy former form And I returned to my natural shape Then I kissed her hand and said I wish thou wouldest transform my wife even as she bans formed me Thereupon she gave me some water saying As soon as thou see her asleep sprinkle this liquid upon her and speak what words thou heardest me utter so shall she become whatsoever thou desirest I went to my wife and found her fast asleep and while sprinkling the water upon her I said Come forth from that form into the form of a mare mule So she became on the instant a she mule and she it is whom thou seest with thine eyes O Sultan and head of the Kings of the Jann Then the Jinni turned towards her and said Is this sooth And she nodded her head and replied by signs Indeed tis the truth for such is my tale and this is what hath be fallen me Now when the old man had ceased speaking the Jinni shook with pleasure and gave him the third of the merchant s blood And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say Then quoth Dunyazad O my sister how pleasant is thy tale and how tasteful how sweet and how grateful She replied And what is this compared with that I could tell thee the night to come if I live and the King spare me FN fifty nine Then thought the King By Allah I will not slay her until I hear the rest of her tale for truly it is wondrous So they rested that night in mutual embrace until the dawn After this the King went forth to his Hall of Estate and the Wazir and the troops came in and the court was crowded and the King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed bidding and forbidding during the rest of the day Then the Divan broke up and King Shahryar entered his palace When it was the Third Night And the King had had his will of the Wazir s daughter Dunyazad her sister said to her Finish for us that tale of thine and she replied With joy and goodly gree It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the third old man told a tale to the Jinni more wondrous than the two preceding the Jinni marvelled with exceeding marvel and shaking with delight cried Lo I have given thee the remainder of the merchant s punishment and for thy sake have I released him Thereupon the merchant embraced the old men and thanked them and these Shaykhs wished him joy on being saved and fared forth each one for his own city Yet this tale is not more wondrous than the fisherman s story Asked the King What is the fisherman s story And she answered by relating the tale of THE FISHERMAN AND THE JINNI It hath reached me O auspicious King that there was a Fisher man well stricken in years who had a wife and three children and withal was of poor condition Now it was his custom to cast his net every day four times and no more On a day he went forth about noontide to the sea shore where he laid down his basket and tucking up his shirt and plunging into the water made a cast with his net and waited till it settled to the bottom Then he gathered the cords together and haled away at it but found it weighty and however much he drew it landwards he could not pull it up so he carried the ends ashore and drove a stake into the ground and made the net fast to it Then he stripped and dived into the water all about the net and left not off working hard until he had brought it up He rejoiced thereat and donning his clothes went to the net when he found in it a dead jackass which had torn the meshes Now when he saw it he exclaimed in his grief There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Then quoth he This is a strange manner of daily bread and he began re citing in extempore verse O toiler through the glooms of night in peril and in pain Thy toiling stint for daily bread comes not by might and main Seest thou not the fisher seek afloat upon the sea His bread while glimmer stars of night as set in tangled skein Anon he plungeth in despite the buffet of the waves The while to sight the bellying net his eager glances strain Till joying at the night s success a fish he bringeth home Whose gullet by the hook of Fate was caught and cut in twain When buys that fish of him a man who spent the hours of night Reckless of cold and wet and gloom in ease and comfort fain Laud to the Lord who gives to this to that denies his wishes And dooms one toil and catch the prey and other eat the fishes FN sixty Then quoth he Up and to it I am sure of His beneficence Inshallah So he continued When thou art seized of Evil Fate assume The noble soul s long suffering tis thy best Complain not to the creature this be plaint From one most Ruthful to the ruthlessest The Fisherman when he had looked at the dead ass got it free of the toils and wrung out and spread his net then he plunged into the sea saying In Allah s name and made a cast and pulled at it but it grew heavy and settled down more firmly than the first time Now he thought that there were fish in it and he made it fast and doffing his clothes went into the water and dived and haled until he drew it up upon dry land Then found he in it a large earthen pitcher which was full of sand and mud and seeing this he was greatly troubled and began repeating these verses FN sixty one Forbear O troubles of the world And pardon an ye nill forbear I went to seek my daily bread I find that breadless I must fare For neither handcraft brings me aught Nor Fate allots to me a share How many fools the Pleiads reach While darkness whelms the wise and ware So he prayed pardon of Allah and throwing away the jar wrung his net and cleansed it and returned to the sea the third time to cast his net and waited till it had sunk Then he pulled at it and found therein potsherds and broken glass whereupon he began to speak these verses He is to thee that daily bread thou canst nor loose nor bind Nor pen nor writ avail thee aught thy daily bread to find For joy and daily bread are what Fate deigneth to allow This soil is sad and sterile ground while that makes glad the hind The shafts of Time and Life bear down full many a man of worth While bearing up to high degree wights of ignoble mind So come thou Death for verily life is not worth a straw When low the falcon falls withal the mallard wings the wind No wonder tis thou seest how the great of soul and mind Are poor and many a loser carle to height of luck designed This bird shall overfly the world from east to furthest west And that shall win her every wish though ne er she leave the nest Then raising his eyes heavenwards he said O my God FN sixty two verily Thou wottest that I cast not my net each day save four times FN sixty three the third is done and as yet Thou hast vouchsafed me nothing So this time O my God deign give me my daily bread Then having called on Allah s name FN sixty four he again threw his net and waited its sinking and settling whereupon he haled at it but could not draw it in for that it was entangled at the bottom He cried out in his vexation There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah and he began reciting Fie on this wretched world an so it be I must be whelmed by grief and misery Tho gladsome be man s lot when dawns the morn He drains the cup of woe ere eve he see Yet was I one of whom the world when asked Whose lot is happiest oft would say Tis he Thereupon he stripped and diving down to the net busied him self with it till it came to land Then he opened the meshes and found therein a cucumber shaped jar of yellow copper FN sixty five evidently full of something whose mouth was made fast with a leaden cap stamped with the seal ring of our Lord Sulayman son of David Allah accept the twain Seeing this the Fisherman rejoiced and said If I sell it in the brass bazar tis worth ten golden diners He shook it and finding it heavy continued Would to Heaven I knew what is herein But I must and will open it and look to its contents and store it in my bag and sell it in the brass market And taking out a knife he worked at the lead till he had loosened it from the jar then he laid the cup on the ground and shook the vase to pour out whatever might be inside He found nothing in it whereat he marvelled with an exceeding marvel But presently there came forth from the jar a smoke which spired heavenwards into aether whereat he again marvelled with mighty marvel and which trailed along earth s surface till presently having reached its full height the thick vapour condensed and became an Ifrit huge of bulk whose crest touched the clouds while his feet were on the ground His head was as a dome his hands like pitchforks his legs long as masts and his mouth big as a cave his teeth were like large stones his nostrils ewers his eyes two lamps and his look was fierce and lowering Now when the Fisherman saw the Ifrit his side muscles quivered his teeth chattered his spittle dried up and he became blind about what to do Upon this the Ifrit looked at him and cried There is no god but the God and Sulayman is the prophet of God presently adding O Apostle of Allah slay me not never again will I gainsay thee in word nor sin against thee in deed FN sixty six Quoth the Fisherman O Marid FN sixty seven diddest thou say Sulayman the Apostle of Allah and Sulayman is dead some thou sand and eight hundred years ago FN sixty eight and we are now in the last days of the world What is thy story and what is thy account of thyself and what is the cause of thy entering into this cucur bit Now when the Evil Spirit heard the words of the Fisher man quoth he There is no god but the God be of good cheer O Fisherman Quoth the Fisherman Why biddest thou me to be of good cheer and he replied Because of thy having to die an ill death in this very hour Said the Fisherman Thou deservest for thy good tidings the withdrawal of Heaven s protection O thou distant one FN sixty nine Wherefore shouldest thou kill me and what thing have I done to deserve death I who freed thee from the jar and saved thee from the depths of the sea and brought thee up on the dry land Replied the Ifrit Ask of me only what mode of death thou wilt die and by what manner of slaughter shall I slay thee Rejoined the Fisherman What is my crime and wherefore such retribution Quoth the Ifrit Hear my story O Fisherman and he answered Say on and be brief in thy saying for of very sooth my life breath is in my nostrils FN seventy Thereupon quoth the Jinni Know that I am one among the heretical Jann and I sinned against Sulayman David son on the twain be peace I together with the famous Sakhr al Jinni FN seventy one whereupon the Prophet sent his minister Asaf son of Barkhiya to seize me and this Wazir brought me against my will and led me in bonds to him I being downcast despite my nose and he placed me standing before him like a suppliant When Sulayman saw me he took refuge with Allah and bade me embrace the True Faith and obey his behests but I refused so sending for this cucurbit FN seventy two he shut me up therein and stopped it over with lead whereon he impressed the Most High Name and gave his orders to the Jann who carried me off and cast me into the midmost of the ocean There I abode an hundred years during which I said in my heart Whoso shall release me him will I enrich for ever and ever But the full century went by and when no one set me free I entered upon the second five score saying Whoso shall release me for him I will open the hoards of the earth Still no one set me free and thus four hundred years passed away Then quoth I Whoso shall release me for him will I fulfil three wishes Yet no one set me free Thereupon I waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said to myself Whoso shall release me from this time forth him will I slay and I will give him choice of what death he will die and now as thou hast released me I give thee full choice of deaths The Fisherman hearing the words of the Ifrit said O Allah the wonder of it that I have not come to free thee save in these days adding Spare my life so Allah spare thine and slay me not lest Allah set one to slay thee Replied the Contumacious One There is no help for it die thou must so ask me by way of boon what manner of death thou wilt die Albeit thus certified the Fisherman again addressed the Ifrit saying Forgive me this my death as a generous reward for having freed thee and the Ifrit Surely I would not slay thee save on account of that same release O Chief of the Ifrits said the Fisherman I do thee good and thou requitest me with evil in very sooth the old saw lieth not when it saith We wrought them weal they met our weal with ill Such by my life is every bad man s labour To him who benefits unworthy wights Shall hap what inapt to Ummi Amir s neighbor FN seventy three Now when the Ifrit heard these words he answered No more of this talk needs must I kill thee Upon this the Fisherman said to himself This is a Jinni and I am a man to whom Allah hath given a passably cunning wit so I will now cast about to com pass his destruction by my contrivance and by mine intelligence even as he took counsel only of his malice and his frowardness FN seventy four He began by asking the Ifrit Hast thou indeed resolved to kill me and receiving for all answer Even so he cried Now in the Most Great Name graven on the seal ring of Sulayman the Son of David peace be with the holy twain an I question thee on a certain matter wilt thou give me a true answer The Ifrit replied Yea but hearing mention of the Most Great Name his wits were troubled and he said with trembling Ask and be brief Quoth the Fisherman How didst thou fit into this bottle which would not hold thy hand no nor even thy foot and how came it to be large enough to contain the whole of thee Replied the Ifrit What cost not believe that I was all there and the Fisherman rejoined Nay I will never believe it until I see thee inside with my own eyes And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fourth Night Her sister said to her Please finish us this tale an thou be not sleepy so she resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Fisherman said to the Ifrit I will never and nowise believe thee until I see thee inside it with mine own eyes the Evil Spirit on the instant shook FN seventy five and became a vapour which condensed and entered the jar little and little till all was well inside when lo the Fisherman in hot haste took the leaden cap with the seal and stoppered therewith the mouth of the jar and called out to the Ifrit saying Ask me by way of boon what death thou wilt die By Allah I will throw thee into the sea FN seventy six be fore us and here will I build me a lodge and whoso cometh hither I will warn him against fishing and will say In these waters abideth an Ifrit who giveth as a last favour a choice of deaths and fashion of slaughter to the man who saveth him Now when the Ifrit heard this from the Fisherman and saw him self in limbo he was minded to escape but this was prevented by Solomon s seal so he knew that the Fisherman had cozened and outwitted him and he waxed lowly and submissive and began humbly to say I did but jest with thee But the other an swered Thou liest O vilest of the Ifrits and meanest and filthiest and he set off with the bottle for the sea side the Ifrit calling out Nay Nay and he calling out Aye Aye There upon the Evil Spirit softened his voice and smoothed his speech and abased himself saying What wouldest thou do with me O Fisherman I will throw thee back into the sea he answered where thou hast been housed and homed for a thousand and eight hundred years and now I will leave thee therein till Judgment day did I not say to thee Spare me and Allah shall spare thee and slay me not lest Allah slay thee yet thou spurn east my supplication and hadst no intention save to deal un graciously by me and Allah hath now thrown thee into my hands and I am cunninger than thou Quoth the Ifrit Open for me and I may bring thee weal Quoth the Fisherman Thou liest thou accursed my case with thee is that of the Wazir of King Yunan with the sage Duban FN seventy seven And who was the Wazir of King Yunan and who was the sage Duban and what was the story about them quoth the Ifrit whereupon the Fisherman began to tell The Tale of the Wazir and the Sage Duban Know O thou Ifrit that in days of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Yunan reigned over the city of Fars of the land of the Roum FN seventy eight He was a powerful ruler and a wealthy who had armies and guards and allies of all nations of men but his body was afflicted with a leprosy which leaches and men of science failed to heal He drank potions and he swallowed pow ders and he used unguents but naught did him good and none among the host of physicians availed to procure him a cure At last there came to his city a mighty healer of men and one well stricken in years the sage Duban highs This man was a reader of books Greek Persian Roman Arabian and Syrian and he was skilled in astronomy and in leechcraft the theorick as well as the practick he was experienced in all that healeth and that hurteth the body conversant with the virtues of every plant grass and herb and their benefit and bane and he understood philosophy and had compassed the whole range of medical science and other branches of the knowledge tree Now this physician passed but few days in the city ere he heard of the King s malady and all his bodily sufferings through the leprosy with which Allah had smitten him and how all the doctors and wise men had failed to heal him Upon this he sat up through the night in deep thought and when broke the dawn and appeared the morn and light was again born and the Sun greeted the Good whose beauties the world adorn FN seventy nine he donned his handsomest dress and going in to King Yunan he kissed the ground before him then he prayed for the endurance of his honour and prosperity in fairest language and made himself known saying O King tidings have reached I me of what befel thee through that which is in thy person and how the host of physicians have proved themselves unavailing to abate it and lo I can cure thee O King and yet will I not make thee drink of draught or anoint thee with ointment Now when King Yunan heard his words he said in huge surprise How wilt thou do this By Allah if thou make me whole I will enrich thee even to thy son s son and I will give thee sumptuous gifts and whatso thou wishest shall be thine and thou shalt be to me a cup companion FN eighty and a friend The King then robed him with a dress of honour and entreated him graciously and asked him Canst thou indeed cure me of this complaint without drug and unguent and he answered Yes I will heal I thee without the pains and penalties of medicine The King marvelled with exceeding marvel and said O physician when shall be this whereof thou speakest and in how many days shall it take place Haste thee O my son He replied I hear and I obey the cure shall begin tomorrow So saying he went forth from the presence and hired himself a house in the city for the better storage of his books and scrolls his medicines and his aromatic roots Then he set to work at choosing the fittest drugs and simples and he fashioned a bat hollow within and furnished with a handle without for which he made a ball the two being prepared with consummate art On the next day when both were ready for use and wanted nothing more he went up to the King and kissing the ground between his hands bade him ride forth on the parade ground FN eighty one there to play at pall and mall He was accompanied by his suite Emirs and Chamberlains Wazirs and Lords of the realm and ere he was seated the sage Duban came up to him and handing him the bat said Take this mall and grip it as I do so and now push for the plain and leaning well over thy horse drive the ball with all thy might until thy palm be moist and thy body perspire then the medicine will penetrate through thy palm and will permeate thy person When thou hast done with playing and thou feelest the effects of the medicine return to thy palace and make the Ghusl ablation FN eighty two in the Hammam bath and lay thee down to sleep so shalt thou be come whole and now peace be with thee Thereupon King Yunan took the bat from the Sage and grasped it firmly then mounting steed he drove the ball before him and gallopped after it till he reached it when he struck it with all his might his palm gripping the bat handle the while and he ceased not malling the ball till his hand waxed moist and his skin perspiring imbibed the medicine from the wood Then the sage Duban knew that the drugs had penetrated his person and bade him return to the palace and enter the Hammam without stay or delay so King Yunan forthright returned and ordered them to clear for him the bath They did so the carpet spreaders making all haste and the slaves all hurry and got ready a change of raiment for the King He entered the bath and made the total ablution long and thoroughly then donned his clothes within the Hammam and rode therefrom to his palace where he lay him down and slept Such was the case with King Yunan but as regards the sage Duban he returned home and slept as usual and when morning dawned he repaired to the palace and craved audience The King ordered him to be admitted then having kissed the ground between his hands in allusion to the King he recited these couplets with solemn intonation Happy is Eloquence when thou art named her sire But mourns she whenas other man the title claimed O Lord of fairest presence whose illuming rays Clear off the fogs of doubt aye veiling deeds high famed Ne er cease thy face to shine like Dawn and rise of Morn And never show Time s face with heat of ire inflamed Thy grace hath favoured us with gifts that worked such wise As rain clouds raining on the hills by words enframed Freely thou lavishedst thy wealth to rise on high Till won from Time the heights whereat thy grandeur aimed Now when the Sage ceased reciting the King rose quickly to his feet and fell on his neck then seating him by his side he bade dress him in a sumptuous dress for it had so happened that when the King left the Hammam he looked on his body and saw no trace of leprosy the skin was all clean as virgin silver He joyed thereat with exceeding joy his breast broadened FN eighty three with delight and he felt thoroughly happy Presently when it was full day he entered his audience hall and sat upon the throne of his kingship whereupon his Chamberlains and Grandees flocked to the presence and with them the Sage Duban Seeing the leach the King rose to him in honour and seated him by his side then the food trays furnished with the daintiest viands were brought and the physician ate with the King nor did he cease companying him all that day Moreover at nightfall he gave the physician Duban two thousand gold pieces besides the usual dress of honour and other gifts galore and sent him home on his own steed After the Sage had fared forth King Yunan again expressed his amazement at the leach s art saying This man medicined my body from without nor anointed me with aught of ointments by Allah surely this is none other than consummate skill I am bound to honour such a man with re wards and distinction and take him to my companion and my friend during the remainder of my days So King Yunan passed the night in joy and gladness for that his body had been made whole and had thrown off so pernicious a malady On the morrow the King went forth from his Serraglio and sat upon his throne and the Lords of Estate stood about him and the Emirs and Wazirs sat as was their wont on his right hand and on his left Then he asked for the Sage Duban who came in and kissed the ground before him when the King rose to greet him and seating him by his side ate with him and wished him long life Moreover he robed him and gave him gifts and ceased not con versing with him until night approached Then the King ordered him by way of salary five dresses of honour and a thousand dinars FN eighty four The physician returned to his own house full of gratitude to the King Now when next morning dawned the King repaired to his audience hall and his Lords and Nobles surrounded him and his Chamberlains and his Ministers as the white en closeth the black of the eye FN eighty five Now the King had a Wazir among his Wazirs unsightly to look upon an ill omened spectacle sor did ungenerous full of envy and evil will When this Minister saw the King place the physician near him and give him all these gifts he jaloused him and planned to do him a harm as in the saying on such subject Envy lurks in every body and the say ing Oppression hideth in every heart power revealeth it and weakness concealeth it Then the Minister came before the King and kissing the ground between his hands said O King of the age and of all time thou in whose benefits I have grown to manhood I have weighty advice to offer thee and if I withhold it I were a son of adultery and no true born man wherefore an thou order me to disclose it I will so do forthwith Quoth the King and he was troubled at the words of the Minister And what is this counsel of thine Quoth he O glorious monarch the wise of old have said Whoso regardeth not the end hath not Fortune to friend and indeed I have lately seen the King on far other than the right way for he lavisheth largesse on his enemy on one whose object is the decline and fall of his king ship to this man he hath shown favour honouring him with over honour and making of him an intimate Wherefore I fear for the King s life The King who was much troubled and changed colour asked Whom cost thou suspect and anent whom doest thou hint and the Minister answered O King an thou be asleep wake up I point to the physician Duban Rejoined the King Fie upon thee This is a true friend who is favoured by me above all men because he cured me with some thing which I held in my hand and he healed my leprosy which had baffled all physicians indeed he is one whose like may not be found in these days no not in the whole world from furthest east to utmost west And it is of such a man thou sayest such hard sayings Now from this day forward I allot him a settled solde and allowances every month a thousand gold pieces and were I to share with him my realm twere but a little matter Perforce I must suspect that thou speakest on this wise from mere envy and jealousy as they relate of the King Sindibad And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say Then quoth Dunyazad O my sister how pleasant is thy tale and how tasteful how sweet and how grateful She replied And where is this compared with what I could tell thee on the coming night if the King deign spare my life Then said the King in himself By Allah I will not slay her until I hear the rest of her tale for truly it is wondrous So they rested that night in mutual embrace until the dawn Then the King went forth to his Hall of Rule and the Wazir and the troops came in and the audience chamber was thronged and the King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade and forbade during the rest of that day till the Court broke up and King Shahryar returned to his palace When It Was The Fifth Night Her sister said Do you finish for us thy story if thou be not sleepy and she resumed It hath reached me O auspicious King and mighty Monarch that King Yunan said to his Minister O Wazir thou art one whom the evil spirit of envy hath possessed because of this physician and thou plottest for my putting him to death after which I should repent me full sorely even as repented King Sindibad for killing his falcon Quoth the Wazir Pardon me O King of the age how was that So the King began the story of King Sindibad and his Falcon It is said but Allah is All knowing FN eighty six that there was a King of the Kings of Fars who was fond of pleasuring and diversion especially coursing end hunting He had reared a falcon which he carried all night on his fist and whenever he went a chasing he took with him this bird and he bade make for her a golden cuplet hung around her neck to give her drink therefrom One day as the King was sitting quietly in his palace behold the high falcaner of the household suddenly addressed him O King of the age this is indeed a day fit for birding The King gave orders accordingly and set out taking the hawk on fist and they fared merrily forwards till they made a Wady FN eighty seven where they planted a circle of nets for the chase when lo a gazelle came within the toils and the King cried Whoso alloweth yon gazelle to spring over his head and loseth her that man will I surely slay They narrowed the nets about the gazelle when she drew near the King s station and planting herself on her hind quarter crossed her forehand over her breast as if about to kiss the earth before the King He bowed his brow low in acknowledgment to the beast when she bounded high over his head and took the way of the waste Thereupon the King turned towards his troops and seeing them winking and pointing at him he asked O Wazir what are my men saying and the Minister answered They say thou didst proclaim that whoso alloweth the gazelle to spring over his head that man shall be put to death Quoth the King Now by the life of my head I will follow her up till I bring her back So he set off gallopping on the gazelle s trail and gave not over tracking till he reached the foot hills of a mountain chain where the quarry made for a cave Then the King cast off at it the falcon which presently caught it up and swooping down drove her talons into its eyes bewildering and blinding it FN eighty eight and the King drew his mace and struck a blow which rolled the game over He then dismounted and after cutting the antelope s throat and flaying the body hung it to the pommel of his saddle Now the time was that of the siesta FN eighty nine and the wold was parched and dry nor was any water to be found anywhere and the King thirsted and his horse also so he went about searching till he saw a tree dropping water as it were melted butter from its boughs Thereupon the King who wore gauntlets of skin to guard him against poisons took the cup from the hawk s neck and filling it with the water set it before the bird and lo the falcon struck it with her pounces and upset the liquid The King filled it a second time with the dripping drops thinking his hawk was thirsty but the bird again struck at the cup with her talons and overturned it Then the King waxed wroth with the hawk and filling the cup a third time offered it to his horse but the hawk upset it with a flirt of wings Quoth the King Allah confound thee thou unluckiest of flying things thou keepest me from drinking and thou deprivest thyself also and the horse So he struck the falcon with his sword and cut off her wing but the bird raised her head and said by signs Look at that which hangeth on the tree The King lifted up his eyes accordingly and caught sight of a brood of vipers whose poison drops he mistook for water thereupon he repented him of having struck off his falcon s wing and mounting horse fared on with the dead gazelle till he arrived at the camp his starting place He threw the quarry to the cook saying Take and broil it and sat down on his chair the falcon being still on his fist when suddenly the bird gasped and died whereupon the King cried out in sorrow and remorse for having slain that falcon which had saved his life Now this is what occurred in the case of King Sindibad and I am assured that were I to do as thou desirest I should repent even as the man who killed his parrot Quoth the Wazir And how was that And the King began to tell The Tale of the Husband and the Parrot FN ninety A certain man and a merchant to boot had married a fair wife a woman of perfect beauty and grace symmetry and loveliness of whom he was mad jealous and who contrived successfully to keep him from travel At last an occasion compelling him to leave her he went to the bird market and bought him for one hundred gold pieces a she parrot which he set in his house to act as duenna expecting her to acquaint him on his return with what had passed during the whole time of his absence for the bird was kenning and cunning and never forgot what she had seen and heard Now his fair wife had fallen in love with a young Turk FN ninety one who used to visit her and she feasted him by day and lay with him by night When the man had made his journey and won his wish he came home and at once causing the Parrot be brought to him questioned her concerning the conduct of his consort whilst he was in foreign parts Quoth she Thy wife hath a man friend who passed every night with her during thine absence Thereupon the husband went to his wife in a violent rage and bashed her with a bashing severe enough to satisfy any body The woman suspecting that one of the slave girls had been tattling to the master called them together and questioned them upon their oaths when all swore that they had kept the secret but that the Parrot had not adding And we heard her with our own ears Upon this the woman bade one of the girls to set a hand mill under the cage and grind therewith and a second to sprinkle water through the cage roof and a third to run about right and left dashing a mirror of bright steel through the livelong night Next morning when the husband returned home after being entertained by one of his friends he bade bring the Parrot before him and asked what had taken place whilst he was away Pardon me O my master quoth the bird I could neither hear nor see aught by reason of the exceeding murk and the thunder and lightning which lasted throughout the night As it happened to be the summer tide the master was astounded and cried But we are now in mid Tammuz FN ninety two and this is not the time for rains and storms Ay by Allah rejoined the bird I saw with these eyes what my tongue hath told thee Upon this the man not knowing the case nor smoking the plot waxed exceeding wroth and holding that his wife had been wrongously accused put forth his hand and pulling the Parrot from her cage dashed her upon the ground with such force that he killed her on the spot Some days after wards one of his slave girls confessed to him the whole truth FN ninety three yet would he not believe it till he saw the young Turk his wife s lover coming out of her chamber when he bared his blade FN ninety four and slew him by a blow on the back of the neck and he did the same by the adulteress and thus the twain laden with mortal sin went straightways to Eternal Fire Then the merchant knew that the Parrot had told him the truth anent all she had seen and he mourned grievously for her loss when mourning availed him not The Minister hearing the words of King Yu nan rejoined O Monarch high in dignity and what harm have I done him or what evil have I seen from him that I should compass his death I would not do this thing save to serve thee and soon shalt thou sight that it is right and if thou accept my advice thou shalt be saved otherwise thou shalt be destroyed even as a certain Wazir who acted treacherously by the young Prince Asked the King How was that and the Minister thus began The Tale of the Prince and the Ogress A certain King who had a son over much given to hunting and coursing ordered one of his Wazirs to be in attendance upon him whithersoever he might wend One day the youth set out for the chase accompanied by his father s Minister and as they jogged on together a big wild beast came in sight Cried the Wazir to the King s son Up and at yon noble quarry So the Prince followed it until he was lost to every eye and the chase got away from him in the waste whereby he was confused and he knew not which way to turn when lo a damsel appeared ahead and she was in tears The King s son asked Who art thou and she answered I am daughter to a King among the Kings of Hind and I was travelling with a caravan in the desert when drowsiness overcame me and I fell from my beast unwittingly whereby I am cut off from my people and sore bewildered The Prince hearing these words pitied her case and mounting her on his horse s crupper travelled until he passed by an old ruin FN ninety five when the damsel said to him O my master I wish to obey a call of nature he therefore set her down at the ruin where she delayed so long that the King s son thought that she was only wasting time so he followed her without her knowledge and behold she was a Ghulah FN ninety six a wicked Ogress who was saying to her brood O my children this day I bring you a fine fat youth FN ninety seven for dinner whereto they answered Bring him quick to us O our mother that we may browse upon him our bellies full The Prince hearing their talk made sure of death and his side muscles quivered in fear for his life so he turned away and was about to fly The Ghulah came out and seeing him in sore affright for he was trembling in every limb cried Wherefore art thou afraid and he replied I have hit upon an enemy whom I greatly fear Asked the Ghulah Diddest thou not say I am a King s son and he answered Even so Then quoth she Why cost not give shine enemy something of money and so satisfy him Quoth he He will not be satisfied with my purse but only with my life and I mortally fear him and am a man under oppression She replied If thou be so distressed as thou deemest ask aid against him from Allah who will surely protect thee from his ill doing and from the evil whereof thou art afraid Then the Prince raised his eyes heavenwards and cried O Thou who answerest the necessitous when he calleth upon Thee and dispellest his distress O my God grant me victory over my foe and turn him from me for Thou over all things art Almighty The Ghulah hearing his prayer turned away from him and the Prince returned to his father and told him the tale of the Wazir whereupon the King summoned the Minister to his presence and then and there slew him Thou likewise O King if thou continue to trust this leach shalt be made to die the worst of deaths He verily thou madest much of and whom thou entreatedest as an intimate will work thy destruction Seest thou not how he healed the disease from outside thy body by something grasped in thy hand Be not assured that he will not destroy thee by something held in like manner Replied King Yunan Thou hast spoken sooth O Wazir it may well be as thou hintest O my well advising Minister and belike this Sage hath come as a spy searching to put me to death for assuredly if he cured me by a something held in my hand he can kill me by a something given me to smell Then asked King Yunan O Minister what must be done with him and the Wazir answered Send after him this very instant and summon him to thy presence and when he shall come strike him across the neck and thus shalt thou rid thyself of him and his wickedness and deceive him ere he can I deceive thee Thou hast again spoken sooth O Wazir said the King and sent one to call the Sage who came in joyful mood for he knew not what had appointed for him the Compassionate as a certain poet saith by way of illustration O Thou who fearest Fate confiding fare Trust all to Him who built the world and wait What Fate saith Be perforce must be my lord And safe art thou from th undecreed of Fate As Duban the physician entered he addressed the King in these lines An fail I of my thanks to thee nor thank thee day by day For whom com posed I prose and verse for whom my say and lay Thou lavishedst thy generous gifts ere they were craved by me Thou lavishedst thy boons unsought sans pretext or delay How shall I stint my praise of thee how shall I cease to laud The grace of thee in secresy and patentest display Nay I will thank thy benefits for aye thy favours lie Light on my thought and tongue though heavy on my back they weigh And he said further on the same theme Turn thee from grief nor care a jot Commit thy needs to Fate and Lot Enjoy the Present passing well And let the Past be clean forgot For whatso haply seemeth worse Shall work thy weal as Allah wot Allah shall do whate er He wills And in His will oppose Him not And further still To th All wise Subtle One trust worldly things Rest thee from all whereto the worldling clings Learn wisely well naught cometh by thy will But e en as willeth Allah King of Kings And lastly Gladsome and gay forget thine every grief Full often grief the wisest hearts outwore Thought is but folly in the feeble slave Shun it and so be saved evermore Said the King for sole return Knowest thou why I have summoned thee and the Sage replied Allah Most Highest alone kenneth hidden things But the King rejoined I summoned thee only to take thy life and utterly to destroy thee Duban the Wise wondered at this strange address with exceeding wonder and asked O King and wherefore wouldest thou slay me and what ill have I done thee and the King answered Men tell me thou art a spy sent hither with intent to slay me and lo I will kill thee ere I be killed by thee then he called to his Sworder and said Strike me off the head of this traitor and deliver us from his evil practices Quoth the Sage Spare me and Allah will spare thee slay me not or Allah shall slay thee And he repeated to him these very words even as I to thee O Ifrit and yet thou wouldst not let me go being bent upon my death King Yunan only rejoined I shall not be safe without slaying thee for as thou healedst me by something held in hand so am I not secure against thy killing me by something given me to smell or otherwise Said the physician This then O King is thy requital and reward thou returnest only evil for good The King replied There is no help for it die thou must and without delay Now when the physician was certified that the King would slay him without waiting he wept and regretted the good he had done to other than the good As one hath said on this subject Of wit and wisdom is Maymunah FN ninety eight bare Whose sire in wisdom all the wits outstrippeth Man may not tread on mud or dust or clay Save by good sense else trippeth he and slippeth Hereupon the Sworder stepped forward and bound the Sage Duban s eyes and bared his blade saying to the King By thy leave while the physician wept and cried Spare me and Allah will spare thee and slay me not or Allah shall slay thee and began repeating I was kind and scaped not they were cruel and escaped And my kindness only led me to Ruination Hall If I live I ll ne er be kind if I die then all be damned Who follow me and curses their kindliness befal Is this continued Duban the return I meet from thee Thou givest me meseems but crocodile boon Quoth the King What is the tale of the crocodile and quoth the physician Impossible for me to tell it in this my state Allah upon thee spare me as thou hopest Allah shall spare thee And he wept with ex ceeding weeping Then one of the King s favourites stood up and said O King grant me the blood of this physician we have never seen him sin against thee or doing aught save healing thee from a disease which baffled every leach and man of science Said the King Ye wot not the cause of my putting to death this physician and this it is If I spare him I doom myself to certain death for one who healed me of such a malady by something held in my hand surely can slay me by something held to my nose and I fear lest he kill me for a price since haply he is some spy whose sole purpose in coming hither was to compass my destruction So there is no help for it die he must and then only shall I be sure of my own life Again cried Duban Spare me and Allah shall spare thee and slay me not or Allah shall slay thee But it was in vain Now when the physician O Ifrit knew for certain that the King would kill him he said O King if there be no help but I must die grant me some little delay that I may go down to my house and release myself from mine obligations and direct my folk and my neighbours where to bury me and distribute my books of medicine Amongst these I have one the rarest of rarities which I would present to thee as an offering keep it as a treasure in thy treasury And what is in the book asked the King and the Sage answered Things beyond compt and the least of secrets is that if directly after thou hast cut off my head thou open three leaves and read three lines of the page to thy left hand my head shall speak and answer every question thou deignest ask of it The King wondered with exceeding wonder and shaking FN ninety nine with delight at the novelty said O physician cost thou really tell me that when I cut off thy head it will speak to me He replied Yes O King Quoth the King This is indeed a strange matter and forthwith sent him closely guarded to his house and Duban then and there settled all his obligations Next day he went up to the King s audience hall where Emirs and Wazirs Chamberlains and Nabobs Grandees and Lords of Estate were gathered together making the presence chamber gay as a garden of flower beds And lo the physician came up and stood before the King bearing a worn old volume and a little etui of metal full of powder like that used for the eyes FN one hundred Then he sat down and said Give me a tray So they brought him one and he poured the powder upon it and levelled it and lastly spake as follows O King take this book but do not open it till my head falls then set it upon this tray and bid press it down upon the powder when forthright the blood will cease flowing That is the time to open the book The King thereupon took the book and made a sign to the Sworder who arose and struck off the physician s head and placing it on the middle of the tray pressed it down upon the powder The blood stopped flowing and the Sage Duban unclosed his eyes and said Now open the book O King The King opened the book and found the leaves stuck together so he put his finger to his mouth and by moistening it he easily turned over the first leaf and in like way the second and the third each leaf opening with much trouble and when he had un stuck six leaves he looked over them and finding nothing written thereon said O physician there is no writing here Duban re plied Turn over yet more and he turned over three others in the same way Now the book was poisoned and before long the venom penetrated his system and he fell into strong convulsions and he cried out The poison hath done its work Whereupon the Sage Duban s head began to improvise There be rulers who have ruled with a foul tyrannic sway But they soon became as though they had never never been Just they had won justice they oppressed and were oppress By Fortune who requited them with ban and bane and teen So they faded like the morn and the tongue of things repeats Take this far that nor vent upon Fortune s ways thy spleen No sooner had the head ceased speaking than the King rolled over dead Now I would have thee know O Ifrit that if King Yunan had spared the Sage Duban Allah would have spared him but he refused so to do and decreed to do him dead wherefore Allah slew him and thou too O Ifrit if thou hadst spared me Allah would have spared thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say then quoth Dunyazad O my sister how pleasant is thy tale and how tasteful how sweet and how grateful She replied And where is this compared with what I could tell thee this coming night if I live and the King spare me Said the King in himself By Allah I will not slay her until I hear the rest of her story for truly it is wondrous They rested that night in mutual embrace until dawn then the King went forth to his Darbar the Wazirs and troops came in and the audience hall was crowded so the King gave orders and judged and appointed and deposed and bade and forbade the rest of that day when the court broke up and King Shahryar entered his palace When it was the Sixth Night Her sister Dunyazad said to her Pray finish for us thy story and she answered I will if the King give me leave Say on quoth the King And she continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Fisherman said to the Ifrit If thou hadst spared me I would have spared thee but nothing would satisfy thee save my death so now I will do thee die by jailing thee in this jar and I will hurl thee into this sea Then the Marid roared aloud and cried Allah upon thee O Fisher man don t Spare me and pardon my past doings and as I have been tyrannous so be thou generous for it is said among sayings that go current O thou who doest good to him who hath done thee evil suffice for the ill doer his ill deeds and do not deal with me as did Umamah to Atikah FN one hundred one Asked the Fisherman And what was their case and the Ifrit answered This is not the time for story telling and I in this prison but set me free and I will tell thee the tale Quoth the Fisherman Leave this language there is no help but that thou be thrown back into the sea nor is there any way for thy getting out of it for ever and ever Vainly I placed myself under thy protection FN one hundred two and I humbled my self to thee with weeping while thou soughtest only to slay me who had done thee no injury deserving this at thy hands nay so far from injuring thee by any evil act I worked thee nought but weal in releasing thee from that jail of thine Now I knew thee to be an evil doer when thou diddest to me what thou didst and know that when I have cast thee back into the sea I will warn whomsoever may fish thee up of what hath befallen me with thee and I will advise him to toss thee back again so shalt thou abide here under these waters till the End of Time shall make an end of thee But the Ifrit cried aloud Set me free this is a noble occasion for generosity and I make covenant with thee and vow never to do thee hurt and harm nay I will help thee to what shall put thee out of want The Fisherman accepted his promises on both conditions not to trouble him as before but on the contrary to do him service and after making firm the plight and swearing him a solemn oath by Allah Most Highest he opened the cucurbit Thereupon the pillar of smoke rose up till all of it was fully out then it thickened and once more became an Ifrit of hideous presence who forthright ad ministered a kick to the bottle and sent it flying into the sea The Fisherman seeing how the cucurbit was treated and making sure of his own death piddled in his clothes and said to himself This promiseth badly but he fortified his heart and cried O Ifrit Allah hath said FN one hundred three Perform your covenant for the performance of your covenant shall be inquired into hereafter Thou hast made a vow to me and hast sworn an oath not to play me false lest Allah play thee false for verily he is a jealous God who respiteth the sinner but letteth him not escape I say to thee as said the Sage Duban to King Yunan Spare me so Allah may spare thee The Ifrit burst into laughter and stalked away saying to the Fisherman Follow me and the man paced after him at a safe distance for he was not assured of escape till they had passed round the suburbs of the city Thence they struck into the uncultivated grounds and crossing them descended into a broad wilderness and lo in the midst of it stood a mountain tarn The Ifrit waded in to the middle and again cried Follow me and when this was done he took his stand in the centre and bade the man cast his net and catch his fish The Fisherman looked into the water and was much astonished to see therein vari coloured fishes white and red blue and yellow however he cast his net and hauling it in saw that he had netted four fishes one of each colour Thereat he rejoiced greatly and more when the Ifrit said to him Carry these to the Sultan and set them in his presence then he will give thee what shall make thee a wealthy man and now accept my excuse for by Allah at this time I wot none other way of benefiting thee inasmuch I have lain in this sea eighteen hundred years and have not seen the face of the world save within this hour But I would not have thee fish here save once a day The Ifrit then gave him God speed saying Allah grant we meet again FN one hundred four and struck the earth with one foot whereupon the ground clove asunder and swallowed him up The Fisherman much marvelling at what had happened to him with the Ifrit took the fish and made for the city and as soon as he reached home he filled an earthen bowl with water and therein threw the fish which began to struggle and wriggle about Then he bore off the bowl upon his head and repairing to the King s palace even as the Ifrit had bidden him laid the fish before the presence and the King wondered with exceeding wonder at the sight for never in his lifetime had he seen fishes like these in quality or in conformation So he said Give those fish to the stranger slave girl who now cooketh for us meaning the bond maiden whom the King of Roum had sent to him only three days before so that he had not yet made trial of her talents in the dressing of meat Thereupon the Wazir carried the fish to the cook and bade her fry them FN one hundred five saying O damsel the King sendeth this say to thee I have not treasured thee O tear o me save for stress time of me approve then to us this day thy delicate handiwork and thy savoury cooking for this dish of fish is a present sent to the Sultan and evidently a rarity The Wazir after he had carefully charged her returned to the King who commanded him to give the Fisherman four hundred diners he gave them accordingly and the man took them to his bosom and ran off home stumbling and falling and rising again and deeming the whole thing to be a dream However he bought for his family all they wanted and lastly he went to his wife in huge joy and gladness So far concerning him but as regards the cookmaid she took the fish and cleansed them and set them in the frying pan basting them with oil till one side was dressed Then she turned them over and behold the kitchen wall crave asunder and therefrom came a young lady fair of form oval of face perfect in grace with eyelids which Kohl lines enchase FN one hundred six Her dress was a silken head kerchief fringed and tasseled with blue a large ring hung from either ear a pair of bracelets adorned her wrists rings with bezels of priceless gems were on her fingers and she hent in hand a long rod of rattan cane which she thrust into the frying pan saying O fish O fish be ye constant to your covenant When the cookmaiden saw this apparition she swooned away The young lady repeated her words a second time and a third time and at last the fishes raised their heads from the pan and saying in articulate speech Yes Yes began with one voice to recite Come back and so will I Keep faith and so will I And if ye fain forsake I ll requite till quits we cry After this the young lady upset the frying pan and went forth by the way she came in and the kitchen wall closed upon her When the cook maiden recovered from her fainting fit she saw the four fishes charred black as charcoal and crying out His staff brake in his first bout FN one hundred seven she again fell swooning to the ground Whilst she was in this case the Wazir came for the fish and looking upon her as insensible she lay not knowing Sunday from Thursday shoved her with his foot and said Bring the fish for the Sultan Thereupon recovering from her fainting fit she wept and in formed him of her case and all that had befallen her The Wazir marvelled greatly and exclaiming This is none other than a right strange matter he sent after the Fisherman and said to him Thou O Fisherman must needs fetch us four fishes like those thou broughtest before Thereupon the man repaired to the tarn and cast his net and when he landed it lo four fishes were therein exactly like the first These he at once carried to the Wazir who went in with them to the cook maiden and said Up with thee and fry these in my presence that I may see this business The damsel arose and cleansed the fish and set them in the frying pan over the fire however they remained there but a little while ere the wall crave asunder and the young lady appeared clad as before and holding in hand the wand which she again thrust into the frying pan saying O fish O fish be ye constant to your olden covenant And behold the fish lifted their heads and repeated Yes Yes and recited this couplet Come back and so will I Keep faith and so will I But if ye fain forsake I ll requite till quits we cry And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Seventh Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the fishes spoke and the young lady upset the frying pan with her rod and went forth by the way she came and the wall closed up the Wazir cried out This is a thing not to be hidden from the King So he went and told him what had happened where upon quoth the King There is no help for it but that I see this with mine own eyes Then he sent for the Fisherman and commended him to bring four other fish like the first and to take with him three men as witnesses The Fisherman at once brought the fish and the King after ordering them to give him four hundred gold pieces turned to the Wazir and said Up and fry me the fishes here before me The Minister replying To hear is to obey bade bring the frying pan threw therein the cleansed fish and set it over the fire when lo the wall crave asunder and out burst a black slave like a huge rock or a remnant of the tribe Ad FN one hundred eight bearing in hand a branch of a green tree and he cried in loud and terrible tones O fish O fish be ye all constant to your antique covenant whereupon the fishes lifted their heads from the frying pan and said Yes Yes we be true to our vow and they again recited the couplet Come back and so will I Keep faith and so will I But if ye fain forsake I ll requite till quits we cry Then the huge blackamoor approached the frying pan and upset it with the branch and went forth by the way he came in When he vanished from their sight the King inspected the fish and finding them all charred black as charcoal was utterly bewildered and said to the Wazir Verily this is a matter whereanent silence cannot be kept and as for the fishes assuredly some marvellous adventure connects with them So he bade bring the Fisherman and asked him saying Fie on thee fellow whence came these fishes and he answered From a tarn between four heights lying behind this mountain which is in sight of thy city Quoth the King How many days march Quoth he O our lord the Sultan a walk of half hour The King wondered and straight way ordering his men to march and horsemen to mount led off the Fisherman who went before as guide privily damning the Ifrit They fared on till they had climbed the mountain and descended unto a great desert which they had never seen during all their lives and the Sultan and his merry men marvelled much at the wold set in the midst of four mountains and the tarn and its fishes of four colours red and white yellow and blue The King stood fixed to the spot in wonderment and asked his troops and all present Hath any one among you ever seen this piece of water before now and all made answer O King of the age never did we set eyes upon it during all our days They also questioned the oldest inhabitants they met men well stricken in years but they replied each and every A lakelet this we never saw in this place Thereupon quoth the King By Allah I will neither return to my capital nor sit upon the throne of my forbears till I learn the truth about this tarn and the fish therein He then ordered his men to dismount and bivouac all around the mountain which they did and summoning his Wazir a Minister of much experience sagacious of penetrating wit and well versed in affairs said to him Tis in my mind to do a certain thing whereof I will inform thee my heart telleth me to fare forth alone this night and root out the mystery of this tarn and its fishes Do thou take thy seat at my tent door and say to the Emirs and Wazirs the Nabobs and the Chamberlains in fine to all who ask thee The Sultan is ill at ease and he hath ordered me to refuse all admittance FN one hundred nine and be careful thou let none know my design And the Wazir could not oppose him Then the King changed his dress and ornaments and slinging his sword over his shoulder took a path which led up one of the mountains and marched for the rest of the night till morning dawned nor did he cease wayfaring till the heat was too much for him After his long walk he rested for a while and then resumed his march and fared on through the second night till dawn when suddenly there appeared a black point in the far distance Hereat he rejoiced and said to himself Haply some one here shall acquaint me with the mystery of the tarn and its fishes Presently drawing near the dark object he found it a palace built of swart stone plated with iron and while one leaf of the gate stood wide open the other was shut The King s spirits rose high as he stood before the gate and rapped a light rap but hearing no answer he knocked a second knock and a third yet there came no sign Then he knocked his loudest but still no answer so he said Doubtless tis empty Thereupon he mustered up resolution and boldly walked through the main gate into the great hall and there cried out aloud Holla ye people of the palace I am a stranger and a wayfarer have you aught here of victual He repeated his cry a second time and a third but still there came no reply so strengthening his heart and making up his mind he stalked through the vestibule into the very middle of the palace and found no man in it Yet it was furnished with silken stuffs gold starred and the hangings were let down over the door ways In the midst was a spacious court off which set four open saloons each with its raised dais saloon facing saloon a canopy shaded the court and in the centre was a jetting fount with four figures of lions made of red gold spouting from their mouths water clear as pearls and diaphanous gems Round about the palace birds were let loose and over it stretched a net of golden wire hindering them from flying off in brief there was everything but human beings The King marvelled mightily thereat yet felt he sad at heart for that he saw no one to give him account of the waste and its tarn the fishes the mountains and the palace itself Presently as he sat between the doors in deep thought behold there came a voice of lament as from a heart grief spent and he heard the voice chanting these verses I hid what I endured of him FN one hundred ten and yet it came to light And nightly sleep mine eyelids fled and changed to sleepless night Oh world Oh Fate withhold thy hand and cease thy hurt and harm Look and behold my hapless sprite in colour and affright Wilt ne er show ruth to highborn youth who lost him on the way Of Love and fell from wealth and fame to lowest basest wight Jealous of Zephyr s breath was I as on your form he breathed But whenas Destiny descends she blindeth human sight FN one hundred eleven What shall the hapless archer do who when he fronts his foe And bends his bow to shoot the shaft shall find his string undight When cark and care so heavy bear on youth FN one hundred twelve of generous soul How shall he scape his lot and where from Fate his place of flight Now when the Sultan heard the mournful voice he sprang to his feet and following the sound found a curtain let down over a chamber door He raised it and saw behind it a young man sitting upon a couch about a cubit above the ground and he fair to the sight a well shaped wight with eloquence dight his forehead was flower white his cheek rosy bright and a mole on his cheek breadth like an ambergris mite even as the poet cloth indite A youth slim waisted from whose locks and brow The world in blackness and in light is set Throughout Creation s round no fairer show No rarer sight thine eye hath ever met A nut brown mole sits throned upon a cheek Of rosiest red beneath an eye of jet FN one hundred thirteen The King rejoiced and saluted him but he remained sitting in his caftan of silken stuff pureed with Egyptian gold and his crown studded with gems of sorts but his face was sad with the traces of sorrow He returned the royal salute in most courteous wise adding O my lord thy dignity demandeth my rising to thee and my sole excuse is to crave thy pardon FN one hundred fourteen Quoth the King Thou art excused O youth so look upon me as thy guest come hither on an especial object I would thou acquaint me with the secrets of this tarn and its fishes and of this palace and thy loneliness therein and the cause of thy groaning and wailing When the young man heard these words he wept with sore weeping FN one hundred fifteen till his bosom was drenched with tears and began reciting Say him who careless sleeps what while the shaft of Fortune flies How many cloth this shifting world lay low and raise to rise Although thine eye be sealed in sleep sleep not th Almighty s eyes And who hath found Time ever fair or Fate in constant guise Then he sighed a long fetched sigh and recited Confide thy case to Him the Lord who made mankind Quit cark and care and cultivate content of mind Ask not the Past or how or why it came to pass All human things by Fate and Destiny were designed The King marvelled and asked him What maketh thee weep O young man and he answered How should I not weep when this is my case Thereupon he put out his hand and raised the skirt of his garment when lo the lower half of him appeared stone down to his feet while from his navel to the hair of his head he was man The King seeing this his plight grieved with sore grief and of his compassion cried Alack and well away in very sooth O youth thou heapest sorrow upon my sorrow I was minded to ask thee the mystery of the fishes only whereas now I am concerned to learn thy story as well as theirs But there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great FN one hundred sixteen Lose no time O youth but tell me forthright thy whole tale Quoth he Lend me thine ears thy sight and thine insight and quoth the King All are at thy service Thereupon the youth began Right wondrous and marvellous is my case and that of these fishes and were it graven with gravers upon the eye corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned How is that asked the King and the young man began to tell The Tale of the Ensorcelled Prince Know then O my lord that whilome my sire was King of this city and his name was Mahmud entitled Lord of the Black Islands and owner of what are now these four mountains He ruled three score and ten years after which he went to the mercy of the Lord and I reigned as Sultan in his stead I took to wife my cousin the daughter of my paternal uncle FN one hundred seventeen and she loved me with such abounding love that whenever I was absent she ate not and she drank not until she saw me again She cohabited with me for five years till a certain day when she went forth to the Hammam bath and I bade the cook hasten to get ready all requisites for our supper And I entered this palace and lay down on the bed where I was wont to sleep and bade two damsels to fan my face one sitting by my head and the other at my feet But I was troubled and made restless by my wife s absence and could not sleep for although my eyes were closed my mind and thoughts were wide awake Presently I heard the slave girl at my head say to her at my feet O Mas udah how miserable is our master and how wasted in his youth and oh the pity of his being so be trayed by our mistress the accursed whore FN one hundred eighteen The other replied Yes indeed Allah curse all faithless women and adulterous but the like of our master with his fair gifts deserveth something better than this harlot who lieth abroad every night Then quoth she who sat by my head Is our lord dumb or fit only for bubbling that he questioneth her not and quoth the other Fie on thee cloth our lord know her ways or cloth she allow him his choice Nay more cloth she not drug every night the cup she giveth him to drink before sleep time and put Bhang FN one hundred nineteen into it So he sleepeth and wotteth not whither she goeth nor what she doeth but we know that after giving him the drugged wine she donneth her richest raiment and perfumeth herself and then she fareth out from him to be away till break of day then she cometh to him and burneth a pastile under his nose and he awaketh from his deathlike sleep When I heard the slave girl s words the light became black before my sight and I thought night would never fall Presently the daughter of my uncle came from the baths and they set the table for us and we ate and sat together a fair half hour quaffing our wine as was ever our wont Then she called for the particular wine I used to drink before sleeping and reached me the cup but seeming to drink it according to my wont I poured the contents into my bosom and lying down let her hear that I was asleep Then behold she cried Sleep out the night and never wake again by Allah I loathe thee and I loathe thy whole body and my soul turneth in disgust from cohabiting with thee and I see not the moment when Allah shall snatch away thy life Then she rose and donned her fairest dress and perfumed her person and slung my sword over her shoulder and opening the gates of the palace went her ill way I rose and followed her as she left the palace and she threaded the streets until she came to the city gate where she spoke words I understood not and the padlocks dropped of themselves as if broken and the gate leaves opened She went forth and I after her without her noticing aught till she came at last to the outlying mounds FN one hundred twenty and a reed fence built about a round roofed hut of mud bricks As she entered the door I climbed upon the roof which commanded a view of the interior and lo my fair cousin had gone in to a hideous negro slave with his upper lip like the cover of a pot and his lower like an open pot lips which might sweep up sand from the gravel floor of the cot He was to boot a leper and a paralytic lying upon a strew of sugar cane trash and wrapped in an old blanket and the foulest rags and tatters She kissed the earth before him and he raised his head so as to see her and said Woe to thee what call hadst thou to stay away all this time Here have been with me sundry of the black brethren who drank their wine and each had his young lady and I was not content to drink because of thine absence Then she O my lord my heart s love and coolth of my eyes FN one hundred twenty one knowest thou not that I am married to my cousin whose very look I loathe and hate myself when in his company And did not I fear for thy sake I would not let a single sun arise before making his city a ruined heap wherein raven should croak and howlet hoot and jackal and wolf harbour and loot nay I had removed its very stones to the back side of Mount Kaf FN one hundred twenty two Rejoined the slave Thou liest damn thee Now I swear an oath by the velour and honour of blackamoor men and deem not our manliness to be the poor manliness of white men from today forth if thou stay away till this hour I will not keep company with thee nor will I glue my body with thy body and strum and belly bump Dost play fast and loose with us thou cracked pot that we may satisfy thy dirty lusts stinkard bitch vilest of the vile whites When I heard his words and saw with my own eyes what passed between these two wretches the world waxed dark be fore my face and my soul knew not in what place it was But my wife humbly stood up weeping before and wheedling the slave and saying O my beloved and very fruit of my heart there is none left to cheer me but thy dear self and if thou cast me off who shall take me in O my beloved O light of my eyes And she ceased not weeping and abasing herself to him until he deigned be reconciled with her Then was she right glad and stood up and doffed her clothes even to her petticoat trousers and said zero my master what hast thou here for thy handmaiden to eat Uncover the basin he grumbled and thou shalt find t the bottom the broiled bones of some rats we dined on pick at them and then go to that slop pot where thou shalt find some leavings of beer FN one hundred twenty three which thou mayest drink So she ate and drank and washed her hands and went and lay down by the side of the slave upon the cane trash and stripping herself stark naked she crept in with him under his foul coverlet and his rags and tatters When I saw my wife my cousin the daughter of my uncle do this deed FN one hundred twenty four I clean lost my wits and climbing down from the roof I entered and took the sword which she had with her and drew it determined to cut down the twain I first struck at the slave s neck and thought that the death decree had fallen on him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eighth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the young ensorcelled Prince said to the King When I smote the slave with intent to strike off his head I thought that I had slain him for he groaned a loud hissing groan but I had cut only the skin and flesh of the gullet and the two arteries It awoke the daughter of my uncle so I sheathed the sword and fared forth for the city and entering the palace lay upon my bed and slept till morning when my wife aroused me and I saw that she had cut off her hair and had donned mourning garments Quoth she O son of my uncle blame me not for what I do it hath just reached me that my mother is dead and my father hath been killed in holy war and of my brothers one hath lost his life by a snake sting and the other by falling down some precipice and I can and should do naught save weep and lament When I heard her words I refrained from all reproach and said only Do as thou list I certainly will not thwart thee She continued sorrowing weeping and wailing one whole year from the beginning of its circle to the end and when it was finished she said to me I wish to build me in thy palace a tomb with a cupola which I will set apart for my mourning and will name the House of Lamentations FN one hundred twenty five Quoth I again Do as thou list Then she builded for herself a cenotaph wherein to mourn and set on its centre a dome under which showed a tomb like a Santon s sepulchre Thither she carried the slave and lodged him but he was exceeding weak by reason of his wound and unable to do her love service he could only drink wine and from the day of his hurt he spake not a word yet he lived on because his appointed hour FN one hundred twenty six was not come Every day morning and evening my wife went to him and wept and wailed over him and gave him wine and strong soups and left not off doing after this manner a second year and I bore with her patiently and paid no heed to her One day however I went in to her unawares and I found her weeping and beating her face and crying Why art thou absent from my sight O my heart s delight Speak to me O my life talk with me O my love Then she recited these verses For your love my patience fails and albeit you forget I may not nor to other love my heart can make reply Bear my body bear my soul wheresoever you may fare And where you pitch the camp let my body buried lie Cry my name above my grave and an answer shall return The moaning of my bones responsive to your cry FN one hundred twenty seven Then she recited weeping bitterly the while The day of my delight is the day when draw you near And the day of mine affright is the day you turn away Though I tremble through the night in my bitter dread of death When I hold you in my arms I am free from all affray Once more she began reciting Though a morn I may awake with all happiness in hand Though the world all be mine and like Kisra kings FN one hundred twenty eight I reign To me they had the worth of the winglet of the gnat When I fail to see thy form when I look for thee in vain When she had ended for a time her words and her weeping I said to her O my cousin let this thy mourning suffice for in pouring forth tears there is little profit Thwart me not answered she in aught I do or I will lay violent hands on myself So I held my peace and left her to go her own way and she ceased not to cry and keen and indulge her affliction for yet another year At the end of the third year I waxed aweary of this lonesome mourning and one day I happened to enter the cenotaph when vexed and angry with some matter which had thwarted me and suddenly I heard her say O my lord I never hear thee vouch safe a single word to me Why cost thou not answer me O my master and she began reciting O thou tomb O thou tomb be his beauty set in shade Hast thou darkened that countenance all sheeny as the noon O thou tomb neither earth nor yet heaven art to me Then how cometh it in thee are conjoined my sun and moon When I heard such verses as these rage was heaped upon my rage I cried out Well away how long is this sorrow to last and I began repeating O thou tomb O thou tomb be his horrors set in blight Hast thou dark ened his countenance that sickeneth the soul O thou tomb neither cess pool nor pipkin art to me Then how cometh it in thee are conjoined soil and coal When she heard my words she sprang to her feet crying Fie upon thee thou cur all this is of thy doings thou hast wounded my heart s darling and thereby worked me sore woe and thou hast wasted his youth so that these three years he hath lain abed more dead than alive In my wrath I cried O thou foulest of harlots and filthiest of whores ever futtered by negro slaves who are hired to have at thee FN one hundred twenty nine Yes indeed it was I who did this good deed and snatching up my sword I drew it and made at her to cut her down But she laughed my words and mine intent to scorn crying To heel hound that thou art Alas FN one hundred thirty for the past which shall no more come to pass nor shall any one avail the dead to raise Allah hath indeed now given into my hand him who did to me this thing a deed that hath burned my heart with a fire which died not and a flame which might not be quenched Then she stood up and pronouncing some words to me unintelligible she said By virtue of my egromancy become thou half stone and half man whereupon I became what thou seest unable to rise or to sit and neither dead nor alive Moreover she ensorcelled the city with all its streets and garths and she turned by her gramarye the four islands into four mountains around the tarn whereof thou questionest me and the citizens who were of four different faiths Moslem Nazarene Jew and Magian she transformed by her enchantments into fishes the Moslems are the white the Magians red the Christians blue and the Jews yellow FN one hundred thirty one And every day she tortureth me and scourgeth me with an hundred stripes each of which draweth floods of blood and cutteth the skin of my shoulders to strips and lastly she clotheth my upper half with a hair cloth and then throweth over them these robes Hereupon the young man again shed tears and began reciting In patience O my God I endure my lot and fate I will bear at will of Thee whatsoever be my state They oppress me they torture me they make my life a woe Yet haply Heaven s happiness shall compensate my strait Yea straitened is my life by the bane and hate o foes But Mustafa and Murtaza FN one hundred thirty two shall ope me Heaven s gate After this the Sultan turned towards the young Prince and said O youth thou hast removed one grief only to add another grief but now O my friend where is she and where is the mausoleum wherein lieth the wounded slave The slave lieth under yon dome quoth the young man and she sitteth in the chamber fronting yonder door And every day at sunrise she cometh forth and first strippeth me and whippeth me with an hundred strokes of the leathern scourge and I weep and shriek but there is no power of motion in my lower limbs to keep her off me After ending her tormenting me she visiteth the slave bringing him wine and boiled meats And to morrow at an early hour she will be here Quoth the King By Allah O youth I will as suredly do thee a good deed which the world shall not willingly let die and an act of derring do which shall be chronicled long after I am dead and gone by Then the King sat him by the side of the young Prince and talked till nightfall when he lay down and slept but as soon as the false dawn FN one hundred thirty three showed he arose and doffing his outer garments FN one hundred thirty four bared his blade and hastened to the place wherein lay the slave Then was he ware of lighted candles and lamps and the perfume of incenses and unguents and directed by these he made for the slave and struck him one stroke killing him on the spot after which he lifted him on his back and threw him into a well that was in the palace Presentry he returned and donning the slave s gear lay down at length within the mausoleum with the drawn sword laid close to and along his side After an hour or so the accursed witch came and first going to her husband she stripped off his clothes and taking a whip flogged him cruelly while he cried out Ah enough for me the case I am in take pity on me O my cousin But she replied Didst thou take pity on me and spare the life of my true love on whom I coated Then she drew the cilice over his raw and bleeding skin and threw the robe upon all and went down to the slave with a goblet of wine and a bowl of meat broth in her hands She entered under the dome weeping and wailing Well away and crying O my lord speak a word to me O my master talk awhile with me and began to recite these couplets How long this harshness this unlove shall bide Suffice thee not tear floods thou hast espied Thou cost prolong our parting purposely And if wouldst please my foe thou rt satisfied Then she wept again and said O my lord speak to me talk with me The King lowered his voice and twisting his tongue spoke after the fashion of the blackamoors and said lack lack there be no Ma esty and there be no Might save in Allauh the Gloriose the Great Now when she heard these words she shouted for joy and fell to the ground fainting and when her senses returned she asked O my lord can it be true that thou hast power of speech and the King making his voice small and faint answered O my cuss cost thou deserve that I talk to thee and speak with thee Why and wherefore rejoined she and he replied The why is that all the livelong day thou tormentest thy hubby and he keeps calling on eaven for aid until sleep is strange to me even from evenin till mawnin and he prays and damns cussing us two me and thee causing me disquiet and much bother were this not so I should long ago have got my health and it is this which prevents my answering thee Quoth she With thy leave I will release him from what spell is on him and quoth the King Release him and let s have some rest She cried To hear is to obey and going from the cenotaph to the palace she took a metal bowl and filled it with water and spake over it certain words which made the contents bubble and boil as a cauldron seetheth over the fire With this she sprinkled her husband saying By virtue of the dread words I have spoken if thou becamest thus by my spells come forth out of that form into shine own former form And lo and behold the young man shook and trembled then he rose to his feet and rejoicing at his deliverance cried aloud I testify that there is no god but the God and in very truth Mohammed is His Apostle whom Allah bless and keep Then she said to him Go forth and return not hither for if thou do I will surely slay thee screaming these words in his face So he went from between her hands and she returned to the dome and going down to the sepulchre she said O my lord come forth to me that I may look upon thee and thy goodliness The King replied in faint low words What FN one hundred thirty five thing hast thou done Thou hast rid me of the branch but not of the root She asked O my darling O my negro ring what is the root And he answered Fie on thee O my cuss The people of this city and of the four islands every night when it s half passed lift their heads from the tank in which thou hast turned them to fishes and cry to Heaven and call down its anger on me and thee and this is the reason why my body s baulked from health Go at once and set them free then come to me and take my hand and raise me up for a little strength is already back in me When she heard the King s words and she still supposed him to be the slave she cried joyously O my master on my head and on my eyes be thy commend Bismillah FN one hundred thirty six So she sprang to her feet and full of joy and gladness ran down to the tarn and took a little of its water n the palm of her hand And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it Was the Ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the young woman the sorceress took in hand some of the tarn water and spake over it words not to be understood the fishes lifted their heads and stood up on the instant like men the spell on the people of the city having been removed What was the lake again became a crowded capital the bazars were thronged with folk who bought and sold each citizen was occupied with his own calling and the four hills became islands as they were whilome Then the young woman that wicked sorceress returned to the King and still thinking he was the negro said to him O my love stretch forth thy honoured hand that I may assist thee to rise Nearer to me quoth the King in a faint and feigned tone She came close as to embrace him when he took up the sword lying hid by his side and smote her across the breast so that the point showed gleaming behind her back Then he smote her a second time and cut her in twain and cast her to the ground in two halves After which he fared forth and found the young man now freed from the spell awaiting him and gave him joy of his happy release while the Prince kissed his hand with abundant thanks Quoth the King Wilt thou abide in this city or go with me to my capital Quoth the youth O King of the age wottest thou not what journey is between thee and thy city Two days and a half answered he whereupon said the other An thou be sleeping O King awake Between thee and thy city is a year s march for a well girt walker and thou haddest not come hither in two days and a half save that the city was under enchantment And I O King will never part from thee no not even for the twinkling of an eye The King rejoiced at his words and said Thanks be to Allah who hath bestowed thee upon me From this hour thou art my son and my only son for that in all my life I have never been blessed with issue Thereupon they embraced and joyed with exceeding great joy and reaching the palace the Prince who had been spell bound informed his lords and his grandees that he was about to visit the Holy Places as a pilgrim and bade them get ready all things necessary for the occasion The preparations lasted ten days after which he set out with the Sultan whose heart burned in yearning for his city whence he had been absent a whole twelvemonth They journeyed with an escort of Mamelukes FN one hundred thirty seven carrying all manners of precious gifts and rarities nor stinted they wayfaring day and night for a full year until they approached the Sultan s capital and sent on messengers to announce their coming Then the Wazir and the whole army came out to meet him in joy and gladness for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their King and the troops kissed the ground before him and wished him joy of his safety He entered and took seat upon his throne and the Minister came before him and when acquainted with all that had be fallen the young Prince he congratulated him on his narrow escape When order was restored throughout the land the King gave largesse to many of his people and said to the Wazir Hither the Fisherman who brought us the fishes So he sent for the man who had been the first cause of the city and the citizens being delivered from enchantment and when he came in to the presence the Sultan bestowed upon him a dress of honour and questioned him of his condition and whether he had children The Fisherman gave him to know that he had two daughters and a son so the King sent for them and taking one daughter to wife gave the other to the young Prince and made the son his head treasurer Furthermore he invested his Wazir with the Sultanate of the City in the Black Islands whilome belonging to the young Prince and dispatched with him the escort of fifty armed slaves together with dresses of honour for all the Emirs and Grandees The Wazir kissed hands and fared forth on his way while the Sultan and the Prince abode at home in all the solace and the delight of life and the Fisherman became the richest man of his age and his daughters wived with Kings until death came to them And yet O King this is not more wondrous than the story of The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad Once upon a time there was a Porter in Baghdad who was a bachelor and who would remain unmarried It came to pass on a certain day as he stood about the street leaning idly upon his crate behold there stood before him an honourable woman in a mantilla of Mosul FN one hundred thirty eight silk broidered with gold and bordered with brocade her walking shoes were also purfled with gold and her hair floated in long plaits She raised her face veil FN one hundred thirty nine and showing two black eyes fringed with jetty lashes whose glances were soft and languishing and whose perfect beauty was ever blandishing she accosted the Porter and said in the suavest tones and choicest language Take up thy crate and follow me The Porter was so dazzled he could hardly believe that he heard her aright but he shouldered his basket in hot haste saying in himself O day of good luck O day of Allah s grace and walked after her till she stopped at the door of a house There she rapped and presently came out to her an old man a Nazarene to whom she gave a gold piece receiving from him in return what she required of strained wine clear as olive oil and she set it safely in the hamper saying Lift and follow Quoth the Porter This by Allah is indeed an auspicious day a day propitious for the granting of all a man wisheth He again hoisted up the crate and followed her till she stopped at a fruiterer s shop and bought from him Shami FN one hundred forty apples and Osmani quinces and Omani FN one hundred forty one peaches and cucumbers of Nile growth and Egyptian limes and Sultani oranges and citrons besides Aleppine jasmine scented myrtle berries Damascene nenuphars flower of privet FN one hundred forty two and camomile blood red anemones violets and pomegranate bloom eglantine and narcissus and set the whole in the Porter s crate saying Up with it So he lifted and followed her till she stopped at a butcher s booth and said Cut me off ten pounds of mutton She paid him his price and he wrapped it in a banana leaf whereupon she laid it in the crate and said Hoist O Porter He hoisted accordingly and followed her as she walked on till she stopped at a grocer s where she bought dry fruits and pistachio kernels Tihamah raisins shelled almonds and all wanted for dessert and said to the Porter Lift and follow me So he up with his hamper and after her till she stayed at the confectioner s and she bought an earthen platter and piled it with all kinds of sweetmeats in his shop open worked tarts and fritters scented with musk and soap cakes and lemon loaves and melon preserves FN one hundred forty three and Zaynab s combs and ladies fingers and Kazi s tit bits and goodies of every description and placed the platter in the Porter s crate Thereupon quoth he being a merry man Thou shouldest have told me and I would have brought with me a pony or a she camel to carry all this market stuff She smiled and gave him a little cuff on the nape saying Step out and exceed not in words for Allah willing thy wage will not be wanting Then she stopped at a perfumer s and took from him ten sorts of waters rose scented with musk grange Lower waterlily willow flower violet and five others and she also bought two loaves of sugar a bottle for perfume spraying a lump of male in cense aloe wood ambergris and musk with candles of Alex andria wax and she put the whole into the basket saying Up with thy crate and after me He did so and followed until she stood before the greengrocer s of whom she bought pickled safflower and olives in brine and in oil with tarragon and cream cheese and hard Syrian cheese and she stowed them away in the crate saying to the Porter Take up thy basket and follow me He did so and went after her till she came to a fair mansion fronted by a spacious court a tall fine place to which columns gave strength and grace and the gate thereof had two leaves of ebony inlaid with plates of red gold The lady stopped at the door and turning her face veil sideways knocked softly with her knuckles whilst the Porter stood behind her thinking of naught save her beauty and loveliness Presently the door swung back and both leaves were opened whereupon he looked to see who had opened it and behold it was a lady of tall figure some five feet high a model of beauty and loveliness brilliance and symmetry and perfect grace Her forehead was flower white her cheeks like the anemone ruddy bright her eyes were those of the wild heifer or the gazelle with eyebrows like the crescent moon which ends Sha aban and begins Ramazan FN one hundred forty four her mouth was the ring of Sulayman FN one hundred forty five her lips coral red and her teeth like a line of strung pearls or of camomile petals Her throat recalled the antelope s and her breasts like two pomegranates of even size stood at bay as it were FN one hundred forty six her body rose and fell in waves below her dress like the rolls of a piece of brocade and her navel FN one hundred forty seven would hold an ounce of benzoin ointment In fine she was like her of whom the poet said On Sun and Moon of palace cast thy sight Enjoy her flower like face her fragrant light Thine eyes shall never see in hair so black Beauty encase a brow so purely white The ruddy rosy cheek proclaims her claim Though fail her name whose beauties we indite As sways her gait I smile at hips so big And weep to see the waist they bear so slight When the Porter looked upon her his wits were waylaid and his senses were stormed so that his crate went nigh to fall from his head and he said to himself Never have I in my life seen a day more blessed than this day Then quoth the lady portress to the lady cateress Come in from the gate and relieve this poor man of his load So the provisioner went in followed by the portress and the Porter and went on till they reached a spacious ground floor hall FN one hundred forty eight built with admirable skill and beautified with all manner colours and carvings with upper balconies and groined arches and galleries and cupboards and recesses whose curtains hung before them In the midst stood a great basin full of water surrounding a fine fountain and at the upper end on the raised dais was a couch of juniper wood set with gems and pearls with a canopy like mosquito curtains of red satin silk looped up with pearls as big as filberts and bigger Thereupon sat a lady bright of blee with brow beaming brilliancy the dream of philosophy whose eyes were fraught with Babel s gramarye FN one hundred forty nine and her eye brows were arched as for archery her breath breathed ambergris and perfumery and her lips were sugar to taste and carnelian to see Her stature was straight as the letter I FN one hundred fifty and her face shamed the noon sun s radiancy and she was even as a galaxy or a dome with golden marquetry or a bride displayed in choicest finery or a noble maid of Araby FN one hundred fifty one Right well of her sang the bard when he said Her smiles twin rows of pearls display Chamomile buds or rimey spray Her tresses stray as night let down And shames her light the dawn o day FN one hundred fifty two The third lady rising from the couch stepped forward with grace ful swaying gait till she reached the middle of the saloon when she said to her sisters Why stand ye here take it down from this poor man s head Then the cateress went and stood before him and the portress behind him while the third helped them and they lifted the load from the Porter s head and emptying it of all that was therein set everything in its place Lastly they gave him two gold pieces saying Wend thy ways O Porter But he went not for he stood looking at the ladies and admiring what uncommon beauty was theirs and their pleasant manners and kindly dispositions never had he seen goodlier and he gazed wistfully at that good store of wines and sweet scented flowers and fruits and other matters Also he marvelled with exceeding marvel especially to see no man in the place and delayed his going whereupon quoth the eldest lady What aileth thee that goest not haply thy wage be too little And turning to her sister the cateress she said Give him another diner But the Porter answered By Allah my lady it is not for the wage my hire is never more than two dirhams but in very sooth my heart and my soul are taken up with you and your condition I wonder to see you single with ne er a man about you and not a soul to bear you company and well you wot that the minaret toppleth o er unless it stand upon four and you want this same fourth and women s pleasure without man is short of measure even as the poet said Seest not we want for joy four things all told The harp and lute the flute and flageolet And be they companied with scents four fold Rose myrtle anemone and violet Nor please all eight an four thou wouldst withold Good wine and youth and gold and pretty pet You be there and want a fourth who shall be a person of good sense and prudence smart witted and one apt to keep careful counsel His words pleased and amused them much and they laughed at him and said And who is to assure us of that We are maidens and we fear to entrust our secret where it may not be kept for we have read in a certain chronicle the lines of one Ibn al Sumam Hold fast thy secret and to none unfold Lost is a secret when that secret s told An fail thy breast thy secret to conceal How canst thou hope another s breast shall hold And Abu Nowas FN one hundred fifty three said well on the same subject Who trusteth secret to another s hand Upon his brow deserveth burn of brand When the Porter heard their words he rejoined By your lives I am a man of sense and a discreet who hath read books and perused chronicles I reveal the fair and conceal the foul and I act as the poet adviseth None but the good a secret keep And good men keep it unrevealed It is to me a well shut house With keyless locks and door ensealed FN one hundred fifty four When the maidens heard his verse and its poetical application addressed to them they said Thou knowest that we have laid out all our monies on this place Now say hast thou aught to offer us in return for entertainment For surely we will not suf fer thee to sit in our company and be our cup companion and gaze upon our faces so fair and so rare without paying a round sum FN one hundred fifty five Wottest thou not the saying Sans hope of gain Love s not worth a grain Whereto the lady portress added If thou bring anything thou art a something if no thing be off with thee thou art a nothing but the procuratrix interposed saying Nay O my sisters leave teasing him for by Allah he hath not failed us this day and had he been other he never had kept patience with me so whatever be his shot and scot I will take it upon myself The Porter over joyed kissed the ground before her and thanked her saying By Allah these monies are the first fruits this day hath given me Hearing this they said Sit thee down and welcome to thee and the eldest lady added By Allah we may not suffer thee to join us save on one condition and this it is that no questions be asked as to what concerneth thee not and frowardness shall be soundly flogged Answered the Porter I agree to this O my lady on my head and my eyes be it Lookye I am dumb I have no tongue Then arose the provisioneress and tightening her girdle set the table by the fountain and put the flowers and sweet herbs in their jars and strained the wine and ranged the flasks in row and made ready every requisite Then sat she down she and her sisters placing amidst them the Porter who kept deeming himself in a dream and she took up the wine flagon and poured out the first cup and drank it off and likewise a second and a third FN one hundred fifty six After this she filled a fourth cup which she handed to one of her sisters and lastly she crowned a goblet and passed it to the Porter saying Drink the dear draught drink free and fain What healeth every grief and pain He took the cup in his hand and louting low returned his best thanks and improvised Drain not the bowl save with a trusty friend A man of worth whose good old For wine like wind sucks sweetness from the sweet And stinks when over stench it haply blow Adding Drain not the bowl save from dear hand like thine The cup recall thy gifts thou gifts of wine After repeating this couplet he kissed their hands and drank and was drunk and sat swaying from side to side and pursued All drinks wherein is blood the Law unclean Doth hold save one the blood shed of the vine Fill fill take all my wealth bequeathed or won Thou fawn a willing ransom for those eyne Then the cateress crowned a cup and gave it to the portress who took it from her hand and thanked her and drank Thereupon she poured again and passed to the eldest lady who sat on the couch and filled yet another and handed it to the Porter He kissed the ground before them and after drinking and thanking them he again began to recite Here Here by Allah here Cups of the sweet the dear Fill me a brimming bowl The Fount o Life I speer Then the Porter stood up before the mistress of the house and said O lady I am thy slave thy Mameluke thy white thrall a thy very bondsman and he began reciting A slave of slaves there standeth at thy door Lauding thy generous boons and gifts galore Beauty may he come in awhile to joy Thy charms for Love and I part nevermore She said to him Drink and health and happiness attend thy drink So he took the cup and kissed her hand and recited these lines in sing song I gave her brave old wine that like her cheeks Blushed red or flame from furnace flaring up She bussed the brim and said with many a smile How durst thou deal folk s cheek for folk to sup Drink said I these are tears of mine whose tinct Is heart blood sighs have boiled in the cup She answered him in the following couplet An tears of blood for me friend thou hast shed Suffer me sup them by thy head and eyes Then the lady took the cup and drank it off to her sisters health and they ceased not drinking the Porter being in the midst of them and dancing and laughing and reciting verses and singing ballads and ritornellos All this time the Porter was carrying on with them kissing toying biting handling groping fingering whilst one thrust a dainty morsel in his mouth and another slapped him and this cuffed his cheeks and that threw sweet flowers at him and he was in the very paradise of pleasure as though he were sitting in the seventh sphere among the Houris FN one hundred fifty seven of Heaven They ceased not doing after this fashion until the wine played tucks in their heads and worsted their wits and when the drink got the better of them the portress stood up and doffed her clothes till she was mother naked However she let down her hair about her body by way of shift and throwing herself into the basin disported herself and dived like a duck and swam up and down and took water in her mouth and spurted it all over the Porter and washed her limbs and between her breasts and inside her thighs and all around her navel Then she came up out of the cistern and throwing herself on the Porter s lap said O my lord O my love what callest thou this article pointing to her slit her solution of continuity I call that thy cleft quoth the Porter and she rejoined Wah wah art thou not ashamed to use such a word and she caught him by the collar and soundly cuffed him Said he again Thy womb thy vulva and she struck him a second slap crying O fie O fie this is another ugly word is here no shame in thee Quoth he Thy coynte and she cried O thou art wholly destitute of modesty and thumped and bashed him Then cried the Porter Thy clitoris FN one hundred fifty eight whereat the eldest lady came down upon him with a yet sorer beating and said No and he said Tis so and the Porter went on calling the same commodity by sundry other names but whatever he said they beat him more and more till his neck ached and swelled with the blows he had gotten and on this wise they made him a butt and a laughing stock At last he turned upon them asking And what do you women call this article Whereto the damsel made answer The basil of the bridges FN one hundred fifty nine Cried the Porter Thank Allah for my safety aid me and be thou propitious O basil of the bridges They passed round the cup and tossed off the bowl again when the second lady stood up and stripping off all her clothes cast herself into the cistern and did as the first had done then she came out of the water and throwing her naked form on the Porter s lap pointed to her machine and said O light of mine eyes do tell me what is the name of this concern He replied as before Thy slit and she rejoined Hath such term no shame for thee and cuffed him and buffeted him till the saloon rang with the blows Then quoth she O fie O fie how canst thou say this without blushing He suggested The basil of the bridges but she would not have it and she said No no and stuck him and slapped him on the back of the neck Then he began calling out all the names he knew Thy slit thy womb thy coynte thy clitoris and the girls kept on saying No no So he said I stick to the basil of the bridges and all the three laughed till they fell on their backs and laid slaps on his neck and said No no that s not its proper name Thereupon he cried O my sisters what is its name and they replied What sayest thou to the husked sesame seed Then the cateress donned her clothes and they fell again to carousing but the Porter kept moaning Oh and Oh for his neck and shoulders and the cup passed merrily round and round again for a full hour After that time the eldest and handsomest lady stood up and stripped off her garments whereupon the Porter took his neck in hand and rubbed and shampoo d it saying My neck and shoulders are on the way of Allah FN one hundred sixty Then she threw herself into the basin and swam and dived sported and washed and the Porter looked at her naked figure as though she had been a slice of the moon FN one hundred sixty one and at her face with the sheen of Luna when at full or like the dawn when it brighteneth and he noted her noble stature and shape and those glorious forms that quivered as she went for she was naked as the Lord made her Then he cried Alack Alack and began to address her versifying in these couplets If I liken thy shape to the bough when green My likeness errs and I sore mistake it For the bough is fairest when clad the most And thou art fairest when mother naked When the lady heard his verses she came up out of the basin and seating herself upon his lap and knees pointed to her genitory and said O my lordling what be the name of this Quoth he The basil of the bridges but she said Bah bah Quoth he The husked sesame quoth she Pooh pooh Then said he Thy womb and she cried Fie Fie art thou not ashamed of thyself and cuffed him on the nape of the neck And whatever name he gave declaring Tis so she beat him and cried No no till at last he said O my sisters and what is its name She replied It is entitled the Khan FN one hundred sixty two of Abu Mansur whereupon the Porter replied Ha ha O Allah be praised for safe deliverance O Khan of Abu Mansur Then she came forth and dressed and the cup went round a full hour At last the Porter rose up and stripping off all his clothes jumped into the tank and swam about and washed under his bearded chin and armpits even as they had done Then he came out and threw himself into the first lady s lap and rested his arms upon the lap of the portress and reposed his legs in the lap of the cateress and pointed to his prickle FN one hundred sixty three and said O my mistresses what is the name of this article All laughed at his words till they fell on their backs and one said Thy pintle But he replied No and gave each one of them a bite by way of forfeit Then said they Thy pizzle but he cried No and gave each of them a hug And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Tenth Night Quoth her sister Dunyazad Finish for us thy story and she answered With joy and goodly greet It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsels stinted not saying to the Porter Thy prickle thy pintle thy pizzle and he ceased not kissing and biting and hugging until his heart was satisfied and they laughed on till they could no more At last one said O our brother what then is it called Quoth he Know ye not Quoth they No Its veritable name said he is mule Burst all which browseth on the basil of the bridges and muncheth the husked sesame and nighteth in the Khan of Abu Mansur Then laughed they till they fell on their backs and returned to their carousel and ceased not to be after this fashion till night began to fall Thereupon said they to the Porter Bismillah FN one hundred sixty four O our master up and on with those sorry old shoes of thine and turn thy face and show us the breadth of thy shoulders Said he By Allah to part with my soul would be easier for me than departing from you come let us join night to day and tomorrow morning we will each wend our own way My life on you said the procuratrix suffer him to tarry with us that we may laugh at him we may live out our lives and never meet with his like for surely he is a right merry rogue and a witty FN one hundred sixty five So they said Thou must not remain with us this night save on condition that thou submit to our commands and that whatso thou seest thou ask no questions there anent nor enquire of its cause All right rejoined he and they said Go read the writing over the door So he rose and went to the entrance and there found written in letters of gold wash WHOSO SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT SHALL HEAR WHAT PLEASETH HIM NOT FN one hundred sixty six The Porter said Be ye witnesses against me that I will not speak on whatso concerneth me not Then the cateress arose and set food before them and they ate after which they changed their drinking place for an other and she lighted the lamps and candles and burned amber gris and aloes wood and set on fresh fruit and the wine service when they fell to carousing and talking of their lovers And they ceased not to eat and drink and chat nibbling dry fruits and laughing and playing tricks for the space of a full hour when lo a knock was heard at the gate The knocking in no wise dis turbed the seance but one of them rose and went to see what it was and presently returned saying Truly our pleasure for this night is to be perfect How is that asked they and she answered At the gate be three Persian Kalandars FN one hundred sixty seven with their beards and heads and eyebrows shaven and all three blind of the left eye which is surely a strange chance They are foreigners from Roum land with the mark of travel plain upon them they have just entered Baghdad this being their first visit to our city and the cause of their knocking at our door is simply because they cannot find a lodging Indeed one of them said to me Haply the owner of this mansion will let us have the key of his stable or some old out house wherein we may pass this night for evening had surprised them and being strangers in the land they knew none who would give them shelter And O my sisters each of them is a figure o fun after his own fashion and if we let them in we shall have matter to make sport of She gave not over persuading them till they said to her Let them in and make thou the usual condition with them that they speak not of what concerneth them not lest they hear what pleaseth them not So she rejoiced and going to the door presently returned with the three monoculars whose beards and mustachios were clean shaven FN one hundred sixty eight They salam d and stood afar off by way of respect but the three ladies rose up to them and welcomed them and wished them joy of their safe arrival and made them sit down The Kalandars looked at the room and saw that it was a pleasant place clean swept and garnished with cowers and the lamps were burning and the smoke of perfumes was spireing in air and beside the dessert and fruits and wine there were three fair girls who might be maidens so they exclaimed with one voice By Allah tis good Then they turned to the Porter and saw that he was a merry faced wight albeit he was by no means sober and was sore after his slappings So they thought that he was one of themselves and said A mendicant like us whether Arab or foreigner FN one hundred sixty nine But when the Porter heard these words he rose up and fixing his eyes fiercely upon them said Sit ye here without exceeding in talk Have you not read what is writ over the door surely it befitteth not fellows who come to us like paupers to wag your tongues at us We crave thy pardon O Fakir FN one hundred seventy rejoined they and our heads are between thy hands The ladies laughed consumedly at the squabble and making peace between the Kalandars and the Porter seated the new guests before meat and they ate Then they sat together and the portress served them with drink and as the cup went round merrily quoth the Porter to the askers And you O brothers mine have ye no story or rare adventure to amuse us withal Now the warmth of wine having mounted to their heads they called for musical instruments and the portress brought them a tambourine of Mosul and a lute of Irak and a Persian harp and each mendicant took one and tuned it this the tambourine and those the lute and the harp and struck up a merry tune while the ladies sang so lustily that there was a great noise FN one hundred seventy one And whilst they were carrying on behold some one knocked at the gate and the portress went to see what was the matter there Now the cause of that knocking O King quoth Shahrazad was this the Caliph Harun al Rashid had gone forth from the palace as was his wont now and then to solace himself in the city that night and to see and hear what new thing was stirring he was in merchant s gear and he was attended by Ja afar his Wazir and by Masrur his Sworder of Vengeance FN one hundred seventy two As they walked about the city their way led them towards the house of the three ladies where they heard the loud noise of musical instruments and singing and merriment so quoth the Caliph to Ja afar I long to enter this house and hear those songs and see who sing them Quoth Ja afar O Prince of the Faithful these folk are surely drunken with wine and I fear some mischief betide us if we get amongst them There is no help but that I go in there replied the Caliph and I desire thee to contrive some pretext for our appearing among them Ja afar replied I hear and I obey FN one hundred seventy three and knocked at the door whereupon the portress came out and opened Then Ja afar came forward and kissing the ground before her said O my lady we be merchants from Tiberias town we arrived at Baghdad ten days ago and alighting at the merchants caravanserai we sold all our merchandise Now a certain trader invited us to an entertainment this night so we went to his house and he set food before us and we ate then we sat at wine and wassail with him for an hour or so when he gave us leave to depart and we went out from him in the shadow of the night and being strangers we could not find our way back to our Khan So haply of your kindness and courtesy you will suffer us to tarry with you this night and Heaven will reward you FN one hundred seventy four The portress looked upon them and seeing them dressed like merchants and men of grave looks and solid she returned to her sisters and repeated to them Ja afar s story and they took compassion upon the strangers and said to her Let them enter She opened the door to them when said they to her Have we thy leave to come in Come in quoth she and the Caliph entered followed by Ja afar and Masrur and when the girls saw them they stood up to them in respect and made them sit down and looked to their wants saying Welcome and well come and good cheer to the guests but with one condition What is that asked they and one of the ladies answered Speak not of what concerneth you not lest ye hear what pleaseth you not Even so said they and sat down to their wine and drank deep Presently the Caliph looked on the three Kalandars and seeing them each and every blind of the left eye wondered at the sight then he gazed upon the girls and he was startled and he marvelled with exceeding marvel at their beauty and loveliness They continued to carouse and to converse and said to the Caliph Drink but he replied I am vowed to Pilgrimage FN one hundred seventy five and drew back from the wine Thereupon the portress rose and spreading before him a table cloth worked with gold set thereon a porcelain bowl into which she poured willow flower water with a lump of snow and a spoonful of sugar candy The Caliph thanked her and said in himself By Allah I will recompense her to morrow for the kind deed she hath done The others again addressed themselves to conversing and carousing and when the wine gat the better of them the eldest lady who ruled the house rose and making obeisance to them took the cateress by the hand and said Rise O my sister and let us do what is our devoir Both answered Even so Then the portress stood up and proceeded to remove the table service and the remnants of the banquet and renewed the pastiles and cleared the middle of the saloon Then she made the Kalandars sit upon a sofa at the side of the estrade and seated the Caliph and Ja afar and Masrur on the other side of the saloon after which she called the Porter and said How scanty is thy courtesy now thou art no stranger nay thou art one of the household So he stood up and tightening his waist cloth asked What would ye I do and she answered Stand in thy place Then the procuratrix rose and set in the midst of the saloon a low chair and opening a closet cried to the Porter Come help me So he went to help her and saw two black bitches with chains round their necks and she said to him Take hold of them and he took them and led them into the middle of the saloon Then the lady of the house arose and tucked up her sleeves above her wrists and seizing a scourge said to the Porter Bring forward one of the bitches He brought her forward dragging her by the chain while the bitch wept and shook her head at the lady who however came down upon her with blows on the sconce and the bitch howled and the lady ceased not beating her till her forearm failed her Then casting the scourge from her hand she pressed the bitch to her bosom and wiping away her tears with her hands kissed her head Then she said to the Porter Take her away and bring the second and when he brought her she did with her as she had done with the first Now the heart of the Caliph was touched at these cruel doings his chest straitened and he lost all patience in his desire to know why the two bitches were so beaten He threw a wink at Ja afar wishing him to ask but the Minister turning towards him said by signs Be silent Then quoth the portress to the mistress of the house O my lady arise and go to thy place that I in turn may do my devoir FN one hundred seventy six She answered Even so and taking her seat upon the couch of juniper wood pargetted with gold and silver said to the portress and cateress Now do ye what ye have to do Thereupon the portress sat upon a low seat by the couch side but the procuretrix entering a closet brought out of it a bag of satin with green fringes and two tassels of gold She stood up before the lady of the house and shaking the bag drew out from it a lute which she tuned by tightening its pegs and when it was in perfect order she began to sing these quatrains Ye are the wish the aim of me And when O Love thy sight I see FN one hundred seventy seven The heavenly mansion openeth FN one hundred seventy eight But Hell I see when lost thy sight From thee comes madness nor the less Comes highest joy comes ecstasy Nor in my love for thee I fear Or shame and blame or hate and spite When Love was throned within my heart I rent the veil of modesty And stints not Love to rend that veil Garring disgrace on grace to alight The robe of sickness then I donned But rent to rags was secrecy Wherefore my love and longing heart Proclaim your high supremest might The tear drop railing adown my cheek Telleth my tale of ignomy And all the hid was seen by all And all my riddle ree d aright Heal then my malady for thou Art malady and remedy But she whose cure is in thy hand Shall ne er be free of bane and blight Burn me those eyne that radiance rain Slay me the swords of phantasy How many hath the sword of Love Laid low their high degree despite Yet will I never cease to pine Nor to oblivion will I flee Love is my health my faith my joy Public and private wrong or right O happy eyes that sight thy charms That gaze upon thee at their gree Yea of my purest wish and will The slave of Love I ll aye be hight When the damsel heard this elegy in quatrains she cried out Alas Alas and rent her raiment and fell to the ground fainting and the Caliph saw scars of the palm rod FN one hundred seventy nine on her back and welts of the whip and marvelled with exceeding wonder Then the portress arose and sprinkled water on her and brought her a fresh and very fine dress and put it on her But when the company beheld these doings their minds were troubled for they had no inkling of the case nor knew the story thereof so the Caliph said to Ja afar Didst thou not see the scars upon the damsel s body I cannot keep silence or be at rest till I learn the truth of her condition and the story of this other maiden and the secret of the two black bitches But Ja afar answered O our lord they made it a condition with us that we speak not of what concerneth us not lest we come to hear what pleaseth us not Then said the portress By Allah O my sister come to me and complete this service for me Replied the procuratrix With joy and goodly gree so she took the lute and leaned it against her breasts and swept the strings with her finger tips and began singing Give back mine eyes their sleep long ravished And say me whither be my reason fled I learnt that lending to thy love a place Sleep to mine eyelids mortal foe was made They said We held thee righteous who waylaid Thy soul Go ask his glorious eyes I said I pardon all my blood he pleased to spill Owning his troubles drove him blood to shed On my mind s mirror sun like sheen he cast Whose keen reflection fire in vitals bred Waters of Life let Allah waste at will Suffice my wage those lips of dewy red An thou address my love thou lieutenant find a cause For plaint and tears or ruth or lustihed In water pure his form shall greet your eyne When fails the bowl nor need ye drink of wine FN one hundred eighty Then she quoted from the same ode I drank but the draught of his glance not wine And his swaying gait swayed to sleep these eyne Twas not grape juice grips me but grasp of Past Twas not bowl o erbowled me but gifts divine His coiling curl lets my soul ennetted And his cruel will all my wits outwitted FN one hundred eighty one After a pause she resumed If we plain of absence what shall we say Or if pain afflict us where wend our way An I hire a truchman FN one hundred eighty two to tell my tale The lover s plaint is not told for pay If I put on patience a lover s life After loss of love will not last a day Naught is left me now but regret repine And tears flooding cheeks for ever and aye O thou who the babes of these eyes FN one hundred eighty three hast fled Thou art homed in heart that shall never stray Would heaven I wot hast thou kept our pact Long as stream shall flow to have firmest fey Or hast forgotten the weeping slave Whom groans afflict and whom griefs waylay Ah when severance ends and we side by side Couch I ll blame thy rigours and chide thy pride Now when the portress heard her second ode she shrieked aloud and said By Allah tis right good and laying hands on her garments tore them as she did the first time and fell to the ground fainting Thereupon the procuratrix rose end brought her a second change of clothes after she had sprinkled water on her She recovered and sat upright and said to her sister the cateress Onwards and help me in my duty for there remains but this one song So the provisioneress again brought out the lute and began to sing these verses How long shall last how long this rigour rife of woe May not suffice thee all these tears thou seest flow Our parting thus with purpose fell thou dost prolong Is t not enough to glad the heart of envious foe Were but this lying world once true to lover heart He had not watched the weary night in tears of woe Oh pity me whom overwhelmed thy cruel will My lord my king tis time some ruth to me thou show To whom reveal my wrongs O thou who murdered me Sad who of broken troth the pangs must undergo Increase wild love for thee and phrenzy hour by hour And days of exile minute by so long so slow O Moslems claim vendetta FN one hundred eighty four for this slave of Love Whose sleep Love ever wastes whose patience Love lays low Doth law of Love allow thee O my wish to lie Lapt in another s arms and unto me cry Go Yet in thy presence say what joys shall I enjoy When he I love but works my love to overthrow When the portress heard the third song she cried aloud and laying hands on her garments rent them down to the very skirt and fell to the ground fainting a third time again showing the scars of the scourge Then said the three Kalandars Would Heaven we had never entered this house but had rather righted on the mounds and heaps outside the city for verily our visit hath been troubled by sights which cut to the heart The Caliph turned to them and asked Why so and they made answer Our minds are sore troubled by this matter Quoth the Caliph Are ye not of the household and quoth they No nor indeed did we ever set eyes on the place till within this hour Hereat the Caliph marvelled and rejoined This man who sitteth by you would he not know the secret of the matter and so saying he winked and made signs at the Porter So they questioned the man but he replied By the All might of Allah in love all are alike FN one hundred eighty five I am the growth of Baghdad yet never in my born days did I darken these doors till to day and my companying with them was a curious matter By Allah they rejoined we took thee for one of them and now we see thou art one like ourselves Then said the Caliph We be seven men and they only three women without even a fourth to help them so let us question them of their case and if they answer us not fain we will be answered by force All of them agreed to this except Ja afar who said FN one hundred eighty six This is not my recking let them be for we are their guests and as ye know they made a compact and condition with us which we accepted and promised to keep wherefore it is better that we be silent concerning this matter and as but little of the night remaineth let each and every of us gang his own gait Then he winked at the Caliph and whispered to him There is but one hour of darkness left and I can bring them before thee to morrow when thou canst freely question them all concerning their story But the Caliph raised his head haughtily and cried out at him in wrath saying I have no patience left for my longing to hear of them let the Kalandars question them forthright Quoth Ja afar This is not my rede Then words ran high and talk answered talk and they disputed as to who should first put the question but at last all fixed upon the Porter And as the jingle increased the house mistress could not but notice it and asked them O ye folk on what matter are ye talking so loudly Then the Porter stood up respectfully before her and said O my lady this company earnestly desire that thou acquaint them with the story of the two bitches and what maketh thee punish them so cruelly and then thou fallest to weeping over them and kissing them and lastly they want to hear the tale of thy sister and why she hath been bastinado d with palm sticks like a man These are the questions they charge me to put and peace be with thee FN one hundred eighty seven Thereupon quoth she who was the lady of the house to the guests Is this true that he saith on your part and all replied Yes save Ja afar who kept silence When she heard these words she cried By Allah ye have wronged us O our guests with grievous wronging for when you came before us we made compact and condition with you that whoso should speak of what concerneth him not should hear what pleaseth him not Sufficeth ye not that we took you into our house and fed you with our best food But the fault is not so much yours as hers who let you in Then she tucked up her sleeves from her wrists and struck the floor thrice with her hand crying Come ye quickly and lo a closet door opened and out of it came seven negro slaves with drawn swords in hand to whom she said Pinion me those praters elbows and bind them each to each They did her bidding and asked her O veiled and virtuous is it thy high command that we strike off their heads but she answered Leave them awhile that I question them of their condition before their necks feel the sword By Allah O my lady cried the Porter slay me not for other s sin all these men offended and deserve the penalty of crime save myself Now by Allah our night had been charming had we escaped the mortification of those monocular Kalandars whose entrance into a populous city would convert it into a howling wilderness Then he repeated these verses How fair is ruth the strong man deigns not smother And fairest fair when shown to weakest brother By Love s own holy tie between us twain Let one not suffer for the sin of other When the Porter ended his verse the lady laughed And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When It was the Eleventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lady after laughing at the Porter despite her wrath came up to the party and spake thus Tell me who ye be for ye have but an hour of life and were ye not men of rank and perhaps notables of your tribes you had not been so froward and I had hastened your doom Then said the Caliph Woe to thee O Ja afar tell her who we are lest we be slain by mistake and speak her fair be fore some horror befal us Tis part of thy deserts replied he whereupon the Caliph cried out at him saying There is a time for witty words and there is a time for serious work Then the lady accosted the three Kalandars and asked them Are ye brothers when they answered No by Allah we be naught but Fakirs and foreigners Then quoth she to one among them Wast thou born blind of one eye and quoth he No by Allah twas a marvellous matter and a wondrous mischance which caused my eye to be torn out and mine is a tale which if it were written upon the eye corners with needle gravers were a warner to whoso would be warned FN one hundred eighty eight She questioned the second and third Kalandar but all replied like the first By Allah O our mistress each one of us cometh from a different country and we are all three the sons of Kings sovereign Princes ruling over suzerains and capital cities Thereupon she turned towards them and said Let each and every of you tell me his tale in due order and explain the cause of his coming to our place and if his story please us let him stroke his head FN one hundred eighty nine and wend his way The first to come forward was the Hammal the Porter who said O my lady I am a man and a porter This dame the cateress hired me to carry a load and took me first to the shop of a vintner then to the booth of a butcher thence to the stall of a fruiterer thence to a grocer who also sold dry fruits thence to a confectioner and a perfumer cum druggist and from him to this place where there happened to me with you what happened Such is my story and peace be on us all At this the lady laughed and said Rub thy head and wend thy ways but he cried By Allah I will not stump it till I hear the stories of my companions Then came forward one of the Monoculars and began to tell her The First Kalandar s Tale Know O my lady that the cause of my beard being shorn and my eye being out torn was as follows My father was a King and he had a brother who was a King over another city and it came to pass that I and my cousin the son of my paternal uncle were both born on one and the same day And years and days rolled on and as we grew up I used to visit my uncle every now and then and to spend a certain number of months with him Now my cousin and I were sworn friends for he ever entreated me with exceeding kindness he killed for me the fattest sheep and strained the best of his wines and we enjoyed long conversing and carousing One day when the wine had gotten the better of us the son of my uncle said to me O my cousin I have a great service to ask of thee and I desire that thou stay me not in whatso I desire to do And I replied With joy and goodly will Then he made me swear the most binding oaths and left me but after a little while he returned leading a lady veiled and richly apparelled with ornaments worth a large sum of money Presently he turned to me the woman being still behind him and said Take this lady with thee and go before me to such a burial ground describing it so that I knew the place and enter with her into such a sepulchre FN one hundred ninety and there await my coming The oaths I swore to him made me keep silence and suffered me not to oppose him so I led the woman to the cemetery and both I and she took our seats in the sepulchre and hardly had we sat down when in came my uncle s son with a bowl of water a bag of mortar and an adze somewhat like a hoe He went straight to the tomb in the midst of the sepulchre and breaking it open with the adze set the stones on one side then he fell to digging into the earth of the tomb till he came upon a large iron plate the size of a wicket door and on raising it there appeared below it a staircase vaulted and winding Then he turned to the lady and said to her Come now and take thy final choice She at once went down by the staircase and disappeared then quoth he to me O son of my uncle by way of completing thy kindness when I shall have descended into this place restore the trap door to where it was and heap back the earth upon it as it lay before and then of thy goodness mix this unslaked lime which is in the bag with this water which is in the bowl and after building up the stones plaster the outside so that none looking upon it shall say This is a new opening in an old tomb For a whole year have I worked at this place whereof none knoweth but Allah and this is the need I have of thee presently adding May Allah never bereave thy friends of thee nor make them desolate by thine absence O son of my uncle O my dear cousin And he went down the stairs and disappeared for ever When he was lost to sight I replaced the iron plate and did all his bidding till the tomb became as it was before and I worked almost unconsciously for my head was heated with wine Returning to the palace of my uncle I was told that he had gone forth a sporting and hunting so I slept that night without seeing him and when the morning dawned I remembered the scenes of the past evening and what happened between me and my cousin I repented of having obeyed him when penitence was of no avail I still thought however that it was a dream So I fell to asking for the son of my uncle but there was none to answer me concerning him and I went out to the grave yard and the sepulchres and sought for the tomb under which he was but could not find it and I ceased not wandering about from sepulchre to sepulchre and tomb to tomb all without success till night set in So I returned to the city yet I could neither eat nor drink my thoughts being engrossed with my cousin for that I knew not what was become of him and I grieved with exceeding grief and passed another sorrowful night watching until the morning Then went I a second time to the cemetery pondering over what the son of mine uncle had done and sorely repenting my hearkening to him went round among all the tombs but could not find the tomb I sought I mourned over the past and remained in my mourning seven days seeking the place and ever missing the path Then my torture of scruples FN one hundred ninety one grew upon me till I well nigh went mad and I found no way to dispel my grief save travel and return to my father So I set out and journeyed homeward but as I was entering my father s capital a crowd of rioters sprang upon me and pinioned me FN one hundred ninety two I wondered thereat with all wonderment seeing that I was the son of the Sultan and these men were my father s subjects and amongst them were some of my own slaves A great fear fell upon me and I said to my soul FN one hundred ninety three Would heaven I knew what hath happened to my father I questioned those that bound me of the cause of their doing but they returned me no answer However after a while one of them said to me and he had been a hired servant of our house Fortune hath been false to thy father his troops betrayed him and the Wazir who slew him now reigneth in his stead and we lay in wait to seize thee by the bidding of him I was well nigh distraught and felt ready to faint on hearing of my father s death when they carried me off and placed me in presence of the usurper Now between me and him there was an olden grudge the cause of which was this I was fond of shooting with the stone bow FN one hundred ninety four and it befel one day as I was standing on the terrace roof of the palace that a bird lighted on the top of the Wazir s house when he happened to be there I shot at the bird and missed the mark but I hit the Wazir s eye and knocked it out as fate and fortune decreed Even so saith the poet We tread the path where Fate hath led The path Fate writ we fain must tread And man in one land doomed to die Death no where else shall do him dead And on like wise saith another Let Fortune have her wanton way Take heart and all her words obey Nor joy nor mourn at anything For all things pass and no things stay Now when I knocked out the Wazir s eye he could not say a single word for that my father was King of the city but he hated me everafter and dire was the grudge thus caused between us twain So when I was set before him hand bound and pinioned he straightway gave orders for me to be beheaded I asked For what crime wilt thou put me to death whereupon he answered What crime is greater than this pointing the while to the place where his eye had been Quoth I This I did by accident not of malice prepense and quoth he If thou didst it by accident I will do the like by thee with intention FN one hundred ninety five Then cried he Bring him forward and they brought me up to him when he thrust his finger into my left eye and gouged it out whereupon I became one eyed as ye see me Then he bade bind me hand and foot and put me into a chest and said to the sworder Take charge of this fellow and go off with him to the waste lands about the city then draw thy scymitar and slay him and leave him to feed the beasts and birds So the headsman fared forth with me and when he was in the midst of the desert he took me out of the chest and I with both hands pinioned and both feet fettered and was about to bandage my eyes before striking off my head But I wept with exceeding weeping until I made him weep with me and looking at him I began to recite these couplets I deemed you coat o mail that should withstand The foeman s shafts and you proved foeman s brand I hoped your aidance in mine every chance Though fail my left to aid my dexter hand Aloof you stand and hear the railer s gibe While rain their shafts on me the giber band But an ye will not guard me from my foes Stand clear and succour neither these nor those And I also quoted I deemed my brethren mail of strongest steel And so they were from foes I to fend my dart I deemed their arrows surest of their aim And so they were when aiming at my heart When the headsman heard my lines he had been sworder to my sire and he owed me a debt of gratitude he cried O my lord what can I do being but a slave under orders presently adding Fly for thy life and nevermore return to this land or they will slay thee and slay me with thee even as the poet said Take thy life and fly whenas evils threat Let the ruined house tell its owner s fate New land for the old thou shalt seek and find But to find new life thou must not await Strange that men should sit in the stead of shame When Allah s world is so wide and great And trust not other in matters grave Life itself must act for a life beset Ne er would prowl the lion with maned neck Did he reckon on aid or of others reck Hardly believing in my escape I kissed his hand and thought the loss of my eye a light matter in consideration of my escaping from being slain I arrived at my uncle s capital and going in to him told him of what had befallen my father and myself whereat he wept with sore weeping and said Verily thou addest grief to my grief and woe to my woe for thy cousin hath been missing these many days I wot not what hath happened to him and none can give me news of him And he wept till he fainted I sorrowed and condoled with him and he would have applied certain medicaments to my eye but he saw that it was become as a walnut with the shell empty Then said he O my son better to lose eye and keep life After that I could no longer remain silent about my cousin who was his only son and one dearly loved so I told him all that had happened He rejoiced with extreme joyance to hear news of his son and said Come now and show me the tomb but I replied By Allah O my uncle I know not its place though I sought it carefully full many times yet could not find the site However I and my uncle went to the grave yard and looked right and left till at last I recognised the tomb and we both rejoiced with exceeding joy We entered the sepulchre and loosened the earth about the grave then up raising the trap door descended some fifty steps till we came to the foot of the staircase when lo we were stopped by a blinding smoke Thereupon said my uncle that saying whose sayer shall never come to shame There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great and we advanced till we suddenly came upon a saloon whose floor was strewed with flour and grain and provisions and all manner necessaries and in the midst of it stood a canopy sheltering a couch Thereupon my uncle went up to the couch and inspecting it found his son and the lady who had gone down with him into the tomb lying in each other s embrace but the twain had become black as charred wood it was as if they had been cast into a pit of fire When my uncle saw this spectacle he spat in his son s face and said Thou hast thy deserts O thou hog FN one hundred ninety six this is thy judgment in the transitory world and yet remaineth the judgment in the world to come a durer and a more enduring And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Twelfth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Kalandar thus went on with his story before the lady and the Caliph and Ja afar My uncle struck his son with his slipper FN one hundred ninety seven as he lay there a black heap of coal I marvelled at his hardness of heart and grieving for my cousin and the lady said By Allah O my uncle calm thy wrath dost thou not see that all my thoughts are occupied with this misfortune and how sorrowful I am for what hath befallen thy son and how horrible it is that naught of him remaineth but a black heap of charcoal And is not that enough but thou must smite him with thy slipper Answered he O son of my brother this youth from his boyhood was madly in love with his own sister FN one hundred ninety eight and often and often I forbade him from her saying to myself They are but little ones However when they grew up sin befel between them and although I could hardly believe it I confined him and chided him and threatened him with the severest threats and the eunuchs and servants said to him Beware of so foul a thing which none before thee ever did and which none after thee will ever do and have a care lest thou be dishonoured and disgraced among the Kings of the day even to the end of time And I added Such a report as this will be spread abroad by caravans and take heed not to give them cause to talk or I will assuredly curse thee and do thee to death After that I lodged them apart and shut her up but the accursed girl loved him with passionate love for Satan had got the mastery of her as well as of him and made their foul sin seem fair in their sight Now when my son saw that I separated them he secretly built this souterrain and furnished it and transported to it victuals even as thou seest and when I had gone out a sporting came here with his sister and hid from me Then His righteous judgment fell upon the twain and consumed them with fire from Heaven and verily the last judgment will deal them durer pains and more enduring Then he wept and I wept with him and he looked at me and said Thou art my son in his stead And I bethought me awhile of the world and of its chances how the Wazir had slain my father and had taken his place and had put out my eye and how my cousin had come to his death by the strangest chance and I wept again and my uncle wept with me Then we mounted the steps and let down the iron plate and heaped up the earth over it and after restoring the tomb to its former condition we returned to the palace But hardly had we sat down ere we heard the tomtoming of the kettle drum and tantara of trumpets and clash of cymbals and the rattling of war men s lances and the clamours of assailants and the clanking of bits and the neighing of steeds while the world was canopied with dense dust and sand clouds raised by the horses hoofs FN one hundred ninety nine We were amazed at sight and sound knowing not what could be the matter so we asked and were told us that the Wazir who usurped my father s kingdom had marched his men and that after levying his soldiery and taking a host of wild Arabs FN two hundred into service he had come down upon us with armies like the sands of the sea their number none could tell and against them none could prevail They attacked the city unawares and the citizens being powerless to oppose them surrendered the place my uncle was slain and I made for the suburbs saying to myself If thou fall into this villain s hands he will assuredly kill thee On this wise all my troubles were renewed and I pondered all that had betided my father and my uncle and I knew not what to do for if the city people or my father s troops had recognised me they would have done their best to win favour by destroying me and I could think of no way to escape save by shaving off my beard and my eyebrows So I shore them off and changing my fine clothes for a Kalandar s rags I fared forth from my uncle s capital and made for this city hoping that peradventure some one would assist me to the presence of the Prince of the Faithful FN two hundred one and the Caliph who is the Viceregent of Allah upon earth Thus have I come hither that I might tell him my tale and lay my case before him I arrived here this very night and was standing in doubt whither I should go when suddenly I saw this second Kalandar so I salam d to him saying I am a stranger and he answered I too am a stranger And as we were conversing behold up came our companion this third Kalandar and saluted us saying I am a stranger And we answered We too be strangers Then we three walked on and together till darkness overtook us and Destiny crave us to your house Such then is the cause of the shaving of my beard and mustachios and eyebrows and the manner of my losing my right eye They marvelled much at this tale and the Caliph said to Ja afar By Allah I have not seen nor have I heard the like of what hath happened to this Kalandar Quoth the lady of the house Rub thy head and wend thy ways but he replied I will not go till I hear the history of the two others Thereupon the second Kalandar came forward and kissing the ground began to tell The Second Kalandar s Tale Know O my lady that I was not born one eyed and mine is a strange story an it were graven with needle graver on the eye corners it were a warner to whoso would be warned I am a King son of a King and was brought up like a Prince I learned intoning the Koran according the seven schools FN two hundred two and I read all manner books and held disputations on their contents with the doctors and men of science moreover I studied star lore and the fair sayings of poets and I exercised myself in all branches of learning until I surpassed the people of my time my skill in calligraphy exceeded that of all the scribes and my fame was bruited abroad over all climes and cities and all the kings learned to know my name Amongst others the King of Hind heard of me and sent to my father to invite me to his court with offerings and presents and rarities such as befit royalties So my father fitted out six ships for me and my people and we put to sea and sailed for the space of a full month till we made the land Then we brought out the horses that were with us in the ships and after loading the camels with our presents for the Prince we set forth inland But we had marched only a little way when behold a dust cloud up flew and grew until it walled FN two hundred three the horizon from view After an hour or so the veil lifted and discovered beneath it fifty horsemen ravening lions to the sight in steel armour dight We observed them straightly and lo they were cutters off of the highway wild as wild Arabs When they saw that we were only four and had with us but the ten camels carrying the presents they dashed down upon us with lances at rest We signed to them with our fingers as it were saying We be messengers of the great King of Hind so harm us not but they answered on like wise We are not in his dominions to obey nor are we subject to his sway Then they set upon us and slew some of my slaves and put the lave to flight and I also fled after I had gotten a wound a grievous hurt whilst the Arabs were taken up with the money and the presents which were with us I went forth unknowing whither I went having become mean as I was mighty and I fared on until I came to the crest of a mountain where I took shelter for the night in a cave When day arose I set out again nor ceased after this fashion till I arrived at a fair city and a well filled Now it was the season when Winter was turning away with his rime and to greet the world with his flowers came Prime and the young blooms were springing and the streams flowed ringing and the birds were sweetly singing as saith the poet concerning a certain city when describing it A place secure from every thought of fear Safety and peace for ever lord it here Its beauties seem to beautify its sons And as in Heaven its happy folk appear I was glad of my arrival for I was wearied with the way and yellow of face for weakness and want but my plight was pitiable and I knew not whither to betake me So I accosted a Tailor sitting in his little shop and saluted him he returned my salam and bade me kindly welcome and wished me well and entreated me gently and asked me of the cause of my strangerhood I told him all my past from first to last and he was concerned on my account and said O youth disclose not thy secret to any the King of this city is the greatest enemy thy father hath and there is blood wit FN two hundred four between them and thou hast cause to fear for thy life Then he set meat and drink before me and I ate and drank and he with me and we conversed freely till night fall when he cleared me a place in a corner of his shop and brought me a carpet and a coverlet I tarried with him three days at the end of which time he said to me Knowest thou no calling whereby to win thy living O my son I am learned in the law I replied and a doctor of doctrine an adept in art and science a mathematician and a notable penman He rejoined Thy calling is of no account in our city where not a soul under standeth science or even writing or aught save money making Then said I By Allah I know nothing but what I have mentioned and he answered Gird thy middle and take thee a hatchet and a cord and go and hew wood in the wold for thy daily bread till Allah send thee relief and tell none who thou art lest they slay thee Then he bought me an axe and a rope and gave me in charge to certain wood cutters and with these guardians I went forth into the forest where I cut fuel wood the whole of my day and came back in the evening bearing my bundle on my head I sold it for half a diner with part of which I bought provision and laid by the rest In such work I spent a whole year and when this was ended I went out one day as was my wont into the wilderness and wandering away from my companions I chanced on a thickly grown lowland FN two hundred five in which there was an abundance of wood So I entered and I found the gnarled stump of a great tree and loosened the ground about it and shovelled away the earth Presently my hatchet rang upon a copper ring so I cleared away the soil and behold the ring was attached to a wooden trap door This I raised and there appeared beneath it a staircase I descended the steps to the bottom and came to a door which I opened and found myself in a noble hall strong of structure and beautifully built where was a damsel like a pearl of great price whose favour banished from my heart all grief and cark and care and whose soft speech healed the soul in despair and captivated the wise and ware Her figure measured five feet in height her breasts were firm and upright her cheek a very garden of delight her colour lively bright her face gleamed like dawn through curly tresses which gloomed like night and above the snows of her bosom glittered teeth of a pearly white FN two hundred six As the poet said of one like her Slim waisted loveling jetty hair encrowned A wand of willow on a sandy mound And as saith another Four things that meet not save they here unite To shed my heart blood and to rape my sprite Brilliantest forehead tresses jetty bright Cheeks rosy red and stature beauty dight When I looked upon her I prostrated myself before Him who had created her for the beauty and loveliness He had shaped in her and she looked at me and said Art thou man or Jinni I am a man answered I and she Now who brought thee to this place where I have abided five and twenty years without even yet seeing man in it Quoth I and indeed I found her words wonder sweet and my heart was melted to the core by them O my lady my good fortune led me hither for the dispelling of my cark and care Then I related to her all my mishap from first to last and my case appeared to her exceeding grievous so she wept and said I will tell thee my story in my turn I am the daughter of the King Ifitamus lord of the Islands of Abnus FN two hundred seven who married me to my cousin the son of my paternal uncle but on my wedding night an Ifrit named Jirjis FN two hundred eight bin Rajmus first cousin that is mother s sister s son of Iblis the Foul Fiend snatched me up and flying away with me like a bird set me down in this place whither he conveyed all I needed of fine stuffs raiment and jewels and furniture and meat and drink and other else Once in every ten days he comes here and lies a single night with me and then wends his way for he took me without the consent of his family and he hath agreed with me that if ever I need him by night or by day I have only to pass my hand over yonder two lines engraved upon the alcove and he will appear to me before my fingers cease touching Four days have now passed since he was here and as there remain six days before he come again say me wilt thou abide with me five days and go hence the day before his coming I replied Yes and yes again O rare if all this be not a dream Hereat she was glad and springing to her feet seized my hand and carried me through an arched doorway to a Hammam bath a fair hall and richly decorate I doffed my clothes and she doffed hers then we bathed and she washed me and when this was done we left the bath and she seated me by her side upon a high divan and brought me sherbet scented with musk When we felt cool after the bath she set food before me and we ate and fell to talking but presently she said to me Lay thee down and take thy rest for surely thou must be weary So I thanked her my lady and lay down and slept soundly forgetting all that had happened to me When I awoke I found her rubbing and shampooing my feet FN two hundred nine so I again thanked her and blessed her and we sat for awhile talking Said she By Allah I was sad at heart for that I have dwelt alone underground for these five and twenty years and praise be to Allah who hath sent me some one with whom I can converse Then she asked O youth what sayest thou to wine and I answered Do as thou wilt Where upon she went to a cupboard and took out a sealed flask of right old wine and set off the table with flowers and scented herbs and began to sing these lines Had we known of thy coming we fain had dispread The cores of our hearts or the balls of our eyes Our cheeks as a carpet to greet thee had thrown And our eyelids had strown for thy feet to betread Now when she finished her verse I thanked her for indeed love of her had gotten hold of my heart and my grief and anguish were gone We sat at converse and carousel till nightfall and with her I spent the night such night never spent I in all my life On the morrow delight followed delight till midday by which time I had drunken wine so freely that I had lost my wits and stood up staggering to the right and to the left and said Come O my charmer and I will carry thee up from this underground vault and deliver thee from the spell of thy Jinni She laughed and replied Content thee and hold thy peace of every ten days one is for the Ifrit and the other nine are thine Quoth I and in good sooth drink had got the better of me This very instant will I break down the alcove whereon is graven the talisman and summon the Ifrit that I may slay him for it is a practice of mine to slay Ifrits When she heard my words her colour waxed wan and she said By Allah do not and she began repeating This is a thing wherein destruction lies I rede thee shun it an thy wits be wise And these also O thou who seekest severance draw the rein Of thy swift steed nor seek o ermuch t advance Ah stay for treachery is the rule of life And sweets of meeting end in severance I heard her verse but paid no heed to her words nay I raised my foot and administered to the alcove a mighty kick And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permisted say When it was the Thirteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the second Kalandar thus continued his tale to the lady But when O my mistress I kicked that alcove with a mighty kick behold the air starkened and darkened and thundered and lightened the earth trembled and quaked and the world became invisible At once the fumes of wine left my head I cried to her What is the matter and she replied The Ifrit is upon us did I not warn thee of this By Allah thou hast brought ruin upon me but fly for thy life and go up by the way thou camest down So I fled up the staircase but in the excess of my fear I forgot sandals and hatchet And when I had mounted two steps I turned to look for them and lo I saw the earth cleave asunder and there arose from it an Ifrit a monster of hideousness who said to the damsel What trouble and posher be this wherewith thou disturbest me What mishap hath betided thee No mishap hath befallen me she answered save that my breast was straitened FN two hundred ten and my heart heavy with sadness so I drank a little wine to broaden it and to hearten myself then I rose to obey a call of Nature but the wine had gotten into my head and I fell against the alcove Thou liest like the whore thou art shrieked the Ifrit and he looked around the hall right and left till he caught sight of my axe and sandals and said to her What be these but the belongings of some mortal who hath been in thy society She answered I never set eyes upon them till this moment they must have been brought by thee hither cleaving to thy garments Quoth the Ifrit These words are absurd thou harlot thou strumpet Then he stripped her stark naked and stretching her upon the floor bound her hands and feet to four stakes like one crucified FN two hundred eleven and set about torturing and trying to make her confess I could not bear to stand listening to her cries and groans so I climbed the stair on the quake with fear and when I reached the top I replaced the trap door and covered it with earth Then repented I of what I had done with penitence exceeding and thought of the lady and her beauty and loveliness and the tortures she was suffering at the hands of the accursed Ifrit after her quiet life of five and twenty years and how all that had happened to her was for the cause of me I bethought me of my father and his kingly estate and how I had become a woodcutter and how after my time had been awhile serene the world had again waxed turbid and troubled to me So I wept bitterly and repeated this couplet What time Fate s tyranny shall most oppress thee Perpend one day shall joy thee one distress thee Then I walked till I reached the home of my friend the Tailor whom I found most anxiously expecting me indeed he was as the saying goes on coals of fire for my account And when he saw me he said All night long my heart hath been heavy fearing for thee from wild beasts or other mischances Now praise be to Allah for thy safety I thanked him for his friendly solicitude and retiring to my corner sat pondering and musing on what had befallen me and I blamed and chided myself for my meddlesome folly and my frowardness in kicking the alcove I was calling myself to account when behold my friend the Tailor came to me and said O youth in the shop there is an old man a Persian FN two hundred twelve who seeketh thee he hath thy hatchet and thy sandals which he had taken to the woodcutters FN two hundred thirteen saying I was going out at what time the Mu azzin began the call to dawn prayer when I chanced upon these things and know not whose they are so direct me to their owner The woodcutters recognised thy hatchet and directed him to thee he is sitting in my shop so fare forth to him and thank him and take thine axe and sandals When I heard these words I turned yellow with fear and felt stunned as by a blow and before I could recover myself lo the floor of my private room clove asunder and out of it rose the Persian who was the Ifrit He had tortured the lady with exceeding tortures natheless she would not confess to him aught so he took the hatchet and sandals and said to her As surely as I am Jirjis of the seed of Iblis I will bring thee back the owner of this and these FN two hundred fourteen Then he went to the woodcutters with the presence aforesaid and being directed to me after waiting a while in the shop till the fact was confirmed he suddenly snatched me up as a hawk snatcheth a mouse and dew high in air but presently descended and plunged with me under the earth I being aswoon the while and lastly set me down in the subterranean palace wherein I had passed that blissful night And there I saw the lady stripped to the skin her limbs bound to four stakes and blood welling from her sides At the sight my eyes ran over with tears but the Ifrit covered her person and said O wanton is not this man thy lover She looked upon me and replied I wot him not nor have I ever seen him before this hour Quoth the Ifrit What this torture and yet no confessing and quoth she I never saw this man in my born days and it is not lawful in Allah s sight to tell lies on him If thou know him not said the Ifrit to her take this sword and strike off his head FN two hundred fifteen She hent the sword in hand and came close up to me and I signalled to her with my eyebrows my tears the while flowing adown my cheeks She understood me and made answer also by signs How couldest thou bring all this evil upon me and I rejoined after the same fashion This is the time for mercy and forgiveness And the mute tongue of my case FN two hundred sixteen spake aloud saying Mine eyes were dragomans for my tongue betted And told full clear the love I fain would hide When last we met and tears in torrents railed For tongue struck dumb my glances testified She signed with eye glance while her lips were mute I signed with fingers and she kenned th implied Our eyebrows did all duty twixt us twain And we being speechless Love spake loud and plain Then O my mistress the lady threw away the sword and said How shall I strike the neck of one I wot not and who hath done me no evil Such deed were not lawful in my law and she held her hand Said the Ifrit Tis grievous to thee to slay thy lover and because he hath lain with thee thou endurest these torments and obstinately refusest to confess After this it is clear to me that only like loveth and pitieth like Then he turned to me and asked me O man haply thou also dost not know this woman whereto I answered And pray who may she be assuredly I never saw her till this instant Then take the sword said he and strike off her head and I will believe that thou wottest her not and will leave thee free to go and will not deaf hardly with thee I replied That will I do and taking the sword went forward sharply and raised my hand to smite But she signed to me with her eyebrows Have I failed thee in aught of love and is it thus that thou requirest me I understood what her looks implied and answered her with an eye glance I will sacrifice my soul for thee And the tongue of the case wrote in our hearts these lines How many a lover with his eyebrows speaketh To his beloved as his passion pleadeth With flashing eyne his passion he inspireth And well she seeth what kits pleading needeth How sweet the look when each on other gazeth And with what swiftness and how sure it speedeth And this with eyebrows all his passion writeth And that with eyeballs all his passion readeth Then my eyes filled with tears to overflowing and I cast the sword from my hand saying O mighty Ifrit and hero if a woman lacking wits and faith deem it unlawful to strike off my head how can it be lawful for me a man to smite her neck whom I never saw in my whole life I cannot do such misdeed though thou cause me drink the cup of death and perdition Then said the Ifrit Ye twain show the good understanding between you but I will let you see how such doings end He took the sword and struck off the lady s hands first with four strokes and then her feet whilst I looked on and made sure of death and she farewelled me with her dying eyes So the Ifrit cried at her Thou whorest and makest me a wittol with thine eyes and struck her so that her head went flying Then he turned to me and said O mortal we have it in our law that when the wife committeth advowtry it is lawful for us to slay her As for this damsel I snatched her away on her bride night when she was a girl of twelve and she knew no one but myself I used to come to her once every ten days and lie with her the night under the semblance of a man a Persian and when I was well assured that she had cuckolded me I slew her But as for thee I am not well satisfied that thou hast wronged me in her nevertheless I must not let thee go unharmed so ask a boon of me and I will grant it Then I rejoiced O my lady with ex ceeding joy and said What boon shall I crave of thee He replied Ask me this boon into what shape I shall bewitch thee wilt thou be a dog or an ass or an ape I rejoined and indeed I had hoped that mercy might be shown me By Allah spare me that Allah spare thee for sparing a Moslem and a man who never wronged thee And I humbled myself before him with exceeding humility and remained standing in his presence saying I am sore oppressed by circumstance He replied Talk me no long talk it is in my power to slay thee but I give thee instead thy choice Quoth I O thou Ifrit it would besit thee to pardon me even as the Envied pardoned the Envier Quoth he And how was that and I began to tell him The Tale of the Envier and the Envied They relate O Ifrit that in a certain city were two men who dwelt in adjoining houses having a common party wall and one of them envied the other and looked on him with an evil eye FN two hundred seventeen and did his utmost endeavour to injure him and albeit at all times he was jealous of his neighbour his malice at last grew on him till he could hardly eat or enjoy the sweet pleasures of sleep But the Envied did nothing save prosper and the more the other strove to injure him the more he got and gained and throve At last the malice of his neighbour and the man s constant endeavour to work him a harm came to his knowledge so he said By Allah God s earth is wide enough for its people and leaving the neighbourhood he repaired to another city where he bought himself a piece of land in which was a dried up draw well FN two hundred eighteen old and in ruinous condition Here he built him an oratory and furnishing it with a few necessaries took up his abode therein and devoted himself to prayer and worshipping Allah Almighty and Fakirs and holy mendicants docked to him from all quarters and his fame went abroad through the city and that country side Presently the news reached his envious neighbour of what good fortune had befallen him and how the city notables had become his disciples so he travelled to the place and presented himself at the holy man s hermitage and was met by the Envied with welcome and greeting and all honour Then quoth the Envier I have a word to say to thee and this is the cause of my faring hither and I wish to give thee a piece of good news so come with me to thy cell Thereupon the Envied arose and took the Envier by the hand and they went in to the inmost part of the hermitage but the Envier said Bid thy Fakirs retire to their cells for I will not tell thee what I have to say save in secret where none may hear us Accordingly the Envied said to his Fakirs Retire to your private cells and when all had done as he bade them he set out with his visitor and walked a little way until the twain reached the ruinous old well And as they stood upon the brink the Envier gave the Envied a push which tumbled him headlong into it unseen of any whereupon he fared forth and went his ways thinking to have had slain him Now this well happened to be haunted by the Jann who seeing the case bore him up and let him down little by little till he reached the bottom when they seated him upon a large stone Then one of them asked his fellows Wot ye who be this man and they answered Nay This man continued the speaker is the Envied hight who flying from the Envier came to dwell in our city and here founded this holy house and he hath edified us by his litanies FN two hundred nineteen and his lections of the Koran but the Envier set out and journeyed till he rejoined him and cunningly contrived to deceive him and cast him into the well where we now are But the fame of this good man hath this very night come to the Sultan of our city who designeth to visit him on the morrow on account of his daughter What aileth his daughter asked one and another answered She is possessed of a spirit for Maymun son of Damdam is madly in love with her but if this pious man knew the remedy her cure would be as easy as could be Hereupon one of them inquired And what is the medicine and he replied The black tom cat which is with him in the oratory hath on the end of his tail a white spot the size of a dirham let him pluck seven white hairs from the spot then let him fumigate her therewith and the Marid will flee from her and not return so she shall be sane for the rest of her life All this took place O Ifrit within earshot of the Envied who listened readily When dawn broke and morn arose in sheen and shone the Fakirs went to seek the Shaykh and found him climbing up the wall of the well whereby he was magnified in their eyes FN two hundred twenty Then knowing that naught save the black tomcat could supply him with the remedy required he plucked the seven tail hairs from the white spot and laid them by him and hardly had the sun risen ere the Sultan entered the hermitage with the great lords of his estate bidding the rest of his retinue to remain standing outside The Envied gave him a hearty welcome and seating him by his side asked him Shall I tell thee the cause of thy coming The King answered Yes He continued Thou hast come upon pretext of a visitation FN two hundred twenty one but it is in thy heart to question me of thy daughter Replied the King Tis even so O thou holy Shaykh and the Envied continued Send and fetch her and I trust to heal her forthright an such it be the will of Allah The King in great joy sent for his daughter and they brought her pinioned and fettered The Envied made her sit down behind a curtain and taking out the hairs fumigated her therewith whereupon that which was in her head cried out and departed from her The girl was at once restored to her right mind and veiling her face said What hath happened and who brought me hither The Sultan rejoiced with a joy that nothing could exceed and kissed his daughter s eyes FN two hundred twenty two and the holy man s hand then turning to his great lords he asked How say ye What fee deserveth he who hath made my daughter whole and all answered He deserveth her to wife and the King said Ye speak sooth So he married him to her and the Envied thus became son in law to the King And after a little the Wazir died and the King said Whom can I make Minister in his stead Thy son in law replied the courtiers So the Envied became a Wazir and after a while the Sultan also died and the lieges said Whom shall we make King and all cried The Wazir So the Wazir was forthright made Sultan and he became King regnant a true ruler of men One day as he had mounted his horse and in the eminence of his kinglihood was riding amidst his Emirs and Wazirs and the Grandees of his realm his eye fell upon his old neighbour the Envier who stood afoot on his path so he turned to one of his Ministers and said Bring hither that man and cause him no affright The Wazir brought him and the King said Give him a thousand miskals FN two hundred twenty three of gold from the treasury and load him ten camels with goods for trade and send him under escort to his own town Then he bade his enemy farewell and sent him away and forbore to punish him for the many and great evils he had done See O Ifrit the mercy of the Envied to the Envier who had hated him from the beginning and had borne him such bitter malice and never met him without causing him trouble and had driven him from house and home and then had journeyed for the sole purpose of taking his life by throwing him into the well Yet he did not requite his injurious dealing but forgave him and was bountiful to him FN two hundred twenty four Then I wept before him O my lady with sore weeping never was there sorer and I recited Pardon my fault for tis the wise man s wont All faults to pardon and revenge forgo In sooth all manner faults in me contain Then deign of goodness mercy grace to show Whoso imploreth pardon from on High Should hold his hand from sinners here below Said the Ifrit Lengthen not thy words As to my slaying thee fear it not and as to my pardoning thee hope it not but from my bewitching thee there is no escape Then he tore me from the ground which closed under my feet and hew with me into the firmament till I saw the earth as a large white cloud or a saucer FN two hundred twenty five in the midst of the waters Presently he set me down on a mountain and taking a little dust over which he muttered some magical words sprinkled me therewith saying Quit that shape and take thou the shape of an ape And on the instant I became an ape a tailless baboon the son of a century FN two hundred twenty six Now when he had left me and I saw myself in this ugly and hateful shape I wept for myself but resigned my soul to the tyranny of Time and Circumstance well weeting that Fortune is fair and constant to no man I descended the mountain and found at the foot a desert plain long and broad over which I travelled for the space of a month till my course brought me to the brink of the briny sea FN two hundred twenty seven After standing there awhile I was ware of a ship in the offing which ran before a fair wind making for the shore I hid myself behind a rock on the beach and waited till the ship drew near when I leaped on board I found her full of merchants and passengers and one of them cried O Captain this ill omened brute will bring us ill luck and another said Turn this ill omened beast out from among us the Captain said Let us kill it another said Slay it with the sword a third Drown it and a fourth Shoot it with an arrow But I sprang up and laid hold of the Rais s FN two hundred twenty eight skirt and shed tears which poured down my chops The Captain took pity on me and said O merchants this ape hath appealed to me for protection and I will protect him henceforth he is under my charge so let none do him aught hurt or harm otherwise there will be bad blood between us Then he entreated me kindly and whatsoever he said I understood and ministered to his every want and served him as a servant albeit my tongue would not obey my wishes so that he came to love me The vessel sailed on the wind being fair for the space of fifty days at the end of which we cast anchor under the walls of a great city wherein was a world of people especially learned men none could tell their number save Allah No sooner had we arrived than we were visited by certain Mameluke officials from the King of that city who after boarding us greeted the merchants and giving them joy of safe arrival said Our King welcometh you and sendeth you this roll of paper whereupon each and every of you must write a line For ye shall know that the King s Minister a calligrapher of renown is dead and the King hath sworn a solemn oath that he will make none Wazir in his stead who cannot write as well as he could He then gave us the scroll which measured ten cubits long by a breadth of one and each of the merchants who knew how to write wrote a line thereon even to the last of them after which I stood up still in the shape of an ape and snatched the roll out of their hands They feared lest I should tear it or throw it overboard so they tried to stay me and scare me but I signed to them that i could write whereat all marvelled saying We never yet saw an ape write And the Captain cried Let him write and if he scribble and scrabble we will kick him out and kill him but if he write fair and scholarly I will adopt him as my son for surely I never yet saw a more intelligent and well mannered monkey than he Would Heaven my real son were his match in morals and manners I took the reed and stretching out my paw dipped it in ink and wrote in the hand used for letters FN two hundred twenty nine these two couplets Time hath recorded gifts she gave the great But none recorded thine which be far higher Allah ne er orphan men by loss of thee Who be of Goodness mother Bounty s sire And I wrote in Rayhani or larger letters elegantly curved FN two hundred thirty Thou hast a reed FN two hundred thirty one of rede to every land Whose driving causeth all the world to thrive Nil is the Nile of Misraim by thy boons Who makest misery smile with fingers five Then I wrote in the Suls FN two hundred thirty two character There be no writer who from Death shall fleet But what his hand hath writ men shall repeat Write therefore naught save what shall serve thee when Thou see s on Judgment Day an so thou see s Then I wrote in the character Naskh FN two hundred thirty three When to sore parting Fate our love shall doom To distant life by Destiny decreed We cause the inkhorn s lips to plain our pains And tongue our utterance with the talking reed And I wrote in the Tumar character FN two hundred thirty four Kingdom with none endures if thou deny This truth where be the Kings of earlier earth Set trees of goodliness while rule endures And when thou art fallen they shall tell thy worth And I wrote in the character Muhakkak FN two hundred thirty five When oped the inkhorn of thy wealth and fame Take ink of generous heart and gracious hand Write brave and noble deeds while write thou can And win thee praise from point of pen and brand Then I gave the scroll to the officials and after we all had written our line they carried it before the King When he saw the paper no writing pleased him save my writing and he said to the assembled courtiers Go seek the writer of these lines and dress him in a splendid robe of honour then mount him on a she mule FN two hundred thirty six let a band of music precede him and bring him to the presence At these words they smiled and the King was wroth with them and cried O accursed I give you an order and you laugh at me O King replied they if we laugh tis not at thee and not without a cause And what is it asked he and they answered O King thou orderest us to bring to thy presence the man who wrote these lines now the truth is that he who wrote them is not of the sons of Adam FN two hundred thirty seven but an ape a tail less baboon belonging to the ship captain Quoth he Is this true that you say Quoth they Yea by the rights of thy munificence The King marvelled at their words and shook with mirth and said I am minded to buy this ape of the Captain Then he sent messengers to the ship with the mule the dress the guard and the state drums saying Not the less do you clothe him in the robe of honour and mount him on the mule and let him be surrounded by the guards and preceded by the band of music They came to the ship and took me from the Captain and robed me in the robe of honour and mounting me on the she mule carried me in state procession through the streets whilst the people were amazed and amused And folk said to one another Halloo is our Sultan about to make an ape his Minister and came all agog crowding to gaze at me and the town was astir and turned topsy turvy on my account When they brought me up to the King and set me in his presence I kissed the ground before him three times and once before the High Chamberlain and great officers and he bade me be seated and I sat respectfully on shins and knees FN two hundred thirty eight and all who were present marvelled at my fine manners and the King most of all Thereupon he ordered the lieges to retire and when none remained save the King s majesty the Eunuch on duty and a little white slave he bade them set before me the table of food containing all manner of birds whatever hoppeth and flieth and treadeth in nest such as quail and sand grouse Then he signed me to eat with him so I rose and kissed ground before him then sat me down and ate with him And when the table was removed I washed my hands in seven waters and took the reed case and reed and wrote instead of speaking these couplets Wail for the little partridges on porringer and plate Cry for the ruin of the fries and stews well marinate Keen as I keen for loved lost daughters of the Kata grouse FN two hundred thirty nine And omelette round the fair enbrowned fowls agglomerate O fire in heart of me for fish those deux poissons I saw Bedded on new made scones FN two hundred forty and cakes in piles to laniate For thee O vermicelli aches my very maw I hold Without thee every taste and joy are clean annihilate Those eggs have rolled their yellow eyes in torturing pains of fire Ere served with hash and fritters hot that delicatest cate Praised be Allah for His baked and roast and ah how good This pulse these pot herbs steeped in oil with eysill combinate When hunger sated was I elbow propt fell back upon Meat pudding FN two hundred forty one wherein gleamed the bangles that my wits amate Then woke I sleeping appetite to eat as though in sport Sweets from broceded trays and kickshaws most elaborate Be patient soul of me Time is a haughty jealous wight Today he seems dark lowering and tomorrow fair to sight FN two hundred forty two Then I rose and seated myself at a respectful distance while the King read what I had written and marvelled exclaiming O the miracle that an ape should be gifted with this graceful style and this power of penmanship By Allah tis a wonder of wonders Presently they set before the King choice wines in flagons of glass and he drank then he passed on the cup to me and I kissed the ground and drank and wrote on it With fire they boiled me to loose my tongue FN two hundred forty three And pain and patience gave for fellowship Hence comes it hands of men upbear me high And honey dew from lips of maid I sip And these also Morn saith to Night withdraw and let me shine So drain we draughts that dull all pain and pine FN two hundred forty four I doubt so fine the glass the wine so clear If tis the wine in glass or glass in twine The King read my verse and said with a sigh Were these gifts FN two hundred forty five in a man he would excel all the folk of his time and age Then he called for the chess board and said Say wilt thou play with me and I signed with my head Yes Then I came forward and ordered the pieces and played with him two games both of which I won He was speechless with surprise so I took the pen case and drawing forth a reed wrote on the board these two couplets Two hosts fare fighting thro the livelong day Nor is their battling ever finished Until when darkness girdeth them about The twain go sleeping in a single bed FN two hundred forty six The King read these lines with wonder and delight and said to his Eunuch FN two hundred forty seven O Mukbil go to thy mistress Sitt al Husn FN two hundred forty eight and say her Come speak the King who biddeth thee hither to take thy solace in seeing this right wondrous ape So the Eunuch went out and presently returned with the lady who when she saw me veiled her face and said O my father hast thou lost all sense of honour How cometh it thou art pleased to send for me and show me to strange men O Sitt al Husn said he no man is here save this little foot page and the Eunuch who reared thee and I thy father From whom then cost thou veil thy face She answered This whom thou deemest an ape is a young man a clever and polite a wise and learned and the son of a King but he is ensorcelled and the Ifrit Jirjaris who is of the seed of Iblis cast a spell upon him after putting to death his own wife the daughter of King Ifitamus lord of the Islands of Abnus The King marvelled at his daughter s words and turning to me said Is this true that she saith of thee and I signed by a nod of my head the answer Yea verily and wept sore Then he asked his daughter Whence knewest thou that he is ensorcelled and she answered O my dear papa there was with me in my childhood an old woman a wily one and a wise and a witch to boot and she taught me the theory of magic and its practice and I took notes in writing and therein waxed perfect and have committed to memory an hundred and seventy chapters of egromantic formulas by the least of which I could transport the stones of thy city behind the Mountain Kaf and the Circumambient Main FN two hundred forty nine or make its site an abyss of the sea and its people fishes swimming in the midst of it O my daughter said her father I conjure thee by my life disenchant this young man that I may make him my Wazir and marry thee to him for indeed he is an ingenious youth and a deeply learned With joy and goodly gree she replied and hending in hand an iron knife whereon was inscribed the name of Allah in Hebrew characters she described a wide circle And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Fourteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Kalandar continued his tale thus O my lady the King s daughter hent in hand a knife whereon were inscribed Hebrew characters and described a wide circle in the midst of the palace hall and therein wrote in Cufic letters mysterious names and talismans and she uttered words and muttered charms some of which we understood and others we understood not Presently the world waxed dark before our sight till we thought that the sky was falling upon our heads and lo the Ifrit presented himself in his own shape and aspect His hands were like many pronged pitch forks his legs like the masts of great ships and his eyes like cressets of gleaming fire We were in terrible fear of him but the King s daughter cried at him No welcome to thee and no greeting O dog whereupon he changed to the form of a lion and said O traitress how is it thou hast broken the oath we sware that neither should contraire other O accursed one answered she how could there be a compact between me and the like of thee Then said he Take what thou has brought on thy self and the lion opened his jaws and rushed upon her but she was too quick for him and plucking a hair from her head waved it in the air muttering over it the while and the hair straightway became a trenchant sword blade wherewith she smote the lion and cut him in twain Then the two halves flew away in air and the head changed to a scorpion and the Princess became a huge serpent and set upon the accursed scorpion and the two fought coiling and uncoiling a stiff fight for an hour at least Then the scorpion changed to a vulture and the serpent became an eagle which set upon the vulture and hunted him for an hour s time till he became a black tom cat which miauled and grinned and spat Thereupon the eagle changed into a piebald wolf and these two battled in the palace for a long time when the cat seeing himself overcome changed into a worm and crept into a huge red pomegranate FN two hundred fifty which lay beside the jetting fountain in the midst of the palace hall Whereupon the pomegranate swelled to the size of a water melon in air and falling upon the marble pavement of the palace broke to pieces and all the grains fell out and were scattered about till they covered the whole floor Then the wolf shook himself and became a snow white cock which fell to picking up the grains purposing not to leave one but by doom of destiny one seed rolled to the fountain edge and there lay hid The cock fell to crowing and clapping his wings and signing to us with his beak as if to ask Are any grains left But we understood not what he meant and he cried to us with so loud a cry that we thought the palace would fall upon us Then he ran over all the floor till he saw the grain which had rolled to the fountain edge and rushed eagerly to pick it up when behold it sprang into the midst of the water and became a fish and dived to the bottom of the basin Thereupon the cock changed to a big fish and plunged in after the other and the two disappeared for a while and lo we heard loud shrieks and cries of pain which made us tremble After this the Ifrit rose out of the water and he was as a burning flame casting fire and smoke from his mouth and eyes and nostrils And immediately the Princess likewise came forth from the basin and she was one live coal of flaming lowe and these two she and he battled for the space of an hour until their fires entirely compassed them about and their thick smoke filled the palace As for us we panted for breath being well nigh suffocated and we longed to plunge into the water fearing lest we be burnt up and utterly destroyed and the King said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Verily we are Allah s and unto Him are we returning Would Heaven I had not urged my daughter to attempt the disenchantment of this ape fellow whereby I have imposed upon her the terrible task of fighting yon accursed Ifrit against whom all the Ifrits in the world could not prevail And would Heaven we had never seen this ape Allah never assain nor bless the day of his coming We thought to do a good deed by him before the face of Allah FN two hundred fifty one and to release him from enchantment and now we have brought this trouble and travail upon our heart But I O my lady was tongue tied and powerless to say a word to him Suddenly ere we were ware of aught the Ifrit yelled out from under the flames and coming up to us as we stood on the estrade blew fire in our faces The damsel overtook him and breathed blasts of fire at his face and the sparks from her and from him rained down upon us and her sparks did us no harm but one of his sparks alighted upon my eye and destroyed it making me a monocular ape and another fell on the King s face scorching the lower half burning off his beard and mustachios and causing his under teeth to fall out while a third alighted on the Castrato s breast killing him on the spot So we despaired of life and made sure of death when lo a voice repeated the saying Allah is most Highest Allah is most Highest Aidance and victory to all who the Truth believe and disappointment and disgrace to all who the religion of Mohammed the Moon of Faith unbelieve The speaker was the Princess who had burnt the Ifrit and he was become a heap of ashes Then she came up to us and said Reach me a cup of water They brought it to her and she spoke over it words we understood not and sprinkling me with it cried By virtue of the Truth and by the Most Great name of Allah I charge thee return to thy former shape And behold I shook and became a man as before save that I had utterly lost an eye Then she cried out The fire The fire O my dear papa an arrow from the accursed hath wounded me to the death for I am not used to fight with the Jann had he been a man I had slain him in the beginning I had no trouble till the time when the pomegranate burst and the grains scattered but I overlooked the seed wherein was the very life of the Jinni Had I picked it up he had died on the spot but as Fate and Fortune decreed I saw it not so he came upon me all unawares and there befel between him and me a sore struggle under the earth and high in air and in the water and as often as I opened on him a gate FN two hundred fifty two he opened on me another gate and a stronger till at last he opened on me the gate of fire and few are saved upon whom the door of fire openeth But Destiny willed that my cunning prevail over his cunning and I burned him to death after I vainly exhorted him to embrace the religion of al Islam As for me I am a dead woman Allah supply my place to you Then she called upon Heaven for help and ceased not to implore relief from the fire when lo a black spark shot up from her robed feet to her thighs then it flew to her bosom and thence to her face When it reached her face she wept and said I testify that there is no god but the God and that Mahommed is the Apostle of God And we looked at her and saw naught but a heap of ashes by the side of the heap that had been the Ifrit We mourned for her and I wished I had been in her place so had I not seen her lovely face who had worked me such weal become ashes but there is no gainsaying the will of Allah When the King saw his daughter s terrible death he plucked out what was left of his beard and beat his face and rent his raiment and I did as he did and we both wept over her Then came in the Chamberlains and Grandees and were amazed to find two heaps of ashes and the Sultan in a fainting fit so they stood round him till he revived and told them what had befallen his daughter from the Ifrit whereat their grief was right grievous and the women and the slave girls shrieked and keened FN two hundred fifty three and they continued their lamentations for the space of seven days Moreover the King bade build over his daughter s ashes a vast vaulted tomb and burn therein wax tapers and sepulchral lamps but as for the Ifrit s ashes they scattered them on the winds speeding them to the curse of Allah Then the Sultan fell sick of a sickness that well nigh brought him to his death for a month s space and when health returned to him and his beard grew again and he had been converted by the mercy of Allah to al Islam he sent for me and said O youth Fate had decreed for us the happiest of lives safe from all the chances and changes of Time till thou camest to us when troubles fell upon us Would to Heaven we had never seen thee and the foul face of thee For we took pity on thee and thereby we have lost our all I have on thy account first lost my daughter who to me was well worth an hundred men secondly I have suffered that which befel me by reason of the fire and the loss of my teeth and my Eunuch also was slain I blame thee not for it was out of thy power to prevent this the doom of Allah was on thee as well as on us and thanks be to the Almighty for that my daughter delivered thee albeit thereby she lost her own life Go forth now O my son from this my city and suffice thee what hath befallen us through thee even although twas decreed for us Go forth in peace and if I ever see thee again I will surely slay thee And he cried out at me So I went forth from his presence O my lady weeping bitterly and hardly believing in my escape and knowing not whither I should wend And I recalled all that had befallen me my meeting the tailor my love for the damsel in the palace beneath the earth and my narrow escape from the Ifrit even after he had determined to do me die and how I had entered the city as an ape and was now leaving it a man once more Then I gave thanks to Allah and said My eye and not my life and before leaving the place I entered the bath and shaved my poll and beard and mustachios and eye brows and cast ashes on my head and donned the coarse black woollen robe of a Kalandar Then I fared forth O my lady and every day I pondered all the calamities which had betided me and I wept and repeated these couplets I am distraught yet verily His ruth abides with me Tho round me gather hosts of ills whence come I cannot see Patient I ll be till Patience self with me impatient wax Patient for ever till the Lord fulfil my destiny Patient I ll bide without complaint a wronged and vanquish man Patient as sunparcht wight that spans the desert s sandy sea Patient I ll be till Aloe s FN two hundred fifty four self unwittingly allow I m patient under bitterer things than bitterest aloe No bitterer things than aloes or than patience for mankind Yet bitterer than the twain to me were Patience treachery My sere and seamed and seared brow would dragoman my sore If soul could search my sprite and there unsecret secrecy Were hills to bear the load I bear they d crumble neath the weight Twould still the roaring wind twould quench the flame tongue s flagrancy And whoso saith the world is sweet certes a day he ll see With more than aloes bitterness and aloes pungency Then I journeyed through many regions and saw many a city intending for Baghdad that I might seek audience in the House of Peace FN two hundred fifty five with the Commander of the Faithful and tell him all that had befallen me I arrived here this very night and found my brother in Allah this first Kalandar standing about as one perplexed so I saluted him with Peace be upon thee and entered into discourse with him Presently up came our brother this third Kalandar and said to us Peace be with you I am a stranger whereto we replied And we too be strangers who have come hither this blessed night So we all three walked on together none of us knowing the other s history till Destiny crave us to this door and we came in to you Such then is my story and my reason for shaving my beard and mustachios and this is what caused the loss of my eye Said the house mistress Thy tale is indeed a rare so rub thy head and wend thy ways but he replied I will not budge till I hear my companions stories Then came forward the third Kalandar and said O illustrious lady my history is not like that of these my comrades but more wondrous and far more marvellous In their case Fate and Fortune came down on them unawares but I drew down destiny upon my own head and brought sorrow on mine own soul and shaved my own beard and lost my own eye Hear then The Third Kalandar s Tale Know O my lady that I also am a King and the son of a King and my name is Ajib son of Kazib When my father died I succeeded him and I ruled and did justice and dealt fairly by all my lieges I delighted in sea trips for my capital stood on the shore before which the ocean stretched far and wide and near hand were many great islands with sconces and garrisons in the midst of the main My fleet numbered fifty merchantmen and as many yachts for pleasance and an hundred and fifty sail ready fitted for holy war with the Unbelievers It fortuned that I had a mind to enjoy myself on the islands aforesaid so I took ship with my people in ten keel and carrying with me a month s victual I set out on a twenty days voyage But one night a head wind struck us and the sea rose against us with huge waves the billows sorely buffetted us and a dense darkness settled round us We gave ourselves up for lost and I said Whoso endangereth his days e en an he scape deserveth no praise Then we prayed to Allah and besought Him but the storm blasts ceased not to blow against us nor the surges to strike us till morning broke when the gale fell the seas sank to mirrory stillness and the sun shone upon us kindly clear Presently we made an island where we landed and cooked somewhat of food and ate heartily and took our rest for a couple of days Then we set out again and sailed other twenty days the seas broadening and the land shrinking Presently the current ran counter to us and we found ourselves in strange waters where the Captain had lost his reckoning and was wholly bewildered in this sea so said we to the look out man FN two hundred fifty six Get thee to the mast head and keep thine eyes open He swarmed up the mast and looked out and cried aloud O Rais I espy to starboard something dark very like a fish floating on the face of the sea and to larboard there is a loom in the midst of the main now black and now bright When the Captain heard the look out s words he dashed his turband on the deck and plucked out his beard and beat his face saying Good news indeed we be all dead men not one of us can be saved And he fell to weeping and all of us wept for his weeping and also for our lives and I said O Captain tell us what it is the look out saw O my Prince answered he know that we lost our course on the night of the storm which was followed on the morrow by a two days calm during which we made no way and we have gone astray eleven days reckoning from that night with ne er a wind to bring us back to our true course Tomorrow by the end of the day we shall come to a mountain of black stone highs the Magnet Mountain FN two hundred fifty seven for thither the currents carry us willy nilly As soon as we are under its lea the ship s sides will open and every nail in plank will fly out and cleave fast to the mountain for that Almighty Allah hath gifted the loadstone with a mysterious virtue and a love for iron by reason whereof all which is iron travelleth towards it and on this mountain is much iron how much none knoweth save the Most High from the many vessels which have been lost there since the days of yore The bright spot upon its summit is a dome of yellow laton from Andalusia vaulted upon ten columns and on its crown is a horseman who rideth a horse of brass and holdeth in hand a lance of laton and there hangeth on his bosom a tablet of lead graven with names and talismans And he presently added And O King none destroyeth folk save the rider on that steed nor will the egromancy be dispelled till he fall from his horse FN two hundred fifty eight Then O my lady the Captain wept with exceeding weeping and we all made sure of death doom and each and every one of us farewelled his friend and charged him with his last will and testament in case he might be saved We slept not that night and in the morning we found ourselves much nearer the Loadstone Mountain whither the waters crave us with a violent send When the ships were close under its lea they opened and the nails flew out and all the iron in them sought the Magnet Mountain and clove to it like a network so that by the end of the day we were all struggling in the waves round about the mountain Some of us were saved but more were drowned and even those who had escaped knew not one another so stupefied were they by the beating of the billows and the raving of the winds As for me O my lady Allah be His name exalted preserved my life that I might suffer whatso He willed to me of hardship misfortune and calamity for I scrambled upon a plank from one of the ships and the wind and waters threw it at the feet of the Mountain There I found a practicable path leading by steps carven out of the rock to the summit and I called on the name of Allah Almighty FN two hundred fifty nine And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Fifteenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the third Kalandar said to the lady the rest of the party sitting fast bound and the slaves standing with swords drawn over their heads And after calling on the name of Almighty Allah and passionately beseeching Him I breasted the ascent clinging to the steps and notches hewn in the stone and mounted little by little And the Lord stilled the wind and aided me in the ascent so that I succeeded in reaching the summit There I found no resting place save the dome which I entered joying with exceeding joy at my escape and made the Wuzu ablution FN two hundred sixty and prayed a two bow prayer FN two hundred sixty one a thanksgiving to God for my preservation Then I fell asleep under the dome and heard in my dream a mysterious Voice FN two hundred sixty two saying O son of Khazib when thou wakest from thy sleep dig under thy feet and thou shalt find a bow of brass and three leaden arrows inscribed with talismans and characts Take the bow and shoot the arrows at the horseman on the dome top and free mankind from this sore calamity When thou hast shot him he shall fall into the sea and the horse will also drop at thy feet then bury it in the place of the bow This done the main will swell and rise till it is level with the mountain head and there will appear on it a skiff carrying a man of laton other than he thou shalt have shot holding in his hand a pair of paddles He will come to thee and do thou embark with him but beware of saying Bismillah or of otherwise naming Allah Almighty He will row thee for a space of ten days till he bring thee to certain Islands called the Islands of Safety and thence thou shalt easily reach a port and find those who will convey thee to thy native land and all this shall be fulfilled to thee so thou call not on the name of Allah Then I started up from my sleep in joy and gladness and hastening to do the bidding of the mysterious Voice found the bow and arrows and shot at the horseman and tumbled him into the main whilst the horse dropped at my feet so I took it and buried it Presently the sea surged up and rose till it reached the top of the mountain nor had I long to wait ere I saw a skiff in the offing coming towards me I gave thanks to Allah and when the skiff came up to me I saw therein a man of brass with a tablet of lead on his breast inscribed with talismans and characts and I embarked without uttering a word The boatman rowed on with me through the first day and the second and the third in all ten whole days till I caught sight of the Islands of Safety whereat I joyed with exceeding joy and for stress of gladness exclaimed Allah Allah In the name of Allah There is no god but the God and Allah is Almighty FN two hundred sixty three Thereupon the skiff forthwith upset and cast me upon the sea then it righted and sank deep into the depths Now I am a fair swimmer so I swam the whole day till nightfall when my forearms and shoulders were numbed with fatigue and I felt like to die so I testified to my faith expecting naught but death The sea was still surging under the violence of the winds and presently there came a billow like a hillock and bearing me up high in air threw me with a long cast on dry land that His will might be fulfilled I crawled up the beach and doffing my raiment wrung it out to dry and spread it in the sunshine then I lay me down and slept the whole night As soon as it was day I donned my clothes and rose to look whither I should walk Presently I came to a thicket of low trees and making a cast round it found that the spot whereon I stood was an islet a mere holm girt on all sides by the ocean whereupon I said to myself Whatso freeth me from one great calamity casteth me into a greater But while I was pondering my case and longing for death behold I saw afar off a ship making for the island so I clomb a tree and hid myself among the branches Presently the ship anchored and landed ten slaves blackamoors bearing iron hoes and baskets who walked on till they reached the middle of the island Here they dug deep into the ground until they uncovered a plate of metal which they lifted thereby opening a trap door After this they returned to the ship and thence brought bread and flour honey and fruits clarified butter FN two hundred sixty four leather bottles containing liquors and many household stuffs also furniture table service and mirrors rugs carpets and in fact all needed to furnish a dwelling and they kept going to and fro and descending by the trap door till they had transported into the dwelling all that was in the ship After this the slaves again went on board and brought back with them garments as rich as may be and in the midst of them came an old old man of whom very little was left for Time had dealt hardly and harshly with him and all that remained of him was a bone wrapped in a rag of blue stuff through which the winds whistled west and east As saith the poet of him Time gars me tremble Ah how sore the baulk While Time in pride of strength cloth ever stalk Time was I walked nor ever felt I tired Now am I tired albe I never walk And the Shaykh held by the hand a youth cast in beauty s mould all elegance and perfect grace so fair that his comeliness deserved to be proverbial for he was as a green bough or the tender young of the roe ravishing every heart with his loveliness and subduing every soul with his coquetry and amorous ways FN two hundred sixty five It was of him the poet spake when he said Beauty they brought with him to make compare But Beauty hung her head in shame and care Quoth they O Beauty hast thou seen his like And Beauty cried His like not anywhere They stinted not their going O my lady till all went down by the trap door and did not reappear for an hour or rather more at the end of which time the slaves and the old man came up without the youth and replacing the iron plate and carefully closing the door slab as it was before they returned to the ship and made sail and were lost to my sight When they turned away to depart I came down from the tree and going to the place I had seen them fill up scraped off and removed the earth and in patience possessed my soul till I had cleared the whole of it away Then appeared the trap door which was of wood in shape and size like a millstone and when I lifted it up it disclosed a winding staircase of stone At this I marvelled and descending the steps till I reached the last found a fair hall spread with various kinds of carpets and silk stuffs wherein was a youth sitting upon a raised couch and leaning back on a round cushion with a fan in his hand and nosegays and posies of sweet scented herbs and flowers before him FN two hundred sixty six but he was alone and not a soul near him in the great vault When he saw me he turned pale but I saluted him courteously and said Set thy mind at ease and calm thy fears no harm shall come near thee I am a man like thyself and the son of a King to boot whom the decrees of Destiny have sent to bear thee company and cheer thee in thy loneliness But now tell me what is thy story and what causeth thee to dwell thus in solitude under the ground When he was assured that I was of his kind and no Jinni he rejoiced and his fine colour returned and making me draw near to him he said O my brother my story is a strange story and tis this My father is a merchant jeweller possessed of great wealth who hath white and black slaves travelling and trading on his account in ships and on camels and trafficking with the most distant cities but he was not blessed with a child not even one Now on a certain night he dreamed a dream that he should be favoured with a son who would be short lived so the morning dawned on my father bringing him woe and weeping On the following night my mother conceived and my father noted down the date of her becoming pregnant FN two hundred sixty seven Her time being fulfilled she bare me whereat my father rejoiced and made banquets and called together the neighbors and fed the Fakirs and the poor for that he had been blessed with issue near the end of his days Then he assembled the astrologers and astronomers who knew the places of the planets and the wizards and wise ones of the time and men learned in horoscopes and nativities FN two hundred sixty eight and they drew out my birth scheme and said to my father Thy son shall live to fifteen years but in his fifteenth there is a sinister aspect an he safely tide it over he shall attain a great age And the cause that threateneth him with death is this In the Sea of Peril standeth the Mountain Magnet hight on whose summit is a horseman of yellow laton seated on a horse also of brass and bearing on his breast a tablet of lead Fifty days after this rider shall fall from his steed thy son will die and his slayer will be he who shoots down the horseman a Prince named Ajib son of King Khazib My father grieved with exceeding grief to hear these words but reared me in tenderest fashion and educated me excellently well until my fifteenth year was told Ten days ago news came to him that the horseman had fallen into the sea and he who shot him down was named Ajib son of King Khazib My father thereupon wept bitter tears at the need of parting with me and became like one possessed of a Jinni However being in mortal fear for me he built me this place under the earth and stocking it with all required for the few days still remaining he brought me hither in a ship and left me here Ten are already past and when the forty shall have gone by without danger to me he will come and take me away for he hath done all this only in fear of Prince Ajib Such then is my story and the cause of my loneliness When I heard his history I marvelled and said in my mind I am the Prince Ajib who hath done all this but as Allah is with me I will surely not slay him So said I to him O my lord far from thee be this hurt and harm and then please Allah thou shalt not suffer cark nor care nor aught disquietude for I will tarry with thee and serve thee as a servant and then wend my ways and after having borne thee company during the forty days I will go with thee to thy home where thou shalt give me an escort of some of thy Mamelukes with whom I may journey back to my own city and the Almighty shall requite thee for me He was glad to hear these words when I rose and lighted a large wax candle and trimmed the ramps end the three lanterns and I set on meat and drink and sweetmeats We ate and drank and sat talking over various matters till the greater part of the night was gone when he lay down to rest and I covered him up and went to sleep myself Next morning I arose and warmed a little water then lifted him gently so as to awake him and brought him the warm water wherewith he washed his face FN two hundred sixty nine and said to me Heaven requite thee for me with every blessing O youth By Allah if I get quit of this danger and am saved from him whose name is Ajib bin Khazib I will make my father reward thee and send thee home healthy and wealthy and if I die then my blessing be upon thee I answered May the day never dawn on which evil shall betide thee and may Allah make my last day before thy last day Then I set before him somewhat of food and we ate and I got ready perfumes for fumigating the hall wherewith he was pleased Moreover I made him a Mankalah cloth FN two hundred seventy and we played and ate sweetmeats and we played again and took our pleasure till nightfall when I rose and lighted the lamps and set before him somewhat to eat and sat telling him stories till the hours of darkness were far spent Then he lay down to rest and I covered him up and rested also And thus I continued to do O my lady for days and nights and affection for him took root in my heart and my sorrow was eased and I said to myself The astrologers lied FN two hundred seventy one when they predicted that he should be slain by Ajib bin Khazib by Allah I will not slay him I ceased not ministering to him and conversing and carousing with him and telling him all manner tales for thirty nine days On the fortieth night FN two hundred seventy two the youth rejoiced and said O my brother Alhamdo lillah praise be to Allah who hath preserved me from death and this is by thy blessing and the blessing of thy coming to me and I pray God that He restore thee to thy native land But now O my brother I would thou warm me some water for the Ghusl ablution and do thou kindly bathe me and change my clothes I replied With love and gladness and I heated water in plenty and carrying it in to him washed his body all over the washing of health FN two hundred seventy three with meal of lupins FN two hundred seventy four and rubbed him well and changed his clothes and spread him a high bed whereon he lay down to rest being drowsy after bathing Then said he O my brother cut me up a water melon and sweeten it with a little sugar candy FN two hundred seventy five So I went to the store room and bringing out a fine water melon I found there set it on a platter and laid it before him saying O my master hast thou not a knife Here it is answered he over my head upon the high shelf So I got up in haste and taking the knife drew it from its sheath but my foot slipped in stepping down and I fell heavily upon the youth holding in my hand the knife which hastened to fulfil what had been written on the Day that decided the destinies of man and buried itself as if planted in the youth s heart He died on the instant When I saw that he was slain and knew that I had slain him maugre myself I cried out with an exceeding loud and bitter cry and beat my face and rent my raiment and said Verily we be Allah s and unto Him we be returning O Moslems O folk fain of Allah there remained for this youth but one day of the forty dangerous days which the astrologers and the learned had foretold for him and the predestined death of this beautiful one was to be at my hand Would Heaven I had not tried to cut the watermelon What dire misfortune is this I must bear fief or loath What a disaster What an affliction O Allah mine I implore thy pardon and declare to Thee my innocence of his death But what God willeth let that come to pass FN two hundred seventy six And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Sixteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ajib thus continued his tale to the lady When I was certified that I had slain him I arose and ascending the stairs replaced the trap door and covered it with earth as before Then I looked out seawards and saw the ship cleaving the waters and making for the island wherefore I was afeard and said The moment they come and see the youth done to death they will know twas I who slew him and will slay me without respite So I climbed up into a high tree and concealed myself among its leaves and hardly had I done so when the ship anchored and the slaves landed with the ancient man the youth s father and made direct for the place and when they removed the earth they were surprised to see it soft FN two hundred seventy seven Then they raised the trap door and went down and found the youth lying at full length clothed in fair new garments with a face beaming after the bath and the knife deep in his heart At the sight they shrieked and wept and beat their faces loudly cursing the murderer whilst a swoon came over the Shaykh so that the slaves deemed him dead unable to survive his son At last they wrapped the slain youth in his clothes and carried him up and laid him on the ground covering him with a shroud of silk Whilst they were making for the ship the old man revived and gazing on his son who was stretched out fell on the ground and strewed dust over his head and smote his face and plucked out his beard and his weeping redoubled as he thought of his murdered son and he swooned away once more After awhile a slave went and fetched a strip of silk whereupon they lay the old man and sat down at his head All this took place and I was on the tree above them watching everything that came to pass and my heart became hoary before my head waxed grey for the hard lot which was mine and for the distress and anguish I had undergone and I fell to reciting How many a joy by Allah s will hath fled With flight escaping sight of wisest head How many a sadness shall begin the day Yet grow right gladsome ere the day is sped How many a weal trips on the heels of ill Causing the mourner s heart with joy to thrill FN two hundred seventy eight But the old man O my lady ceased not from his swoon till near sunset when he came to himself and looking upon his dead son he recalled what had happened and how what he had dreaded had come to pass and he beat his face and head and recited these couplets Racked is my heart by parting fro my friends And two rills ever fro my eyelids flow With them FN two hundred seventy nine went forth my hopes Ah well away What shift remaineth me to say or do Would I had never looked upon their sight What shift fair sirs when paths e er strainer grow What charm shall calm my pangs when this wise burn Longings of love which in my vitals glow Would I had trod with them the road of Death Ne er had befel us twain this parting blow Allah I pray the Truthful show me Roth And mix our lives nor part them evermo e How blest were we as death one roof we dwelt Conjoined in joys nor recking aught of woe Till Fortune shot us pith the severance shaft Ah who shall patient bear such parting throe And dart of Death struck down amid the tribe The age s pearl that Morn saw brightest show I cried the while his case took speech and said Would Heaven my son Death mote his doom foreslow Which be the readiest road wi thee to meet My Son for whom I would my soul bestow If sun I call him no the sun cloth set If moon I call him wane the moons Ah no O sad mischance o thee O doom of days Thy place none other love shall ever know Thy sire distracted sees thee but despairs By wit or wisdom Fate to overthrow Some evil eye this day hath cast its spell And foul befal him as it foul befel Then he sobbed a single sob and his soul fled his flesh The slaves shrieked aloud Alas our lord and showered dust on their heads and redoubled their weeping and wailing Presently they carried their dead master to the ship side by side with his dead son and having transported all the stuff from the dwelling to the vessel set sail and disappeared from mine eyes I descended from the tree and raising the trap door went down into the underground dwelling where everything reminded me of the youth and I looked upon the poor remains of him and began repeating these verses Their tracks I see and pine with pain and pang And on deserted hearths I weep and yearn And Him I pray who doomed them depart Some day vouchsafe the boon of safe return FN two hundred eighty Then O my lady I went up again by the trap door and every day I used to wander round about the island and every night I returned to the underground hall Thus I lived for a month till at last looking at the western side of the island I observed that every day the tides ebbed leaving shallow water for which the flow did not compensate and by the end of the month the sea showed dry land in that direction At this I rejoiced making certain of my safety so I arose and fording what little was left of the water got me to the mainland where I fell in with great heaps of loose sand in which even a camel s hoof would sink up to the knee FN two hundred eighty one However I emboldened my soul and wading through the sand behold a fire shone from afar burning with a brazing light FN two hundred eighty two So I made for it hoping haply to find succour and broke out into these verses Belike Fortune may her bridle turn And Time bring weal although he s jealous hight Forward my hopes and further all my needs And passed ills with present weals requite And when I drew near the fire aforesaid lo it was a palace with gates of copper burnished red which when the rising sun shone thereon gleamed and glistened from afar showing what had seemed to me a fire I rejoiced in the sight and sat down over against the gate but I was hardly settled in my seat before there met me ten young men clothed in sumptuous gear and all were blind of the left eye which appeared as plucked out They were accompanied by a Shaykh an old old man and much I marvelled at their appearance and their all being blind of the same eye When they saw me they saluted me with the Salam and asked me of my case and my history whereupon I related to them all what had befallen me and what full measure of misfortune was mine Marvelling at my tale they took me to the mansion where I saw ranged round the hall ten couches each with its blue bedding and coverlet of blue stuff FN two hundred eighty three and amiddlemost stood a smaller couch furnished like them with blue and nothing else As we entered each of the youths took his seat on his own couch and the old man seated himself upon the smaller one in the middle saying to me O youth sit thee down on the floor and ask not of our case nor of the loss of our eyes Presently he rose up and set before each young man some meat in a charger and drink in a large mazer treating me in like manner and after that they sat questioning me concerning my adventures and what had betided me and I kept telling them my tale till the night was far spent Then said the young men O our Shaykh wilt not thou set before us our ordinary The time is come He replied With love and gladness and rose and entering a closet disappeared but presently returned bearing on his head ten trays each covered with a strip of blue stuff He set a tray before each youth and lighting ten wax candles he stuck one upon each tray and drew off the covers and lo under them was naught but ashes and powdered charcoal and kettle soot Then all the young men tucked up their sleeves to the elbows and fell a weeping and wailing and they blackened their faces and smeared their clothes and buffetted their brows and beat their breasts continually exclaiming We were sitting at our ease but our frowardness brought us unease They ceased not to do this till dawn drew nigh when the old man rose and heated water for them and they washed their faces and donned other and clean clothes Now when I saw this O my lady for very wonderment my senses left me and my wits went wild and heart and head were full of thought till I forgot what had betided me and I could not keep silence feeling I fain must speak out and question them of these strangenesses so I said to them How come ye to do this after we have been so open hearted and frolicksome Thanks be to Allah ye be all sound and sane yet actions such as these befit none but mad men or those possessed of an evil spirit I conjure you by all that is dearest to you why stint ye to tell me your history and the cause of your losing your eyes and your blackening your faces with ashes and soot Hereupon they turned to me and said O young man hearken not to thy youthtide s suggestions and question us no questions Then they slept and I with them and when they awoke the old man brought us somewhat of food and after we had eaten and the plates and goblets had been removed they sat conversing till night fall when the old man rose and lit the wax candles and lamps and set meat and drink before us After we had eaten and drunken we sat conversing and carousing in companionage till the noon of night when they said to the old man Bring us our ordinary for the hour of sleep is at hand So he rose and brought them the trays of soot and ashes and they did as they had done on the preceding night nor more nor less I abode with them after this fashion for the space of a month during which time they used to blacken their faces with ashes every night and to wash and change their raiment when the morn was young and I but marvelled the more and my scruples and curiosity increased to such a point that I had to forego even food and drink At last I lost command of myself for my heart was aflame with fire unquenchable and lowe unconcealable and I said O young men will ye not relieve my trouble and acquaint me with the reason of thus blackening your faces and the meaning of your words We were sitting at our ease but our frowardness brought us unease Quoth they Twere better to keep these things secret Still I was bewildered by their doings to the point of abstaining from eating and drinking and at last wholly losing patience quoth I to them There is no help for it ye must acquaint me with what is the reason of these doings They replied We kept our secret only for thy good to gratify thee will bring down evil upon thee and thou wilt become a monocular even as we are I repeated There is no help for it and if ye will not let me leave you and return to mine own people and be at rest from seeing these things for the proverb saith Better ye bide and I take my leave For what eye sees not heart shall never grieve Thereupon they said to me Remember O youth that should ill befal thee we will not again harbour thee nor suffer thee to abide amongst us and bringing a ram they slaughtered it and skinned it Lastly they gave me a knife saying Take this skin and stretch thyself upon it and we will sew it around thee presently there shall come to thee a certain bird hight Rukh FN two hundred eighty four that will catch thee up in his pounces and tower high in air and then set thee down on a mountain When thou feelest he is no longer flying rip open the pelt with this blade and come out of it the bird will be scared and will fly away and leave thee free After this fare for half a day and the march will place thee at a palace wondrous fair to behold towering high in air and builded of Khalanj FN two hundred eighty five lign aloes and sandal wood plated with red gold and studded with all manner emeralds and costly gems fit for seal rings Enter it and thou shalt win to thy wish for we have all entered that palace and such is the cause of our losing our eyes and of our blackening our faces Were we now to tell thee our stories it would take too long a time for each and every of us lost his left eye by an adventure of his own I rejoiced at their words and they did with me as they said and the bird Rukh bore me off end set me down on the mountain Then I came out of the skin and walked on till I reached the palace The door stood open as I entered and found myself in a spacious and goodly hall wide exceedingly even as a horse course and around it were an hundred chambers with doors of sandal and aloes woods plated with red gold and furnished with silver rings by way of knockers FN two hundred eighty six At the head or upper end FN two hundred eighty seven of the hall I saw forty damsels sumptuously dressed and ornamented and one and all bright as moons none could ever tire of gazing upon them and all so lovely that the most ascetic devotee on seeing them would become their slave and obey their will When they saw me the whole bevy came up to me and said Welcome and well come and good cheer FN two hundred eighty eight to thee O our lord This whole month have we been expecting thee Praised be Allah who hath sent us one who is worthy of us even as we are worthy of him Then they made me sit down upon a high divan and said to me This day thou art our lord and master and we are thy servants and thy hand maids so order us as thou wilt And I marvelled at their case Presently one of them arose and set meat before me and I ate and they ate with me whilst others warmed water and washed my hands and feet and changed my clothes and others made ready sherbets and gave us to drink and all gathered around me being full of joy and gladness at my coming Then they sat down and conversed with me till nightfall when five of them arose and laid the trays and spread them with flowers and fragrant herbs and fruits fresh and dried and confections in profusion At last they brought out a fine wine service with rich old wine and we sat down to drink and some sang songs and others played the lute and psaltery and recorders and other instruments and the bowl went merrily round Hereupon such gladness possessed me that I forgot the sorrows of the world one and all and said This is indeed life O sad that tis fleeting I enjoyed their company till the time came for rest and our heads were all warm with wine when they said O our lord choose from amongst us her who shall be thy bed fellow this night and not lie with thee again till forty days be past So I chose a girl fair of face and perfect in shape with eyes Kohl edged by nature s hand FN two hundred eighty nine hair long and jet black with slightly parted teeth FN two hundred ninety and joining brows twas as if she were some limber graceful branchlet or the slender stalk of sweet basil to amaze and to bewilder man s fancy even as the poet said of such an one To even her with greeny bough were vain Fool he who finds her beauties in the roe When hath the roe those lively lovely limbs Or honey dews those lips alone bestow Those eyne soul piercing eyne which slay with love Which bind the victim by their shafts laid low My heart to second childhood they beguiled No wonder love sick man again is child And I repeated to her the maker s words who said None other charms but thine shall greet mine eyes Nor other image can my heart surprise Thy love my lady captives all my thoughts And on that love I ll die and I ll arise So I lay with her that night none fairer I ever knew and when it was morning the damsels carried me to the Hammam bath and bathed me and robed me in fairest apparel Then they served up food and we ate and drank and the cup went round till nightfall when I chose from among them one fair of form and face soft sided and a model of grace such an one as the poet described when he said On her fair bosom caskets twain I scanned Sealed fast with musk seals lovers to withstand With arrowy glances stand on guard her eyes Whose shafts would shoot who dares put forth a hand With her I spent a most goodly night and to be brief O my mistress I remained with them in all solace and delight of life eating and drinking conversing and carousing and every night lying with one or other of them But at the head of the new year they came to me in tears and bade me farewell weeping and crying out and clinging about me whereat I wondered and said What may be the matter verily you break my heart They exclaimed Would Heaven we had never known thee for though we have companies with many yet never saw we a pleasanter than thou or a more courteous And they wept again But tell me more clearly asked I what causeth this weeping which maketh my gall bladder FN two hundred ninety one like to burst and they answered O our lord and master it is severance which maketh us weep and thou and thou only art the cause of our tears If thou hearken to us we need never be parted and if thou hearken not we part for ever but our hearts tell us that thou wilt not listen to our words and this is the cause of our tears and cries Tell me how the case standeth Know O our lord that we are the daughters of Kings who have met here and have lived together for years and once in every year we are perforce absent for forty days and afterwards we return and abide here for the rest of the twelve month eating and drinking and taking our pleasure and enjoying delights we are about to depart according to our custom and we fear lest after we be gone thou contraire our charge and disobey our injunctions Here now we commit to thee the keys of the palace which containeth forty chambers and thou mayest open of these thirty and nine but beware and we conjure thee by Allah and by the lives of us lest thou open the fortieth door for therein is that which shall separate us for ever FN two hundred ninety two Quoth I Assuredly I will not open it if it contain the cause of severance from you Then one among them came up to me and falling on my neck wept and recited these verses If Time unite us after absent while The world harsh frowning on our lot shall smile And if thy semblance deign adorn mine eyes FN two hundred ninety three I ll pardon Time past wrongs and by gone guile And I recited the following When drew she near to bid adieu with heart unstrung While care and longing on that day her bosom wrung Wet pearls she wept and mine like red carnelians rolled And joined in sad riviere around her neck they hung When I saw her weeping I said By Allah I will never open that fortieth door never and no wise and I bade her farewell Thereupon all departed flying away like birds signalling with their hands farewells as they went and leaving me alone in the palace When evening drew near I opened the door of the first chamber and entering it found myself in a place like one of the pleasaunces of Paradise It was a garden with trees of freshest green and ripe fruits of yellow sheen and its birds were singing clear and keen and rills ran wimpling through the fair terrene The sight and sounds brought solace to my sprite and I walked among the trees and I smelt the breath of the flowers on the breeze and heard the birdies sing their melodies hymning the One the Almighty in sweetest litanies and I looked upon the apple whose hue is parcel red and parcel yellow as said the poet Apple whose hue combines in union mellow My fair s red cheek her hapless lover s yellow Then I looked upon the quince and inhaled its fragrance which to shame musk and ambergris even as the poet hath said Quince every taste conjoins in her are found Gifts which for queen of fruits the Quince have crowned Her taste is wine her scent the waft of musk Pure gold her hue her shape the Moon s fair round Then I looked upon the pear whose taste surpasseth sherbet and sugar and the apricot FN two hundred ninety four whose beauty striketh the eye with admiration as if she were a polished ruby Then I went out of the place and locked the door as it was before When it was the morrow I opened the second door and entering found myself in a spacious plain set with tall date palms and watered by a running stream whose banks were shrubbed with bushes of rose and jasmine while privet and eglantine oxe eye violet and lily narcissus origane and the winter gilliflower carpeted the borders and the breath of the breeze swept over these sweet smelling growths diffusing their delicious odours right and left perfuming the world and filling my soul with delight After taking my pleasure there awhile I went from it and having closed the door as it was before opened the third door wherein I saw a high open hall pargetted with parti coloured marbles and pietra dura of price and other precious stones and hung with cages of sandal wood and eagle wood full of birds which made sweet music such as the Thousand voiced FN two hundred ninety five and the cushat the merle the turtle dove and the Nubian ring dove My heart was filled with pleasure thereby my grief was dispelled and I slept in that aviary till dawn Then I undocked the door of the fourth chamber and therein found a grand saloon with forty smaller chambers giving upon it All their doors stood open so I entered and found them full of pearls and jacinths and beryls and emeralds and corals and car buncles and all manner precious gems and jewels such as tongue of man may not describe My thought was stunned at the sight and I said to myself These be things methinks united which could not be found save in the treasuries of a King of Kings nor could the monarchs of the world have collected the like of these And my heart dilated and my sorrows ceased For quoth I now verily am I the monarch of the age since by Allah s grace this enormous wealth is mine and I have forty damsels under my hand nor is there any to claim them save myself Then I gave not over opening place after place until nine and thirty days were passed and in that time I had entered every chamber except that one whose door the Princesses had charged me not to open But my thoughts O my mistress ever ran on that forbidden fortieth FN two hundred ninety six and Satan urged me to open it for my own undoing nor had I patience to forbear albeit there wanted of the trysting time but a single day So I stood before the chamber aforesaid and after a moment s hesitation opened the door which was plated with red gold and entered I was met by a perfume whose like I had never before smelt and so sharp and subtle was the odour that it made my senses drunken as with strong wine and I fell to the ground in a fainting fit which lasted a full hour When I came to myself I strengthened my heart and entering found myself in a chamber whose floor was bespread with saffron and blazing with light from branched candelabra of gold and lamps fed with costly oils which diffused the scent of musk and ambergris I saw there also two great censers each big as a mazer bowl FN two hundred ninety seven flaming with lign aloes nadd perfume FN two hundred ninety eight ambergris and honied scents and the place was full of their fragrance Presently O my lady I espied a noble steed black as the murks of night when murkiest standing ready saddled and bridled and his saddle was of red gold before two mangers one of clear crystal wherein was husked sesame and the other also of crystal containing water of the rose scented with musk When I saw this I marvelled and said to myself Doubtless in this animal must be some wondrous mystery and Satan cozened me so I led him without the palace end mounted him but he would not stir from his place So I hammered his sides with my heels but he moved not and then I took the rein whip FN two hundred ninety nine and struck him withal When he felt the blow he neighed a neigh with a sound like deafening thunder and opening a pair of wings FN three hundred flew up with me in the firmament of heaven far beyond the eyesight of man After a full hour of flight he descended and alighted on a terrace roof and shaking me off his back lashed me on the face with his tail and gouged out my left eye causing it roll along my cheek Then he flew away I went down from the terrace and found myself again amongst the ten one eyed youths sitting upon their ten couches with blue covers and they cried out when they saw me No welcome to thee nor aught of good cheer We all lived of lives the happiest and we ate and drank of the best upon brocades and cloths of gold we took rest and we slept with our heads on beauty s breast but we could not await one day to gain the delights of a year Quoth I Behold I have become one like unto you and now I would have you bring me a tray full of blackness wherewith to blacken my face and receive me into your society No by Allah quoth they thou shalt not sojourn with us and now get thee hence So they drove me away Finding them reject me thus I foresaw that matters would go hard with me and I remembered the many miseries which Destiny had written upon my forehead and I fared forth from among them heavy hearted and tearful eyed repeating to myself these words I was sitting at mine ease but my frowardness brought me to unease Then I shaved beard and mustachios and eye brows renouncing the world and wandered in Kalandar garb about Allah s earth and the Almighty decreed safety for me till I arrived at Baghdad which was on the evening of this very night Here I met these two other Kalandars standing bewildered so I saluted them saying I am a stranger and they answered And we likewise be strangers By the freak of Fortune we were like to like three Kalandars and three monoculars all blind of the left eye Such O my lady is the cause of the shearing of my beard and the manner of my losing an eye Said the lady to him Rub thy head and wend thy ways but he answered By Allah I will not go until I hear the stories of these others Then the lady turning towards the Caliph and Ja afar and Masrur said to them Do ye also give an account of yourselves you men Whereupon Ja afar stood forth and told her what he had told the portress as they were entering the house and when she heard his story of their being merchants and Mosul men who had outrun the watch she said I grant you your lives each for each sake and now away with you all So they all went out and when they were in the street quoth the Caliph to the Kalandars O company whither go ye now seeing that the morning hath not yet dawned Quoth they By Allah O our lord we know not where to go Come and pass the rest of the night with us said the Caliph and turning to Ja afar Take them home with thee and tomorrow bring them to my presence that we may chronicle their adventures Ja afar did as the Caliph bade him and the Commander of the Faithful returned to his palace but sleep gave no sign of visiting him that night and he lay awake pondering the mishaps of the three Kalandar princes and impatient to know the history of the ladies and the two black bitches No sooner had morning dawned than he went forth and sat upon the throne of his sovereignty and turning to Ja afar after all his Grandees and Officers of state were gathered together he said Bring me the three ladies and the two bitches and the three Kalandars So Ja afar fared forth and brought them all before him and the ladies were veiled then the Minister turned to them and said in the Caliph s name We pardon you your maltreatment of us and your want of courtesy in consideration of the kindness which forewent it and for that ye knew us not now however I would have you to know that ye stand in presence of the fifth FN three hundred one of the sons of Abbas Harun al Rashid brother of Caliph Musa al Hadi son of Al Mansur son of Mohammed the brother of Al Saffah bin Mohammed who was first of the royal house Speak ye therefore before him the truth and the whole truth When the ladies heard Ja afar s words touching the Commander of the Faithful the eldest came forward and said O Prince of True Believers my story is one which were it graven with needle gravers upon the eye corners were a warner for whoso would be warned and an example for whoso can take profit from example And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Seventeenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that she stood forth before the Commander of the Faithful and began to tell The Eldest Lady s Tale Verily a strange tale is mine and tis this Yon two black bitches are my eldest sisters by one mother and father and these two others she who beareth upon her the signs of stripes and the third our procuratrix are my sisters by another mother When my father died each took her share of the heritage and after a while my mother also deceased leaving me and my sisters german three thousand diners so each daughter received her portion of a thousand diners and I the same albe the youngest In due course of time my sisters married with the usual festivities and lived with their husbands who bought merchandise with their wives monies and set out on their travels together Thus they threw me off My brothers in law were absent with their wives five years during which period they spent all the money they had and becoming bankrupt deserted my sisters in foreign parts amid stranger folk After five years my eldest sister returned to me in beggar s gear with her clothes in rags and tatters FN three hundred two and a dirty old mantilla FN three hundred three and truly she was in the foulest and sorriest plight At first sight I did not know my own sister but presently I recognised her and said What state is this O our sister she replied Words cannot undo the done and the reed of Destiny hath run through what Allah decreed Then I sent her to the bath and dressed her in a suit of mine own and boiled for her a bouillon and brought her some good wine and said to her O my sister thou art the eldest who still standest to us in the stead of father and mother and as for the inheritance which came to me as to you twain Allah hath blessed it and prospered it to me with increase and my circumstances are easy for I have made much money by spinning and cleaning silk and I and you will share my wealth alike I entreated her with all kindliness and she abode with me a whole year during which our thoughts and fancies were always full of our other sister Shortly after she too came home in yet fouler and sorrier plight than that of my eldest sister and I dealt by her still more honorably than I had done by the first and each of them had a share of my substance After a time they said to me O our sister we desire to marry again for indeed we have not patience to drag on our days without husbands and to lead the lives of widows bewitched and I replied O eyes of me FN three hundred four ye have hitherto seen scanty weal in wedlock for now a days good men and true are become rarities and curiosities nor do I deem your projects advisable as ye have already made trial of matrimony and have failed But they would not accept my advice and married without my consent nevertheless I gave them outfit and dowries out of my money and they fared forth with their mates In a mighty little time their husbands played them false and taking whatever they could lay hands upon levanted and left them in the lurch Thereupon they came to me ashamed and in abject case and made their excuses to me saying Pardon our fault and be not wroth with us FN three hundred five for although thou art younger in years yet art thou older in wit henceforth we will never make mention of marriage so take us back as thy hand maidens that we may eat our mouthful Quoth I Welcome to you O my sisters there is naught dearer to me than you And I took them in and redoubled my kindness to them We ceased not to live after this loving fashion for a full year when I resolved to sell my wares abroad and first to fit me a conveyance for Bassorah so I equipped a large ship and loaded her with merchandise and valuable goods for traffic and with provaunt and all needful for a voyage and said to my sisters Will ye abide at home whilst I travel or would ye prefer to accompany me on the voyage We will travel with thee answered they for we cannot bear to be parted from thee So I divided my monies into two parts one to accompany me and the other to be left in charge of a trusty person for as I said to myself Haply some accident may happen to the ship and yet we remain alive in which case we shall find on our return what may stand us in good stead I took my two sisters and we went a voyaging some days and nights but the master was careless enough to miss his course and the ship went astray with us and entered a sea other than the sea we sought For a time we knew naught of this and the wind blew fair for us ten days after which the look out man went aloft to see about him and cried Good news Then he came down rejoicing and said I have seen what seemeth to be a city as twere a pigeon Hereat we rejoiced and ere an hour of the day had passed the buildings showed plain in the offing and we asked the Captain What is the name of yonder city and he answered By Allah I wot not for I never saw it before and never sailed these seas in my life but since our troubles have ended in safety remains for you only to land there with your merchandise and if you find selling profitable sell and make your market of what is there and if not we will rest here two days and provision ourselves and fare away So we entered the port and the Captain went up town and was absent awhile after which he returned to us and said Arise go up into the city and marvel at the works of Allah with His creatures and pray to be preserved from His righteous wrath So we landed and going up into the city saw at the gate men hending staves in hand but when we drew near them behold they had been translated FN three hundred six by the anger of Allah and had become stones Then we entered the city and found all who therein woned into black stones enstoned not an inhabited house appeared to the espier nor was there a blower of fire FN three hundred seven We were awe struck at the sight and threaded the market streets where we found the goods and gold and silver left lying in their places and we were glad and said Doubtless there is some mystery in all this Then we dispersed about the thorough fares and each busied himself with collecting the wealth and money and rich stuffs taking scanty heed of friend or comrade As for myself I went up to the castle which was strongly fortified and entering the King s palace by its gate of red gold found all the vaiselle of gold and silver and the King himself seated in the midst of his Chamberlains and Nabobs and Emirs and Wazirs all clad in raiment which confounded man s art I drew nearer and saw him sitting on a throne incrusted and inlaid with pearls and gems and his robes were of gold cloth adorned with jewels of every kind each one flashing like a star Around him stood fifty Mamelukes white slaves clothed in silks of divers sorts holding their drawn swords in their hands but when I drew near to them lo all were black stones My understanding was confounded at the sight but I walked on and entered the great hall of the Harim FN three hundred eight whose walls I found hung with tapestries of gold striped silk and spread with silken carpets embroidered with golden cowers Here I saw the Queen lying at full length arrayed in robes purfled with fresh young FN three hundred nine pearls on her head was a diadem set with many sorts of gems each fit for a ring FN three hundred ten and around her neck hung collars and necklaces All her raiment and her ornaments were in natural state but she had been turned into a black stone by Allah s wrath Presently I espied an open door for which I made straight and found leading to it a flight of seven steps So I walked up and came upon a place pargetted with marble and spread and hung with gold worked carpets and tapestry amiddlemostof which stood a throne of juniper wood inlaid with pearls and precious stones and set with bosses of emeralds In the further wall was an alcove whose curtains bestrung with pearls were let down and I saw a light issuing therefrom so I drew near and perceived that the light came from a precious stone as big as an ostrich egg set at the upper end of the alcove upon a little chryselephantine couch of ivory and gold and this jewel blazing like the sun cast its rays wide and side The couch also was spread with all manner of silken stuffs amazing the gazer with their richness and beauty I marvelled much at all this especially when seeing in that place candles ready lighted and I said in my mind Needs must some one have lighted these candles Then I went forth and came to the kitchen and thence to the buttery and the King s treasure chambers and continued to explore the palace and to pace from place to place I forgot myself in my awe and marvel at these matters and I was drowned in thought till the night came on Then I would have gone forth but knowing not the gate I lost my way so I returned to the alcove whither the lighted candles directed me and sat down upon the couch and wrapping myself in a coverlet after I had repeated somewhat from the Koran I would have slept but could not for restlessness possessed me When night was at its noon I heard a voice chanting the Koran in sweetest accents but the tone thereof was weak so I rose glad to hear the silence broken and followed the sound until I reached a closet whose door stood ajar Then peeping through a chink I considered the place and lo it was an oratory wherein was a prayer niche FN three hundred eleven with two wax candles burning and lamps hanging from the ceiling In it too was spread a prayer carpet whereupon sat a youth fair to see and before him on its stand FN three hundred twelve was a copy of the Koran from which he was reading I marvelled to see him alone alive amongst the people of the city and entering saluted him whereupon he raised his eyes and returned my salam Quoth I Now by the Truth of what thou readest in Allah s Holy Book I conjure thee to answer my question He looked upon me with a smile and said O handmaid of Allah first tell me the cause of thy coming hither and I in turn will tell what hath befallen both me and the people of this city and what was the reason of my escaping their doom So I told him my story whereat he wondered and I questioned him of the people of the city when he replied Have patience with me for a while O my sister and reverently closing the Holy Book he laid it up in a satin bag Then he seated me by his side and I looked at him and behold he was as the moon at its full fair of face and rare of form soft sided and slight of well proportioned height and cheek smoothly bright and diffusing light in brief a sweet a sugar stick FN three hundred thirteen even as saith the poet of the like of him in these couplets That night th astrologer a scheme of planets drew And lo a graceful shape of youth appeared in view Saturn had stained his locks with Saturninest jet And spots of nut brown musk on rosy side face blew FN three hundred fourteen Mars tinctured either cheek with tinct of martial red Sagittal shots from eyelids Sagittarius threw Dowered him Mercury with bright mercurial wit Bore off the Bear FN three hundred fifteen what all man s evil glances grew Amazed stood Astrophil to sight the marvel birth When louted low the Moon at full to buss the Earth And of a truth Allah the Most High had robed him in the raiment of perfect grace and had purfled and fringed it with a cheek all beauty and loveliness even as the poet saith of such an one By his eyelids shedding perfume and his fine slim waist I swear By the shooting of his shafts barbed with sorcery passing rare By the softness of his sides FN three hundred sixteen and glances lingering light And brow of dazzling day tide ray and night within his hair By his eyebrows which deny to who look upon them rest Now bidding now forbidding ever dealing joy and care By the rose that decks his cheek and the myrtle of its moss FN three hundred seventeen By jacinths bedded in his lips and pearl his smile lays bare By his graceful bending neck and the curving of his breast Whose polished surface beareth those granados lovely pair By his heavy hips that quiver as he passeth in his pride Or he resteth with that waist which is slim beyond compare By the satin of his skin by that fine unsullied sprite By the beauty that containeth all things bright and debonnair By that ever open hand by the candour of his tongue By noble blood and high degree whereof he s hope and heir Musk from him borrows muskiness she loveth to exhale And all the airs of ambergris through him perfume the air The sun methinks the broad bright sun before my love would pale And sans his splendour would appear a paring of his nail FN three hundred eighteen I glanced at him with one glance of eyes which caused me a thousand sighs and my heart was at once taken captive wise so I asked him O my lord and my love tell me that whereof I questioned thee and he answered Hearing is obeying Know O handmaid of Allah that this city was the capital of my father who is the King thou sawest on the throne transfigured by Allah s wrath to a black stone and the Queen thou foundest in the alcove is my mother They and all the people of the city were Magians who fire adored in lieu of the Omnipotent Lord FN three hundred nineteen and were wont to swear by lowe and heat and shade and light and the spheres revolving day and night My father had ne er a son till he was blest with me near the last of his days and he reared me till I grew up and prosperity anticipated me in all things Now it so fortuned that there was with us an old woman well stricken in years a Moslemah who inwardly believing in Allah and His Apostle conformed outwardly with the religion of my people and my father placed thorough confidence in her for that he knew her to be trustworthy and virtuous and he treated her with ever increasing kindness believing her to be of his own belief So when I was well nigh grown up my father committed me to her charge saying Take him and educate him and teach him the rules of our faith let him have the best in structions and cease not thy fostering care of him So she took me and taught me the tenets of Al Islam with the divine ordinances FN three hundred twenty of the Wuzu ablution and the five daily prayers and she made me learn the Koran by rote often repeating Serve none save Allah Almighty When I had mastered this much of knowledge she said to me O my son keep this matter concealed from thy sire and reveal naught to him lest he slay thee So I hid it from him and I abode on this wise for a term of days when the old woman died and the people of the city redoubled in their impiety FN three hundred twenty one and arrogance and the error of their ways One day while they were as wont behold they heard a loud and terrible sound and a crier crying out with a voice like roaring thunder so every ear could hear far and near O folk of this city leave ye your fire worshipping and adore Allah the All compassionate King At this fear and terror fell upon the citizens and they crowded to my father he being King of the city and asked him What is this awesome voice we have heard for it hath confounded us with the excess of its terror and he answered Let not a voice fright you nor shake your steadfast sprite nor turn you back from the faith which is right Their hearts inclined to his words and they ceased not to worship the fire and they persisted in rebellion for a full year from the time they heard the first voice and on the anniversary came a second cry and a third at the head of the third year each year once Still they persisted in their malpractises till one day at break of dawn judgment and the wrath of Heaven descended upon them with all suddenness and by the visitation of Allah all were metamorphosed into black stones FN three hundred twenty two they and their beasts and their cattle and none was saved save myself who at the time was engaged in my devotions From that day to this I am in the case thou seest constant in prayer and fasting and reading and reciting the Koran but I am indeed grown weary by reason of my loneliness having none to bear me company Then said I to him for in very sooth he had won my heart and was the lord of my life and soul O youth wilt thou fare with me to Baghdad city and visit the Olema and men learned in the law and doctors of divinity and get thee increase of wisdom and understanding and theology And know that she who standeth in thy presence will be thy handmaid albeit she be head of her family and mistress over men and eunuchs and servants and slaves Indeed my life was no life before it fell in with thy youth I have here a ship laden with merchandise and in very truth Destiny drove me to this city that I might come to the knowledge of these matters for it was fated that we should meet And I ceased not to persuade him and speak him fair and use every art till he consented And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Eighteenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lady ceased not persuading with soft speech the youth to depart with her till he consented and said Yes She slept that night lying at his feet and hardly knowing where she was for excess of joy As soon as the next morning dawned she pursued addressing the Caliph I arose and we entered the treasuries and took thence whatever was light in weight and great in worth then we went down side by side from the castle to the city where we were met by the Captain and my sisters and slaves who had been seeking for me When they saw me they rejoiced and asked what had stayed me and I told them all I had seen and related to them the story of the young Prince and the transformation wherewith the citizens had been justly visited Hereat all marvelled but when my two sisters these two bitches O Commander of the Faithful saw me by the side of my young lover they jaloused me on his account and were wroth and plotted mischief against me We awaited a fair wind and went on board rejoicing and ready to fly for joy by reason of the goods we had gotten but my own greatest joyance was in the youth and we waited awhile till the wind blew fair for us and then we set sail and fared forth Now as we sat talking my sisters asked me And what wilt thou do with this handsome young man and I answered I purpose to make him my husband Then I turned to him and said O my lord I have that to propose to thee wherein thou must not cross me and this it is that when we reach Baghdad my native city I offer thee my life as thy handmaiden in holy matrimony and thou shalt be to me baron and I will be femme to thee He answered I hear and I obey thou art my lady and my mistress and whatso thou doest I will not gainsay Then I turned to my sisters and said This is my gain I content me with this youth and those who have gotten aught of my property let them keep it as their gain with my good will Thou sayest and doest well answered the twain but they imagined mischief against me We ceased not spooning before a fair wind till we had exchanged the sea of peril for the seas of safety and in a few days we made Bassorah city whose buildings loomed clear before us as evening fell But after we had retired to rest and were sound alseep my two sisters arose and took me up bed and all and threw me into the sea they did the same with the young Prince who as he could not swim sank and was drowned and Allah enrolled him in the noble army of Martyrs FN three hundred twenty three As for me would Heaven I had been drowned with him but Allah deemed that I should be of the saved so when I awoke and found myself in the sea and saw the ship making off like a dash of lightning He threw in my way a piece of timber which I bestrided and the waves tossed me to and fro till they cast me upon an island coast a high land and an uninhabited I landed and walked about the island the rest of the night and when morning dawned I saw a rough track barely fit for child of Adam to tread leading to what proved a shallow ford connecting island and mainland As soon as the sun had risen I spread my garments to dry in its rays and ate of the fruits of the island and drank of its waters then I set out along the foot track and ceased not walking till I reached the mainland Now when there remained between me and the city but a two hours journey behold a great serpent the bigness of a date palm came fleeing towards me in all haste gliding along now to the right then to the left till she was close upon me whilst her tongue lolled ground wards a span long and swept the dust as she went She was pursued by a Dragon FN three hundred twenty four who was not longer than two lances and of slender build about the bulk of a spear and although her terror lent her speed and she kept wriggling from side to side he overtook her and seized her by the tail whereat her tears streamed down and her tongue was thrust out in her agony I took pity on her and picking up a stone and calling upon Allah for aid threw it at the Dragon s head with such force that he died then and there and the serpent opening a pair of wings flew into the lift and disappeared from before my eyes I sat down marvelling over that adventure but I was weary and drowsiness overcoming me I slept where I was for a while When I awoke I found a jet black damsel sitting at my feet shampooing them and by her side stood two black bitches my sisters O Commander of the Faithful I was ashamed before her FN three hundred twenty five and sitting up asked her O my sister who and what art thou and she answered How soon hast thou forgotten me I am she for whom thou wroughtest a good deed and sowedest the seed of gratitude and slewest her foe for I am the serpent whom by Allah s aidance thou didst just now deliver from the Dragon I am a Jinniyah and he was a Jinn who hated me and none saved my life from him save thou As soon as thou freedest me from him I flew on the wind to the ship whence thy sisters threw thee and removed all that was therein to thy house Then I ordered my attendant Marids to sink the ship and I transformed thy two sisters into these black bitches for I know all that hath passed between them and thee but as for the youth of a truth he is drowned So saying she flew up with me and the bitches and presently set us down on the terrace roof of my house wherein I found ready stored the whole of what property was in my ship nor was aught of it missing Now continued the serpent that was I swear by all engraver on the seal ring of Solomon FN three hundred twenty six with whom be peace unless thou deal to each of these bitches three hundred stripes every day I will come and imprison thee forever under the earth I answered Hearkening and obedience and away she flew But before going she again charged me saying I again swear by Him who made the two seas flow FN three hundred twenty seven and this be my second oath if thou gainsay me I will come and transform thee like thy sisters Since then I have never failed O Commander of the Faithful to beat them with that number of blows till their blood flows with my tears I pitying them the while and well they wot that their being scourged is no fault of mine and they accept my excuses And this is my tale and my history The Caliph marvelled at her adventures and then signed to Ja afar who said to the second lady the Portress And thou how camest thou by the welts and wheels upon thy body So she began the Tale of the Portress Know O Commander of the Faithful that I had a father who after fulfilling his time deceased and left me great store of wealth I remained single for a short time and presently married one of the richest of his day I abode with him a year when he also died and my share of his property amounted to eighty thousand diners in gold according to the holy law of inheritance FN three hundred twenty eight Thus I became passing rich an my reputation spread far and wide for I had made me ten changes of raiment each worth a thousand diners One day as I was sitting at home behold there came in to me an old woman FN three hundred twenty nine with lantern jaws and cheeks sucked in and eyes rucked up and eyebrows scant and scald and head bare and bald and teeth broken by time and mauled and back bending and neck nape nodding and face blotched and rheum running and hair like a snake black and white speckled in complexion a very fright even as saith the poet of the like of her Ill omened hag unshriven be her sins Nor mercy visit her on dying bed Thousand head strongest he mules would her guiles Despite their bolting lead with spider thread And as saith another A hag to whom th unlawful lawfullest And witchcraft wisdom in her sight are grown A mischief making brat a demon maid A whorish woman and a pimping crone FN three hundred thirty When the old woman entered she salamed to me and kissing the ground before me said I have at home an orphan daughter and this night are her wedding and her displaying FN three hundred thirty one We be poor folks and strangers in this city knowing none inhabitant and we are broken hearted So do thou earn for thyself a recompense and a reward in Heaven by being present at her displaying and when the ladies of this city shall hear that thou art to make act of presence they also will present themselves so shalt thou comfort her affliction for she is sore bruised in spirit and she hath none to look to save Allah the Most High Then she wept and kissed my feet reciting these couplets Thy presence bringeth us a grace We own before thy winsome face And wert thou absent ne er an one Could stand in stead or take thy place So pity get hold on me and compassion and I said Hearing is consenting and please Allah I will do somewhat more for her nor shall she be shown to her bridegroom save in my raiment and ornaments and jewelry At this the old woman rejoiced and bowed her head to my feet and kissed them saying Allah requite thee weal and comfort thy heart even as thou hast comforted mine But O my lady do not trouble thyself to do me this service at this hour be thou ready by supper time FN three hundred thirty two when I will come and fetch thee So saying she kissed my hand and went her ways I set about stringing my pearls and donning my brocades and making my toilette Little recking what Fortune had in womb for me when suddenly the old woman stood before me simpering and smiling till she showed every tooth stump and quoth she O my mistress the city madams have arrived and when I apprized them that thou promisedst to be present they were glad and they are now awaiting thee and looking eagerly for thy coming and for the honour of meeting thee So I threw on my mantilla and making the old crone walk before me and my handmaidens behind me I fared till we came to a street well watered and swept neat where the winnowing breeze blew cool and sweet Here we were stopped by a gate arched over with a dome of marble stone firmly seated on solidest foundation and leading to a Palace whose walls from earth rose tall and proud and whose pinnacle was crowned by the clouds FN three hundred thirty three and over the doorway were writ these couplets I am the wone where Mirth shall ever smile The home of Joyance through my lasting while And mid my court a fountain jets and flows Nor tears nor troubles shall that fount defile The merge with royal Nu uman s FN three hundred thirty four bloom is dight Myrtle Narcissus flower and Chamomile Arrived at the gate before which hung a black curtain the old woman knocked and it was opened to us when we entered and found a vestibule spread with carpets and hung around with lamps all alight and wax candles in candelabra adorned with pendants of precious gems and noble ores We passed on through this passage till we entered a saloon whose like for grandeur and beauty is not to be found in this world It was hung and carpeted with silken stuffs and was illuminated with branches sconces and tapers ranged in double row an avenue abutting on the upper or noble end of the saloon where stood a couch of juniper wood encrusted with pearls and gems and surmounted by a baldaquin with mosquito curtains of satin looped up with margaritas And hardly had we taken note of this when there came forth from the baldaquin a young lady and I looked O Commander of the Faithful upon a face and form more perfect than the moon when fullest with a favour brighter than the dawn gleaming with saffron hued light even as the poet sang when he said Thou pacest the palace a marvel sight A bride for a Kisra s or Kaisar s night Wantons the rose on thy roseate cheek O cheek as the blood of the dragon FN three hundred thirty five bright Slim waisted languorous sleepy eyed With charms which promise all love And the tire which attires thy tiara d brow Is a night of woe on a morn s glad light The fair young girl came down from the estrade and said to me Welcome and well come and good cheer to my sister the dearly beloved the illustrious and a thousand greetings Then she recited these couplets An but the house could know who cometh twould rejoice And kiss the very dust whereon thy foot was placed And with the tongue of circumstance the walls would say Welcome and hail to one with generous gifts engraced Then sat she down and said to me O my sister I have a brother who hath had sight of thee at sundry wedding feasts and festive seasons he is a youth handsomer than I and he hath fallen desperately in love with thee for that bounteous Destiny hath garnered in thee all beauty and perfection and he hath given silver to this old woman that she might visit thee and she hath contrived on this wise to foregather us twain He hath heard that thou art one of the nobles of thy tribe nor is he aught less in his and being desirous to ally his lot with thy lot he hath practiced this device to bring me in company with thee for he is fain to marry thee after the ordinance of Allah and his Apostle and in what is lawful and right there is no shame When I heard these words and saw myself fairly entrapped in the house I said Hearing is consenting She was delighted at this and clapped her hands FN three hundred thirty six whereupon a door opened and out of it came a young man blooming in the prime of life exquisitely dressed a model of beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace with gentle winning manners and eyebrows like a bended bow and shaft on cord and eyes which bewitched all hearts with sorcery lawful in the sight of the Lord even as saith some rhymer describing the like of him His face as the face of the young moon shines And Fortune stamps him with pearls for signs FN three hundred thirty seven And Allah favour him who said Blest be his beauty blest the Lord s decree Who cast and shaped a thing so bright of blee All gifts of beauty he conjoins in one Lost in his love is all humanity For Beauty s self inscribed on his brow I testify there be no Good but he FN three hundred thirty eight When I looked at him my heart inclined to him and I loved him and he sat by my side and talked with me a while when the young lady again clapped her hands and behold a side door opened and out of it came the Kazi with his four assessors as witnesses and they saluted us and sitting down drew up and wrote out the marriage contract between me and the youth and retired Then he turned to me and said Be our night blessed presently adding O my lady I have a condition to lay on thee Quoth I O my lord what is that Whereupon he arose and fetching a copy of the Holy Book presented it to me saying Swear hereon thou wilt never look at any other than myself nor incline thy body or thy heart to him I swore readily enough to this and he joyed with exceeding joy and embraced me round the neck while love for him possessed my whole heart Then they set the table FN three hundred thirty nine before us and we ate and drank till we were satisfied but I was dying for the coming of the night And when night did come he led me to the bride chamber and slept with me on the bed and continued to kiss and embrace me till the morning such a night I had never seen in my dreams I lived with him a life of happiness and delight for a full month at the end of which I asked his leave FN three hundred forty to go on foot to the bazar and buy me certain especial stuffs and he gave me permission So I donned my mantilla and taking with me the old woman and a slave girl FN three hundred forty one I went to the khan of the silk mercers where I seated myself in the shop front of a young merchant whom the old woman recommended saying to me This youth s father died when he was a boy and left him great store of wealth he hath by him a mighty fine FN three hundred forty two stock of goods and thou wilt find what thou seekest with him for none in the bazar hath better stuffs than he Then she said to him Show this lady the most costly stuffs thou hast by thee and he replied Hearkening and obedience Then she whispered me Say a civil word to him but I replied I am pledged to address no man save my lord And as she began to sound his praise I said sharply to her We want nought of thy sweet speeches our wish is to buy of him whatsoever we need and return home So he brought me all I sought and I offered him his money but he refused to take it saying Let it be a gift offered to my guest this day Then quoth I to the old woman If he will not take the money give him back his stuff By Allah cried he not a thing will I take from thee I sell it not for gold or for silver but I give it all as a gift for a single kiss a kiss more precious to me than everything the shop containeth Asked the old woman What will the kiss profit thee and turning to me whispered O my daughter thou hearest what this young fellow saith What harm will it do thee if he get a kiss from thee and thou gettest what thou seekest at that price Replied I I take refuge with Allah from such action Knowest thou not that I am bound by an oath FN three hundred forty three But she answered Now whist just let him kiss thee and neither speak to him nor lean over him so shalt thou keep thine oath and thy silver and no harm whatever shall befal thee And she ceased not to persuade me and importune me and make light of the matter till evil entered into my mind and I put my head in the poke FN three hundred forty four and declaring I would ne er consent consented So I veiled my eyes and held up the edge of my mantilla between me and the people passing and he put his mouth to my cheek under the veil But while kissing me he bit me so hard a bite that it tore the flesh from my cheek FN three hundred forty five and blood flowed fast and faintness came over me The old woman caught me in her arms and when I came to myself I found the shop shut up and her sorrowing over me and saying Thank Allah for averting what might have been worse Then she said to me Come take heart and let us go home before the matter become public and thou be dishonoured And when thou art safe inside the house feign sickness and lie down and cover thyself up and I will bring thee powders and plasters to cure this bite withal and thy wound will be healed at the latest in three days So after a while I arose and I was in extreme distress and terror came full upon me but I went on little by little till I reached the house when I pleaded illness and lay me down When it was night my husband came in to me and said What hath befallen thee O my darling in this excursion of thine and I replied I am not well my head acheth badly Then he lighted a candle and drew near me and looked hard at me and asked What is that wound I see on thy cheek and in the tenderest part too And I answered When I went out to day with thy leave to buy stuffs a camel laden with firewood jostled me and one of the pieces tore my veil and wounded my cheek as thou seest for indeed the ways of this city are strait Tomorrow cried he I will go complain to the Governor so shall he gibbet every fuel seller in Baghdad Allah upon thee said I burden not thy soul with such sin against any man The fact is I was riding on an ass and it stumbled throwing me to the ground and my cheek lighted upon a stick or a bit of glass and got this wound Then said he tomorrow I will go up to Ja afar the Barmaki and tell him the story so shall he kill every donkey boy in Baghdad Wouldst thou destroy all these men because of my wound said I when this which befel me was by decree of Allah and His destiny But he answered There is no help for it and springing to his feet plied me with words and pressed me till I was perplexed and frightened and I stuttered and stammered and my speech waxed thick and I said This is a mere accident by decree of Allah Then O Commander of the Faithful he guessed my case and said Thou hast been false to thine oath He at once cried out with a loud cry whereupon a door opened and in came seven black slaves whom he commanded to drag me from my bed and throw me down in the middle of the room Furthermore he ordered one of them to pinion my elbows and squat upon my head and a second to sit upon my knees and secure my feet and drawing his sword he gave it to a third and said Strike her O Sa ad and cut her in twain and let each one take half and cast it into the Tigris FN three hundred forty six that the fish may eat her for such is the retribution due to those who violate their vows and are unfaithful to their love And he redoubled in wrath and recited these couplets An there be one who shares with me her love I d strangle Love tho life by Love were slain Saying O Soul Death were the nobler choice For ill is Love when shared twixt partners twain Then he repeated to the slave Smite her O Sa ad And when the slave who was sitting upon me made sure of the command he bent down to me and said O my mistress repeat the profession of Faith and bethink thee if there be any thing thou wouldst have done for verily this is the last hour of thy life O good slave said I wait but a little while and get off my head that I may charge thee with my last injunctions Then I raised my head and saw the state I was in how I had fallen from high degree into lowest disgrace and into death after life and such life and how I had brought my punishment on myself by my own sin where upon the tears streamed from mine eyes and I wept with exceed ing weeping But he looked on me with eyes of wrath and began repeating Tell her who turneth from our love to work it injury sore And taketh her a fine new love the old love tossing o er We cry enough o thee ere thou enough of us shalt cry What past between us cloth suffice and haply something more FN three hundred forty seven When I heard this O Commander of the Faithful I wept and looked at him and began repeating these couplets To severance you doom my love and all unmoved remain My tear sore lids you sleepless make and sleep while I complain You make firm friendship reign between mine eyes and insomny Yet can my heart forget you not nor tears can I restrain You made me swear with many an oath my troth to hold for aye But when you reigned my bosom s lord you wrought me traitor bane I loved you like a silly child who wots not what is Love Then spare the learner let her not be by the master slain By Allah s name I pray you write when I am dead and gone Upon my tomb This died of Love whose senses Love had ta en Then haply one shall pass that way who fire of Love hath felt And treading on a lover s heart with ruth and woe shall melt When I ended my verses tears came again but the poetry and the weeping only added fury to his fury and he recited Twas not satiety bade me leave the dearling of my soul But that she sinned a mortal sin which clips me in its clip She sought to let another share the love between us twain But my True Faith of Unity refuseth partnership FN three hundred forty eight When he ceased reciting I wept again and prayed his pardon and humbled myself before him and spoke him softly saying to myself I will work on him with words so haply he will refrain from slaying me even though he take all I have So I complained of my sufferings and began to repeat these couplets Now by thy life and wert thou just my life thou hadst not ta en But who can break the severance law which parteth lovers twain Thou loadest me with heavy weight of longing love when I Can hardly bear my chemisette for weakness and for pain I marvel not to see my life and soul in ruin lain I marvel much to see my frame such severance pangs sustain When I ended my verse I wept again and he looked at me and reviled me in abusive language FN three hundred forty nine repeating these couplets Thou wast all taken up with love of other man not me Twas thine to show me severance face twas only mine to see I ll leave thee for that first thou wert of me to take thy leave And patient bear that parting blow thou borest so patiently E en as thou soughtest other love so other love I ll seek And make the crime of murdering love thine own atrocity When he had ended his verses he again cried out to the slave Cut her in half and free us from her for we have no profit of her So the slave drew near me O Commander of the Faithful and I ceased bandying verses and made sure of death and despairing of life committed my affairs to Almighty Allah when behold the old woman rushed in and threw herself at my husband s feet and kissed them and wept and said O my son by the rights of my fosterage and by my long service to thee I conjure thee pardon this young lady for indeed she hath done nothing deserving such doom Thou art a very young man and I fear lest her death be laid at thy door for it is said Whoso slayeth shall be slain As for this wanton since thou deemest her such drive her out from thy doors from thy love and from thy heart And she ceased not to weep and importune him till he relented and said I pardon her but needs must I set on her my mark which shall show upon her all my life Then he bade the slaves drag me along the ground and lay me out at full length after stripping me of all my clothes FN three hundred fifty and when the slaves had so sat upon me that I could not move he fetched in a rod of quince tree and came down with it upon my body and continued beating me on the back and sides till I lost consciousness from excess of pain and I despaired of life Then he commanded the slaves to take me away as soon as it was dark together with the old woman to show them the way and throw me upon the floor of the house wherein I dwelt before my marriage They did their lord s bidding and cast me down in my old home and went their ways I did not revive from my swoon till dawn appeared when I applied myself to the dressing of my wounds with ointments and other medicaments and I medicined myself but my sides and ribs still showed signs of the rod as thou hast seen I lay in weakly case and confined to my bed for four months before I was able to rise and health returned to me At the end of that time I went to the house where all this had happened and found it a ruin the street had been pulled down endlong and rubbish heaps rose where the building erst was nor could I learn how this had come about Then I betook myself to this my sister on my father s side and found her with these two black bitches I saluted her and told her what had betided me and the whole of my story and she said O my sister who is safe from the despite of Time and secure Thanks be to Allah who has brought thee off safely and she began to say Such is the World so bear a patient heart When riches leave thee and when friends depart Then she told me her own story and what had happened to her with her two sisters and how matters had ended so we abode together and the subject of marriage was never on our tongues for all these years After a while we were joined by our other sister the procuratrix who goeth out every morning and buyeth all we require for the day and night and we continued in such condition till this last night In the morning our sister went out as usual to make her market and then befel us what befel from bringing the Porter into the house and admitting these three Kalandar men We entreated them kindly and honourably and a quarter of the night had not passed ere three grave and respectable merchants from Mosul joined us and told us their adventures We sat talking with them but on one condition which they violated whereupon we treated them as sorted with their breach of promise and made them repeat the account they had given of themselves They did our bidding and we forgave their offence so they departed from us and this morning we were unexpectedly summoned to thy presence And such is our story The Caliph wondered at her words and bade the tale be recorded and chronicled and laid up in his muniment chambers And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Nineteenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph commanded this story and those of the sister and the Kalandars to be recorded in the archives and be set in the royal muniment chambers Then he asked the eldest lady the mistress of the house Knowest thou the whereabouts of the Ifritah who spelled thy sisters and she answered O Commander of the Faithful she gave me a ringlet of her hair saying Whenas thou wouldest see me burn a couple of these hairs and I will be with thee forthright even though I were beyond Caucasus mountain Quoth the Caliph Bring me hither the hair So she brought it and he threw the whole lock upon the fire As soon as the odour of the burning hair dispread itself the palace shook and trembled and all present heard a rumbling and rolling of thunder and a noise as of wings and lo the Jinniyah who had been a serpent stood in the Caliph s presence Now she was a Moslemah so she saluted him and said Peace be with thee O Vicar FN three hundred fifty one of Allah whereto he replied And with thee also be peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessing Then she continued Know that this damsel sowed for me the seed of kindness wherefor I cannot enough requite her in that she delivered me from death and destroyed mine enemy Now I had seen how her sisters dealt with her and felt myself bound to avenge her on them At first I was minded to slay them but I feared it would be grievous to her so I transformed them to bitches but if thou desire their release O Commander of the Faithful I will release them to pleasure thee and her for I am of the Moslems Quoth the Caliph Release them and after we will look into the affair of the beaten lady and consider her case carefully and if the truth of her story be evidenced I will exact retaliation FN three hundred fifty two from him who wronged her Said the Ifritah O Commander of the Faithful I will forthwith release them and will discover to thee the man who did that deed by this lady and wronged her and took her property and he is the nearest of all men to thee So saying she took a cup of water and muttered a spell over it and uttered words there was no understanding then she sprinkled some of the water over the faces of the two bitches saying Return to your former human shape whereupon they were restored to their natural forms and fell to praising their Creator Then said the Ifritah O Commander of the Faithful of a truth he who scourged this lady with rods is thy son Al Amin brother of Al Maamun FN three hundred fifty three for he had heard of her beauty and love liness and he played a lover s stratagem with her and married her according to the law and committed the crime such as it is of scourging her Yet indeed he is not to be blamed for beating her for he laid a condition on her and swore her by a solemn oath not to do a certain thing however she was false to her vow and he was minded to put her to death but he feared Almighty Allah and contented himself with scourging her as thou hast seen and with sending her back to her own place Such is the story of the second lady and the Lord knoweth all When the Caliph heard these words of the Ifritah and knew who had beaten the damsel he marvelled with mighty marvel and said Praise be to Allah the Most High the Almighty who hath shown his exceeding mercy towards me enabling me to deliver these two damsels from sorcery and torture and vouchsafing to let me know the secret of this lady s history And now by Allah we will do a deed which shall be recorded of us after we are no more Then he summoned his son Al Amin and questioned him of the story of the second lady the portress and he told it in the face of truth whereupon the Caliph bade call into presence the Kazis and their witnesses and the three Kalandars and the first lady with her sisters german who had been ensorcelled and he married the three to the three Kalandars whom he knew to be princes and sons of Kings and he appointed them chamberlains about his person assigning to them stipends and allowances and all that they required and lodging them in his palace at Baghdad He returned the beaten lady to his son Al Amin renewing the marriage contract between them and gave her great wealth and bade rebuild the house fairer than it was before As for himself he took to wife the procuratrix and lay with her that night and next day he set apart for her an apartment in his Serraglio with handmaidens for her service and a fixed daily allowance And the people marvelled at their Caliph s generosity and natural beneficence and princely widsom nor did he forget to send all these histories to be recorded in his annals When Shahrazad ceased speaking Dunyazad exclaimed O my own sister by Allah in very sooth this is a right pleasant tale and a delectable never was heard the like of it but prithee tell me now another story to while away what yet remaineth of the waking hours of this our night She replied With love and gladness if the King give me leave and he said Tell thy tale and tell it quickly So she began in these words THE TALE OF THE THREE APPLES They relate O King of the age and lord of the time and of these days that the Caliph Harun al Rashid summoned his Wazir Ja afar one night and said to him I desire to go down into the city and question the common folk concerning the conduct of those charged with its governance and those of whom they complain we will depose from office and those whom they commend we will promote Quoth Ja afar Hearkening and obedience So the Caliph went down with Ja afar and Eunuch Masrur to the town and walked about the streets and markets and as they were threading a narrow alley they came upon a very old man with a fishing net and crate to carry small fish on his head and in his hand a staff and as he walked at a leisurely pace he repeated these lines They say me Thou shinest a light to mankind With thy lore as the night which the Moon doth uplight I answer A truce to your jests and your gibes Without luck what is learning a poor devil wight If they take me to pawn with my lore in my pouch With my volumes to read and my ink case to write For one day s provision they never could pledge me As likely on Doomsday to draw bill at sight How poorly indeed doth it fare wi the poor With his pauper existence and beggarly plight In summer he faileth provision to find In winter the fire pot s his only delight The street dogs with bite and with bark to him rise And each losel receives him with bark and with bite If he lift up his voice and complain of his wrong None pities or heeds him however he s right And when sorrows and evils like these he must brave His happiest homestead were down in the grave When the Caliph heard his verses he said to Ja afar See this poor man and note his verses for surely they point to his necessities Then he accosted him and asked O Shaykh what be thine occupation and the poor man answered O my lord I am a fisherman with a family to keep and I have been out between mid day and this time and not a thing hath Allah made my portion wherewithal to feed my family I cannot even pawn myself to buy them a supper and I hate and disgust my life and I hanker after death Quoth the Caliph Say me wilt thou return with us to Tigris bank and cast thy net on my luck and whatsoever turneth up I will buy of thee for an hundred gold pieces The man rejoiced when he heard these words and said On my head be it I will go back with you and returning with them river wards made a cast and waited a while then he hauled in the rope and dragged the net ashore and there appeared in it a chest padlocked and heavy The Caliph examined it and lifted it finding it weighty so he gave the fisherman two hundred dinars and sent him about his business whilst Masrur aided by the Caliph carried the chest to the palace and set it down and lighted the candles Ja afar and Masrur then broke it open and found therein a basket of palm leaves corded with red worsted This they cut open and saw within it a piece of carpet which they lifted out and under it was a woman s mantilla folded in four which they pulled out and at the bottom of the chest they came upon a young lady fair as a silver ingot slain and cut into nineteen pieces When the Caliph looked upon her he cried Alas and tears ran down his cheeks and turning to Ja afar he said O dog of Wazirs FN three hundred fifty four shall folk be murdered in our reign and be cast into the river to be a burden and a responsibility for us on the Day of Doom By Allah we must avenge this woman on her murderer and he shall be made die the worst of deaths And presently he added Now as surely as we are descended from the Sons of Abbas FN three hundred fifty five if thou bring us not him who slew her that we do her justice on him I will hang thee at the gate of my palace thee and forty of thy kith and kin by thy side And the Caliph was wroth with exceeding rage Quoth Ja afar Grant me three days delay and quoth the Caliph We grant thee this So Ja afar went out from before him and returned to his own house full of sorrow and saying to himself How shall I find him who murdered this damsel that I may bring him before the Caliph If I bring other than the murderer it will be laid to my charge by the Lord in very sooth I wot not what to do He kept his house three days and on the fourth day the Caliph sent one of the Chamberlains for him and as he came into the presence asked him Where is the murderer of the damsel to which answered Ja afar O Commander of the Faithful am I inspector of murdered folk that I should ken who killed her The Caliph was furious at his answer and bade hang him before the palace gate and commanded that a crier cry through the streets of Baghdad Whoso would see the hanging of Ja afar the Barmaki Wazir of the Caliph with forty of the Barmecides FN three hundred fifty six his cousins and kinsmen before the palace gate let him come and let him look The people flocked out from all the quarters of the city to witness the execution of Ja afar and his kinsmen not knowing the cause Then they set up the gallows and made Ja afar and the others stand underneath in readiness for execution but whilst every eye was looking for the Caliph s signal and the crowd wept for Ja afar and his cousins of the Barmecides lo and behold a young man fair of face and neat of dress and of favour like the moon raining light with eyes black and bright and brow flower white and cheeks red as rose and young down where the beard grows and a mole like a grain of ambergris pushed his way through the people till he stood immediately before the Wazir and said to him Safety to thee from this strait O Prince of the Emirs and Asylum of the poor I am the man who slew the woman ye found in the chest so hang me for her and do her justice on me When Ja afar heard the youth s confession he rejoiced at his own deliverance but grieved and sorrowed for the fair youth and whilst they were yet talking behold another man well stricken in years pressed forwards through the people and thrust his way amid the populace till he came to Ja afar and the youth whom he saluted saying Ho thou the Wazir and Prince sans peer believe not the words of this youth Of a surety none murdered the damsel but I take her wreak on me this moment for an thou do not thus I will require it of thee before Almighty Allah Then quoth the young man O Wazir this is an old man in his dotage who wotteth not whatso he saith ever and I am he who murdered her so do thou avenge her on me Quoth the old man O my son thou art young and desirest the joys of the world and I am old and weary and surfeited with the world I will offer my life as a ransom for thee and for the Wazir and his cousins No one murdered the damsel but I so Allah upon thee make haste to hang me for no life is left in me now that hers is gone The Wazir marvelled much at all this strangeness and taking the young man and the old man carried them before the Caliph where after kissing the ground seven times between his hands he said O Commander of the Faithful I bring thee the murderer of the damsel Where is he asked the Caliph and Ja afar answered This young man saith I am the murderer and this old man giving him the lie saith I am the murderer and behold here are the twain standing before thee The Caliph looked at the old man and the young man and asked Which of you killed the girl The young man replied No one slew her save I and the old man answered Indeed none killed her but myself Then said the Caliph to Ja afar Take the twain and hang them both but Ja afar rejoined Since one of them was the murderer to hang the other were mere injustice FN three hundred fifty seven By Him who raised the firmament and dispread the earth like a carpet cried the youth I am he who slew the damsel and he went on to describe the manner of her murder and the basket the mantilla and the bit of carpet in fact all that the Caliph had found upon her So the Caliph was certified that the young man was the murderer whereat he wondered and asked him What was the cause of thy wrongfully doing this damsel to die and what made thee confess the murder without the bastinado and what brought thee here to yield up thy life and what made thee say Do her wreak upon me The youth answered Know O Commander of the Faithful that this woman was my wife and the mother of my children also my first cousin and the daughter of my paternal uncle this old man who is my father s own brother When I married her she was a maid FN three hundred fifty eight and Allah blessed me with three male children by her she loved me and served me and I saw no evil in her for I also loved her with fondest love Now on the first day of this month she fell ill with grievous sickness and I fetched in physicians to her but recovery came to her little by little and when I wished her to go to the Hammam bath she said There is a something I long for before I go to the bath and I long for it with an exceeding longing To hear is to comply said I And what is it Quoth she I have a queasy craving for an apple to smell it and bite a bit of it I replied Hadst thou a thousand longings I would try to satisfy them So I went on the instant into the city and sought for apples but could find none yet had they cost a gold piece each would I have bought them I was vexed at this and went home and said O daughter of my uncle by Allah I can find none She was distressed being yet very weakly and her weakness in creased greatly on her that night and I felt anxious and alarmed on her account As soon as morning dawned I went out again and made the round of the gardens one by one but found no apples anywhere At last there met me an old gardener of whom I asked about them and he answered O my son this fruit is a rarity with us and is not now to be found save in the garden of the Commander of the Faithful at Bassorah where the gardener keepeth it for the Caliph s eating I returned to my house troubled by my ill success and my love for my wife and my affection moved me to undertake the journey So I gat me ready and set out and travelled fifteen days and nights going and coming and brought her three apples which I bought from the gardener for three dinars But when I went in to my wife and set them before her she took no pleasure in them and let them lie by her side for her weakness and fever had increased on her and her malady lasted without abating ten days after which time she began to recover health So I left my house and betaking me to my shop sat there buying and selling and about midday behold a great ugly black slave long as a lance and broad as a bench passed by my shop holding in hand one of the three apples wherewith he was playing Quoth I O my good slave tell me whence thou tookest that apple that I may get the like of it He laughed and answered I got it from my mistress for I had been absent and on my return I found her lying ill with three apples by her side and she said to me My horned wittol of a husband made a journey for them to Bassorah and bought them for three dinars So I ate and drank with her and took this one from her FN three hundred fifty nine When I heard such words from the slave O Commander of the Faithful the world grew black before my face and I arose and locked up my shop and went home beside myself for excess of rage I looked for the apples and finding only two of the three asked my wife O my cousin where is the third apple and raising her head languidly she answered I wet not O son of my uncle where tis gone This convinced me that the slave had spoken the truth so I took a knife and coming behind her got upon her breast without a word said and cut her throat Then I hewed off her head and her limbs in pieces and wrapping her in her mantilla and a rag of carpet hurriedly sewed up the whole which I set in a chest and locking it tight loaded it on my he mule and threw it into the Tigris with my own hands So Allah upon thee O Commander of the Faithful make haste to hang me as I fear lest she appeal for vengeance on Resurrection Day For when I had thrown her into the river and none knew aught of it as I went back home I found my eldest son crying and yet he knew naught of what I had done with his mother I asked him What hath made thee weep my boy and he answered I took one of the three apples which were by my mammy and went down into the lane to play with my brethren when behold a big long black slave snatched it from my hand and said Whence hadst thou this Quoth I My father travelled far for it and brought it from Bassorah for my mother who was ill and two other apples for which he paid three ducats He took no heed of my words and I asked for the apple a second and a third time but he cuffed me and kicked me and went off with it I was afraid lest my mother should swinge me on account of the apple so for fear of her I went with my brother outside the city and stayed there till evening closed in upon us and indeed I am in fear of her and now by Allah O my father say nothing to her of this or it may add to her ailment When I heard what my child said I knew that the slave was he who had foully slandered my wife the daughter of my uncle and was certified that I had slain her wrong fully So I wept with exceeding weeping and presently this old man my paternal uncle and her father came in and I told him what had happened and he sat down by my side and wept and we ceased not weeping till midnight We have kept up mourning for her these last five days and we lamented her in the deepest sorrow for that she was unjustly done to die This came from the gratuitous lying of the slave the blackamoor and this was the manner of my killing her so I conjure thee by the honour of thine ancestors make haste to kill me and do her justice upon me as there is no living for me after her The Caliph marvelled at his words and said By Allah the young man is excusable I will hang none but the accursed slave and I will do a deed which shall comfort the ill at ease and suffering and which shall please the All glorious King And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Twentieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph swore he would hang none but the slave for the youth was excusable Then he turned to Ja afar and said to him Bring before me this accursed slave who was the sole cause of this calamity and if thou bring him not before me within three days thou shalt be slain in his stead So Ja afar fared forth weeping and saying Two deaths have already beset me nor shall the crock come of safe from every shock FN three hundred sixty In this matter craft and cunning are of no avail but He who preserved my life the first time can preserve it a second time By Allah I will not leave my house during the three days of life which remain to me and let the Truth whose perfection be praised do e en as He will So he kept his house three days and on the fourth day he summoned the Kazis and legal witnesses and made his last will and testament and took leave of his children weeping Presently in came a messenger from the Caliph and said to him The Commander of the Faithful is in the most violent rage that can be and he sendeth to seek thee and he sweareth that the day shall certainly not pass without thy being hanged unless the slave be forth coming When Ja afar heard this he wept and his children and slaves and all who were in the house wept with him After he had bidden adieu to everybody except his youngest daughter he proceeded to farewell her for he loved this wee one who was a beautiful child more than all his other children and he pressed her to his breast and kissed her and wept bitterly at parting from her when he felt something round inside the bosom of her dress and asked her O my little maid what is in thy bosom pocket O my father she replied it is an apple with the name of our Lord the Caliph written upon it Rayhan our slave brought it to me four days ago and would not let me have it till I gave him two dinars for it When Ja afar heard speak of the slave and the apple he was glad and put his hand into his child s pocket FN three hundred sixty one and drew out the apple and knew it and rejoiced saying O ready Dispeller of trouble FN three hundred sixty two Then he bade them bring the slave and said to him Fie upon thee Rayhan whence haddest thou this apple By Allah O my master he replied though a lie may get a man once off yet may truth get him off and well off again and again I did not steal this apple from thy palace nor from the gardens of the Commander of the Faithful The fact is that five days ago as I was walking along one of the alleys of this city I saw some little ones at play and this apple in hand of one of them So I snatched it from him and beat him and he cried and said O youth this apple is my mother s and she is ill She told my father how she longed for an apple so he travelled to Bassorah and bought her three apples for three gold pieces and I took one of them to play withal He wept again but I paid no heed to what he said and carried it off and brought it here and my little lady bought it of me for two dinars of gold And this is the whole story When Ja afar heard his words he marvelled that the murder of the damsel and all this misery should have been caused by his slave he grieved for the relation of the slave to himself while rejoicing over his own deliverance and he repeated these lines If ill betide thee through thy slave Make him forthright thy sacrifice A many serviles thou shalt find But life comes once and never twice Then he took the slave s hand and leading him to the Caliph related the story from first to last and the Caliph marvelled with extreme astonishment and laughed till he fell on his back and ordered that the story be recorded and be made public amongst the people But Ja afar said Marvel not O Commander of the Faithful at this adventure for it is not more wondrous than the History of the Wazir Nur al Din Ali of Egypt and his brother Shams al Din Mohammed Quoth the Caliph Out with it but what can be stranger than this story And Ja afar answered O Commander of the Faithful I will not tell it thee save on condition that thou pardon my slave and the Caliph rejoined If it be indeed more wondrous than that of the three apples I grant thee his blood and if not I will surely slay thy slave So Ja afar began in these words the TALE OF NUR AL DIN AND HIS SON Know O Commander of the Faithful that in times of yore the land of Egypt was ruled by a Sultan endowed with justice and generosity one who loved the pious poor and companied with the Olema and learned men and he had a Wazir a wise and an experienced well versed in affairs and in the art of government This Minister who was a very old man had two sons as they were two moons never man saw the like of them for beauty and grace the elder called Shams al Din Mohammed and the younger Nur al Din Ali but the younger excelled the elder in seemliness and pleasing semblance so that folk heard his fame in far countries and men flocked to Egypt for the purpose of seeing him In course of time their father the Wazir died and was deeply regretted and mourned by the Sultan who sent for his two sons and investing them with dresses of honour FN three hundred sixty three said to them Let not your hearts be troubled for ye shall stand in your father s stead and be joint Ministers of Egypt At this they rejoiced and kissed the ground before him and performed the ceremonial mourning FN three hundred sixty four for their father during a full month after which time they entered upon the Wazirate and the power passed into their hands as it had been in the hands of their father each doing duty for a week at a time They lived under the same roof and their word was one and whenever the Sultan desired to travel they took it by turns to be in attendance on him It fortuned one night that the Sultan purposed setting out on a journey next morning and the elder whose turn it was to accompany him was sitting conversing with his brother and said to him O my brother it is my wish that we both marry I and thou two sisters and go in to our wives on one and the same night Do O my brother as thou desirest the younger replied for right is thy recking and surely I will comply with thee in whatso thou sayest So they agreed upon this and quoth Shams al Din If Allah decree that we marry two damsels and go in to them on the same night and they shall conceive on their bridenights and bear children to us on the same day and by Allah s will they wife bear thee a son and my wife bear me a daughter let us wed them either to other for they will be cousins Quoth Nur al Din O my brother Shams al Din what dower FN three hundred sixty five wilt thou require from my son for thy daughter Quoth Shams al Din I will take three thousand dinars and three pleasure gardens and three farms and it would not be seemly that the youth make contract for less than this When Nur al Din heard such demand he said What manner of dower is this thou wouldst impose upon my son Wottest thou not that we are brothers and both by Allah s grace Wazirs and equal in office It behoveth thee to offer thy daughter to my son without marriage settlement or if one need be it should represent a mere nominal value by way of show to the world for thou knowest that the masculine is worthier than the feminine and my son is a male and our memory will be preserved by him not by thy daughter But what said Shams al Din is she to have and Nur al Din continued Through her we shall not be remembered among the Emirs of the earth but I see thou wouldest do with me according to the saying An thou wouldst bluff off a buyer ask him high price and higher or as did a man who they say went to a friend and asked something of him being in necessity and was answered Bismallah FN three hundred sixty six in the name of Allah I will do all what thou requirest but come to morrow Whereupon the other replied in this verse When he who is asked a favour saith To morrow The wise man wots tis vain to beg or borrow Quoth Shams al Din Basta FN three hundred sixty seven I see thee fail in respect to me by making thy son of more account than my daughter and tis plain that thine understanding is of the meanest and that thou lackest manners Thou remindest me of thy partnership in the Wazirate when I admitted thee to share with me only in pity for thee and not wishing to mortify thee and that thou mightest help me as a manner of assistant But since thou talkest on this wise by Allah I will never marry my daughter to thy son no not for her weight in gold When Nur al Din heard his brother s words he waxed wroth and said And I too I will never never marry my son to thy daughter no not to keep from my lips the cup of death Shams al Din replied I would not accept him as a husband for her and he is not worth a paring of her nail Were I not about to travel I would make an example of thee however when I return thou shalt see and I will show thee how I can assert my dignity and vindicate my honour But Allah doeth whatso He willeth FN three hundred sixty eight When Nur al Din heard this speech from his brother he was filled with fury and lost his wits for rage but he hid what he felt and held his peace and each of the brothers passed the night in a place far apart wild with wrath against the other As soon as morning dawned the Sultan fared forth in state and crossed over from Cairo FN three hundred sixty nine to Jizah FN three hundred seventy and made for the pyramids accompanied by the Wazir Shams al Din whose turn of duty it was whilst his brother Nur al din who passed the night in sore rage rose with the light and prayed the dawn prayer Then he betook himself to his treasury and taking a small pair of saddle bags filled them with gold and he called to mind his brother s threats and the contempt wherewith he had treated him and he repeated these couplets Travel and thou shalt find new friends for old ones left behind Toil for the sweets of human life by toil and moil are found The stay at home no honour wins nor aught attains but want So leave thy place of birth FN three hundred seventy one and wander all the world around I ve seen and very oft I ve seen how standing water stinks And only flowing sweetens it and trotting makes it sound And were the moon forever full and ne er to wax or wane Man would not strain his watchful eyes to see its gladsome round Except the lion leave his lair he ne er would fell his game Except the arrow leave the bow ne er had it reached its bound Gold dust is dust the while it lies untravelled in the mine And aloes wood mere fuel is upon its native ground And gold shall win his highest worth when from his goal ungoal d And aloes sent to foreign parts grows costlier than gold When he ended his verse he bade one of his pages saddle him his Nubian mare mule with her padded selle Now she was a dapple grey FN three hundred seventy two with ears like reed pens and legs like columns and a back high and strong as a dome builded on pillars her saddle was of gold cloth and her stirrups of Indian steel and her housing of Ispahan velvet she had trappings which would serve the Chosroes and she was like a bride adorned for her wedding night Moreover he bade lay on her back a piece of silk for a seat and a prayer carpet under which were his saddle bags When this was done he said to his pages and slaves I purpose going forth a pleasuring outside the city on the road to Kalyub town FN three hundred seventy three and I shall lie three nights abroad so let none of you follow me for there is something straiteneth my breast Then he mounted the mule in haste and taking with him some provaunt for the way set out from Cairo and faced the open and uncultivated country lying around it FN three hundred seventy four About noontide he entered Bilbays city FN three hundred seventy five where he dismounted and stayed awhile to rest himself and his mule and ate some of his victual He bought at Bilbays all he wanted for himself and forage for his mule and then fared on the way of the waste Towards night fall he entered a town called Sa adiyah FN three hundred seventy six where he alighted and took out somewhat of his viaticum and ate then he spread his strip of silk on the sand and set the saddle bags under his head and slept in the open air for he was still overcome with anger When morning dawned he mounted and rode onward till he reached the Holy City FN three hundred seventy seven Jerusalem and thence he made Aleppo where he dismounted at one of the caravanserais and abode three days to rest himself and the mule and to smell the air FN three hundred seventy eight Then being determined to travel afar and Allah having written safety in his fate he set out again wending without wotting whither he was going and having fallen in with certain couriers he stinted not travelling till he had reached Bassorah city albeit he knew not what the place was 
2068-146217-0000	train-other-500	It was dark night when he alighted at the Khan so he spread out his prayer carpet and took down the saddle bags from the back of his mule and gave her with her furniture in charge of the door keeper that he might walk her about
2068-146217-0001	train-other-500	The man took her and did as he was bid Now it so happened that the Wazir of Bassorah a man shot in years was sitting at the lattice window of his palace opposite the Khan and
2068-146217-0002	train-other-500	he saw the porter walking the mule up and down He was struck by her trappings of price and
none	none	 thought her a nice beast fit for the riding of Wazirs or even of royalties and the more he looked the more was he perplexed 
2068-146217-0003	train-other-500	till at last he said to one of his pages Bring hither yon door keeper The page went and returned to the Wazir with the porter who kissed the ground between his hands and the Minister asked him Who is the owner of yonder mule
none	none	 and what manner of man is he and he answered O my lord the owner of this mule is a comely young man of pleasant manners withal grave and dignified and doubtless one of the sons of the merchants When the Wazir heard the door keeper s words he arose forthright and mounting his horse rode to the Khan FN three hundred seventy nine and went in to Nur al Din who seeing the minister making towards him rose to his feet and advanced to meet him and saluted him The Wazir welcomed him to Bassorah 
2068-146217-0004	train-other-500	and dis mounting embraced him and made him sit down by his side and said O my son
none	none	 whence comest thou and what dost thou seek 
2068-146217-0005	train-other-500	O my lord Nur al Din replied
none	none	 I have come from Cairo city of which my father was whilome Wazir 
2068-146217-0006	train-other-500	but he hath been removed to the grace of Allah and he informed him of all that had befallen him from beginning to end adding I am resolved never to return home before I have seen all the cities and countries of the world
2068-146217-0007	train-other-500	When the Wazir heard this he said to him O my son hearken not to the voice of passion lest it cast thee into the pit for
none	none	 indeed many regions be waste places 
2068-146217-0008	train-other-500	and I fear for thee the turns of Time Then he let load the saddle bags
none	none	 and the silk and prayer carpets on the mule 
2068-146217-0009	train-other-500	and carried Nur al Din to his own house
none	none	 where 
2068-146217-0010	train-other-500	he lodged him in a pleasant place and entreated him honourably and made much of him
none	none	 for he inclined to love him with exceeding love After a while 
2068-146217-0011	train-other-500	he said to him O my son here am I left a man in years and have no male children but Allah hath blessed me with a daughter
none	none	 who eventh thee in beauty 
2068-146217-0012	train-other-500	and I have rejected all her many suitors men of rank and substance But affection for thee hath entered into my heart say me then wilt thou be to her a husband If thou accept this
none	none	 I will go up with thee to the Sultan of Bassorah FN three hundred eighty and will tell him that

none	none	 is one day with thee 
2068-146217-0058	train-other-500	and another day against thee and all worldly goods are but a loan to be repaid And I have heard a poet say Take thought nor hast to win the thing thou wilt Have ruth on man

2068-146217-0059	train-other-500	No tyrant but shall rue worse tyrant s ire The THIRD BEHEST is Learn to be silent in society and let thine own faults distract thine attention from the faults of other men for

2068-146217-0062	train-other-500	But friends to lack of wealth no friendship render On this wise Nur al Din ceased not to counsel his son Badr al Din Hasan till his hour came and sighing one sobbing sigh his life went forth
2068-146217-0063	train-other-500	Then the voice of mourning and keening rose high in his house and the Sultan and all the grandees grieved for him and buried him but his son ceased not lamenting his loss for two months during which
2068-146217-0064	train-other-500	he never mounted horse nor attended the Divan
none	none	 nor presented himself before the Sultan At last the King being wroth with him stablished in his stead one of the Chamberlains and made him Wazir giving orders to seize and set seals on all Nur al Din s houses and goods and domains So the new Wazir went forth with a mighty posse of Chamberlains and people of the Divan and watchmen and a host of idlers to do this and to seize Badr al Din Hasan and carry him before the King who would deal with him as he deemed fit Now there was among the crowd of followers a Mameluke of the deceased Wazir who when he heard this order urged his horse and rode at full speed to the house of Badr al Din Hasan for he cold not endure to see the ruin of his old master s son He found him sitting at the gate with head hung down and sorrowing as was his wont for the loss of his father so he dismounted and kissing his hand said to him O my lord and son of my lord haste ere ruin come and lay waste When Hasan heard this he trembled and asked 
2068-146217-0065	train-other-500	What may be the matter and the man answered The Sultan is angered with thee and hath issued a warrant against thee and evil cometh hard upon my track so flee with thy life At these words

2068-146217-0067	train-other-500	O my lord up at once and save thyself and leave this house while it is yet time And he quoted these lines Escape with thy life if oppression betide thee And let the house of its builder s fate

2068-146217-0070	train-other-500	and take him before the presence that he may put him to death and all cried Alas for his beauty and his loveliness When he heard this he fled forth at hazard knowing not whither he was going and gave not over hurrying onwards till
2068-146217-0071	train-other-500	Destiny drove him to his father s tomb So he entered the cemetery and threading his way through the graves

none	none	 I read signs of trouble in thy face I was sleeping within this very hour answered Hasan when my father appeared to me and chid me for not having visited his tomb so I awoke trembling and came hither forthright lest the day should go by without my visiting him which would have been grievous to me O my lord rejoined the Jew FN three hundred ninety eight thy father had many merchantmen at sea and as some of them are now due it is my wish to buy of thee the cargo of the first ship that cometh into port with this thousand dinars of gold I consent quoth Hasan whereupon the Jew took out a bag of gold and counted out a thousand sequins which he gave to Hasan the son of the Wazir saying Write me a letter of sale and seal it So Hasan took a pen and paper and wrote these words in duplicate The writer Hasan Badr al Din son of Wazir Nur al Din hath to Isaac the Jew all the cargo of the first of his father s ships which cometh into port for a thousand dinars and he hath received the price in advance And after he had taken one copy the Jew put it into his pouch and went away but Hasan fell a weeping as he thought of the dignity and prosperity which had erst been his and he began reciting This house my lady since you left is now a home no more For me not neighbours since you left prove kind and neighbourly The friend whilere I took to heart alas no more to me 
2068-146217-0073	train-other-500	Is friend and even Luna s self displayeth lunacy You left and by your going left the world a waste a wolf And lies a gloomy murk upon the face of hill and lea

the Jinniyah how the King had caused the wedding contract to be drawn up between the hunchbacked groom and the lovely young lady who was heart broken for sorrow and how she was the fairest of created things and even more beautiful than this youth the Jinniyah cried at him Thou liest this youth is handsomer than any one of his day The Ifrit gave her the lie again adding By Allah O my sister the

that he was no longer at his father s tomb in Bassorah city he looked right and left and saw that he was in a strange place and he would have cried out but the Ifrit gave him a cuff which persuaded him to keep silence Then he brought him rich raiment and clothed him therein and giving him a lighted flambeau said Know that I have brought thee hither meaning to do thee a good turn for the love of Allah so take this torch and mingle with the people at the Hammam door and walk on with them without stopping till thou reach the house of the wedding festival then go boldly forward and enter the great saloon and fear none but take thy stand at the right hand of the Hunchback bridegroom and as often as any of the nurses and tirewomen and singing girls come up to thee FN four hundred five put thy hand into thy pocket which thou wilt find filled with gold Take it out and throw it to them and spare not for as often as thou thrustest fingers in pouch thou shalt find it full of coin Give largesse by handsful and fear nothing but set thy trust upon Him who created thee for this is not by thine own strength but by that of Allah Almighty that His decrees may take effect upon his creatures When Badr al Din Hasan heard these words from the Ifrit he said to himself Would Heaven I knew what all this means and what is the cause of such kindness However he mingled with the people and lighting his flambeau moved on with the bridal procession till he came to the bath where he found the Hunchback already on horseback Then he pushed his way in among the crowd a veritable beauty of a man in the finest apparel wearing tarbush FN four hundred six and turband and a long sleeved robe purfled with gold and as often as the singing women stopped for the people to give them largesse he thrust his hand into his pocket and finding it full of gold took out a handful and threw it on the tambourine FN four hundred seven till he had filled it with gold pieces for the music girls and the tirewomen The singers were amazed by his bounty and the people marvelled at his beauty and loveliness and the splendour of his dress He ceased not to do thus till he reached the mansion of the Wazir who was his uncle where the Chamberlains drove back the people and forbade them to go forward but the singing girls and the tirewomen said By Allah we will not enter unless this young man enter with us for he hath given us length o life with his largesse and we will not display the bride unless he be present Therewith they carried him into the bridal hall and made him sit down defying the evil glances of the hunchbacked bridegroom The wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Courtiers all stood in double line each holding a massy cierge ready lighted all wore thin face veils and the two rows right and left extended from the bride s throne FN four hundred eight to the head of the hall adjoining the chamber whence she was to come forth When the ladies saw Badr al Din Hasan and noted his beauty and loveliness and his face that shone like the new moon their hearts inclined to him and the singing girls said to all that were present Know that this beauty crossed our hands with naught but red gold so be not chary to do him womanly service and comply with all he says no matter what he ask FN four hundred nine So all the women crowded around Hasan with their torches and gazed upon his loveliness and envied him his beauty and one and all would gladly have lain on his bosom an hour or rather a year Their hearts were so troubled that they let fall their veils from before their faces and said Happy she who belongeth to this youth or to whom he belongeth and they called down curses on the crooked groom and on him who was the cause of his marriage to the girl beauty and as often as they blessed Badr al Din Hasan they damned the Hunchback saying Verily this youth and none else deserveth our Bride Ah well away for such a lovely one with this hideous Quasimodo Allah s curse light on his head and on the Sultan who commanded the marriage Then the singing girls beat their tabrets and lulliloo d with joy announcing the appearing of the bride and the Wazir s daughter came in surrounded by her tirewomen who had made her goodly to look upon for they had perfumed her and incensed her and adorned her hair and they had robed her in raiment and ornaments befitting the mighty Chosroes Kings The most notable part of her dress was a loose robe worn over her other garments it was diapered in red gold with figures of wild beasts and birds whose eyes and beaks were of gems and claws of red rubies and green beryl and her neck was graced with a necklace of Yamani work worth thousands of gold pieces whose bezels were great round jewels of sorts the like of which was never owned by Kaysar or by Tobba King FN four hundred ten And the bride was as the full moon when at fullest on fourteenth night and as she paced into the hall she was like one of the Houris of Heaven praise be to Him who created her in such splendour of beauty The ladies encompassed her as the white contains the black of the eye they clustering like stars whilst she shone amongst them like the moon when it eats up the clouds Now Badr al Din Hasan of Bassorah was sitting in full gaze of the folk when the bride came forward with her graceful swaying and swimming gait and her hunchbacked groom stood up to meet FN four hundred eleven and receive her she however turned away from the wight and walked forward till she stood before her cousin Hasan the son of her uncle Whereat the people laughed But when the wedding guests saw her thus attracted towards Badr al Din they made a mighty clamour and the singing women shouted their loudest whereupon he put his hand into his pocket and pulling out a handful of gold cast it into their tambourines and the girls rejoiced and said Could we win our wish this bride were thine At this he smiled and the folk came round him flambeaux in hand like the eyeball round the pupil while the Gobbo bridegroom was left sitting alone much like a tail less baboon for every time they lighted a candle for him it went out willy nilly so he was left in darkness and silence and looking at naught but himself FN four hundred twelve When Badr al Din Hasan saw the bridegroom sitting lonesome in the dark and all the wedding guests with their flambeaux and wax candles crowding around himself he was bewildered and marvelled much but when he looked at his cousin the daughter of his uncle he rejoiced and felt an inward delight he longed to greet her and gazed intently on her face which was radiant with light and brilliancy Then the tirewomen took off her veil and displayed her in the first bridal dress which was of scarlet satin and Hasan had a view of her which dazzled his sight and dazed his wits as she moved to and fro swaying with graceful gait FN four hundred thirteen and she turned the heads of all the guests women as well as men for she was even as saith the surpassing poet A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed Clad in her cramoisy hued chemisette Of her lips honey dew she gave me drink And with her rosy cheeks quencht fire she set Then they changed that dress and displayed her in a robe of azure and she reappeared like the full moon when it riseth over the horizon with her coal black hair and cheeks delicately fair and teeth shown in sweet smiling and breasts firm rising and crowning sides of the softest and waist of the roundest And in this second suit she was as a certain master of high conceits saith of the like of her She came apparrelled in an azure vest Ultramarine as skies are deckt and dight I view d th unparrellel d sight which show d my eyes A moon of Summer on a Winter night Then they changed that suit for another and veiling her face in the luxuriance of her hair loosed her lovelocks so dark so long that their darkness and length outvied the darkest nights and she shot through all hearts with the magical shaft of her eye babes They displayed her in the third dress and she was as said of her the sayer Veiling her cheeks with hair a morn she comes And I her mischiefs with the cloud compare Saying Thou veilest morn with night Ah no Quoth she I shroud full moon with darkling air Then they displayed her in the fourth bridal dress and she came forward shining like the rising sun and swaying to and fro with lovesome grace and supple ease like a gazelle fawn And she clave all hearts with the arrows of her eyelashes even as saith one who described a charmer like her The sun of beauty she to sight appears And lovely coy she mocks all loveliness And when he fronts her favour and her smile A morn the Sun of day in clouds must dress Then she came forth in the fifth dress a very light of loveliness like a wand of waving willow or a gazelle of the thirsty wold Those locks which stung like scorpions along her cheeks were bent and her neck was bowed in blandishment and her hips quivered as she went As saith one of the poets describing her in verse She comes like fullest moon on happy night Taper of waist with shape of magic might She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind And Ruby on her cheeks reflects his light Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair Beware of curls that bite with viper bite Her sides are silken soft the while the heart Mere rock behind that surface lurks from sight From the fringed curtains of her eyne she shoots Shafts which at farthest range on mark alight When round her neck or waist I throw my arms Her breasts repel me with their hardened height Ah how her beauty all excels ah how That shape transcends the graceful waving bough Then they adorned her with the sixth toilette a dress which was green And now she shamed her slender straightness the nut brown spear her radiant face dimmed the brightest beams of full moon and she outdid the bending branches in gentle movement and flexible grace Her loveliness exalted the beauties of earth s four quarters and she broke men s hearts by the significance of her semblance for she was even as saith one of the poets in these lines A damsel twas the tirer s art had decked with snares and sleight FN four hundred fourteen And robed in rays as though the sun from her had borrowed light She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green As veiled by its leafy screen pomegranate hides from sight And when he said How callest thou the manner of thy dress She answered us in pleasant way with double meaning dight We call this garment creve coeur and rightly is it hight For many a heart wi this we broke FN four hundred fifteen and conquered many a sprite Then they displayed her in the seventh dress coloured between safflower FN four hundred sixteen and saffron even as one of the poets saith In vest of saffron pale and safflower red Musk d sandal d ambergris d she came to front Rise cried her youth go forth and show thyself Sit said her hips we cannot bear the brunt And when I craved a bout her Beauty said Do do and said her pretty shame Don t don t Thus they displayed the bride in all her seven toilettes before Hasan al Basri wholly neglecting the Gobbo who sat moping alone and when she opened her eyes FN four hundred seventeen she said O Allah make this man my goodman and deliver me from the evil of this hunchbacked groom As soon as they had made an end of this part of the ceremony they dismissed the wedding guests who went forth women children and all and none remained save Hasan and the Hunchback whilst the tirewomen led the bride into an inner room to change her garb and gear and get her ready for the bridegroom Thereupon Quasimodo came up to Badr al Din Hasan and said O my lord thou hast cheered us this night with thy good company and overwhelmed us with thy kindness and courtesy but now why not get thee up and go Bismallah he answered In Allah s name so be it and rising he went forth by the door where the Ifrit met him and said Stay in thy stead O Badr al Din and when the Hunchback goes out to the closet of ease go in without losing time and seat thyself in the alcove and when the bride comes say to her Tis I am thy husband for the King devised this trick only fearing for thee the evil eye and he whom thou sawest is but a Syce a groom one of our stablemen Then walk boldly up to her and unveil her face for jealousy hath taken us of this matter While Hasan was still talking with the Ifrit behold the groom fared forth from the hall and entering the closet of ease sat down on the stool Hardly had he done this when the Ifrit came out of the tank FN four hundred eighteen wherein the water was in semblance of a mouse and squeaked out Zeek Quoth the Hunchback What ails thee and the mouse grew and grew till it became a coal black cat and caterwauled Meeao Meeao FN four hundred nineteen Then it grew still more and more till it became a dog and barked out Owh Owh When the bridegroom saw this he was frightened and exclaimed Out with thee O unlucky one FN four hundred twenty But the dog grew and swelled till it became an ass colt that brayed and snorted in his face Hauk Hauk FN four hundred twenty one Whereupon the Hunchback quaked and cried Come to my aid O people of the house But behold the ass colt grew and became big as a buffalo and walled the way before him and spake with the voice of the sons of Adam saying Woe to thee O thou Bunch back thou stinkard O thou filthiest of grooms Hearing this the groom was seized with a colic and he sat down on the jakes in his clothes with teeth chattering and knocking together Quoth the Ifrit Is the world so strait to thee thou findest none to marry save my lady love But as he was silent the Ifrit continued Answer me or I will do thee dwell in the dust By Allah replied the Gobbo O King of the Buffaloes this is no fault of mine for they forced me to wed her and verily I wot not that she had a lover among the buffaloes but now I repent first before Allah and then before thee Said the Ifrit to him I swear to thee that if thou fare forth from this place or thou utter a word before sunrise I assuredly will wring thy neck When the sun rises wend thy went and never more return to this house So saying the Ifrit took up the Gobbo bridegroom and set him head downwards and feet upwards in the slit of the privy FN four hundred twenty two and said to him I will leave thee here but I shall be on the look out for thee till sunrise and if thou stir before then I will seize thee by the feet and dash out thy brains against the wall so look out for thy life Thus far concerning the Hunchback but as regards Badr al Din Hasan of Bassorah he left the Gobbo and the Ifrit jangling and wrangling and going into the house sat him down in the very middle of the alcove and behold in came the bride attended by an old woman who stood at the door and said O Father of Uprightness FN four hundred twenty three arise and take what God giveth thee Then the old woman went away and the bride Sitt al Husn or the Lady of Beauty hight entered the inner part of the alcove broken hearted and saying in herself By Allah I will never yield my person to him no not even were he to take my life But as she came to the further end she saw Badr al Din Hasan and she said Dearling Art thou still sitting here By Allah I was wishing that thou wert my bridegroom or at least that thou and the hunchbacked horse groom were partners in me He replied O beautiful lady how should the Syce have access to thee and how should he share in thee with me Then quoth she who is my husband thou or he Sitt al Husn rejoined Hasan we have not done this for mere fun FN four hundred twenty four but only as a device to ward off the evil eye from thee for when the tirewomen and singers and wedding guests saw they beauty being displayed to me they feared fascination and thy father hired the horse groom for ten dinars and a porringer of meat to take the evil eye off us and now he hath received his hire and gone his gait When the Lady of Beauty heard these words she smiled and rejoiced and laughed a pleasant laugh Then she whispered him By the Lord thou hast quenched a fire which tortured me and now by Allah O my little dark haired darling take me to thee and press me to thy bosom Then she began singing By Allah set thy foot upon my soul Since long long years for this alone I long And whisper tale of love in ear of me To me tis sweeter than the sweetest song No other youth upon my heart shall lie So do it often dear and do it long Then she stripped off her outer gear and she threw open her chemise from the neck downwards and showed her parts genital and all the rondure of her hips When Badr al Din saw the glorious sight his desires were roused and he arose and doffed her clothes and wrapping up in his bag trousers FN four hundred twenty five the purse of gold which he had taken from the Jew and which contained the thousand dinars he laid it under the edge of the bedding Then he took off his turband and set it upon the settle FN four hundred twenty six atop of his other clothes remaining in his skull cap and fine shirt of blue silk laced with gold Whereupon the Lady of Beauty drew him to her and he did likewise Then he took her to his embrace and set her legs round his waist and point blanked that cannon FN four hundred twenty seven placed where it battereth down the bulwark of maidenhead and layeth it waste And he found her a pearl unpierced and unthridden and a filly by all men save himself unridden and he abated her virginity and had joyance of her youth in his virility and presently he withdrew sword from sheath and then returned to the fray right eath and when the battle and the siege had finished some fifteen assaults he had furnished and she conceived by him that very night Then he laid his hand under her head and she did the same and they embraced and fell asleep in each other s arms as a certain poet said of such lovers in these couplets Visit thy lover spurn what envy told No envious churl shall smile on love ensoul d Merciful Allah made no fairer sight Than coupled lovers single couch doth hold Breast pressing breast and robed in joys their own With pillowed forearms cast in finest mould And when heart speaks to heart with tongue of love Folk who would part them hammer steel ice cold If a fair friend FN four hundred twenty eight thou find who cleaves to thee Live for that friend that friend in heart enfold O ye who blame for love us lover kind Say can ye minister to diseased mind This much concerning Badr al Hasan and Sitt al Husn his cousin but as regards the Ifrit as soon as he saw the twain asleep he said to the Ifritah Arise slip thee under the youth and let us carry him back to his place ere dawn overtake us for the day is nearhand Thereupon she came forward and getting under him as he lay asleep took him up clad only in his fine blue shirt leaving the rest of his garments and ceased not flying and the Ifrit vying with her in flight till the dawn advised them that it had come upon them mid way and the Muezzin began his call from the Minaret Haste ye to salvation Haste ye to salvation FN four hundred twenty nine Then Allah suffered his angelic host to shoot down the Ifrit with a shooting star FN four hundred thirty so he was consumed but the Ifritah escaped and she descended with Badr al Din at the place where the Ifrit was burnt and did not carry him back to Bassorah fearing lest he come to harm Now by the order of Him who predestineth all things they alighted at Damascus of Syria and the Ifritah set down her burden at one of the city gates and flew away When day arose and the doors were opened the folks who came forth saw a handsome youth with no other raiment but his blue shirt of gold embroidered silk and skull cap FN four hundred thirty one lying upon the ground drowned in sleep after the hard labour of the night which had not suffered him to take his rest So the folk looking at him said O her luck with whom this one spent the night but would he had waited to don his garments Quoth another A sorry lot are the sons of great families Haply he but now came forth of the tavern on some occasion of his own and his wine flew to his head FN four hundred thirty two whereby he hath missed the place he was making for and strayed till he came to the gate of the city and finding it shut lay him down and to by by As the people were bandying guesses about him suddenly the morning breeze blew upon Badr al Din and raising his shirt to his middle showed a stomach and navel with something below it FN four hundred thirty three and legs and thighs clear as crystal and smooth as cream Cried the people By Allah he is a pretty fellow and at the cry Badr al din awoke and found himself lying at a city gate with a crowd gathered around him At this he greatly marvelled and asked Where am I O good folk and what causeth you thus to gather round me and what have I had to do with you and they answered We found thee lying here asleep during the call to dawn prayer and this is all we know of the matter but where diddest thou lie last night FN four hundred thirty four By Allah O good people replied he I lay last night in Cairo Said somebody Thou hast surely been eating Hashish FN four hundred thirty five and another He is a fool and a third He is a citrouille and a fourth asked him Art thou out of thy mind thou sleepest in Cairo and thou wakest in the morning at the gate of Damascus city FN four hundred thirty six Cried he By Allah my good people one and all I lie not to you indeed I lay yesternight in the land of Egypt and yesternoon I was at Bassorah Quoth one Well well and quoth another Ho ho and a third So so and a fourth cried This youth is mad is possessed of the Jinni So they clapped hands at him and said to one another Alas the pity of it for his youth by Allah a madman and madness is no respecter of persons Then they said to him Collect thy wits and return to thy reason How couldest thou be in Bassorah yesterday and Cairo yesternight and withal awake in Damascus this morning But he persisted Indeed I was a bridegroom in Cairo last night Belike thou hast been dreaming rejoined they and sawest all this in thy sleep So Hasan took thought for a while and said to them By Allah this is no dream nor vision like doth it seem I certainly was in Cairo where they displayed the bride before me in presence of a third person the Hunchback groom who was sitting hard by By Allah O my brother this be no dream and if it were a dream where is the bag of gold I bore with me and where are my turband and my robe and my trousers Then he rose and entered the city threading its highways and by ways and bazar streets and the people pressed upon him and jeered at him crying out Madman madman till he beside himself with rage took refuge in a cook s shop Now that Cook had been a trifle too clever that is a rogue and thief but Allah had made him repent and turn from his evil ways and open a cook shop and all the people of Damascus stood in fear of his boldness and his mischief So when the crowd saw the youth enter his shop they dispersed being afraid of him and went their ways The Cook looked at Badr al Din and noting his beauty and loveliness fell in love with him forthright and said Whence comest thou O youth Tell me at once thy tale for thou art become dearer to me than my soul So Hasan recounted to him all that had befallen him from beginning to end but in repetition there is no fruition and the Cook said O my lord Badr al Din doubtless thou knowest that this case is wondrous and this story marvellous therefore O my son hide what hath betided thee till Allah dispel what ills be thine and tarry with me here the meanwhile for I have no child and I will adopt thee Badr al Din replied Be it as thou wilt O my uncle Whereupon the Cook went to the bazar and bought him a fine suit of clothes and made him don it then fared with him to the Kazi and formally declared that he was his son So Badr al Din Hasan became known in Damascus city as the Cook s son and he sat with him in the shop to take the silver and on this wise he sojourned there for a time Thus far concerning him but as regards his cousin the Lady of Beauty when morning dawned she awoke and missed Badr al Din Hasan from her side but she thought that he had gone to the privy and she sat expecting him for an hour or so when behold entered her father Shams al Din Mohammed Wazir of Egypt Now he was disconsolate by reason of what had befallen him through the Sultan who had entreated him harshly and had married his daughter by force to the lowest of his menials and he too a lump of a groom bunch backed withal and he said to himself I will slay this daughter of mine if of her own free will she have yielded her person to this acursed carle So he came to the door of the bride s private chamber and said Ho Sitt al Husn She answered him Here am I here am I FN four hundred thirty seven O my lord and came out unsteady of gait after the pains and pleasures of the night and she kissed his hand her face showing redoubled brightness and beauty for having lain in the arms of that gazelle her cousin When her father the Wazir saw her in such case he asked her O thou accursed art thou rejoicing because of this horse groom and Sitt al Husn smiled sweetly and answered By Allah don t ridicule me enough of what passed yesterday when folk laughed at me and evened me with that groom fellow who is not worthy to bring my husband s shoes or slippers nay who is not worth the paring of my husband s nails By the Lord never in my life have I nighted a night so sweet as yesternight so don t mock by reminding me of the Gobbo When her parent heard her words he was filled with fury and his eyes glared and stared so that little of them showed save the whites and he cried Fie upon thee What words are these Twas the hunchbacked horse groom who passed the night with thee Allah upon thee replied the Lady of Beauty do not worry me about the Gobbo Allah damn his father FN four hundred thirty eight and leave jesting with me for this groom was only hired for ten dinars and a porringer of meat and he took his wage and went his way As for me I entered the bridal chamber where I found my true bridegroom sitting after the singer women had displayed me to him the same who had crossed their hands with red gold till every pauper that was present waxed wealthy and I passed the night on the breast of my bonny man a most lively darling with his black eyes and joined eyebrows FN four hundred thirty nine When her parent heard these words the light before his face became night and he cried out at her saying O thou whore What is this thou tellest me Where be thy wits O my father she rejoined thou breakest my heart enough for thee that thou hast been so hard upon me Indeed my husband who took my virginity is but just now gone to the draught house and I feel that I have conceived by him FN four hundred forty The Wazir rose in much marvel and entered the privy where he found the hunchbacked groom with his head in the hole and his heels in the air At this sight he was confounded and said This is none other than he the rascal Hunchback So he called to him Ho Hunchback The Gobbo grunted out Taghum Taghum FN four hundred forty one thinking it was the Ifrit spoke to him so the Wazir shouted at him and said Speak out or I ll strike off thy pate with this sword Then quoth the Hunchback By Allah O Shaykh of the Ifrits ever since thou settest me in this place I have not lifted my head so Allah upon thee take pity and entreat me kindly When the Wazir heard this he asked What is this thou sayest I m bride s father and no Ifrit Enough for thee that thou hast well nigh done me die answered Quasimodo now go thy ways before he come upon thee who hath served me thus Could ye not marry me to any save the lady love of buffaloes and the beloved of Ifrits Allah curse her and curse him who married me to her and was the cause of this my case And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Twenty third Night Said she It hath reached me O auspicious King that the hunchbacked groom spake to the bride s father saying Allah curse him who was the cause of this my case Then said the Wazir to him Up and out of this place Am I mad cried the groom that I should go with thee without leave of the Ifrit whose last words to me were When the sun rises arise and go they gait So hath the sun risen or no for I dare not budge from this place till then Asked the Wazir Who brought thee hither and he answered I came here yesternight for a call of nature and to do what none can do for me when lo a mouse came out of the water and squeaked at me and swelled and waxed gross till it was big as a buffalo and spoke to me words that entered my ears Then he left me here and went away Allah curse the bride and him who married me to her The Wazir walked up to him and lifted his head out of the cesspool hole and he fared forth running for dear life and hardly crediting that the sun had risen and repaired to the Sultan to whom he told all that had befallen him with the Ifrit But the Wazir returned to the bride s private chamber sore troubled in spirit about her and said to her O my daughter explain this strange matter to me Quoth she Tis simply this The bridegroom to whom they displayed me yestereve lay with me all night and took my virginity and I am with child by him He is my husband and if thou believe me not there are his turband twisted as it was lying on the settle and his dagger and his trousers beneath the bed with a something I wot not what wrapped up in them When her father heard this he entered the private chamber and found the turband which had been left there by Badr al Din Hasan his brother s son and he took it in hand and turned it over saying This is the turband worn by Wazirs save that it is of Mosul stuff FN four hundred forty two So he opened it and finding what seemed to be an amulet sewn up in the Fez he unsewed the lining and took it out then he lifted up the trousers wherein was the purse of the thousand gold pieces and opening that also found in it a written paper This he read and it was the sale receipt of the Jew in the name of Badr al Din Hasan son of Nur al Din Ali the Egyptian and the thousand dinars were also there No sooner had Shams al Din read this than he cried out with a loud cry and fell to the ground fainting and as soon as he revived and understood the gist of the matter he marvelled and said There is no God but the God who All might is over all things Knowest thou O my daughter who it was that became the husband of thy virginity No answered she and he said Verily he is the son of my brother thy cousin and this thousand dinars is thy dowry Praise be to Allah and would I wot how this matter came about then opened he the amulet which was sewn up and found therein a paper in the handwriting of his deceased brother Nur al Din the Egyptian father of Badr al Din Hasan and when he saw the hand writing he kissed it again and again and he wept and wailed over his dead brother and improvised this lines I see their traces and with pain I melt And on their whilome homes I weep and yearn And Him I pray who dealt this parting blow Some day he deign vouchsafe a safe return FN four hundred forty three When he ceased versifying he read the scroll and found in it recorded the dates of his brother s marriage with the daughter of the Wazir of Bassorah and of his going in to her and her conception and the birth of Badr al Din Hasan and all his brother s history and doings up to his dying day So he marvelled much and shook with joy and comparing the dates with his own marriage and going in to his wife and the birth of their daughter Sitt al Husn he found that they perfectly agreed So he took the document and repairing with it to the Sultan acquainted him with what had passed from first to last whereat the King marvelled and commanded the case to be at once recorded FN four hundred forty four The Wazir abode that day expecting to see his brother s son but he came not and he waited a second day a third day and so on to the seventh day without any tidings of him So he said By Allah I will do a deed such as none hath ever done before me and he took reed pen and ink and drew upon a sheet of paper the plan of the whole house showing whereabouts was the private chamber with the curtain in such a place and the furniture in such another and so on with all that was in the room Then he folded up the sketch and causing all the furniture to be collected he took Badr al Din s garments and the turband and Fez and robe and purse and carried the whole to his house and locked them up against the coming of his nephew Badr al Din Hasan the son of his lost brother with an iron padlock on which he set his seal As for the Wazir s daughter when her tale of months was fulfilled she bare a son like the full moon the image of his father in beauty and loveliness and fair proportions and perfect grace They cut his navel string FN four hundred forty five and Kohl d his eyelids to strengthen his eyes and gave him over to the nurses and nursery governesses FN four hundred forty six naming him Ajib the Wonderful His day was as a month and his month was as a year FN four hundred forty seven and when seven years had passed over him his grandfather sent him to school enjoining the master to teach him Koran reading and to educate him well he remained at the school four years till he began to bully his schoolfellows and abuse them and bash them and thrash them and say Who among you is like me I am the son of Wazir of Egypt At last the boys came in a body to the Monitor FN four hundred forty eight of what hard usage they were wont to have from Ajib and he said to them I will tell you somewhat you may do to him so that he shall leave off coming to the school and it is this When he enters to morrow sit ye down about him and say some one of you to some other By Allah none shall play with us at this game except he tell us the names of his mamma and his papa for he who knows not the names of his mother and his father is a bastard a son of adultery FN four hundred forty nine and he shall not play with us When morning dawned the boys came to school Ajib being one of them and all flocked around him saying We will play a game wherein none can join save he can tell the name of his mamma and his papa And they all cried By Allah good Then quoth one of them My name is Majid and my mammy s name is Alawiyah and my daddy s Izz al Din Another spoke in like guise and yet a third till Ajid s turn came and he said MY name is Ajib and my mother s is Sitt al Husn and my father s Shams al Din the Wazir of Cairo By Allah cried they the Wazir is not thy true father Ajib answered The Wazir is my father in very deed Then the boys all laughed and clapped their hands at him saying He does not know who is his papa get out from among us for none shall play with us except he know his father s name Thereupon they dispersed from around him and laughed him to scorn so his breast was straitened and he well nigh choked with tears and hurt feelings Then said the Monitor to him We know that the Wazir is thy grandfather the father of thy mother Sitt al Husn and not thy father As for thy father neither dost thou know him nor yet do we for the Sultan married thy mother to the hunchbacked horse groom but the Jinni came and slept with her and thou hast no known father Leave then comparing thyself too advantageously with the little ones of the school till thou know that thou hast a lawful father for until then thou wilt pass for a child of adultery amongst them Seest thou that not even a huckster s son knoweth his own sire Thy grandfather is the Wazir of Egypt but as for thy father we wot him not and we say indeed that thou hast none So return to thy sound senses When Ajib heard these insulting words from the Monitor and the school boys and understood the reproach they put upon him he went out at once and ran to his mother Sitt al Husn to complain but he was crying so bitterly that his tears prevented his speech for a while When she heard his sobs and saw his tears her heart burned as though with fire for him and she said O my son why dost thou weep Allah keep the tears from thine eyes Tell me what hath betided thee So he told her all that he heard from the boys and from the Monitor and ended with asking And who O my mother is my father She answered Thy father is the Wazir of Egypt but he said Do not lie to me The Wazir is thy father not mine who then is my father Except thou tell me the very truth I will kill myself with this hanger FN four hundred fifty When his mother heard him speak of his father she wept remembering her cousin and her bridal night with him and all that occurred thereon and then and she repeated these couplets Love in my heart they lit and went their ways And all I love to furthest lands withdrew And when they left me sufferance also left And when we parted Patience bade adieu They fled and flying with my joys they fled In very consistency my spirit flew They made my eyelids flow with severance tears And to the parting pang these drops are due And when I long to see reunion day My groans prolonging sore for ruth I sue Then in my heart of hearts their shapes I trace And love and longing care and cark renew O ye whose names cling round me like a cloak Whose love yet closer than a shirt I drew Beloved ones how long this hard despite How long this severance and this coy shy flight Then she wailed and shrieked aloud and her son did the like and behold in came the Wazir whose heart burnt within him at the sight of their lamentations and he said What makes you weep So the Lady of Beauty acquainted him with what had happened between her son and the school boys and he also wept calling to mind his brother and what had past between them and what had betided his daughter and how he had failed to find out what mystery there was in the matter Then he rose at once and repairing to the audience hall went straight to the King and told his tale and craved his permission FN four hundred fifty one to travel eastward to the city of Bassorah and ask after his brother s son Furthermore he besought the Sultan to write for him letters patent authorising him to seize upon Badr al Din his nephew and son in law wheresoever he might find him And he wept before the King who had pity on him and wrote royal autographs to his deputies in all climes FN four hundred fifty two and countries and cities whereat the Wazir rejoiced and prayed for blessings on him Then taking leave of his Sovereign he returned to his house where he equipped himself and his daughter and his adopted child Ajib with all things meet for a long march and set out and travelled the first day and the second and the third and so forth till he arrived at Damascus city He found it a fair place abounding in trees and streams even as the poet said of it When I nighted and dayed in Damascus town Time sware such another he ne er should view And careless we slept under wing of night Till dappled Morn gan her smiles renew And dew drops on branch in their beauty hung Like pearls to be dropt when the Zephyr blew And the Lake FN four hundred fifty three was the page where birds read and note And the clouds set points to what breezes wrote The Wazir encamped on the open space called Al Hasa FN four hundred fifty four and after pitching tents said to his servants A halt here for two days So they went into the city upon their several occasions this to sell and this to buy this to go to the Hammam and that to visit the Cathedral mosque of the Banu Umayyah the Ommiades whose like is not in this world FN four hundred fifty five Ajib also went with his attendant eunuch for solace and diversion to the city and the servant followed with a quarter staff FN four hundred fifty six of almond wood so heavy that if he struck a camel therewith the beast would never rise again FN four hundred fifty seven When the people of Damascus saw Ajib s beauty and brilliancy and perfect grace and symmetry for he was a marvel of comeliness and winning loveliness softer than the cool breeze of the North sweeter than limpid waters to a man in drowth and pleasanter than the health for which sick man sueth a mighty many followed him whilest others ran on before and sat down on the road until he should come up that they might gaze on him till as Destiny had decreed the Eunuch stopped opposite the shop of Ajib s father Badr al Din Hasan Now his beard had grown long and thick and his wits had ripened during the twelve years which had passed over him and the Cook and ex rogue having died the so called Hasan of Bassorah had succeeded to his goods and shop for that he had been formally adopted before the Kazi and witnesses When his son and the Eunuch stepped before him he gazed on Ajib and seeing how very beautiful he was his heart fluttered and throbbed and blood drew to blood and natural affection spake out and his bowels yearned over him He had just dressed a conserve of pomegranate grains with sugar and Heaven implanted love wrought within him so he called to his son Ajib and said O my lord O thou who hast gotten the mastery of my heart and my very vitals and to whom my bowels yearn say me wilt thou enter my house and solace my soul by eating of my meat Then his eyes streamed with tears which he could not stay for he bethought him of what he had been and what he had become When Ajib heard his father s words his heart also yearned himwards and he looked at the Eunuch and said to him Of a truth O my good guard my heart yearns to this cook he is as one that hath a son far away from him so let us enter and gladden his heart by tasting of his hospitality Perchance for our so doing Allah may reunite me with my father When the Eunuch heard these words he cried A fine thing this by Allah Shall the sons of Wazirs be seen eating in a common cook shop Indeed I keep off the folk from thee with this quarter staff lest they even look upon thee and I dare not suffer thee to enter this shop at all When Hasan of Bassorah heard his speech he marvelled and turned to the Eunuch with the tears pouring down his cheeks and Ajib said Verily my heart loves him But he answered Leave this talk thou shalt not go in Thereupon the father turned to the Eunuch and said O worthy sir why wilt thou not gladden my soul by entering my shop O thou who art like a chestnut dark without but white of heart within O thou of the like of whom a certain poet said The Eunuch burst out a laughing and asked Said what Speak out by Allah and be quick about it So Hasan the Bassorite began reciting these couplets If not master of manners or aught but discreet In the household of Kings no trust could he take And then for the Harem what Eunuch FN four hundred fifty eight is he Whom angels would serve for his service sake The Eunuch marvelled and was pleased at these words so he took Ajib by the hand and went into the cook s shop whereupon Hasan the Bassorite ladled into a saucer some conserve of pomegranate grains wonderfully good dressed with almonds and sugar saying You have honoured me with your company eat then and health and happiness to you Thereupon Ajib said to his father Sit thee down and eat with us so perchance Allah may unite us with him we long for Quoth Hasan O my son hast thou then been afflicted in thy tender years with parting from those thou lovest Quoth Ajib Even so O nuncle mine my heart burns for the loss of a beloved one who is non other than my father and indeed I come forth I and my grandfather FN four hundred fifty nine to circle and search the world for him Oh the pity of it and how I long to meet him Then he wept with exceeding for his own bereavement which recalled to him his long separation from dear friends and from his mother and the Eunuch was moved to pity for him Then they ate together till they were satisfied and Ajib and the slave rose and left the shop Hereat Hasan the Bassorite felt as though his soul had departed his body and had gone with them for he could not lose sight of the boy during the twinkling of an eye albeit he knew not that Ajib was his son So he locked up his shop and hastened after them and he walked so fast that he came up with them before they had gone out of the western gate The Eunuch turned and asked him What ails the and Badr al Din answered When ye went from me meseemed my soul had gone with you and as I had business without the city gate I purposed to bear you company till my matter was ordered and so return The Eunuch was angered and said to Ajib This is just what I feared we ate that unlucky mouthful which we are bound to respect and here is the fellow following us from place to place for the vulgar are ever the vulgar Ajib turning and seeing the Cook just behind him was wroth and his face reddened with rage and he said to the servant Let him walk the highway of the Moslems but when we turn off it to our tents and find that he still follows us we will send him about his business with a flea in his ear Then he bowed his head and walked on the Eunuch walking behind him But Hasan of Bassorah followed them to the plain Al Hasa and as they drew near to the tents they turned round and saw him close on their heels so Ajib was very angry fearing that the Eunuch might tell his grandfather what had happened His indignation was the hotter for apprehension lest any say that after he had entered a cook shop the cook had followed him So he turned and looked at Hasan of Bassorah and found his eyes fixed on his own for the father had become a body without a soul and it seemed to Ajib that his eye was a treacherous eye or that he was some lewd fellow So his rage redoubled and stooping down he took up a stone weighing half a pound and threw it at his father It struck him on the forehead cutting it open from eye brow to eye brow and causing the blood to stream down and Hasan fell to the ground in a swoon whilst Ajib and the Eunuch made for the tents When the father came to himself he wiped away the blood and tore off a strip from his turband and bound up his head blaming himself the while and saying I wronged the lad by shutting up my shop and following so that he thought I was some evil minded fellow Then he returned to his place where he busied himself with the sale of his sweetmeats and he yearned after his mother at Bassorah and wept over her and broke out repeating Unjust it were to bid the World FN four hundred sixty be just And blame her not She ne er was made for justice Take what she gives thee leave all grief aside For now to fair and then to foul her lust is So Hasan of Bassorah set himself steadily to sell his sweetmeats but the Wazir his uncle halted in Damascus three days and then marched upon Emesa and passing through that town he made enquiry there and at every place where he rested Thence he fared on by way of Hamah and Aleppo and thence to Diyar Bakr and Maridin and Mosul still enquiring till he arrived at Bassorah city Here as soon as he had secured a lodging he presented himself before the Sultan who entreated him with high honour and the respect due to his rank and asked the cause of his coming The Wazir acquainted him with his history and told him that the Minister Nur al Din was his brother whereupon the Sultan exclaimed Allah have mercy upon him and added My good Sahib FN four hundred sixty one he was my Wazir for fifteen years and I loved him exceedingly Then he died leaving a son who abode only a single month after his father s death since which time he has disappeared and we could gain no tidings of him But his mother who is the daughter of my former Minister is still among us When the Wazir Shams al Din heard that his nephew s mother was alive and well he rejoiced and said O King I much desire to meet her The King on the instant gave him leave to visit her so he betook himself to the mansion of his brother Nur al Din and cast sorrowful glances on all things in and around it and kissed the threshold Then he bethought him of his brother Nur al Din Ali and how he had died in a strange land far from kith and kin and friends and he wept and repeated these lines I wander mid these walls my Layla s walls And kissing this and other wall I roam Tis not the walls or roof my heart so loves But those who in this house had made their home Then he passed through the gate into a courtyard and found a vaulted doorway builded of hardest syenite FN four hundred sixty two inlaid with sundry kinds of multi coloured marble Into this he walked and wandered about the house and throwing many a glance around saw the name of his brother Nur al Din written in gold wash upon the walls So he went up to the inscription and kissed it and wept and thought of how he had been separated from his brother and had now lost him for ever and he recited these couplets I ask of you from every rising sun And eke I ask when flasheth levenlight When I pass my nights in passion pain Yet ne er I plain me of my painful plight My love if longer last this parting throe Little by little shall it waste my sprite An thou wouldst bless these eyne with sight of thee One day on earth I crave none other sight Think not another could possess my mind Nor length nor breadth for other love I find Then he walked on till he came to the apartment of his brother s widow the mother of Badr al Din Hasan the Egyptian Now from the time of her son s disappearance she had never ceased weeping and wailing through the light hours and the dark and when the years grew longsome with her she built for him a tomb of marble in the midst of the saloon and there used to weep for him day and night never sleeping save thereby When the Wazir drew near her apartment he heard her voice and stood behind the door while she addressed the sepulchre in verse and said Answer by Allah Sepulchre are all his beauties gone Hath change the power to blight his charms that Beauty s paragon Thou art not earth O Sepulchre nor art thou sky to me How comes it then in thee I see conjoint the branch and moon While she was bemoaning herself after this fashion behold the Wazir went in to her and saluted her and informed her that he was her husband s brother and telling her all that had passed between them laid open before her the whole story how her son Badr al Din Hasan had spent a whole night with his daughter full ten years ago but had disappeared in the morning And he ended with saying My daughter conceived by thy son and bare a male child who is now with me and he is thy son and thy son s son by my daughter When she heard the tidings that her boy Badr al Din was still alive and saw her brother in law she rose up to him and threw herself at his feet and kissed them reciting these lines Allah be good to him that gives glad tidings of thy steps In very sooth for better news mine ears would never sue Were he content with worn out robe upon his back I d throw A heart to pieces rent and torn when heard the word Adieu Then the Wazir sent for Ajib and his grandmother stood up and fell on his neck and wept but Shams al Din said to her This is no time for weeping this is the time to get thee ready for travelling with us to the land of Egypt haply Allah will reunite me and thee with thy son and my nephew Replied she Hearkening and obedience and rising at once collected her baggage and treasures and her jewels and equipped herself and her slave girls for the march whilst the Wazir went to take his leave of the Sultan of Bassorah who sent by him presents and rarities for the Soldan of Egypt Then he set out at once upon his homeward march and journeyed till he came to Damascus city where he alighted in the usual place and pitched tents and said to his suite We will halt a se nnight here to buy presents and rare things for the Soldan Now Ajib bethought him of the past so he said to the Eunuch O Laik I want a little diversion come let us go down to the great bazar of Damascus FN four hundred sixty three and see what hath become of the cook whose sweetmeats we ate and whose head we broke for indeed he was kind to us and we entreated him scurvily The Eunuch answered Hearing is obeying So they went forth from the tents and the tie of blood drew Ajib towards his father and forthwith they passed through the gateway Bab al Faradis FN four hundred sixty four hight and entered the city and ceased not walking through the streets till they reached the cookshop where they found Hasan of Bassorah standing at the door It was near the time of mid afternoon prayer FN four hundred sixty five and it so fortuned that he had just dressed a confection of pomegranate grains When the twain drew near to him and Ajib saw him his heart yearned towards him and noticing the scar of the blow which time had darkened on his brow he said to him Peace be on thee O man FN four hundred sixty six know that my heart is with thee But when Badr al Din looked upon his son his vitals yearned and his heart fluttered and he hung his head earthwards and sought to make his tongue give utterance to his words but he could not Then he raised his head humbly and suppliant wise towards his boy and repeated these couplets I longed for my beloved but when I saw his face Abashed I held my tongue and stood with downcast eye And hung my head in dread and would have hid my love But do whatso I would hidden it would not lie Volumes of plaints I had prepared reproach and blame But when we met no single word remembered I And then said he to them Heal my broken heart and eat of my sweetmeats for by Allah I cannot look at thee but my heart flutters Indeed I should not have followed thee the other day but that I was beside myself By Allah answered Ajib thou dost indeed love us We ate in thy house a mouthful when we were here before and thou madest us repent of it for that thou followedst us and wouldst have disgraced us so now we will not eat aught with thee save on condition that thou make oath not to go out after us nor dog us Otherwise we will not visit thee again during our present stay for we shall halt a week here whilst my grandfather buys certain presents for the King Quoth Hasan of Bassorah I promise you this So Ajib and the Eunuch entered the shop and his father set before them a saucer full of conserve of pomegranate grains Said Ajib Sit thee down and eat with us so haply shall Allah dispel our sorrows Hasan the Bassorite was joyful and sat down and ate with them but his eyes kept gazing fixedly on Ajib s face for his very heart and vitals clove to him and at last the boy said to him Did I not tell thee thou art a most noyous dotard so do stint thy staring in my face But when Hasan of Bassorah heard his son s words he repeated these lines Thou hast some art the hearts of men to clip Close veiled far hidden mystery dark and deep O thou whose beauties sham the lustrous moon Wherewith the saffron Morn fears rivalship Thy beauty is a shrine shall ne er decay Whose signs shall grow until they all outstrip FN four hundred sixty seven Must I be thirst burnt by that Eden brow And die of pine to taste that Kausar lip FN four hundred sixty eight Hasan kept putting morsels into Ajib s mouth at one time and at another time did the same by the Eunuch and they ate till they were satisfied and could no more Then all rose up and the cook poured water on their hands FN four hundred sixty nine and loosing a silken waist shawl dried them and sprinkled them with rose water from a casting bottle he had by him Then he went out and presently returned with a gugglet of sherbet flavoured with rose water scented with musk and cooled with snow and he set this before them saying Complete your kindness to me So Ajib took the gugglet and drank and passed it to the Eunuch and it went round till their stomachs were full and they were surfeited with a meal larger than their wont Then they went away and made haste in walking till they reached the tents and Ajib went in to his grandmother who kissed him and thinking of her son Badr al Din Hasan groaned aloud and wept and recited these lines I still had hoped to see thee and enjoy thy sight For in thine absence life has lost its kindly light I swear my vitals wot none other love but thine By Allah who can read the secrets of the sprite Then she asked Ajib O my son where hast thou been and he answered In Damascus city Whereupon she rose and set before him a bit of scone and a saucer of conserve of pomegranate grains which was too little sweetened and she said to the Eunuch Sit down with thy master Said the servant to himself By Allah we have no mind to eat I cannot bear the smell of bread but he sat down and so did Ajib though his stomach was full of what he had eaten already and drunken Nevertheless he took a bit of the bread and dipped it in the pomegranate conserve and made shift to eat it but he found it too little sweetened for he was cloyed and surfeited so he said Faugh what be this wild beast FN four hundred seventy stuff O my son cried his grandmother dost thou find fault with my cookery I cooked this myself and none can cook it as nicely as I can save thy father Badr al Din Hasan By Allah O my lady Ajib answered this dish is nasty stuff for we saw but now in the city of Bassorah a cook who so dresseth pomegranate grains that the very smell openeth a way to the heart and the taste would make a full man long to eat and as for this mess compared with his tis not worth either much or little When his grandmother heard his words she waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and looked at the servant And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Twenty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ajib s grandmother heard his words she waxed wroth and looked at the servant and said Woe to thee dost thou spoil my son FN four hundred seventy one and dost take him into common cookshops The Eunuch was frightened and denied saying We did not go into the shop we only passed by it By Allah cried Ajib but we did go in and we ate till it came out of our nostrils and the dish was better than thy dish Then his grandmother rose and went and told her brother in law who was incensed against the Eunuch and sending for him asked him Why didst thou take my son into a cookshop and the Eunuch being frightened answered We did not go in But Ajib said We did go inside and ate conserve of pomegranate grains till we were full and the cook gave us to drink of iced and sugared sherbet At this the Wazir s indignation redoubled and he questioned the Castrato but as he still denied the Wazir said to him If thou speak sooth sit down and eat before us So he came forward and tried to eat but could not eat and threw away the mouthful crying O my lord I am surfeited since yesterday By this the Wazir was certified that he had eaten at the cook s and bade the slaves throw him FN four hundred seventy two which they did Then they came down on him with a rib basting which burned him till he cried for mercy and help from Allah saying O my master beat me no more and I will tell thee the truth whereupon the Wazir stopped the bastinado and said Now speak thou sooth Quoth the Eunuch Know then that we did enter the shop of a cook while he was dressing conserve of pomegranate grains and he set some of it before us by Allah I never ate in my life its like nor tasted aught nastier than this stuff which is now before us FN four hundred seventy three Badr al Din Hasan s mother was angry at this and said Needs thou must go back to the cook and bring me a saucer of conserved pomegranate grains from that which is in his shop and show it to thy master that he may say which be the better and the nicer mine or his Said the unsexed I will So on the instant she gave him a saucer and a half dinar and he returned to the shop and said to the cook O Shaykh of all Cooks FN four hundred seventy four we have laid a wager concerning thy cookery in my lord s house for they have conserve of pomegranate grains there also so give me this half dinar s worth and look to it for I have eaten a full meal of stick on account of thy cookery and so do not let me eat aught more thereof Hasan of Bassorah laughed and answered By Allah none can dress this dish as it should be dressed save myself and my mother and she at this time is in a far country Then he ladled out a saucer full and finishing it off with musk and rose water put it in a cloth which he sealed FN four hundred seventy five and gave it to the Eunuch who hastened back with it No sooner had Badr al Din Hasan s mother tasted it and perceived its fine flavour and the excellence of the cookery than she knew who had dressed it and she screamed and fell down fainting The Wazir sorely started sprinkled rose water upon her and after a time she recovered and said If my son be yet of this world none dressed this conserve of pomegranate grains but he and this Cook is my very son Badr al Din Hasan there is no doubt of it nor can there be any mistake for only I and he knew how to prepare it and I taught him When the Wazir heard her words he joyed with exceeding joy and said O the longing of me for a sight of my brother s son I wonder if the days will ever unite us with him Yet it is to Almighty Allah alone that we look for bringing about this meeting Then he rose without stay or delay and going to his suite said to them Be off some fifty of you with sticks and staves to the Cook s shop and demolish it then pinion his arms behind him with his own turband saying It was thou madest that foul mess of pomegranate grains and drag him here perforce but without doing him a harm And they replied It is well Then the Wazir rode off without losing an instant to the Palace and foregathering with the Viceroy of Damascus showed him the Sultan s orders After careful perusal he kissed the letter and placing it upon his head said to his visitor Who is this offender of thine Quoth the Wazir A man who is a cook So the Viceroy at once sent his apparitors to the shop which they found demolished and everything in it broken to pieces for whilst the Wazir was riding to the palace his men had done his bidding Then they awaited his return from the audience and Hasan of Bassorah who was their prisoner kept saying I wonder what they have found in the conserve of pomegranate grains to bring things to this pass FN four hundred seventy six When the Wazir returned to them after his visit to the Viceroy who had given him formal permission to take up his debtor and depart with him on entering the tents he called for the Cook They brought him forward pinioned with his turband and when Badr al Din Hasan saw his uncle he wept with excessive weeping and said O my lord what is my offence against thee Art thou the man who dressed that conserve of pomegranate grains asked the Wazir and he answered Yes didst thou find in it aught to call for the cutting off of my head Quoth the Wazir That were the least of thy deserts Quoth the cook O my lord wilt thou not tell me my crime and what aileth the conserve of pomegranate grains Presently replied the Wazir and called aloud to his men Bring hither the camels So they struck the tents and by the Wazir s orders the servants took Badr al Din Hasan and set him in a chest which they padlocked and put on a camel Then they departed and stinted not journeying till nightfall when they halted and ate some victual and took Badr al Din Hasan out of his chest and gave him a meal and locked him up again They set out once more and travelled till they reached Kimrah where they took him out of the box and brought him before the Wazir who asked him Art thou he who dressed that conserve of pomegranate grains He answered Yes O my lord and the Wazir said Fetter him So they fettered him and returned him to the chest and fared on again till they reached Cairo and lighted at the quarter called Al Raydaniyah FN four hundred seventy seven Then the Wazir gave order to take Badr al Din Hasan out of the chest and sent for a carpenter and said to him Make me a cross of wood FN four hundred seventy eight for this fellow Cried Badr al Din Hasan And what wilt thou do with it and the Wazir replied I mean to crucify thee thereon and nail thee thereto and parade thee all about the city And why wilt thou use me after this fashion Because of thy villanous cookery of conserved pomegranate grains how durst thou dress it and sell it lacking pepper And for that it lacked pepper wilt thou do all this to me Is it not enough that thou hast broken my shop and smashed my gear and boxed me up in a chest and fed me only once a day Too little pepper too little pepper this is a crime which can be expiated only upon the cross Then Badr al Din Hasan marvelled and fell a mourning for his life whereupon the Wazir asked him Of what thinkest thou and he answered him Of maggoty heads like thine FN four hundred seventy nine for an thou had one ounce of sense thou hadst not treated me thus Quoth the Wazir It is our duty to punish thee lest thou do the like again Quoth Badr al Din Hasan Of a truth my offense were over punished by the least of what thou hast already done to me and Allah damn all conserve of pomegranate grains and curse the hour when I cooked it and would I had died ere this But the Wazir rejoined There is no help for it I must crucify a man who sells conserve of pomegranate grains lacking pepper All this time the carpenter was shaping the wood and Badr al Din looked on and thus they did till night when his uncle took him and clapped him into the chest saying The thing shall be done to morrow Then he waited until he knew Badr al Din Hasan to be asleep when he mounted and taking the chest up before him entered the city and rode on to his own house where he alighted and said to his daughter Sitt al Husn Praised be Allah who hath reunited thee with thy husband the son of thine uncle Up now and order the house as it was on thy bridal night So the servants arose and lit the candles and the Wazir took out his plan of the nuptial chamber and directed them what to do till they had set everything in its stead so that whoever saw it would have no doubt but it was the very night of the marriage Then he bade them put down Badr al Din Hasan s turband on the settle as he had deposited it with his own hand and in like manner his bag trousers and the purse which were under the mattress and told daughter to undress herself and go to bed in the private chamber as on her wedding night adding When the son of thine uncle comes in to thee say to him Thou hast loitered while going to the privy and call him to lie by thy side and keep him in converse till daybreak when we will explain the whole matter to him Then he bade take Badr al Din Hasan out of the chest after loosing the fetters from his feet and stripping off all that was on him save the fine shirt of blue silk in which he had slept on his wedding night so that he was well nigh naked and trouserless All this was done whilst he was sleeping on utterly unconscious Then by doom of Destiny Badr al Din Hasan turned over and awoke and finding himself in a lighted vestibule said to himself Surely I am in the mazes of some dream So he rose and went on to a little to an inner door and looked in and lo he was in the very chamber wherein the bride had been displayed to him and there he saw the bridal alcove and the settle and his turband and all his clothes When he saw this he was confounded and kept advancing with one foot and retiring with the other saying Am I sleeping or waking And he began rubbing his forehead and saying for indeed he was thoroughly astounded By Allah verily this is the chamber of the bride who was displayed before me Where am I then I was surely but now in a box Whilst he was talking with himself Sitt al Husn suddenly lifted the corner of the chamber curtain and said O my lord wilt thou not come in Indeed thou hast loitered long in the water closet When he heard her words and saw her face he burst out laughing and said Of a truth this is a very nightmare among dreams Then he went in sighing and pondered what had come to pass with him and was perplexed about his case and his affair became yet more obscure to him when he saw his turband and bag trousers and when feeling the pocket he found the purse containing the thousand gold pieces So he stood still and muttered Allah is all knowing Assuredly I am dreaming a wild waking dream Then said the Lady of Beauty to him What ails thee to look puzzled and perplexed adding Thou wast a very different man during the first of the night He laughed and asked her How long have I been away from thee and she answered him Allah preserve thee and His Holy Name be about thee Thou didst but go out an hour ago for an occasion and return Are thy wits clean gone When Badr al Din Hasan heard this he laughed FN four hundred eighty and said Thou hast spoken truth but when I went out from thee I forgot myself awhile in the draught house and dreamed that I was a cook at Damascus and abode there ten years and there came to me a boy who was of the sons of the great and with him an Eunuch Here he passed his hand over his forehead and feeling the scar cried By Allah O my lady it must have been true for he struck my forehead with a stone and cut it open from eye brow to eye brow and here is the mark so it must have been on wake Then he added But perhaps I dreamt it when we fell asleep I and thou in each other s arms for meseems it was as though I travelled to Damascus without tarbush and trousers and set up as a cook there Then he was perplexed and considered for awhile and said By Allah I also fancied that I dressed a conserve of pomegranate grains and put too little pepper in it By Allah I must have slept in the numerocent and have seen the whole thing in a dream but how long was that dream Allah upon thee said Sitt al Husn and what more sawest thou So he related all to her and presently said By Allah had I not woke up they would have nailed me to a cross of wood Wherefore asked she and he answered For putting too little pepper in the conserve of pomegranate grains and meseemed they demolished my shop and dashed to pieces my pots and pans destroyed all my stuff and put me in a box they then sent for the carpenter to fashion a cross for me and would have crucified me thereon Now Alham dolillah thanks be to Allah for that all this happened to me in sleep and not on wake Sitt al Husn laughed and clasped him to her bosom and he her to his then he thought again and said By Allah it could not be save while I was awake truly I know not what to think of it Then he lay him down and all the night he was bewildered about his case now saying I was dreaming and then saying I was awake till morning when his uncle Shams al Din the Wazir came to him and saluted him When Badr al Din Hasan saw him he said By Allah art thou not he who bade bind my hands behind me and smash my shop and nail me to a cross on a matter of conserved pomegranate grains because the dish lacked a sufficiency of pepper Whereupon the Wazir said to him Know O my son that truth hath shown it soothfast and the concealed hath been revealed FN four hundred eighty one Thou art the son of my brother and I did all this with thee to certify myself that thou wast indeed he who went in unto my daughter that night I could not be sure of this till I saw that thou knewest the chamber and thy turband and thy trousers and thy gold and the papers in thy writing and in that of thy father my brother for I had never seen thee afore that and knew thee not and as to thy mother I have prevailed upon her to come with me from Bassorah So saying he threw himself on his nephew s breast and wept for joy and Badr al Din Hasan hearing these words from his uncle marvelled with exceeding marvel and fell on his neck and also shed tears for excess of delight Then said the Wazir to him O my son the sole cause of all this is what passed between me and thy sire and all that had occurred to part them Lastly the Wazir sent for Ajib and when his father saw him he cried And this is he who struck me with the stone Quoth the Wazir This is thy son And Badr al Din Hasan threw himself upon his boy and began repeating Long have I wept o er severance ban and bane Long from mine eyelids tear rills rail and rain And vowed I if Time re union bring My tongue from name of Severance I ll restrain Joy hath o ercome me to this stress that I From joy s revulsion to shed tears am fain Ye are so trained to tears O eyne of me You weep with pleasure as you weep with pain FN four hundred eighty two When he had ended his verse his mother came in and threw herself upon him and began reciting When we met we complained Our hearts were sore wrung But plaint is not pleasant Fro messenger s tongue Then she wept and related to him what had befallen her since his departure and he told her what he had suffered and they thanked Allah Almighty for their reunion Two days after his arrival the Wazir Shams al din went in to the Sultan and kissing the ground between his hands greeted him with the greeting due to Kings The Sultan rejoiced at his return and his face brightened and placing him hard by his side FN four hundred eighty three asked him to relate all he had seen in his wayfaring and whatso had betided him in his going and coming So the Wazir told him all that had passed from first to last and the Sultan said Thanks be to Allah for thy victory FN four hundred eighty four and the winning of thy wish and thy safe return to thy children and thy people And now I needs must see the son of thy brother Hasan of Bassorah so bring him to the audience hall to morrow Shams al Din replied Thy slave shall stand in thy presence to morrow Inshallah if it be God s will Then he saluted him and returning to his own house informed his nephew of the Sultan s desire to see him whereto replied Hasan whilome the Bassorite The slave is obedient to the orders of his lord And the result was that next day he accompanied his uncle Shams al Din to the Divan and after saluting the Sultan and doing him reverence in most ceremonious obeisance and with most courtly obsequiousness he began improvising these verses The first in rank to kiss the ground shall deign Before you and all ends and aims attain You are Honour s fount and all that hope of you Shall gain more honour than Hope hoped to gain The Sultan smiled and signed to him to sit down So he took a seat close to his uncle Shams al Din and the King asked him his name Quoth Badr al Din Hasan The meanest of thy slaves is known as Hasan the Bassorite who is instant in prayer for thee day and night The Sultan was pleased at his words and being minded to test his learning and prove his good breeding asked him Dost thou remember any verses in praise of the mole on the cheek He answered I do and began reciting When I think of my love and our parting smart My groans go forth and my tears upstart He s a mole that reminds me in colour and charms O the black o the eye and the grain FN four hundred eighty five of the heart The King admired and praised the two couplets and said to him Quote something else Allah bless thy sire and may thy tongue never tire So he began That cheek mole s spot they evened with a grain Of musk nor did they here the simile strain Nay marvel at the face comprising all Beauty nor falling short by single grain The King shook with pleasure FN four hundred eighty six and said to him Say more Allah bless thy days So he began O you whose mole on cheek enthroned recalls A dot of musk upon a stone of ruby Grant me your favours Be not stone at heart Core of my heart whose only sustenance you be Quoth the King Fair comparison O Hasan FN four hundred eighty seven thou hast spoken excellently well and hast proved thyself accomplished in every accomplishment Now explain to me how many meanings be there in the Arabic language FN four hundred eighty eight for the word Khal or mole He replied Allah keep the King Seven and fifty and some by tradition say fifty Said the Sultan Thou sayest sooth presently adding Hast thou knowledge as to the points of excellence in beauty Yes answered Badr al Din Hasan Beauty consisteth in brightness of face clearness of complexion shapeliness of nose gentleness of eyes sweetness of mouth cleverness of speech slenderness of shape and seemliness of all attributes But the acme of beauty is in the hair and indeed al Shihab the Hijazi hath brought together all these items in his doggrel verse of the metre Rajaz FN four hundred eighty nine and it is this Say thou to skin Be soft to face Be fair And gaze nor shall they blame howso thou stare Fine nose in Beauty s list is high esteemed Nor less an eye full bright and debonnair Eke did they well to laud the lovely lips Which e en the sleep of me will never spare A winning tongue a stature tall and straight FN four hundred ninety A seemly union of gifts rarest rare But Beauty s acme in the hair one views it So hear my strain and with some few excuse it The Sultan was captivated by his converse and regarding him as a friend asked What meaning is there in the saw Shurayh is foxier than the fox And he answered Know O King whom Almighty Allah keep that the legist Shurayh FN four hundred ninety one was wont during the days of the plague to make a visitation to Al Najaf and whenever he stood up to pray there came a fox which would plant himself facing him and which by mimicking his movements distracted him from his devotions Now when this became longsome to him one day he doffed his shirt and set it upon a cane and shook out the sleeves then placing his turband on the top and girding its middle with a shawl he stuck it up in the place where he used to pray Presently up trotted the fox according to his custom and stood over against the figure whereupon Shurayh came behind him and took him Hence the sayer saith Shurayh foxier than the fox When the Sultan heard Badr al Din Hasan s explanation he said to his uncle Shams al Din Truly this the son of thy brother is perfect in courtly breeding and I do not think that his like can be found in Cairo At this Hasan arose and kissed the ground before him and sat down again as a Mameluke should sit before his master When the Sultan had thus assured himself of his courtly breeding and bearing and his knowledge of the liberal arts and belles lettres he joyed with exceeding joy and invested him with a splendid robe of honour and promoted him to an office whereby he might better his condition FN four hundred ninety two Then Badr al Din Hasan arose and kissing the ground before the King wished him continuance of glory and asked leave to retire with his uncle the Wazir Shams al Din The Sultan gave him leave and he issued forth and the two returned home where food was set before them and they ate what Allah had given them After finishing his meal Hasan repaired to the sitting chamber of his wife the Lady of Beauty and told her what had past between him and the Sultan whereupon quoth she He cannot fail to make thee a cup companion and give thee largess in excess and load thee with favours and bounties so shalt thou by Allah s blessing dispread like the greater light the rays of thy perfection wherever thou be on shore or on sea Said he to her I purpose to recite a Kasidah an ode in his praise that he may redouble in affection for me Thou art right in thine intent she answered so gather thy wits together and weigh thy words and I shall surely see my husband favoured with his highest favour Thereupon Hasan shut himself up and composed these couplets on a solid base and abounding in inner grace and copies them out in a hand writing of the nicest taste They are as follows Mine is a Chief who reached most haught estate Treading the pathways of the good and great His justice makes all regions safe and sure And against froward foes bars every gate Bold lion hero saint e en if you call Seraph or Sovran FN four hundred ninety three he with all may rate The poorest supplicant rich from him returns All words to praise him were inadequate He to the day of peace is saffron Morn And murky Night in furious warfare s bate Bow neath his gifts our necks and by his deeds As King of freeborn FN four hundred ninety four souls he joys his state Allah increase for us his term of years And from his lot avert all risks and fears When he had finished transcribing the lines he despatched them in charge of one of his uncle s slaves to the Sultan who perused them and his fancy was pleased so he read them to those present and all praised them with the highest praise Thereupon he sent for the writer to his sitting chamber and said to him Thou art from this day forth my boon companion and I appoint to thee a monthly solde of a thousand dirhams over and above that I bestowed on thee aforetime So Hasan rose and kissing the ground before the King several times prayed for the continuance of his greatness and glory and length of life and strength Thus Badr al Din Hasan the Bassorite waxed high in honour and his fame flew forth to many regions and he abode in all comfort and solace and delight of life with his uncle and his own folk till Death overtook him When the Caliph Harun al Rashid heard this story from the mouth of his Wazir Ja afar the Barmecide he marvelled much and said It behoves that these stories be written in letters of liquid gold Then he set the slave at liberty and assigned to the youth who had slain his wife such a monthly stipend as sufficed to make his life easy he also gave him a concubine from amongst his own slave girls and the young man became one of his cup companions Yet this story continued Shahrazad is in no wise stranger than the tale of the Tailor and the Hunchback and the Jew and the Reeve and the Nazarene and what betided them Quoth the King And what may that be So Shahrazad began in these words FN four hundred ninety five THE HUNCHBACK S TALE It hath reached me O auspicious King that there dwelt during times of yore and years and ages long gone before in a certain city of China FN four hundred ninety six a Tailor who was an open handed man that loved pleasuring and merry making and who was wont he and his wife to solace themselves from time to time with public diversions and amusements One day they went out with the first of the light and were returning in the evening when they fell in with a Hunchback whose semblance would draw a laugh from care and dispel the horrors of despair So they went up to enjoy looking at him and invited him to go home with them and converse and carouse with them that night He consented and accompanied them afoot to their home whereupon the Tailor fared forth to the bazaar night having just set in and bought a fried fish and bread and lemons and dry sweetmeats for dessert and set the victuals before the Hunchback and they ate Presently the Tailor s wife took a great fid of fish and gave it in a gobbet to the Gobbo stopping his mouth with her hand and saying By Allah thou must down with it at a single gulp and I will not give thee time to chew it So he bolted it but therein was a stiff bone which stuck in his gullet and his hour being come he died And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Twenty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Tailor s wife gave the Hunchback that mouthful of fish which ended his term of days he died on the instant Seeing this the Tailor cried aloud There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Alas that this poor wretch should have died in so foolish fashion at our hands and the woman rejoined Why this idle talk Hast thou not heard his saying who said Why then waste I my time in grief until I find no friend to bear my weight of woe How sleep upon a fire that flames unquenched Upon the flames to rest were hard enow Asked her husband And what shall I do with him and she answered Rise and take him in thine arms and spread a silken kerchief over him then I will fare forth with thee following me this very night and if thou meet any one say This is my son and his mother and I are carrying him to the doctor that he may look at him So he rose and taking the Hunchback in his arms bore him along the streets preceded by his wife who kept crying O my son Allah keep thee what part paineth thee and where hath this small pox FN four hundred ninety seven attacked thee So all who saw them said Tis a child sick of small pox FN four hundred ninety eight They went along asking for the physician s house till folk directed them to that of a leach which was a Jew They knocked at the door and there came down to them a black slave girl who opened and seeing a man bearing a babe and a woman with him said to them What is the matter We have a little one with us answered the Tailor s wife and we wish to show him to the physician so take this quarter dinar and give it to thy master and let him come down and see my son who is sore sick The girl went up to tell her master whereupon the Tailor s wife walked into the vestibule and said to her husband Leave the Hunchback here and let us fly for our lives So the Tailor carried the dead man to the top of the stairs and propped him upright against the wall and ran away he and his wife Meanwhile the girl went in to the Jew and said to him At the door are a man and a woman with a sick child and they have given me a quarter dinar for thee that thou mayest go down and look at the little one and prescribe for it As soon as the Jew saw the quarter dinar he rejoiced and rose quickly in his greed of gain and went forth hurriedly in the dark but hardly had he made a step when he stumbled on the corpse and threw it over when it rolled to the bottom of the staircase So he cried out to the girl to hurry up with the light and she brought it whereupon he went down and examining the Hunchback found that he was stone dead So he cried out O for Esdras FN four hundred ninety nine O for Moses O for Aaron O for Joshua son of Nun O the Ten Commandments I have stumbled against the sick one and he hath fallen downstairs and he is dead How shall I get this man I have killed out of my house O by the hoofs of the ass of Esdras Then he took up the body and carrying it into the house told his wife what had happened and she said to him Why dost thou sit still If thou keep him here till day break we shall both lose our lives Let us two carry him to the terrace roof and throw him over into the house of our neighbour the Moslem for if he abide there a night the dogs will come down on him from the adjoining terraces and eat him up Now his neighbour was a Reeve the controller of the Sultan s kitchen and was wont to bring back great store of oil and fat and broken meats but the cats and rats used to eat it or if the dogs scented a fat sheep s tail they would come down from the nearest roofs and tear at it and on this wise the beasts had already damaged much of what he brought home So the Jew and his wife carried the Hunchback up to the roof and letting him down by his hands and feet through the wind shaft FN five hundred into the Reeve s house propped him up against the wall and went their ways Hardly had they done this when the Reeve who had been passing an evening with his friends hearing a recitation of the Koran came home and opened the door and going up with a lighted candle found a son of Adam standing in the corner under the ventilator When he saw this he said Wah by Allah very good forsooth He who robbeth my stuff is none other than a man Then he turned to the Hunchback and said So tis thou that stealest the meat and the fat I thought it was the cats and dogs and I kill the dogs and cats of the quarter and sin against them by killing them And all the while tis thou comest down from the house terrace through the wind shaft But I will avenge myself upon thee with my own hand So he snatched up a heavy hammer and set upon him and smote him full on the breast and he fell down Then he examined him and finding that he was dead cried out in horror thinking that he had killed him and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great And he feared for his life and added Allah curse the oil and the meat and the grease and the sheep s tails to boot How hath fate given this man his quietus at my hand Then he looked at the body and seeing it was that of a Gobbo said Was it not enough for thee to be a hunchback FN five hundred one but thou must likewise be a thief and prig flesh and fat O thou Veiler FN five hundred two deign to veil me with Thy curtain of concealment So he took him up on his shoulders and going forth with him from his house about the latter end of the night carried him to the nearest end of the bazaar where he set him up on his feet against the wall of a shop at the head of a dark lane and left him and went away After a while up came a Nazarene FN five hundred three the Sultan s broker who much bemused with liquor was purposing for the Hammam bath as his drunkenness whispered in his ear Verily the call to matins FN five hundred four is nigh He came plodding along and staggering about till he drew near the Hunchback and squatted down to make water FN five hundred five over against him when he happened to glance around and saw a man standing against the wall Now some person had snatched off the Christian s turband FN five hundred six in the first of the night so when he saw the Hunchback hard by he fancied that he also meant to steal his headdress Thereupon he clenched his fist and struck him on the neck felling him to the ground and called aloud to the watchman of the bazaar and came down on the body in his drunken fury and kept on belabouring and throttling the corpse Presently the Charley came up and finding a Nazarene kneeling on a Moslem and frapping him asked What harm hath this one done and the Broker answered The fellow meant to snatch off my turband Get up from him quoth the watch man So he arose and the Charley went up to the Hunchback and finding him dead exclaimed By Allah good indeed A Christian killing a Mahometan Then he seized the Broker and tying his hands behind his back carried him to the Governor s house FN five hundred seven and all the while the Nazarene kept saying to himself O Messiah O Virgin how came I to kill this fellow And in what a hurry he must have been to depart this life when he died of a single blow Presently as his drunkenness fled came dolour in its stead So the Broker and the body were kept in the Governor s place till morning morrowed when the Wali came out and gave order to hang the supposed murderer and commanded the executioner FN five hundred eight make proclamation of the sentence Forthwith they set up a gallows under which they made the Nazarene stand and the torch bearer who was hangman threw the rope round his neck and passed one end through the pulley and was about to hoist him up FN five hundred nine when lo the Reeve who was passing by saw the Broker about to be hanged and making his way through the people cried out to the executioner Hold Hold I am he who killed the Hunchback Asked the Governor What made thee kill him and he answered I went home last night and there found this man who had come down the ventilator to steal my property so I smote him with a hammer on the breast and he died forthright Then I took him up and carried him to the bazaar and set him up against the wall in such a place near such a lane adding Is it not enough for me to have killed a Moslem without also killing a Christian So hang none other but me When the Governor heard these words he released the Broker and said to the torch bearer Hang up this man on his own confession So he loosed the cord from the Nazarene s neck and threw it round that of the Reeve and making him stand under the gallows tree was about to string him up when behold the Jewish physician pushed through the people and shouted to the executioner Hold Hold It was I and none else killed the Hunchback Last night I was sitting at home when a man and a woman knocked at the door carrying this Gobbo who was sick and gave my handmaid a quarter dinar bidding her hand me the fee and tell me to come down and see him Whilst she was gone the man and the woman brought him into the house and setting him on the stairs went away and presently I came down and not seeing him for I was in the dark stumbled over him and he fell to the foot of the staircase and died on the moment Then we took him up I and my wife and carried him on to the top terrace and the house of this Reeve being next door to mine we let the body down through the ventilator When he came home and found the Hunchback in his house he fancied he was a thief and struck him with a hammer so that he fell to the ground and our neighbour made certain that he had slain him Now is it not enough for me to have killed one Moslem unwittingly without burdening myself with taking the life of another Moslem wittingly When the Governor heard this he said to the hangman Set free the Reeve and hang the Jew Thereupon the torch bearer took him and slung the cord round his neck when behold the Tailor pushed through the people and shouted to the executioner Hold Hold It was I and none else killed the Hunchback and this was the fashion thereof I had been out a pleasuring yesterday and coming back to supper fell in with this Gobbo who was drunk and drumming away and singing lustily to his tambourine So I accosted him and carried him to my house and bought a fish and we sat down to eat Presently my wife took a fid of fish and making a gobbet of it FN five hundred ten crammed it into his mouth but some of it went down the wrong way or stuck in his gullet and he died on the instant So we lifted him up I and my wife and carried him to the Jew s house where the slave girl came down and opened the door to us and I said to her Tell thy master that there are a man and a woman and a sick person for thee to see I gave her a quarter dinar and she went up to tell her master and whilst she was gone I carried the Hunchback to the head of the staircase and propped him up against the wall and went off with my wife When the Jew came down he stumbled over him and thought that he had killed him Then he asked the Jew Is this the truth and the Jew answered Yes Thereupon the Tailor turned to the Governor and said Leave go the Jew and hang me When the Governor heard the Tailor s tale he marvelled at the matter of this Hunchback and exclaimed Verily this is an adventure which should be recorded in books Then he said to the hangman Let the Jew go and hang the Tailor on his own confession The executioner took the Tailor and put the rope around his neck and said I am tired of such slow work we bring out this one and change him for that other and no one is hanged after all Now the Hunchback in question was they relate jester to the Sultan of China who could not bear him out of his sight so when the fellow got drunk and did not make his appearance that night or the next day till noon the Sultan asked some of his courtiers about him and they answered O our lord the Governor hath come upon him dead and hath ordered his murderer to be hanged but as the hangman was about to hoist him up there came a second and a third and a fourth and each one said It is I and none else killed the Hunchback and each gave a full and circumstantial account of the manner of the jester being killed When the King heard this he cried aloud to the Chamberlain in waiting Go down to the Governor and bring me all four of them So the Chamberlain went down at once to the place of execution where he found the torch bearer on the point of hanging the Tailor and shouted to him Hold Hold Then he gave the King s command to the Governor who took the Tailor the Jew the Nazarene and the Reeve the Hunchback s body being borne on men s shoulders and went up with one and all of them to the King When he came into the presence he kissed the ground and acquainted the ruler with the whole story which it is needless to relate for as they say There is no avail in a thrice told tale The Sultan hearing it marvelled and was moved to mirth and commanded the story to be written in letters of liquid gold saying to those present Did ye ever hear a more wondrous tale than that of my Hunchback Thereupon the Nazarene broker came forward and said O King of the age with thy leave I will tell thee a thing which happened to myself and which is still more wondrous and marvellous and pleasurable and delectable than the tale of the Hunchback Quoth the King Tell us what thou hast to say So he began in these words The Nazarene Broker s Story O King of the age I came to this thy country with merchandise and Destiny stayed me here with you but my place of birth was Cairo in Egypt where I also was brought up for I am one of the Copts and my father was a broker before me When I came to man s estate he departed this life and I succeeded to his business One day as I was sitting in my shop behold there came up to me a youth as handsome as could be wearing sumptuous raiment and riding a fine ass FN five hundred eleven When he saw me he saluted me and I stood up to do him honour then he took out a kerchief containing a sample of sesame and asked How much is this worth per Ardabb FN five hundred twelve whereto I answered An hundred dirhams Quoth he Take porters and gaugers and metesmen and come tomorrow to the Khan al Jawali FN five hundred thirteen by the Gate of Victory quarter where thou wilt find me Then he fared forth leaving with me the sample of sesame in his kerchief and I went the round of my customers and ascertained that every Ardabb would fetch an hundred and twenty dirhams Next day I took four metesmen and walked with them to the Khan where I found him awaiting me As soon as he saw me he rose and opened his magazine when we measured the grain till the store was empty and we found the contents fifty Ardabbs making five thousand pieces of silver Then said he Let ten dirhams on every Ardabb be thy brokerage so take the price and keep in deposit four thousand and five hundred dirhams for me and when I have made an end of selling the other wares in my warehouses I will come to thee and receive the amount I will well replied I and kissing his hand went away having made that day a profit of a thousand dirhams He was absent a month at the end of which he came to me and asked Where be the dirhams I rose and saluted him and answered to him Wilt thou not eat somewhat in my house But he refused with the remark Get the monies ready and I will presently return and take them Then he rode away So I brought out the dirhams and sat down to await him but he stayed away for another month when he came back and said to me Where be the dirhams I rose and saluting him asked Wilt thou not eat some thing in my house But he again refused adding Get me the monies ready and I will presently return and take them Then he rode off So I brought out the dirhams and sat down to await his return but he stayed away from me a third month and I said Verily this young man is liberality in incarnate form At the end of the month he came up riding a mare mule and wearing a suit of sumptuous raiment he was as the moon on the night of fullness and he seemed as if fresh from the baths with his cheeks rosy bright and his brow flower white and a mole spot like a grain of ambergris delighting the sight even as was said of such an one by the poet Full moon with sun in single mansion In brightest sheen and fortune rose and shone With happy splendour changing every sprite Hail to what guerdons prayer with blissful boon Their charms and grace have gained perfection s height All hearts have conquered and all wits have won Laud to the Lord for works so wonder strange And what th Almighty wills His hand hath done When I saw him I rose to him and invoking blessings on him asked O my lord wilt thou not take thy monies Whence the hurry FN five hundred fourteen quoth he Wait till I have made an end of my business and then I will come and take them Again he rode away and I said to myself By Allah when he comes next time needs must I make him my guest for I have traded with his dirhams and have gotten large gains thereby At the end of the year he came again habited in a suit of clothes more sumptuous than the former and when I conjured him by the Evangel to alight at my house and eat of my guest food he said I consent on condition that what thou expendest on me shall be of my monies still in thy hands I answered So be it and made him sit down whilst I got ready what was needful of meat and drink and else besides and set the tray before him with the invitation Bismillah FN five hundred fifteen Then he drew near the tray and put out his left hand FN five hundred sixteen and ate with me and I marvelled at his not using the right hand When we had done eating I poured water on his hand and gave him wherewith to wipe it Upon this we sat down to converse after I had set before him some sweetmeats and I said to him O my master prithee relieve me by telling me why thou eatest with thy left hand Perchance something aileth thy other hand When he heard my words he repeated these verses Dear friend ask not what burneth in my breast Lest thou see fiery pangs eye never saw Wills not my heart to harbour Salma in stead Of Layla s FN five hundred seventeen love but need hath ne er a law And he put out his right arm from his sleeve and behold the hand was cut off a wrist without a fist I was astounded at this but he said Marvel not and think not that I ate with my left hand for conceit and insolence but from necessity and the cutting off my right hand was caused by an adventure of the strangest Asked I And what caused it and he answered Know that I am of the sons of Baghdad and my father was of notables of that city When I came to man s estate I heard the pilgrims and wayfarers travellers and merchants talk of the land of Egypt and their words sank deep into my mind till my parent died when I took a large sum of money and furnished myself for trade with stuffs of Baghdad and Mosul and packing them up in bales set out on my wanderings and Allah decreed me safety till I entered this your city Then he wept and began repeating The blear eyed scapes the pits Wherein the lynx eyed fall A word the wise man slays And saves the natural The Moslem fails of food The Kafir feasts in hall What art or act is man s God s will obligeth all Now when he had ended his verse he said So I entered Cairo and took off my loads and stored my stuffs in the Khan Al Masrur FN five hundred eighteen Then I gave the servant a few silvers wherewith to buy me some food and lay down to sleep awhile When I awoke I went to the street called Bayn al Kasrayn Between the two Palaces and presently returned and rested my night in the Khan When it was morning I opened a bale and took out some stuff saying to myself I will be off and go through some of the bazaars and see the state of the market So I loaded the stuff on some of my slaves and fared forth till I reached the Kaysariyah or Exchange of Jaharkas FN five hundred nineteen where the brokers who knew of my coming came to meet me They took the stuffs and cried them for sale but could not get the prime cost of them I was vexed at this however the Shaykh of the brokers said to me O my lord I will tell thee how thou mayest make a profit of thy goods Thou shouldest do as the merchants do and sell thy merchandise at credit for a fixed period on a contract drawn up by a notary and duly witnessed and employ a Shroff to take thy dues every Monday and Thursday So shalt thou gain two dirhams and more for every one and thou shalt solace and divert thyself by seeing Cairo and the Nile Quoth I This is sound advice and carried the brokers to the Khan They took my stuffs and went with them on Change where I sold them well taking bonds for the value These bonds I deposited with a Shroff a banker who gave me a receipt with which I returned to the Khan Here I stayed a whole month every morning breaking my fast with a cup of wine and making my meals on pigeon s meat mutton and sweetmeats till the time came when my receipts began to fall due So every Monday and Thursday I used to go on Change and sit in the shop of one or other of the merchants whilst the notary and money changer went round to recover the monies from the traders till after the time of mid afternoon prayer when they brought me the amount and I counted it and sealing the bags returned with them to the Khan On a certain day which happened to be a Monday FN five hundred twenty I went to the Hammam and thence back to my Khan and sitting in my own room FN five hundred twenty one broke my fast with a cup of wine after which I slept a little When I awoke I ate a chicken and perfuming my person repaired to the shop of a merchant hight Badr al Din al Bostani or the Gardener FN five hundred twenty two who welcomed me and we sat talking awhile till the bazaar should open Presently behold up came a lady of stately figure wearing a head dress of the most magnificent perfumed with the sweetest of scents and walking with graceful swaying gait and seeing me she raised her mantilla allowing me a glimpse of her beautiful black eyes She saluted Badr al Din who returned her salutation and stood up and talked with her and the moment I heard her speak the love of her got hold of my heart Presently she said to Badr al Din Hast thou by thee a cut piece of stuff woven with thread of pure gold So he brought out to her a piece from those he had bought of me and sold it to her for one thousand two hundred dirhams when she said I will take the piece home with me and send thee its price That is impossible O my lady the merchant replied for here is the owner of the stuff and I owe him a share of profit Fie upon thee she cried Do I not use to take from thee entire rolls of costly stuff and give thee a greater profit than thou expectest and send thee the money Yes rejoined he but I stand in pressing need of the price this very day Hereupon she took up the piece and threw it back upon his lap saying Out on thee Allah confound the tribe of you which estimates none at the right value and she turned to go I felt my very soul going with her so I stood up and stayed her saying I conjure thee by the Lord O my lady favour me by retracing thy gracious steps She turned back with a smile and said For thy sake I return and took a seat opposite me in the shop Then quoth I to Badr al Din What is the price they asked thee for this piece and quoth he Eleven hundred dirhams I rejoined The odd hundred shall be thy profit bring me a sheet of paper and I will write thee a discharge for it Then I wrote him a receipt in my own handwriting and gave the piece to the lady saying Take it away with thee and if thou wilt bring me its price next bazaar day or better still accept it as my guest gift to thee Allah requite thee with good answered she and make thee my husband and lord and master of all I have FN five hundred twenty three And Allah favoured her prayer I saw the Gates of Paradise swing open before me and said O my lady let this piece of stuff be now thine and another like it is ready for thee only let me have one look at thy face So she raised her veil and I saw a face the sight of which bequeathed to me a thousand sighs and my heart was so captivated by her love that I was no longer ruler of my reason Then she let fall her face veil and taking up the piece of stuff said O my lord make me not desolate by thine absence and turned away and disappeared from my sight I remained sitting on Change till past the hour of after noon prayer lost to the world by the love which had mastered me and the violence of my passion compelled me to make enquiries concerning her of the merchant who answered me This is a lady and a rich she is the daughter of a certain Emir who lately died and left her a large fortune Then I took leave of him and returned home to the Khan where they set supper before me but I could not eat for thinking of her and when I lay down to sleep sleep came not near me So I watched till morning when I arose and donned a change of raiment and drank a cup of wine and after breaking my fast on some slight matter I went to the merchant s shop where I saluted him and sat down by him Presently up came the lady as usual followed by a slave girl and wearing a dress more sumptuous than before and she saluted me without noticing Badr al Din and said in fluent graceful speech never heard I voice softer or sweeter Send one with me to take the thousand and two hundred dirhams the price of the piece Why this hurry asked I and she answered May we never lose thee FN five hundred twenty four and handed me the money Then I sat talking with her and presently I signed to her in dumb show whereby she understood that I longed to enjoy her person FN five hundred twenty five and she rose up in haste with a show of displeasure My heart clung to her and I went forth from the bazaar and followed on her track As I was walking suddenly a black slave girl stopped me and said O my master come speak with my mistress FN five hundred twenty six At this I was surprised and replied There is none who knows me here but she rejoined zero my lord how soon hast thou forgotten her My lady is the same who was this day at the shop of such a merchant Then I went with her to the Shroff s where I found the lady who drew me to her side and said O my beloved thine image is firmly stamped upon my fancy and love of thee hath gotten hold of my heart from the hour I first saw thee nor sleep nor food nor drink hath given me aught of pleasure I replied The double of that suffering is mine and my state dispenseth me from complaint Then said she O my beloved at thy house or at mine I am a stranger here and have no place of reception save the Khan so by thy favour it shall be at thy house So be it but this is Friday FN five hundred twenty seven night and nothing can be done till tomorrow after public prayers go to the Mosque and pray then mount thine ass and ask for the Habbaniyah FN five hundred twenty eight quarter and when there look out for the mansion of Al Nakib FN five hundred twenty nine Barakat popularly known as Abu Shamah the Syndic for I live there so do not delay as I shall be expecting thee I rejoiced with still greater joy at this and took leave of her and returned to my Khan where I passed a sleepless night Hardly was I assured that morning had dawned when I rose changed my dress perfumed myself with essences and sweet scents and taking fifty dinars in a kerchief went from the Khan Masrur to the Zuwaylah FN five hundred thirty gate where I mounted an ass and said to its owner Take me to the Habbaniyah So he set off with me and brought up in the twinkling of an eye at a street known as Darb al Munkari where I said to him Go in and ask for the Syndic s mansion He was absent a while and then returned and said Alight Go thou before me to the house quoth I adding Come back with the earliest light and bring me home and he answered In Allah s name whereupon I gave him a quarter dinar of gold and he took it and went his ways Then I knocked at the door and out came two white slave girls both young high bosomed virgins as they were moons and said to me Enter for our mistress is expecting thee and she hath not slept the night long for her delight in thee I passed through the vestibule into a saloon with seven doors floored with parti coloured marbles and furnished with curtains and hangings of coloured silks the ceiling was cloisonne with gold and corniced with inscriptions FN five hundred thirty one emblazoned in lapis lazuli and the walls were stuccoed with Sultani gypsum FN five hundred thirty two which mirrored the beholder s face Around the saloon were latticed windows overlooking a garden full of all manner of fruits whose streams were railing and riffling and whose birds were trilling and shrilling and in the heart of the hall was a jetting fountain at whose corners stood birds fashioned in red gold crusted with pearls and gems and spouting water crystal clear When I entered and took a seat And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Twenty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the young merchant continued When I entered and took a seat the lady at once came in crowned with a diadem FN five hundred thirty three of pearls and jewels her face dotted with artificial moles in indigo FN five hundred thirty four her eyebrows pencilled with Kohl and her hands and feet reddened with Henna When she saw me she smiled in my face and took me to her embrace and clasped me to her breast then she put her mouth to my mouth and sucked my tongue FN five hundred thirty five and I did likewise and said Can it be true O my little darkling thou art come to me adding Welcome and good cheer to thee By Allah from the day I saw thee sleep hath not been sweet to me nor hath food been pleasant Quoth I Such hath also been my case and I am thy slave thy negro slave Then we sat down to converse and I hung my head earthwards in bashfulness but she delayed not long ere she set before me a tray of the most exquisite viands marinated meats fritters soaked in bee s FN five hundred thirty six honeys and chickens stuffed with sugar and pistachio nuts whereof we ate till we were satisfied Then they brought basin and ewer and I washed my hands and we scented ourselves with rose water musk d and sat down again to converse So she began repeating these couplets FN five hundred thirty seven Had we wist of thy coming thy way had been strewn With the blood of our heart and the balls of our sight Our cheek as a foot cloth to greet thee been thrown That thy step on our eyelids should softly alight And she kept plaining of what had befallen her and I of what had betided me and love of her got so firm hold of my heart that all my wealth seemed a thing of naught in comparison with her Then we fell to toying and groping and kissing till night fall when the handmaidens set before us meats and a complete wine service and we sat carousing till the noon of night when we lay down and I lay with her never in my life saw I a night like that night When morning morrowed I arose and took leave of her throwing under the carpet bed the kerchief wherein were the dinars FN five hundred thirty eight and as I went out she wept and said O my lord when shall I look upon that lovely face again I will be with thee at sunset answered I and going out found the donkey boy who had brought me the day before awaiting at the door So I mounted ass and rode to the Khan of Masrur where I alighted and gave the man a half dinar saying Return at sunset and he said I will Then I breakfasted and went out to seek the price of my stuffs after which I returned and taking a roast lamb and some sweetmeats called a porter and put the provision in his crate and sent it to the lady paying the man his hire FN five hundred thirty nine I went back to my business till sunset when the ass driver came to me and I took fifty dinars in a kerchief and rode to her house where I found the marble floor swept the brasses burnisht the branch lights burning the wax candles ready lighted the meat served up and the wine strained FN five hundred forty When my lady saw me she threw her arms about my neck and cried Thou hast desolated me by thine absence Then she set the tables before me and we ate till we were satisfied when the slave girls carried off the trays and served up wine We gave not over drinking till half the night was past and being well warmed with drink we went to the sleeping chamber and lay there till morning I then arose and fared forth from her leaving the fifty dinars with her as before and finding the donkey boy at the door rode to the Khan and slept awhile After that I went out to make ready the evening meal and took a brace of geese with gravy on two platters of dressed and peppered rice and got ready colocasia FN five hundred forty one roots fried and soaked in honey and wax candles and fruits and conserves and nuts and almonds and sweet scented cowers and I sent them all to her As soon as it was night I again tied up fifty dinars in a kerchief and mounting the ass as usual rode to the mansion where we ate and drank and lay together till morning when I threw the kerchief and dinars to her FN five hundred forty two and rode back to the Khan I ceased not doing after that fashion till after a sweet night I woke one fine morning and found myself beggared dinar less and dirhamless So said I to myself All this be Satan s work and began to recite these couplets Poverty dims the sheen of man whate er his wealth has been E en as the sun about to set shines with a yellowing light Absent he falls from memory forgotten by his friends Present he shareth not their joys for none in him delight He walks the market shunned of all too glad to hide his head In desert places tears he sheds and moans his bitter plight By Allah mid his kith and kin a man however good Waylaid by want and penury is but a stranger wight I fared forth from the Khan and walked down Between the Palaces street till I came to the Zuwaylah Porte where I found the people crowding and the gateway blocked for the much folk And by the decree of Destiny I saw there a trooper against whom I pressed unintentionally so that my hand came upon his bosom pocket and I felt a purse inside it I looked and seeing a string of green silk hanging from the pocket knew it for a purse and the crush grew greater every minute and just then a camel laden with a load of fuel happened to jostle the trooper on the opposite side and he turned round to fend it off from him lest it tear his clothes and Satan tempted me so I pulled the string and drew out a little bag of blue silk containing something which chinked like coin But the soldier feeling his pocket suddenly lightened put his hand to it and found it empty whereupon he turned to me and snatching up his mace from his saddle bow struck me with it on the head I fell to the ground whilst the people came round us and seizing the trooper s mare by the bridle said to him Strikest thou this youth such a blow as this for a mere push But the trooper cried out at them This fellow is an accursed thief Whereupon I came to myself and stood up and the people looked at me and said Nay he is a comely youth he would not steal anything and some of them took my part and others were against me and question and answer waxed loud and warm The people pulled at me and would have rescued me from his clutches but as fate decreed behold the Governor the Chief of Police and the watch FN five hundred forty three entered the Zuwaylah Gate at this moment and seeing the people gathered together around me and the soldier the Governor asked What is the matter By Allah O Emir answered the trooper this is a thief I had in my pocket a purse of blue silk lined with twenty good gold pieces and he took it whilst I was in the crush Quoth the Governor Was any one by thee at the time and quoth the soldier No Thereupon the Governor cried out to the Chief of Police who seized me and on this wise the curtain of the Lord s protection was withdrawn from me Then he said Strip him and when they stripped me they found the purse in my clothes The Wali took it opened it and counted it and finding in it twenty dinars as the soldier had said waxed exceeding wroth and bade his guard bring me before him Then said he to me Now O youth speak truly didst thou steal this purse FN five hundred forty four At this I hung my head to the ground and said to myself If I deny having stolen it I shall get myself into terrible trouble So I raised my head and said Yes I took it When the Governor heard these words he wondered and summoned witnesses who came forward and attested my confession All this happened at the Zuwaylah Gate Then the Governor ordered the link bearer to cut off my right hand and he did so after which he would have struck off my left foot also but the heart of the soldier softened and he took pity on me and interceded for me with the Governor that I should not be slain FN five hundred forty five Thereupon the Wali left me and went away and the folk remained round me and gave me a cup of wine to drink As for the trooper he pressed the purse upon me and said Thou art a comely youth and it befitteth not thou be a thief So I repeated these verses I swear by Allah s name fair sir no thief was I Nor O thou best of men was I a bandit bred But Fortune s change and chance o erthrew me suddenly And cark and care and penury my course misled I shot it not indeed twas Allah shot the shaft That rolled in dust the Kingly diadem from my head FN five hundred forty six The soldier turned away after giving me the purse and I also went my ways having wrapped my hand in a piece of rag and thrust it into my bosom My whole semblance had changed and my colour had waxed yellow from the shame and pain which had befallen me Yet I went on to my mistress s house where in extreme perturbation of spirit I threw myself down on the carpet bed She saw me in this state and asked me What aileth thee and why do I see thee so changed in looks and I answered My head paineth me and I am far from well Whereupon she was vexed and was concerned on my account and said Burn not my heart O my lord but sit up and raise thy head and recount to me what hath happened to thee today for thy face tells me a tale Leave this talk replied I But she wept and said Me seems thou art tired of me for I see thee contrary to thy wont But I was silent and she kept on talking to me albeit I gave her no answer till night came on Then she set food before me but I refused it fearing lest she see me eating with my left hand and said to her I have no stomach to eat at present Quoth she Tell me what hath befallen thee to day and why art thou so sorrowful and broken in spirit and heart Quoth I Wait awhile I will tell thee all at my leisure Then she brought me wine saying Down with it this will dispel thy grief thou must indeed drink and tell me of thy tidings I asked her Perforce must I tell thee and she answered Yes Then said I If it needs must be so then give me to drink with thine own hand She filled and drank FN five hundred forty seven and filled again and gave me the cup which I took from her with my left hand and wiped the tears from my eyelids and began repeating When Allah willeth aught befall a man Who hath of ears and eyes and wits full share His ears He deafens and his eyes He blinds And draws his wits e en as we draw a hair FN five hundred forty eight Till having wrought His purpose He restores Man s wits that warned more circumspect he fare When I ended my verses I wept and she cried out with an exceeding loud cry What is the cause of thy tears Thou burnest my heart What makes thee take the cup with thy left hand Quoth I Truly I have on my right hand a boil and quoth she Put it out and I will open it for thee FN five hundred forty nine It is not yet time to open it I replied so worry me not with thy words for I will not take it out of the bandage at this hour Then I drank off the cup and she gave not over plying me with drink until drunkenness overcame me and I fell asleep in the place where I was sitting whereupon she looked at my right hand and saw a wrist without a fist So she searched me closely and found with me the purse of gold and my severed hand wrapped up in the bit of rag FN five hundred fifty With this such sorrow came upon her as never overcame any and she ceased not lamenting on my account till the morning When I awoke I found that she had dressed me a dish of broth of four boiled chickens which she brought to me together with a cup of wine I ate and drank and laying down the purse would have gone out but she said to me Whither away and I answered Where my business calleth me and said she Thou shalt not go sit thee down So I sat down and she resumed Hath thy love for me so overpowered thee that thou hast wasted all thy wealth and hast lost thine hand on my account I take thee to witness against me and also Allah be my witness that I will never part with thee but will die under thy feet and soon thou shalt see that my words are true Then she sent for the Kazi and witnesses and said to them Write my contract of marriage with this young man and bear ye witness that I have received the marriage settlement FN five hundred fifty one When they had drawn up the document she said Be witness that all my monies which are in this chest and all I have in slaves and handmaidens and other property is given in free gift to this young man So they took act of this statement enabling me to assume possession in right of marriage and then withdrew after receiving their fees Thereupon she took me by the hand and leading me to a closet opened a large chest and said to me See what is herein and I looked and behold it was full of kerchiefs Quoth she This is the money I had from thee and every kerchief thou gavest me containing fifty dinars I wrapped up and cast into this chest so now take thine own for it returns to thee and this day thou art become of high estate Fortune and Fate afflicted thee so that thou didst lose thy right hand for my sake and I can never requite thee nay although I gave my life twere but little and I should still remain thy debtor Then she added Take charge of thy property so I transferred the contents of her chest to my chest and added my wealth to her wealth which I had given her and my heart was eased and my sorrow ceased I stood up and kissed her and thanked her and she said Thou hast given thy hand for love of me and how am I able to give thee an equivalent By Allah if I offered my life for thy love it were indeed but little and would not do justice to thy claim upon me Then she made over to me by deed all that she possessed in clothes and ornaments of gold and pearls and goods and farms and chattels and lay not down to sleep that night being sorely grieved for my grief till I told her the whole of what had befallen me I passed the night with her But before we had lived together a month s time she fell sorely sick and illness increased upon her by reason of her grief for the loss of my hand and she endured but fifty days before she was numbered among the folk of futurity and heirs of immortality So I laid her out and buried her body in mother earth and let make a pious perfection of the Koran FN five hundred fifty two for the health of her soul and gave much money in alms for her after which I turned me from the grave and returned to the house There I found that she had left much substance in ready money and slaves mansions lands and domains and among her store houses was a granary of sesame seed whereof I sold part to thee and I had neither time nor inclination to take count with thee till I had sold the rest of the stock in store nor indeed even now have I made an end of receiving the price So I desire thou baulk me not in what I am about to say to thee twice have I eaten of thy food and I wish to give thee as a present the monies for the sesame which are by thee Such is the cause of the cutting off my right hand and my eating with my left Indeed said I thou hast shown me the utmost kindness and liberality Then he asked me Why shouldst thou not travel with me to my native country whither I am about to return with Cairene and Alexandrian stuffs Say me wilt thou accompany me and I answered I will So I agreed to go with him at the head of the month and I sold all I had and bought other merchandise then we set out and travelled I and the young man to this country of yours where he sold his venture and bought other investment of country stuffs and continued his journey to Egypt But it was my lot to abide here so that these things befell me in my strangerhood which befell last night and is not this tale O King of the age more wondrous and marvellous than the story of the Hunchback Not so quoth the King I cannot accept it there is no help for it but that you be hanged every one of you And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Twenty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King of China declared There is no help for it but that you be hanged the Reeve of the Sultan s Kitchen came forward and said If thou permit me I will tell thee a tale of what befell me just before I found this Gobbo and if it be more wondrous than his story do thou grant us our lives And when the King answered Yes he began to recount The Reeve s Tale Know O King that last night I was at a party where they made a perfection of the Koran and got together doctors of law and religion skilled in recitation and intoning and when the readers ended the table was spread and amongst other things they set before us was a marinated ragout FN five hundred fifty three flavoured with cumin seed So we sat down but one of our number held back and refused to touch it We conjured him to eat of it but he swore he would not and when we again pressed him he said Be not instant with me sufficeth me that which hath already befallen me through eating it and he began reciting Shoulder thy tray and go straight to thy goal And if suit thee this Kohl why use this Kohl FN five hundred fifty four When he ended his verse we said to him Allah upon thee tell us thy reason for refusing to eat of the cumin ragout If so it be he replied and needs must I eat of it I will not do so except I wash my hand forty times with soap forty times with potash and forty times with galangale FN five hundred fifty five the total being one hundred and twenty washings Thereupon the hospitable host bade his slaves bring water and whatso he required and the young man washed his hand as afore mentioned Then he sat down as if disgusted and frightened withal and dipping his hand in the ragout began eating and at the same time showing signs of anger And we wondered at him with extreme wonderment for his hand trembled and the morsel in it shook and we saw that his thumb had been cut off and he ate with his four fingers only So we said to him Allah upon thee what happened to thy thumb Is thy hand thus by the creation of God or hath some accident befallen it O my brothers he answered it is not only thus with this thumb but also with my other thumb and with both my great toes as you shall see So saying he uncovered his left hand and his feet and we saw that the left hand was even as the right and in like manner that each of his feet lacked its great toe When we saw him after this fashion our amazement waxed still greater and we said to him We have hardly patience enough to await thy history and to hear the manner of the cutting off of thy thumbs and the reason of thy washing both hands one hundred and twenty times Know then said he that my father was chief of the merchants and the wealthiest of them all in Baghdad city during the reign of the Caliph Harun al Rashid and he was much given to wine drinking and listening to the lute and the other instruments of pleasaunce so that when he died he left nothing I buried him and had perlections of the Koran made for him and mourned for him days and nights then I opened his shop and found that he had left in it few goods while his debts were many However I compounded with his creditors for time to settle their demands and betook myself to buying and selling paying them something from week to week on account and I gave not over doing this till I had cleared off his obligations in full and began adding to my principal One day as I sat in my shop suddenly and unexpectedly there appeared before me a young lady than whom I never saw a fairer wearing the richest raiment and ornaments and riding a she mule with one negro slave walking before her and another behind her She drew rein at the head of the exchange bazaar and entered followed by an eunuch who said to her O my lady come out and away without telling anyone lest thou light a fire which will burn us all up Moreover he stood before her guarding her from view whilst she looked at the merchants shops She found none open but mine so she came up with the eunuch behind her and sitting down in my shop saluted me never heard I aught fairer than her speech or sweeter than her voice Then she unveiled her face and I saw that she was like the moon and I stole a glance at her whose sight caused me a thousand sighs and my heart was captivated with love of her and I kept looking again and again upon her face repeating these verses Say to the charmer in the dove hued veil Death would be welcome to abate thy bale Favour me with thy favours that I live See I stretch forth my palm to take thy vail When she heard my verse she answered me saying I ve lost all patience by despite of you My heart knows nothing save love plight to you If aught I sight save charms so bright of you My parting end not in the sight of you I swear I ll ne er forget the right of you And fain this breast would soar to height of you You made me drain the love cup and I lief A love cup tender for delight of you Take this my form where er you go and when You die entomb me in the site of you Call on me in my grave and hear my bones Sigh their responses to the shright of you And were I asked Of God what wouldst thou see I answer first His will then Thy decree When she ended her verse she asked me O youth hast thou any fair stuffs by thee and I answered O my lady thy slave is poor but have patience till the merchants open their shops and I will suit thee with what thou wilt Then we sat talking I and she and I was drowned in the sea of her love dazed in the desert FN five hundred fifty six of my passion for her till the merchants opened their shops when I rose and fetched her all she sought to the tune of five thousand dirhams She gave the stuff to the eunuch and going forth by the door of the Exchange she mounted mule and went away without telling me whence she came and I was ashamed to speak of such trifle When the merchants dunned me for the price I made myself answerable for five thousand dirhams and went home drunken with the love of her They set supper before me and I ate a mouthful thinking only of her beauty and loveliness and sought to sleep but sleep came not to me And such was my condition for a whole week when the merchants required their monies of me but I persuaded them to have patience for another week at the end of which time she again appeared mounted on a she mule and attended by her eunuch and two slaves She saluted me and said O my master we have been long in bringing thee the price of the stuffs but now fetch the Shroff and take thy monies So I sent for the money changer and the eunuch counted out the coin before him and made it over to me Then we sat talking I and she till the market opened when she said to me Get me this and that So I got her from the merchants whatso she wanted and she took it and went away without saying a word to me about the price As soon as she was out of sight I repented me of what I had done for the worth of the stuffs bought for her amounted to a thousand dinars and I said in my soul What manner of love is this She hath brought me five thousand dirhams and hath taken goods for a thousand dinars FN five hundred fifty seven I feared lest I should be beggared through having to pay the merchants their money and I said They know none other but me this lovely lady is naught but a cheat and a swindler who hath diddled me with her beauty and grace for she saw that I was a mere youth and laughed at me for not asking her address I ceased not to be troubled by these doubts and fears as she was absent more than a month till the merchants pestered me for their money and were so hard upon me that I put up my property for sale and stood on the very brink of ruin However as I was sitting in my shop one day drowned in melancholy musings she suddenly rode up and dismounting at the bazaar gate came straight towards me When I saw her all my cares fell from me and I forgot every trouble She came close up to me and greeted me with her sweet voice and pleasant speech and presently said Fetch me the Shroff and weigh thy money FN five hundred fifty eight So she gave me the price of what goods I had gotten for her and more and fell to talking freely with me till I was like to die of joy and delight Presently she asked me Hast thou a wife and I answered No indeed I have never known woman and began to shed tears Quoth she Why weepest thou Quoth I It is nothing Then giving the eunuch some of the gold pieces I begged him to be go between FN five hundred fifty nine in the matter but he laughed and said She is more in love with thee than thou with her she hath no occasion for the stuffs she hath bought of thee and did all this only for the love of thee so ask of her what thou wilt and she will deny thee nothing When she saw me giving the dinars to the eunuch she returned and sat down again and I said to her Be charitable to thy slave and pardon him what he is about to say Then I told her what was in my mind and she assented and said to the eunuch Thou shalt carry my message to him adding to me And do thou whatso the eunuch biddeth thee Then she got up and went away and I paid the merchants their monies and they all profited but as for me regret at the breaking off of our intercourse was all my gain and I slept not the whole of that night However before many days passed her eunuch came to me and I entreated him honourably and asked him after his mistress Truly she is sick with love of thee he replied and I rejoined Tell me who and what she is Quoth he The Lady Zubaydah queen consort of Harun al Rashid brought her up as a rearling FN five hundred sixty and hath advanced her to be stewardess of the Harim and gave her the right of going in and out of her own sweet will She spoke to her lady of thee and begged her to marry her to thee but she said I will not do this till I see the young man and if he be worthy of thee I will marry thee to him So now we look for the moment to smuggle thee into the Palace and if thou succeed in entering privily thou wilt win thy wish to wed her but if the affair get wind the Lady Zubaydah will strike off thy head FN five hundred sixty one What sayest thou to this I answered I will go with thee and abide the risk whereof thou speakest Then said he As soon as it is night go to the Mosque built by the Lady Zubaydah on the Tigris and pray the night prayers and sleep there With love and gladness cried I So at nightfall I repaired to the Mosque where I prayed and passed the night With earliest dawn behold came sundry eunuchs in a skiff with a number of empty chests which they deposited in the Mosque then all of them went their ways but one and looking curiously at him I saw he was our go between Presently in came the handmaiden my mistress walking straight up to us and I rose to her and embraced her while she kissed me and shed tears FN five hundred sixty two We talked awhile after which she made me get into one of the chests which she locked upon me Presently the other eunuchs came back with a quantity of packages and she fell to stowing them in the chests which she locked down one by one till all were shut When all was done the eunuchs embarked the chests in the boat and made for the Lady Zubaydah s palace With this thought began to beset me and I said to myself Verily thy lust and wantonness will be the death of thee and the question is after all shalt thou win to thy wish or not And I began to weep boxed up as I was in the box and suffering from cramp and I prayed Allah that He deliver me from the dangerous strait I was in whilst the boat gave not over going on till it reached the Palace gate where they lifted out the chests and amongst them that in which I was Then they carried them in passing through a troop of eunuchs guardians of the Harim and of the ladies behind the curtain till they came to the post of the Eunuch in Chief FN five hundred sixty three who started up from his slumbers and shouted to the damsel What is in those chests They are full of wares for the Lady Zubaydah Open them one by one that I may see what is in them And wherefore wouldst thou open them Give me no words and exceed not in talk These chests must and shall be opened So saying he sprang to his feet and the first which they brought to him to open was that wherein I was and when I felt his hands upon it my senses failed me and I bepissed myself in my funk the water running out of the box Then said she to the Eunuch in Chief O steward thou wilt cause me to be killed and thyself too for thou hast damaged goods worth ten thousand dinars This chest contains coloured dresses and four gallon flasks of Zemzem water FN five hundred sixty four and now one of them hath got unstoppered and the water is running out over the clothes and it will spoil their colours The eunuch answered Take up thy boxes and get thee gone to the curse of God So the slaves carried off all the chests including mine and hastened on with them till suddenly I heard the voice of one saying Alack and alack the Caliph the Caliph When that cry struck mine ears I died in my skin and said a saying which never yet shamed the sayer There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great I and only I have brought this calamity upon myself Presently I heard the Caliph say to my mistress A plague on thee what is in those boxes and she answered Dresses for the Lady Zubaydah FN five hundred sixty five whereupon he Open them before me When I heard this I died my death outright and said to myself By Allah today is the very last of my days in this world if I come safe out of this I am to marry her and no more words but detection stares me in the face and my head is as good as stricken off Then I repeated the profession of Faith saying There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Twenty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the young merchant continued as follows Now when I testified I bear witness that there is no god save the God I heard my mistress the handmaid declare to the Caliph These chests O Commander of the Faithful have been committed to my charge by the Lady Zubaydah and she doth not wish their contents to be seen by any one No matter quoth the Caliph needs must they be opened I will see what is in them and he cried aloud to the eunuchs Bring the chests here before me At this I made sure of death without benefit of a doubt and swooned away Then the eunuchs brought the chests up to him one after another and he fell to inspecting the contents but he saw in them only otters and stuffs and fine dresses and they ceased not opening the chests and he ceased not looking to see what was in them finding only clothes and such matters till none remained unopened but the box in which I was boxed They put forth their hands to open it but my mistress the handmaid made haste and said to the Caliph This one thou shalt see only in the presence of the Lady Zubaydah for that which is in it is her secret When he heard this he gave orders to carry in the chests so they took up that wherein I was and bore it with the rest into the Harim and set it down in the midst of the saloon and indeed my spittle was dried up for very fear FN five hundred sixty six Then my mistress opened the box and took me out saying Fear not no harm shall betide thee now nor dread but broaden thy breast and strengthen thy heart and sit thee down till the Lady Zubaydah come and surely thou shalt win thy wish of me So I sat down and after a while in came ten hand maidens virgins like moons and ranged themselves in two rows five facing five and after them twenty other damsels high bosomed virginity surrounding the Lady Zubaydah who could hardly walk for the weight of her raiment and ornaments As she drew near the slave girls dispersed from around her and I advanced and kissed the ground between her hands She signed to me to sit and when I sat down before her chair she began questioning me of my forbears and family and condition to which I made such answers that pleased her and she said to my mistress Our nurturing of thee O damsel hath not disappointed us Then she said to me Know that this handmaiden is to us even as our own child and she is a trust committed to thee by Allah I again kissed the ground before her well pleased that I should marry my mistress and she bade me abide ten days in the palace So I abode there ten days during which time I saw not my mistress nor anybody save one of the concubines who brought me the morning and evening meals After this the Lady Zubaydah took counsel with the Caliph on the marriage of her favourite handmaid and he gave leave and assigned to her a wedding portion of ten thousand gold pieces So the Lady Zubaydah sent for the Kazi and witnesses who wrote our marriage contract after which the women made ready sweetmeats and rich viands and distributed them among all the Odahs FN five hundred sixty seven of the Harim Thus they did other ten days at the end of which time my mistress went to the baths FN five hundred sixty eight Meanwhile they set before me a tray of food where on were various meats and among those dishes which were enough to daze the wits was a bowl of cumin ragout containing chickens breasts fricandoed FN five hundred sixty nine and flavoured with sugar pistachios musk and rose water Then by Allah fair sirs I did not long hesitate but took my seat before the ragout and fell to and ate of it till I could no more After this I wiped my hands but forgot to wash them and sat till it grew dark when the wax candles were lighted and the singing women came in with their tambourines and proceeded to display the bride in various dresses and to carry her in procession from room to room all round the palace getting their palms crossed with gold Then they brought her to me and disrobed her When I found myself alone with her on the bed I embraced her hardly believing in our union but she smelt the strong odours of the ragout upon my hands and forth with cried out with an exceeding loud cry at which the slave girls came running to her from all sides I trembled with alarm unknowing what was the matter and the girls asked her What aileth thee O our sister She answered them Take this mad man away from me I had thought he was a man of sense Quoth I to her What makes thee think me mad Quoth she Thou madman what made thee eat of cumin ragout and forget to wash thy hand By Allah I will requite thee for thy misconduct Shall the like of thee come to bed with the like of me with unclean hands FN five hundred seventy Then she took from her side a plaited scourge and came down with it on my back and the place where I sit till her forearms were benumbed and I fainted away from the much beating when she said to the handmaids Take him and carry him to the Chief of Police that he may strike off the hand wherewith he ate of the cumin ragout and which he did not wash When I heard this I said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Wilt thou cut off my hand because I ate of a cumin ragout and did not wash The handmaidens also interceded with her and kissed her hand saying O our sister this man is a simpleton punish him not for what he hath done this nonce but she answered By Allah there is no help but that I dock him of somewhat especially the offending member Then she went away and I saw no more of her for ten days during which time she sent me meat and drink by a slave girl who told me that she had fallen sick from the smell of the cumin ragout After that time she came to me and said O black of face FN five hundred seventy one I will teach thee how to eat cumin ragout without washing thy hands Then she cried out to the handmaids who pinioned me and she took a sharp razor and cut off my thumbs and great toes even as you see O fair assembly Thereupon I swooned away and she sprinkled some powder of healing herbs upon the stumps and when the blood was stanched I said Never again will I eat of cumin ragout without washing my hands forty times with potash and forty times with galangale and forty times with soap And she took of me an oath and bound me by a covenant to that effect When therefore you brought me the cumin ragout my colour changed and I said to myself It was this very dish that caused the cutting off of my thumbs and great toes and when you forced me I said Needs must I fulfil the oath I have sworn And what befell thee after this asked those present and he answered When I swore to her her anger was appeased and I slept with her that night We abode thus awhile till she said to me one day Verily the Palace of the Caliph is not a pleasant place for us to live in and none ever entered it save thyself and thou only by grace of the Lady Zubaydah Now she hath given me fifty thousand dinars adding Take this money and go out and buy us a fair dwelling house So I fared forth and bought a fine and spacious mansion whither she removed all the wealth she owned and what riches I had gained in stuffs and costly rarities Such is the cause of the cutting off of my thumbs and great toes We ate continued the Reeve and were returning to our homes when there befell me with the Hunchback that thou wottest of This then is my story and peace be with thee Quoth the King This story is on no wise more delectable than the story of the Hunchback nay it is even less so and there is no help for the hanging of the whole of you Then came forward the Jewish physician and kissing the ground said O King of the age I will tell thee an history more wonderful than that of the Hunchback Tell on said the King of China so he began the Tale of the Jewish Doctor Right marvellous was a matter which came to pass to me in my youth I lived in Damascus of Syria studying my art and one day as I was sitting at home behold there came to me a Mameluke from the household of the Sahib and said to me Speak with my lord So I followed him to the Viceroy s house and entering the great hall saw at its head a couch of cedar plated with gold whereon lay a sickly youth beautiful withal fairer than he one could not see I sat down by his head and prayed to Heaven for a cure and he made me a sign with his eyes so I said to him O my lord favour me with thy hand and safety be with thee FN five hundred seventy two Then he put forth his left hand and I marvelled thereat and said By Allah strange that this handsome youth the son of a great house should so lack good manners This can be nothing but pride and conceit However I felt his pulse and wrote him a prescription and continued to visit him for ten days at the end of which time he recovered and went to the Hammam FN five hundred seventy three whereupon the Viceroy gave me a handsome dress of honour and appointed me superintendent of the hospital which is in Damascus FN five hundred seventy four I accompanied him to the baths the whole of which they had kept private for his accommodation and the servants came in with him and took off his clothes within the bath and when he was stripped I saw that his right hand had been newly cut off and this was the cause of his weakliness At this I was amazed and grieved for him then looking at his body I saw on it the scars of scourge stripes whereto he had applied unguents I was troubled at the sight and my concern appeared in my face The young man looked at me and comprehending the matter said O Physician of the age marvel not at my case I will tell thee my story as soon as we quit the baths Then we washed and returning to his house ate somewhat of food and took rest awhile after which he asked me What sayest thou to solacing thee by inspecting the supper hall and I answered So let it be Thereupon he ordered the slaves to carry out the carpets and cushions required and roast a lamb and bring us some fruit They did his bidding and we ate together he using the left hand for the purpose After a while I said to him Now tell me thy tale O Physician of the age replied he hear what befell me Know that I am of the sons of Mosul where my grandfather died leaving nine children of whom my father was the eldest All grew up and took to them wives but none of them was blessed with offspring except my father to whom Providence vouchsafed me So I grew up amongst my uncles who rejoiced in me with exceeding joy till I came to man s estate One day which happened to be a Friday I went to the Cathedral mosque of Mosul with my father and my uncles and we prayed the congregational prayers after which the folk went forth except my father and uncles who sat talking of wondrous things in foreign parts and the marvellous sights of strange cities At last they mentioned Egypt and one of my uncles said Travellers tell us that there is not on earth s face aught fairer than Cairo and her Nile and these words made me long to see Cairo Quoth my father Whoso hath not seen Cairo hath not seen the world Her dust is golden and her Nile a miracle holden and her women are as Houris fair puppets beautiful pictures her houses are palaces rare her water is sweet and light FN five hundred seventy five and her mud a commodity and a medicine beyond compare even as said the poet in this his poetry The Nile FN five hundred seventy six flood this day is the gain you own You alone in such gain and bounties wone The Nile is my tear flood of severance And here none is forlorn but I alone Moreover temperate is her air and with fragrance blent Which surpasseth aloes wood in scent and how should it be otherwise she being the Mother of the World And Allah favour him who wrote these lines An I quit Cairo and her pleasaunces Where can I wend to find so gladsome ways Shall I desert that site whose grateful scents Joy every soul and call for loudest praise Where every palace as another Eden Carpets and cushions richly wrought displays A city wooing sight and sprite to glee Where Saint meets Sinner and each joys his craze Where friend meets friend by Providence united In greeny garden and in palmy maze People of Cairo and by Allah s doom I fare with you in thoughts I wone always Whisper not Cairo in the ear of Zephyr Lest for her like of garden scents he reave her FN five hundred seventy seven And if your eyes saw her earth and the adornment thereof with bloom and the purfling of it with all manner blossoms and the islands of the Nile and how much is therein of wide spread and goodly prospect and if you bent your sight upon the Abyssinian Pond FN five hundred seventy eight your glance would not revert from the scene quit of wonder for nowhere would you behold the fellow of that lovely view and indeed the two arms of the Nile embrace most luxuriant verdure FN five hundred seventy nine as the white of the eye encompasseth its black or like filigreed silver surrounding chrysolites And divinely gifted was the poet who there anent said these couplets By th Abyssinian Pond O day divine In morning twilight and in sunny shine The water prisoned in its verdurous walls Like sabre flashes before shrinking eyne And in The Garden sat we while it drains Slow draught with purfled sides dyed finest fine The stream is rippled by the hands of clouds We too a rippling on our rugs recline Passing pure wine and whoso leaves us there Shall ne er arise from fall his woes design Draining long draughts from large and brimming bowls Administ ring thirst s only medicine wine And what is there to compare with the Rasad the Observatory and its charms whereof every viewer as he approacheth saith Verily this spot is specialised with all manner of excellence And if thou speak of the Night of Nile full FN five hundred eighty give the rainbow and distribute it FN five hundred eighty one And if thou behold The Garden at eventide with the cool shades sloping far and wide a marvel thou wouldst see and wouldst incline to Egypt in ecstasy And wert thou by Cairo s river side FN five hundred eighty two when the sun is sinking and the stream dons mail coat and habergeon FN five hundred eighty three over its other vestments thou wouldst be quickened to new life by its gentle zephyrs and by its all sufficient shade So spake he and the rest fell to describing Egypt and her Nile As I heard their accounts my thoughts dwelt upon the subject and when after talking their fill all arose and went their ways I lay down to sleep that night but sleep came not because of my violent longing for Egypt and neither meat pleased me nor drink After a few days my uncles equipped themselves for a trade journey to Egypt and I wept before my father till he made ready for me fitting merchandise and he consented to my going with them saying however Let him not enter Cairo but leave him to sell his wares at Damascus So I took leave of my father and we fared forth from Mosul and gave not over travelling till we reached Aleppo FN five hundred eighty four where we halted certain days Then we marched onwards till we made Damascus and we found her a city as though she were a Paradise abounding in trees and streams and birds and fruits of all kinds We alighted at one of the Khans where my uncles tarried awhile selling and buying and they bought and sold also on my account each dirham turning a profit of five on prime cost which pleased me mightily After this they left me alone and set their faces Egyptwards whilst I abode at Damascus where I had hired from a jeweller for two dinars a month a mansion FN five hundred eighty five whose beauties would beggar the tongue Here I remained eating and drinking and spending what monies I had in hand till one day as I was sitting at the door of my house be hold there came up a young lady clad in costliest raiment never saw my eyes richer I winked FN five thousand eight hundred eighty six at her and she stepped inside without hesitation and stood within I entered with her and shut the door upon myself and her whereupon she raised her face veil and threw off her mantilla when I found her like a pictured moon of rare and marvellous loveliness and love of her gat hold of my heart So I rose and brought a tray of the most delicate eatables and fruits and whatso befitted the occasion and we ate and played and after that we drank till the wine turned our heads Then I lay with her the sweetest of nights and in the morning I offered her ten gold pieces when her face lowered and her eye brows wrinkled and shaking with wrath she cried Fie upon thee O my sweet companion dost thou deem that I covet thy money Then she took out from the bosom of her shift FN five hundred eighty seven fifteen dinars and laying them before me said By Allah unless thou take them I will never come back to thee So I accepted them and she said to me O my beloved expect me again in three days time when I will be with thee between sunset and supper tide and do thou prepare for us with these dinars the same entertainment as yesternight So saying she took leave of me and went away and all my senses went with her On the third day she came again clad in stuff weft with gold wire and wearing raiment and ornaments finer than before I had prepared the place for her ere she arrived and the repast was ready so we ate and drank and lay together as we had done till the morning when she gave me other fifteen gold pieces and promised to come again after three days Accordingly I made ready for her and at the appointed time she presented herself more richly dressed than on the first and second occasions and said to me O my lord am I not beautiful Yea by Allah thou art answered I and she went on Wilt thou allow me to bring with me a young lady fairer than I and younger in years that she may play with us and thou and she may laugh and make merry and rejoice her heart for she hath been very sad this long time past and hath asked me to take her out and let her spend the night abroad with me Yea by Allah I replied and we drank till the wine turned our heads and slept till the morning when she gave me other fifteen dinars saying Add something to thy usual provision on account of the young lady who will come with me Then she went away and on the fourth day I made ready the house as usual and soon after sunset behold she came accompanied by another damsel carefully wrapped in her mantilla They entered and sat down and when I saw them I repeated these verses How dear is our day and how lucky our lot When the cynic s away with his tongue malign When love and delight and the swimming of head Send cleverness trotting the best boon of wine When the full moon shines from the cloudy veil And the branchlet sways in her greens that shine When the red rose mantles in freshest cheek And Narcissus FN five hundred eighty eight opeth his love sick eyne When pleasure with those I love is so sweet When friendship with those I love is complete I rejoiced to see them and lighted the candles after receiving them with gladness and delight They doffed their heavy outer dresses and the new damsel uncovered her face when I saw that she was like the moon at its full never beheld I aught more beautiful Then I rose and set meat and drink before them and we ate and drank and I kept giving mouthfuls to the new comer crowning her cup and drinking with her till the first damsel waxing inwardly jealous asked me By Allah is she not more delicious than I whereto I answered Ay by the Lord It is my wish that thou lie with her this night for I am thy mistress but she is our visitor Upon my head be it and my eyes Then she rose and spread the carpets for our bed FN five hundred eighty nine and I took the young lady and lay with her that night till morning when I awoke and found myself wet as I thought with sweat I sat up and tried to arouse the damsel but when I shook her by the shoulders my hand became crimson with blood and her head rolled off the pillow Thereupon my senses fled and I cried aloud saying O All powerful Protector grant me Thy protection Then finding her neck had been severed I sprung up and the world waxed black before my eyes and I looked for the lady my former love but could not find her So I knew that it was she who had murdered the damsel in her jealousy FN five hundred ninety and said There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great What is to be done now I considered awhile then doffing my clothes dug a hole in the middle of the court yard wherein I laid the murdered girl with her jewellery and golden ornaments and throwing back the earth on her replaced the slabs of the marble FN five hundred ninety one pavement After this I made the Ghusl or total ablution FN five hundred ninety two and put on pure clothes then taking what money I had left locked up the house and summoned courage and went to its owner to whom I paid a year s rent saying I am about to join my uncles in Cairo Presently I set out and journeying to Egypt foregathered with my uncles who rejoiced in me and I found that they had made an end of selling their merchandise They asked me What is the cause of thy coming and I answered I longed for a sight of you but did not let them know that I had any money with me I abode with them a year enjoying the pleasures of Cairo and her Nile FN five hundred ninety three and squandering the rest of my money in feasting and carousing till the time drew near for the departure of my uncles when I fled from them and hid myself They made enquiries and sought for me but hearing no tidings they said He will have gone back to Damascus When they departed I came forth from my hiding place and abode in Cairo three years until naught remained of my money Now every year I used to send the rent of the Damascus house to its owner until at last I had nothing left but enough to pay him for one year s rent and my breast was straitened So I travelled to Damascus and alighted at the house whose owner the jeweller was glad to see me and I found everything locked up as I had left it I opened the closets and took out my clothes and necessaries and came upon beneath the carpet bed whereon I had lain that night with the girl who had been beheaded a golden necklace set with ten gems of passing beauty I took it up and cleansing it of the blood sat gazing upon it and wept awhile Then I abode in the house two days and on the third I entered the Hammam and changed my clothes I had no money by me now so Satan whispered temptation to me that the Decree of Destiny be carried out Next day I took the jewelled necklace to the bazaar and handed it to a broker who made me sit down in the shop of the jeweller my landlord and bade me have patience till the market was full FN five hundred ninety four when he carried off the ornament and proclaimed it for sale privily and without my knowledge The necklet was priced as worth two thousand dinars but the broker returned to me and said This collar is of copper a mere counterfeit after the fashion of the Franks FN five hundred ninety five and a thousand dirhams have been bidden for it Yes I answered I knew it to be copper as we had it made for a certain person that we might mock her now my wife hath inherited it and we wish to sell it so go and take over the thousand dirhams And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Twenty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the beautiful youth said to the broker Take over the thousand dirhams and when the broker heard this he knew that the case was suspicious So he carried the collar to the Syndic of the bazaar and the Syndic took it to the Governor who was also prefect of police and said to him falsely enough This necklet was stolen from my house and we have found the thief in traders dress So before I was aware of it the watch got round me and making me their prisoner carried me before the Governor who questioned me of the collar I told him the tale I had told to the broker but he laughed and said These words are not true Then before I knew what was doing the guard stripped off my clothes and came down with palm rods upon my ribs till for the smart of the stick I confessed It was I who stole it saying to myself Tis better for thee to say I stole it than to let them know that its owner was murdered in thy house for then would they slay thee to avenge her So they wrote down that I had stolen it and they cut off my hand and scalded the stump in oil FN five hundred ninety six when I swooned away for pain but they gave me wine to drink and I recovered and taking up my hand was going to my fine house when my landlord said to me Inasmuch O my son as this hath befallen thee thou must leave my house and look out for another lodging for thee since thou art convicted of theft Thou art a handsome youth but who will pity thee after this O my master said I bear with me but two days or three till I find me another place He answered So be it and went away and left me I returned to the house where I sat weeping and saying How shall I go back to my own people with my hand lopped off and they know not that I am innocent Perchance even after this Allah may order some matter for me And I wept with exceeding weeping grief beset me and I remained in sore trouble for two days but on the third day my landlord came suddenly in to me and with him some of the guard and the Syndic of the bazaar who had falsely charged me with stealing the necklet I went up to them and asked What is the matter however they pinioned me with out further parley and threw a chain about my neck saying The necklet which was with thee hath proved to be the property of the Wazir of Damascus who is also her Viceroy and they added It was missing from his house three years ago at the same time as his younger daughter When I heard these words my heart sank within me and I said to myself Thy life is gone beyond a doubt By Allah needs must I tell the Chief my story and if he will let him kill me and if he please let him pardon me So they carried me to the Wazir s house and made me stand between his hands When he saw me he glanced at me out of the corner of his eye and said to those present Why did ye lop off his hand This man is unfortunate and there is no fault in him indeed ye have wronged him in cutting off his hand When I heard this I took heart and my soul presaging good I said to him By Allah O my lord I am no thief but they calumniated me with a vile calumny and they scourged me midmost the market bidding me confess till for the pain of the rods I lied against myself and confessed the theft albeit I am altogether innocent of it Fear not quoth the Viceroy no harm shall come to thee Then he ordered the Syndic of the bazaar to be imprisoned and said to him Give this man the blood money for his hand and if thou delay I will hang thee and seize all thy property Moreover he called to his guards who took him and dragged him away leaving me with the Chief Then they loosed by his command the chain from my neck and unbound my arms and he looked at me and said O my son be true with me and tell me how this necklace came to thee And he repeated these verses Truth best befits thee albeit truth Shall bring thee to burn on the threatened fire By Allah O my lord answered I I will tell thee nothing but the truth Then I related to him all that had passed between me and the first lady and how she had brought me the second and had slain her out of jealousy and I detailed for him the tale to its full When he heard my story he shook his head and struck his right hand upon the left FN five hundred ninety seven and putting his kerchief over his face wept awhile and then repeated I see the woes of the world abound And worldings sick with spleen and teen There s One who the meeting of two shall part And who part not are few and far between Then he turned to me and said Know O my son that the elder damsel who first came to thee was my daughter whom I used to keep closely guarded When she grew up I sent her to Cairo and married her to her cousin my brother s son After a while he died and she came back but she had learnt wantonness and ungraciousness from the people of Cairo FN five hundred ninety eight so she visited thee four times and at last brought her younger sister Now they were sisters german and much attached to each other and when that adventure happened to the elder she disclosed her secret to her sister who desired to go out with her So she asked thy leave and carried her to thee after which she returned alone and finding her weeping I questioned her of her sister but she said I know nothing of her However she presently told her mother privily of what had happened and how she had cut off her sister s head and her mother told me Then she ceased not to weep and say By Allah I shall cry for her till I die Nor did she give over mourning till her heart broke and she died and things fell out after that fashion See then O my son what hath come to pass and now I desire thee not to thwart me in what I am about to offer thee and it is that I purpose to marry thee to my youngest daughter for she is a virgin and born of another mother FN five hundred ninety nine and I will take no dower of thee but on the contrary will appoint thee an allowance and thou shalt abide with me in my house in the stead of my son So be it I answered and how could I hope for such good fortune Then he sent at once for the Kazi and witnesses and let write my marriage contract with his daughter and I went in to her Moreover he got me from the Syndic of the bazaar a large sum of money and I became in high favour with him During this year news came to me that my father was dead and the Wazir despatched a courier with letters bearing the royal sign manual to fetch me the money which my father had left behind him and now I am living in all the solace of life Such was the manner of the cutting off my right hand I marvelled at his story continued the Jew and I abode with him three days after which he gave me much wealth and I set out and travelled Eastward till I reached this your city and the sojourn suited me right well so I took up my abode here and there befell me what thou knowest with the Hunchback There upon the King of China shook his head FN six hundred and said This story of thine is not stranger and more wondrous and marvellous and delectable than the tale of the Hunchback and so needs must I hang the whole number of you However there yet remains the Tailor who is the head of all the offence and he added O Tailor if thou canst tell me any thing more wonderful than the story of the Hunchback I will pardon you all your offences Thereupon the man came forward and began to tell the Tale of the Tailor Know O King of the age that most marvellous was that which befell me but yesterday before I foregathered with the Hunch back It so chanced that in the early day I was at the marriage feast of one of my companions who had gotten together in his house some twenty of the handicraftsmen of this city amongst them tailors and silk spinners and carpenters and others of the same kidney As soon as the sun had risen they set food FN six hundred one before us that we might eat when behold the master of the house entered and with him a foreign youth and a well favoured of the people of Baghdad wearing clothes as handsome as handsome could be and he was of right comely presence save that he was lame of one leg He came and saluted us and we stood up to receive him but when he was about to sit down he espied amongst us a certain man which was a Barber whereupon he refused to be seated and would have gone away But we stopped him and our host also stayed him making oath that he should not leave us and asked him What is the reason of thy coming in and going out again at once whereto he answered By Allah O my lord do not hinder me for the cause of my turning back is yon Barber of bad omen FN six hundred two yon black o face yon ne er do well When the housemaster heard these words he marvelled with extreme marvel and said How cometh this young man who haileth from Baghdad to be so troubled and perplexed about this Barber Then we looked at the stranger and said Explain the cause of thine anger against the Barber O fair company quoth the youth there befell me a strange adventure with this Barber in Baghdad which is my native city he was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my lameness and I have sworn never to sit in the same place with him nor even tarry in any town where he happens to abide and I have bidden adieu to Baghdad and travelled far from it and came to stay in this your city yet I have hardly passed one night before I meet him again But not another day shall go by ere I fare forth from here Said we to him Allah upon thee tell us the tale and the youth replied the Barber changing colour from brown to yellow as he spoke Know O fair company that my father was one of the chief merchants of Baghdad and Almighty Allah had blessed him with no son but myself When I grew up and reached man s estate my father was received into the mercy of Allah whose Name be exalted and left me money and eunuchs servants and slaves and I used to dress well and diet well Now Allah had made me a hater of women kind and one day as I was walking along a street in Baghdad a party of females met me face to face in the footway so I fled from them and entering an alley which was no thoroughfare sat down upon a stone bench at its other end I had not sat there long before the latticed window of one of the houses opposite was thrown open and there appeared at it a young lady as she were the full moon at its fullest never in my life saw I her like and she began to water some flowers on the window sill FN six hundred three She turned right and left and seeing me watching her shut the window and went away Thereupon fire was suddenly enkindled in my heart my mind was possessed with her and my woman hate turned to woman love I continued sitting there lost to the world till sunset when lo the Kazi of the city came riding by with his slaves before him and his eunuchs behind him and dismounting entered the house in which the damsel had appeared By this I knew that he was her father so I went home sorrowful and cast myself upon my carpet bed in grief Then my handmaids flocked in and sat about me unknowing what ailed me but I addressed no speech to them and they wept and wailed over me Presently in came an old woman who looked at me and saw with a glance what was the matter with me so she by my head spoke me fair saying O my son tell me all about it and I will be the means of thy union with her FN six hundred four So I related to her what had happened and she answered O my son this one is the daughter of the Kazi of Baghdad who keepeth her in the closest seclusion and the window where thou sawest her is her floor whilst her father occupies the large saloon in the lower story She is often there alone and I am wont to visit at the house so thou shalt not win to her save through me Now set thy wits to work and be of good cheer With these words she went away and I took heart at what she said and my people rejoiced that day seeing me rise in the morning safe and sound By and by the old woman returned looking chopfallen FN six hundred five and said O my son do not ask me how I fared with her When I told her that she cried at me If thou hold not thy peace O hag of ill omen and leave not such talk I will entreat thee as thou deservest and do thee die by the foulest of deaths But needs must I have at her a second time FN six hundred six When I heard this it added ailment to my ailment and the neighbours visited me and judged that I was not long for this world but after some days the old woman came to me and putting her mouth close to my ear whispered O my son I claim from thee the gift of good news With this my soul returned to me and I said Whatever thou wilt shall be thine Thereupon she began Yesterday I went to the young lady who seeing me broken in spirit and shedding tears from reddened eyes asked me O naunty FN six hundred seven mine what ails thee that I see thy breast so straitened and I answered her weeping bitterly O my lady I am just come from the house of a youth who loves thee and who is about to die for sake of thee Quoth she and her heart was softened And who is this youth of whom thou speakest and quoth I He is to me as a son and the fruit of my vitals He saw thee some days ago at the window watering thy flowers and espying thy face and wrists he fell in love at first sight I let him know what happened to me the last time I was with thee whereupon his ailment increased he took to the pillow and he is naught now but a dead man and no doubt what ever of it At this she turned pale and asked All this for my sake and I answered Ay by Allah FN six hundred eight what wouldst thou have me do Said she Go back to him and greet him for me and tell him that I am twice more heartsick than he is And on Friday before the hour of public prayer bid him here to the house and I will come down and open the door for him Then I will carry him up to my chamber and foregather with him for a while and let him depart before my father return from the Mosque When I heard the old woman s words all my sickness suddenly fell from me my anguish ceased and my heart was comforted I took off what clothes were on me and gave them to her and as she turned to go she said Keep a good heart I have not a jot of sorrow left I replied My household and intimates rejoiced in my recovery and I abode thus till Friday when behold the old woman came in and asked me how I did to which I answered that I was well and in good case Then I donned my clothes and perfumed myself and sat down to await the congregation going in to prayers that I might betake myself to her But the old woman said to me Thou hast time and to spare so thou wouldst do well to go to the Hammam and have thy hair shaven off especially after thy ailment so as not to show traces of sickness This were the best way answered I I have just now bathed in hot water but I will have my head shaved Then I said to my page Go to the bazaar and bring me a barber a discreet fellow and one not inclined to meddling or impertinent curiosity or likely to split my head with his excessive talk FN six hundred nine The boy went out at once and brought back with him this wretched old man this Shaykh of ill omen When he came in he saluted me and I returned his salutation then quoth he Of a truth I see thee thin of body and quoth I I have been ailing He continued Allah drive far away from thee thy woe and thy sorrow and thy trouble and thy distress Allah grant thy prayer said I He pursued All gladness to thee O my master for indeed recovery is come to thee Dost thou wish to be polled or to be blooded Indeed it was a tradition of Ibn Abbas FN six hundred ten Allah accept of him that the Apostle said Whoso cutteth his hair on a Friday the Lord shall avert from him threescore and ten calamities and again is related of him also that he said Cupping on a Friday keepeth from loss of sight and a host of diseases Leave this talk I cried come shave me my head at once for I can t stand it So he rose and put forth his hand in most leisurely way and took out a kerchief and unfolded it and lo it contained an astrolabe FN six hundred eleven with seven parallel plates mounted in silver Then he went to the middle of the court and raised head and instrument towards the sun s rays and looked for a long while When this was over he came back and said to me Know that there have elapsed of this our day which be Friday and this Friday be the tenth of the month Safar in the six hundred and fifty third year since the Hegira or Flight of the Apostle on whom be the bestest of blessings and peace and the seven thousand three hundred and twentieth year of the era of Alexander eight degrees and six minutes Furthermore the ascendant of this our day is according to the exactest science of computation the planet Mars and it so happeneth that Mercury is in conjunction with him denoting an auspicious moment for hair cutting and this also maketh manifest to me that thou desires union with a certain person and that your intercourse will not be propitious But after this there occurreth a sign respecting a matter which will befall thee and whereof I will not speak O thou cried I by Allah thou weariest me and scatterest my wits and thy forecast is other than good I sent for thee to poll my head and naught else so up and shave me and prolong not thy speech By Allah replied he if thou but knew what is about to befall thee thou wouldst do nothing this day and I counsel thee to act as I tell thee by computation of the constellations By Allah said I never did I see a barber who excelled in judicial astrology save thyself but I think and I know that thou art most prodigal of frivolous talk I sent for thee only to shave my head but thou comest and pesterest me with this sorry prattle What more wouldst thou have replied he Allah hath bounteously bestowed on thee a Barber who is an astrologer one learned in alchemy and white magic FN six hundred twelve syntax grammar and lexicology the arts of logic rhetoric and elocution mathematics arithmetic and algebra astronomy astromancy and geometry theology the Traditions of the Apostle and the Commentaries on the Koran Furthermore I have read books galore and digested them and have had experience of affairs and comprehended them In

officiousness argal to serve thee is a religious duty incumbent on me I am no busy body as thou seemest to suppose and on this account I am known as The Silent Man also The Modest Man Wherefore it behoveth thee to render thanks to Allah Almighty and not cross me for I am a true counsellor to thee and benevolently minded towards thee Would that I were in thy service a whole year that thou mightest do me justice and I would ask thee no wage for all this When I heard his flow of words I said to him Doubtless thou wilt be my death this day And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Thirtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the young man said to the Barber Thou certainly will be the death of me this very day O master mine replied he I am he The Silent Man hight by reason of the fewness of my words to distinguish me from my six brothers For the eldest is called Al Bakbuk the prattler the second Al Haddar

Shakashik or many clamours and the seventh is famous as Al Samit The Silent Man and this is my noble self Whilst he redoubled his talk I thought my gall bladder would have burst so I said to the servant Give him a quarter dinar and dismiss him and let him go from me in the name of God who made him I won t have my head shaved to day What words be these O my lord cried he By Allah I will accept no hire of thee till I have served thee and have ministered to thy wants and I care not if I never take money of thee If thou know not my quality I know thine and I owe thy father an honest man on whom Allah Almighty have mercy many a kindness for he was a liberal soul and a generous By Allah he sent for me one day as it were this blessed day and I went in to him and found a party of his intimates about him Quoth he to me Let me blood so I pulled out my astrolabe and taking the sun s altitude for him I ascertained that the ascendant was inauspicious and the hour unfavourable for brooding I told him of this and he did according to my bidding and awaited a better opportunity So I made these lines in honour of him I went to my patron some blood to let him But found that the moment was far from good So I sat and I talked of all strangenesses And with jests and jokes his good will I wooed They pleased him and cried he O man of wit Thou hast proved thee perfect in merry mood Quoth I O thou Lord of men save thou Lend me art and wisdom I m fou and wood In thee gather grace boon bounty suavity And I guerdon the world with lore science and gravity Thy father was delighted and cried out to the servant Give him an hundred and three gold pieces with a robe of honour The man obeyed his orders and I awaited an auspicious moment when I blooded him and he did not baulk me nay he thanked me and I was also thanked and praised by all present When the blood letting was over I had no power to keep silence and asked him By Allah O my lord what made thee say to the servant Give him an hundred and three dinars and he answered One dinar was for the astrological observation another for thy pleasant conversation the third for the phlebotomisation and the remaining hundred and the dress were for thy verses in my commendation May Allah show small mercy to my father exclaimed I for knowing the like of thee He laughed and ejaculated There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God Glory to Him that changeth and is changed not I took thee for a man of sense but I see thou babblest and dotest for illness Allah hath said in the Blessed Book FN six hundred thirteen Paradise is prepared for the goodly who bridle their anger and forgive men and so forth and in any case thou art excused Yet I cannot conceive the cause of thy hurry and flurry and thou must know that thy father and thy grandfather did nothing without consulting me and indeed it hath been said truly enough Let the adviser be prized and There is no vice in advice and it is also said in certain saws Whoso hath no counsellor elder than he will never himself an elder be FN six hundred fourteen and the poet says Whatever needful thing thou undertake Consult th experienced and contraire him not And indeed thou shalt never find a man better versed in affairs than I and I am here standing on my feet to serve thee I am not vexed with thee why shouldest thou be vexed with me But whatever happen I will bear patiently with thee in memory of the much kindness thy father shewed me By Allah cried I O thou with tongue long as the tail of a jackass thou persistest in pestering me with thy prate and thou becomest more longsome in thy long speeches when all I want of thee is to shave my head and wend thy way Then he lathered my head saying I perceive thou art vexed with me but I will not take it ill of thee for thy wit is weak and thou art but a laddy it was only yesterday I used to take thee on my shoulder FN six hundred fifteen and carry thee to school O my brother said I for Allah s sake do what I want and go thy gait And I rent my garments FN six hundred sixteen When he saw me do this he took the razor and fell to sharpening it and gave not over stropping it until my senses were well nigh leaving me Then he came up to me and shaved part of my head then he held his hand and then he said O my lord haste is Satan s gait whilst patience is of Allah the Compassionate But thou O my master I ken thou knowest not my rank for verily this hand alighteth upon the heads of Kings and Emirs and Wazirs and sages and doctors learned in the law and the poet said of one like me All crafts are like necklaces strung on a string But this Barber s the union pear of the band High over all craftsmen he ranketh and why The heads of the Kings are under his hand FN six hundred seventeen Then said I Do leave off talking about what concerneth thee not indeed thou hast straitened my breast and distracted my mind Quoth he Meseems thou art a hasty man and quoth I Yes yes yes and he I rede thee practice restraint of self for haste is Satan s pelf which bequeatheth only repentance and ban and bane and He upon whom be blessings and peace hath said The best of works is that wherein deliberation lurks but I by Allah have some doubt about thine affair and so I should like thee to let me know what it is thou art in such haste to do for I fear me it is other than good Then he continued It wanteth three hours yet to prayer time but I do not wish to be in doubt upon this matter nay I must know the moment exactly for truly A guess shot in times of doubt oft brings harm about especially in the like of me a superior person whose merits are famous amongst mankind at large and it doth not befit me to talk at random as do the common sort of astrologers So saying he threw down the razor and taking up the astrolabe went forth under the sun and stood there a long time after which he returned and counting on his fingers said to me There remain still to prayer time three full hours and complete neither more nor yet less according to the most learned astronomicals and the wisest makers of almanacks Allah upon thee cried I hold thy tongue with me for thou breakest my liver in pieces So he took the razor and after sharpening it as before and shaving other two hairs of my head he again held his hand and said I am concerned about thy hastiness and indeed thou wouldst do well to let me into the cause of it t were the better for thee as thou knowest that neither thy father nor thy grandfather ever did a single thing save by my advice When I saw that there was no escape from him I said to myself The time for prayer draws near and I wish to go to her before the folk come out of the mosque If I am delayed much longer I know not how to come at her Then said I aloud Be quick and stint this talk and impertinence for I have to go to a party at the house of some of my intimates When he heard me speak of the party he said This thy day is a blessed day for me In very sooth it was but yesterday I invited a company of my friends and I have forgotten to provide anything for them to eat This very moment I was thinking of it Alas how I shall be disgraced in their eyes Be not distressed about this matter answered I have I not told thee that I am bidden to an entertainment this day So every thing in my house eatable and drinkable shall be thine if thou wilt only get through thy work and make haste to shave my head He replied Allah requite thee with good Specify to me what is in thy house for my guests that I may be ware of it Quoth I Five dishes of meat and ten chickens with reddened breasts FN six hundred eighteen and a roasted lamb Set them before me quoth he that I may see them So I told my people to buy borrow or steal them and bring them in anywise And had all this set before him When he saw it he cried The wine is wanting and I replied I have a flagon or two of good old grape juice in the house and he said Have it brought out So I sent for it and he exclaimed Allah bless thee for a generous disposition But there are still the essences and perfumes So I bade them set before him a box containing Nadd FN six hundred nineteen the best of compound perfumes together with fine lign aloes ambergris and musk unmixed the whole worth fifty dinars Now the time waxed strait and my heart straitened with it so I said to him Take it all and finish shaving my head by the life of Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep By Allah said he I will not take it till I see all that is in it So I bade the page open the box and the Barber laid down the astrolabe leaving the greater part of my head unpolled and sitting on the ground turned over the scents and incense and aloes wood and essences till I was well nigh distraught Then he took the razor and coming up to me shaved off some few hairs and repeated these lines The boy like his father shall surely show As the tree from its parent root shall grow FN six hundred twenty Then said he By Allah O my son I know not whether to thank thee or thy father for my entertainment this day is all due to thy bounty and beneficence and although none of my company be worthy of it yet I have a set of honourable men to wit Zantut the bath keeper and Sali a the corn chandler and Silat the bean seller and Akrashah the greengrocer and Humayd the scavenger and Sa id the camel man and Suwayd the porter and Abu Makarish the bathman FN six hundred twenty one and Kasim the watchman and Karim the groom There is not among the whole of them a bore or a bully in his cups nor a meddler nor a miser of his money and each and every hath some dance which he danceth and some of his own couplets which he caroleth and the best of them is that like thy servant thy slave here they know not what much talking is nor what forwardness means The bath keeper sings to the tom tom FN six hundred twenty two a song which enchants and he stands up and dances and chants I am going O mammy to fill up my pot As for the corn chandler he brings more skill to it than any he dances and sings O Keener FN six hundred twenty three zero sweetheart thou fallest not short and he leaves no one s vitals sound for laughing at him But the scavenger sings so that the birds stop to listen to him and dances and sings News my wife wots is not locked in a box FN six hundred twenty four And he hath privilege for tis a shrewd rogue FN six hundred twenty five and a witty and speaking of his excellence I am wont to say My life for the scavenger right well I love him Like a waving bough he is sweet to my sight Fate joined us one night when to him quoth I The while I grew weak and love gained more might Thy love burns my heart And no wonder quoth he When the drawer of dung turns a stoker wight FN six hundred twenty six And indeed each is perfect in whatso can charm the wit with joy and jollity adding presently But hearing is not seeing and indeed if thou make up thy mind to join us and put off going to thy friends twill be better for us and for thee The traces of illness are yet upon thee and haply thou art going among folk who be mighty talkers men who commune together of what concerneth them not or there may be amongst them some forward fellow who will split thy head and thou half thy size from sickness This shall be for some other day answered I and laughed with heart angered finish thy work and go in Allah Almighty s guard to thy friends for they will be expecting thy coming O my lord replied he I seek only to introduce thee to these fellows of infinite mirth the sons of men of worth amongst whom there is neither procacity nor dicacity nor loquacity for never since I grew to years of discretion could I endure to consort with one who asketh questions concerning what concerneth him not nor have I ever frequented any save those who are like myself men of few words In sooth if thou were to company with them or even to see them once thou wouldst forsake all thy intimates Allah fulfil thy joyance with them said I needs must I come amongst them some day or other But he said Would it were this very day for I had set my heart upon thy making one of us yet if thou must go to thy friends to day I will take these good things wherewith thou hast honoured and favoured me to my guests and leave them to eat and drink and not wait for me whilst I will return to thee in haste and accompany thee to thy little party for there is no ceremony between me and my intimates to prevent my leaving them Fear not I will soon be back with thee and wend with thee whithersoever thou wendest There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great I shouted Go thou to thy friends and make merry with them and do let me go to mine and be with them this day for they expect me But the Barber cried I will not let thee go alone and I replied The truth is none can enter where I am going save myself He rejoined I suspect that to day thou art for an assignation with some woman else thou hadst taken me with thee yet am I the right man to take one who could aid thee to the end thou wishest But I fear me thou art running after strange women and thou wilt lose thy life for in this our city of Baghdad one cannot do any thing in this line especially on a day like Friday our Governor is an angry man and a mighty sharp blade Shame on thee thou wicked bad old man cried I Be off what words are these thou givest me O cold of wit FN six hundred twenty seven cried he thou sayest to me what is not true and thou hidest thy mind from me but I know the whole business for certain and I seek only to help thee this day with my best endeavour I was fearful lest my people or my neighbours should hear the Barber s talk so I kept silence for a long time whilst he finished shaving my head by which time the hour of prayer was come and the Khutbah or sermon was about to follow When he had done I said to him Go to thy friends with their meat and drink and I will await thy return Then we will fare together In this way I hoped to pour oil on troubled waters and to trick the accursed loon so haply I might get quit of him but he said Thou art cozening me and thou wouldst go alone to thy appointment and cast thyself into jeopardy whence there will be no escape for thee Now by Allah and again by Allah do not go till I return that I may accompany thee and watch the issue of thine affair So be it I replied do not be long absent Then he took all the meat and drink I had given him and the rest of it and went out of my house but the accursed carle gave it in charge of a porter to carry to his home but hid himself in one of the alleys As for me I rose on the instant for the Muezzins had already called the Salam of Friday the salute to the Apostle FN six hundred twenty eight and I dressed in haste and went out alone and hurrying to the street took my stand by the house wherein I had seen the young lady I found the old woman on guard at the door awaiting me and went up with her to the upper story the damsel s apartment Hardly had I reached it when behold the master of the house returned from prayers and entering the great saloon closed the door I looked down from the window and saw this Barber Allah s curse upon him sitting over against the door and said How did this devil find me out At this very moment as Allah had decreed it for rending my veil of secrecy it so happened that a handmaid of the house master committed some offence for which he beat her She shrieked out and his slave ran in to intercede for her whereupon the Kazi beat him to boot and he also roared out The damned Barber fancied that it was I who was being beaten so he also fell to shouting and tore his garments and scattered dust on his head and kept on shrieking and crying Help Help So the people came round about him and he went on yelling My master is being murdered in the Kazi s house Then he ran clamouring to my place with the folk after him and told my people and servants and slaves and before I knew what was doing up they came tearing their clothes and letting loose their hair FN six hundred twenty nine and shouting Alas our master and this Barber leading the rout with his clothes rent and in sorriest plight and he also shouting like a madman and saying Alas for our murdered master And they all made an assault upon the house in which I was The Kazi hearing the yells and the uproar at his door said to one of his servants See what is the matter and the man went forth and returned and said O my master at the gate there are more than ten thousand souls what with men and women and all crying out Alas for our murdered master and they keep pointing to our house When the Kazi heard this the matter seemed serious and he waxed wroth so he rose and opening the door saw a great crowd of people whereat he was astounded and said O folk what is there to do O accursed O dog O hog my servants replied Tis thou who hast killed our master Quoth he O good folk and what hath your master done to me that I should kill him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Thirty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Kazi said to the servants What hath your master done to me that I should kill him This is my house and it is open to you all Then quoth the Barber Thou didst beat him and I heard him cry out and quoth the Kazi But what was he doing that I should beat him and what brought him in to my house and whence came he and whither went he Be not a wicked perverse old man cried the Barber for I know the whole story and the long and short of it is that thy daughter is in love with him and he loves her and when thou knewest that he had entered the house thou badest thy servants beat him and they did so by Allah none shall judge between us and thee but the Caliph or else do thou bring out our master that his folk may take him before they go in and save him perforce from thy house and thou be put to shame Then said the Kazi and his tongue was bridled and his mouth was stopped by confusion before the people An thou say sooth do thou come in and fetch him out Whereupon the Barber pushed forward and entered the house When I saw this I looked about for a means of escape and flight but saw no hiding place except a great chest in the upper chamber where I was So I got into it and pulled the lid down upon myself and held my breath The Barber was hardly in the room before he began to look about for me then turned him right and left and came straight to the place where I was and stepped up to the chest and lifting it on his head made off as fast as he could At this my reason forsook me for I knew that he would not let me be so I took courage and opening the chest threw myself to the ground My leg was broken in the fall and the door being open I saw a great concourse of people looking in Now I carried in my sleeve much gold and some silver which I had provided for an ill day like this and the like of such occasion so I kept scattering it amongst the folk to divert their attention from me and whilst they were busy scrambling for it I set off hopping as fast as I could through the by streets of Baghdad shifting and turning right and left But whithersoever I went this damned Barber would go in after me crying aloud They would have bereft me of my master They would have slain him who was a benefactor to me and my family and my friends Praised be Allah who made me prevail against them and delivered my lord from their hands Then to me Where wilt thou go now Thou wouldst persist in following thine own evil devices till thou broughtest thyself to this ill pass and had not Allah vouchsafed me to thee ne er hadst thou escaped this strait into which thou hast fallen for they would have cast thee into a calamity whence thou never couldest have won free But I will not call thee to account for thine ignorance as thou art so little of wit and inconsequential and addicted to hastiness Said I to him Doth not what thou hast brought upon me suffice thee but thou must run after me and talk me such talk in the bazaar streets And I well nigh gave up the ghost for excess of rage against him Then I took refuge in the shop of a weaver amiddlemost of the market and sought protection of the owner who drove the Barber away and sitting in the back room FN six hundred thirty I said to myself If I return home I shall never be able to get rid of this curse of a Barber who will be with me night and day and I cannot endure the sight of him even for a breathing space So I sent out at once for witnesses and made a will dividing the greater part of my property among my people and appointed a guardian over them to whom I committed the charge of great and small directing him to sell my houses and domains Then I set out on my travels that I might be free of this pimp FN six hundred thirty one and I came to settle in your town where I have lived some time When you invited me and I came hither the first thing I saw was this accursed pander seated in the place of honour How then can my heart be glad and my stay be pleasant in company with this fellow who brought all this upon me and who was the cause of the breaking of my leg and of my exile from home and native land And the youth refused to sit down and went away When we heard his story continued the Tailor we were amazed beyond measure and amused and said to the Barber By Allah is it true what this young man saith of thee By Allah replied he I dealt thus by him of my courtesy and sound sense and generosity Had it not been for me he had perished and none but I was the cause of his escape Well it was for him that he suffered in his leg and not in his life Had I been a man of many words a meddler a busy body I had not acted thus kindly by him but now I will tell you a tale which befell me that you may be well assured I am a man sparing of speech in whom is no forwardness and a very different person from those six Brothers of mine and this it is The Barber s Tale of Himself I was living in Baghdad during the times of Al Mustansir bi llah FN six hundred thirty two Son of Al Mustazi bi llah the then Caliph a prince who loved the poor and needy and companied with the learned and pious One day it happened to him that he was wroth with ten persons highwaymen who robbed on the Caliph s highway and he ordered the Prefect of Baghdad to bring them into the presence on the anniversary of the Great Festival FN six hundred thirty three So the Prefect sallied out and making them His prisoners embarked with them in a boat I caught sight of them as they were embarking and said to myself These are surely assembled for a marriage feast methinks they are spending their day in that boat eating and drinking and none shall be companion of their cups but I myself So I rose O fair assembly and of the excess of my courtesy and the gravity of my understanding I embarked with them and entered into conversation with them They rowed across to the opposite bank where they landed and there came up the watch and guardians of the peace with chains which they put round the robbers necks They chained me among the rest of them and O people is it not a proof of my courtesy and spareness of speech that I held my peace and did not please to speak Then they took us away in bilbos and next morning carried us all before Al Mustansir bi llah Commander of the Faithful who bade smite the necks of the ten robbers So the Sworder came forward after they were seated on the leather of blood FN six hundred thirty four then drawing his blade struck off one head after another until he had smitten the neck of the tenth and I alone remained The Caliph looked at me and asked the Heads man saying What ails thee that thou hast struck off only nine heads and he answered Allah forbid that I should behead only nine when thou biddest me behead ten Quoth the Caliph Meseems thou hast smitten the necks of only nine and this man before thee is the tenth By thy beneficence replied the Headsman I have beheaded ten Count them cried the Caliph and whenas they counted heads lo there were ten The Caliph looked at me and said What made thee keep silence at a time like this and how camest thou to company with these men of blood Tell me the cause of all this for albeit thou art a very old man assuredly thy wits are weak Now when I heard these words from the Caliph I sprang to my feet and replied Know O Prince of the Faithful that I am the Silent Shaykh and am thus called to distinguish me from my six brothers I am a man of immense learning whilst as for the gravity of my understanding the wiliness of my wits and the spareness of my speech there is no end of them and my calling is that of a barber I went out early on yesterday morning and saw these men making for a skiff and fancying they were bound for a marriage feast I joined them and mixed with them After a while up came the watch and guardians of the peace who put chains round their necks and round mine with the rest but in the excess of my courtesy I held my peace and spake not a word nor was this other but generosity on my part They brought us into thy presence and thou gavest an order to smite the necks of the ten yet did I not make myself known to thee and remained silent before the Sworder purely of my great generosity and courtesy which led me to share with them in their death But all my life long have I dealt thus nobly with mankind and they requite me the foulest and evillest requital When the Caliph heard my words and knew that I was a man of exceeding generosity and of very few words one in whom is no forwardness as this youth would have it whom I rescued from mortal risk and who hath so scurvily repaid me he laughed with excessive laughter till he fell upon his back Then said he to me O Silent Man do thy six brothers favour thee in wisdom and knowledge and spareness of speech I replied Never were they like me Thou puttest reproach upon me O Commander of the Faithful and it becomes thee not to even my brothers with me for of the abundance of their speech and their deficiency of courtesy and gravity each one of them hath gotten some maim or other One is a monocular another palsied a third stone blind a fourth cropped of ears and nose and a fifth shorn of both lips while the sixth is a hunchback and a cripple And conceive not O Commander of the Faithful that I am prodigal of speech but I must perforce explain to thee that I am a man of greater worth and fewer words than any of them From each one of my brothers hangs a tale of how he came by his bodily defect and these I will relate to thee So the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his First Brother Know then O Commander of the Faithful that my first brother Al Bakbuk the Prattler is a Hunchback who took to tailoring in Baghdad and he used to sew in a shop hired from a man of much wealth who dwelt over the shop FN six hundred thirty five and there was also a flour mill in the basement One day as my brother the Hunchback was sitting in his shop a tailoring he chanced to raise his head and saw a lady like the rising full moon at a balconied window of his landlord s house engaged in looking out at the passers by FN six hundred thirty six When my brother beheld her his heart was taken with love of her and he passed his whole day gazing at her and neglected his tailoring till eventide Next morning he opened his shop and sat him down to sew but as often as he stitched a stitch he looked to the window and saw her as before and his passion and infatuation for her increased On the third day as he was sitting in his usual place gazing on her she caught sight of him and perceiving that he had been captivated with love of her laughed in his face FN six hundred thirty seven and he smiled back at her Then she disappeared and presently sent her slave girl to him with a bundle containing a piece of red cowered silk The handmaid accosted him and said My lady salameth to thee and desireth thee of thy skill and good will to fashion for her a shift of this piece and to sew it handsomely with thy best sewing He replied Hearkening and obedience and shaped for her a chemise and finished sewing it the same day When the morning morrowed the girl came back and said to him My lady salameth to thee and asks how thou hast passed yesternight for she hath not tasted sleep by reason of her heart being taken up with thee Then she laid before him a piece of yellow satin and said My lady biddeth thee cut her two pair of petticoat trousers out of this piece and sew them this very day Hearkening and obedience replied he greet her for me with many greetings and say to her Thy slave is obedient to thine order so command him as thou wilt Then he applied himself to cutting out and worked hard at sewing the trousers and after an hour the lady appeared at the lattice and saluted him by signs now casting down her eyes then smiling in his face and he began to assure himself that he would soon make a conquest She did not let him stir till he had finished the two pair of trousers when she with drew and sent the handmaid to whom he delivered them and she took them and went her ways When it was night he threw himself on his carpet bed and lay tossing about from side to side till morning when he rose and sat down in his place Presently the damsel came to him and said My master calleth for thee Hearing these words he feared with exceeding fear but the slave girl seeing his affright said to him No evil is meant to thee naught but good awaiteth thee My lady would have thee make acquaintance with my lord So my brother the tailor rejoicing with great joy went with her and when he came into the presence of his landlord the lady s husband he kissed the ground before him and the master of the house returned his greeting and gave him a great piece of linen saying Shape me shirts out of this stuff and sew them well and my brother answered To hear is to obey Thereupon he fell to work at once snipping shaping and sewing till he had finished twenty shirts by supper time without stopping to taste food The house master asked him How much the wage for this and he answered Twenty dirhams So the gentleman cried out to the slave girl Bring me twenty dirhams and my brother spake not a word but the lady signed Take nothing from him whereupon my brother said By Allah I will take naught from thy hand And he carried off his tailor s gear and returned to his shop although he was destitute even to a red cent FN six hundred thirty eight Then he applied himself to do their work eating in his zeal and diligence but a bit of bread and drinking only a little water for three days At the end of this time came the handmaid and said to him What hast thou done Quoth he They are finished and carried the shirts to the lady s husband who would have paid him his hire but he said I will take nothing for fear of her and returning to his shop passed the night without sleep because of his hunger Now the dame had informed her husband how the case stood my brother knowing naught of this and the two had agreed to make him tailor for nothing the better to mock and laugh at him Next morning he went to his shop and as he sat there the handmaid came to him and said Speak with my master So he accompanied her to the husband who said to him I wish thee to cut out for me five long sleeved robes FN six hundred thirty nine So he cut them out FN six hundred forty and took the stuff and went away Then he sewed them and carried them to the gentleman who praised his sewing and offered him a purse of silver He put out his hand to take it but the lady signed to him from behind her husband not to do so and he replied O my lord there is no hurry we have time enough for this Then he went forth from the house meaner and meeker than a donkey for verily five things were gathered together in him viz love beggary hunger nakedness and hard labour Nevertheless he heartened himself with the hope of gaining the lady s favours When he had made an end of all their jobs they played him another trick and married him to their slave girl but on the night when he thought to go in to her they said to him Lie this night in the mill and to morrow all will go well My brother concluded that there was some good cause for this and nighted alone in the mill Now the husband had set on the miller to make the tailor turn the mill so when night was half spent the man came in to him and began to say This bull of ours hath be come useless and standeth still instead of going round he will not turn the mill this night and yet we have great store of corn to be ground However I ll yoke him perforce and make him finish grinding it before morning as the folk are impatient for their flour So he filled the hoppers with grain and going up to my brother with a rope in his hand tied it round his neck and said to him Gee up Round with the mill thou O bull wouldst do nothing but grub and stale and dung Then he took a whip and laid it on the shoulders and calves of my brother who began to howl and bellow but none came to help him and he was forced to grind the wheat till hard upon dawn when the house master came in and seeing my brother still tethered to the yoke and the man flogging him went away At day break the miller returned home and left him still yoked and half dead and soon after in came the slave girl who unbound him and said to him I and my lady are right sorry for what hath happened and we have borne thy grief with thee But he had no tongue wherewith to answer her from excess of beating and mill turning Then he retired to his lodging and behold the clerk who had drawn up the marriage deed came to him FN six hundred forty one and saluted him saying Allah give thee long life May thy espousal be blessed This face telleth of pleasant doings and dalliance and kissing and clipping from dusk to dawn Allah grant the liar no peace O thou thousandfold cuckold my brother replied by Allah I did nothing but turn the mill in the place of the bull all night till morning Tell me thy tale quoth he and my brother recounted what had befallen him and he said Thy star agrees not with her star but an thou wilt I can alter the contract for thee adding Ware lest another cheat be not in store for thee And my brother answered him See if thou have not another contrivance Then the clerk left him and he sat in his shop looking for some one to bring him a job whereby he might earn his day s bread Presently the handmaid came to him and said Speak with my lady Begone O my good girl replied he there shall be no more dealings between me and thy lady The handmaid returned to her mistress and told her what my brother had said and presently she put her head out of the window weeping and saying Why O my beloved are there to be no more dealings twixt me and thee But he made her no answer Then she wept and conjured him swearing that all which had befallen him in the mill was not sanctioned by her and that she was innocent of the whole matter When he looked upon her beauty and loveliness and heard the sweetness of her speech the sorrow which had possessed him passed from his heart he accepted her excuse and he rejoiced in her sight So he saluted her and talked with her and sat tailoring awhile after which the handmaid came to him and said My mistress greeteth thee and informeth thee that her husband purposeth to lie abroad this night in the house of some intimate friends of his so when he is gone do thou come to us and spend the night with my lady in delightsomest joyance till the morning Now her husband had asked her How shall we manage to turn him away from thee and she answered Leave me to play him another trick and make him a laughing stock for all the town But my brother knew naught of the malice of women As soon as it was dusk the slave girl came to him and carried him to the house and when the lady saw him she said to him By Allah O my lord I have been longing exceedingly for thee By Allah cried he kiss me quick before thou give me aught else FN six hundred forty two Hardly had he spoken when the lady s husband came in from the next room FN six hundred forty three and seized him saying By Allah I will not let thee go till I deliver thee to the chief of the town watch My brother humbled himself to him but he would not listen to him and carried him before the Prefect who gave him an hundred lashes with a whip and mounting him on a camel promenaded him round about the city whilst the guards proclaimed aloud This is his reward who violateth the Harims of honourable men Moreover he fell off the camel and broke his leg and so became lame Then the Prefect banished him from the city and he went forth unknowing whither he should wend but I heard of him and fearing for him went out after him and brought him back secretly to the city and restored him to health and took him into my house where he still liveth The Caliph laughed at my story and said Thou hast done well O Samit O Silent Man O spare of speech and he bade me take a present and go away But I said I will accept naught of thee except I tell thee what befell all my other brothers and do not think me a man of many words So the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his Second Brother Know O Commander of the Faithful that my second brother s name was Al Haddar that is the Babbler and he was the paralytic Now it happened to him one day as he was going about his business that an old woman accosted him and said Stop a little my good man that I may tell thee of somewhat which if it be to thy liking thou shalt do for me and I will pray Allah to give thee good of it My brother stopped and she went on I will put thee in the way of a certain thing so thou not be prodigal of speech On with thy talk quoth he and she What sayest thou to handsome quarters and a fair garden with flowing waters flowers blooming and fruit growing and old wine going and a pretty young face whose owner thou mayest embrace from dark till dawn If thou do whatso I bid thee thou shalt see something greatly to thy advantage And is all this in the world asked my brother and she answered Yes and it shall be thine so thou be reasonable and leave idle curiosity and many words and do my bidding I will indeed O my lady said he how is it thou hast preferred me in this matter before all men and what is it that so much pleaseth thee in me Quoth she Did I not bid thee be spare of speech Hold thy peace and follow me Know that the young lady to whom I shall carry thee loveth to have her own way and hateth being thwarted and all who gainsay so if thou humour her thou shalt come to thy desire of her And my brother said I will not cross her in anything Then she went on and my brother followed her an hungering after what she described to him till they entered a fine large house handsome and choicely furnished full of eunuchs and servants and showing signs of prosperity from top to bottom And she was carrying him to the upper story when the people of the house said to him What dost thou here But the old woman answered them Hold your peace and trouble him not he is a workman and we have occasion for him Then she brought him into a fine great pavilion with a garden in its midst never eyes saw a fairer and made him sit upon a handsome couch He had not sat long be fore he heard a loud noise and in came a troop of slave girls surrounding a lady like the moon on the night of its fullest When he saw her he rose up and made an obeisance to her whereupon she welcomed him and bade him be seated So he sat down and she said to him Allah advance thee to honour Is all well with thee O my lady he answered all with me is right well Then she bade bring in food and they set before her delicate viands so she sat down to eat making a show of affection to my brother and jesting with him though all the while she could not refrain from laughing but as often as he looked at her she signed towards her handmaidens as though she were laughing at them My brother the ass understood nothing but in the excess of his ridiculous passion he fancied that the lady was in love with him and that she would soon grant him his desire When they had done eating they set on the wine and there came in ten maidens like moons with lutes ready strung in their hands and fell to singing with full voices sweet and sad whereupon delight gat hold upon him and he took the cup from the lady s hands and drank it standing Then she drank a cup of wine and my brother still standing said to her Health and bowed to her She handed him another cup and he drank it off when she slapped him hard on the nape of his neck FN six hundred forty four Upon this my brother would have gone out of the house in anger but the old woman followed him and winked to him to return So he came back and the lady bade him sit and he sat down without a word Then she again slapped him on the nape of his neck and the second slapping did not suffice her she must needs make all her handmaidens also slap and cuff him while he kept saying to the old woman I never saw aught nicer than this She on her side ceased not exclaiming Enough enough I conjure thee O my mistress but the women slapped him till he well nigh swooned away Presently my brother rose and went out to obey a call of nature but the old woman overtook him and said Be patient a little and thou shalt win to thy wish How much longer have I to wait my brother replied this slapping hath made me feel faint As soon as she is warm with wine answered she thou shalt have thy desire So he returned to his place and sat down where upon all the handmaidens stood up and the lady bade them perfume him with pastiles and besprinkle his face with rose water Then said she to him Allah advance thee to honour Thou hast entered my house and hast borne with my conditions for whoso thwarteth me I turn him away and whoso is patient hath his desire O mistress mine said he I am thy slave and in the hollow of thine hand Know then continued she that Allah hath made me passionately fond of frolic and whoso falleth in with my humour cometh by whatso he wisheth Then she ordered her maidens to sing with loud voices till the whole company was delighted after which she said to one of them Take thy lord and do what is needful for him and bring him back to me forthright So the damsel took my brother and he not knowing what she would do with him but the old woman overtook him and said Be patient there remaineth but little to do At this his face brightened and he stood up before the lady while the old woman kept saying Be patient thou wilt now at once win to thy wish till he said Tell me what she would have the maiden do with me Nothing but good replied she as I am thy sacrifice She wisheth only to dye thy eyebrows and pluck out thy mustachios Quoth he As for the dyeing of my eye brows that will come off with washing FN six hundred forty five but for the plucking out of my mustachios that indeed is a somewhat painful process Be cautious how thou cross her cried the old woman for she hath set her heart on thee So my brother patiently suffered her to dye his eyebrows and pluck out his mustachios after which the maiden returned to her mistress and told her Quoth she Remaineth now only one other thing to be done thou must shave his beard and make him a smooth o face FN six hundred forty six So the maiden went back and told him what her mistress had bidden her do and my brother the blockhead said to her How shall I do what will disgrace me before the folk But the old woman said She would do on this wise only that thou mayst be as a beardless youth and that no hair be left on thy face to scratch and prick her delicate cheeks for indeed she is passionately in love with thee So be patient and thou shalt attain thine object My brother was patient and did her bidding and let shave off his beard and when he was brought back to the lady lo he appeared dyed red as to his eyebrows plucked of both mustachios shorn of his beard rouged on both cheeks At first she was affrighted at him then she made mockery of him and laughing till she fell upon her back said O my lord thou hast indeed won my heart by thy good nature Then she conjured him by her life to stand up and dance and he arose and capered about and there was not a cushion in the house but she threw it at his head and in like manner did all her women who also kept pelting him with oranges and lemons and citrons till he fell down senseless from the cuffing on the nape of the neck the pillowing and the fruit pelting Now thou hast attained thy wish said the old woman when he came round there are no more blows in store for thee and there remaineth but one little thing to do It is her wont when she is in her cups to let no one have her until she put off her dress and trousers and remain stark naked FN six hundred forty seven Then she will bid thee doff thy clothes and run and she will run before thee as if she were flying from thee and do thou follow her from place to place till thy prickle stands at fullest point when she will yield to thee FN six hundred forty eight adding Strip off thy clothes at once So he rose well nigh lost in ecstasy and doffing his raiment showed himself mother naked And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Thirty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the old woman said to the Barber s second brother Doff thy clothes he rose well nigh lost in ecstasy and stripping off his raiment showed himself mother naked Whereupon the lady stripped also and said to my brother If thou want anything run after me till thou catch me Then she set out at a run and he ran after her while she rushed into room after room and rushed out of room after room my brother scampering after her in a rage of desire like a veritable madman with yard standing terribly tall After much of this kind she dashed into a darkened place and he dashed after her but suddenly he trod upon a yielding spot which gave way under his weight and before he was aware where he was he found himself in the midst of a crowded market part of the bazaar of the leather sellers who were crying the prices of skins and hides and buying and selling When they saw him in his plight naked with standing yard shorn of beard and mustachios with eyebrows dyed red and cheeks ruddied with rouge they shouted and clapped their hands at him and set to flogging him with skins upon his bare body till a swoon came over him Then they threw him on the back of an ass and carried him to the Chief of Police Quoth the Chief What is this Quoth they This fellow fell suddenly upon us out of the Wazir s house FN six hundred forty nine in this state So the Prefect gave him an hundred lashes and then banished him from Baghdad However I went out after him and brought him back secretly into the city and made him a daily allowance for his living although were it not for my generous humour I could not have put up with the like of him Then the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his Third Brother My third brother s name was Al Fakik the Gabbler who was blind One day Fate and Fortune drove him to a fine large house and he knocked at the door desiring speech of its owner that he might beg somewhat of him Quoth the master of the house Who is at the door But my brother spake not a word and presently he heard him repeat with a loud voice Who is this Still he made no answer and immediately heard the master walk to the door and open it and say What dost thou want My brother answered Something for Allah Almighty s sake FN six hundred fifty Art thou blind asked the man and my brother answered Yes Quoth the other Stretch me out thy hand So my brother put out his hand thinking that he would give him something but he took it and drawing him into the house carried him up from stair to stair till they reached the terrace on the house top my brother thinking the while that he would surely give him something of food or money Then he asked my brother What dost thou want O blind man and he answered Something for the Almighty s sake Allah open for thee some other door O thou why not say so when I was below stairs O cadger why not answer me when I first called to thee And what meanest thou to do for me now There is nothing in the house to give thee Then take me down the stair The path is before thee So my brother rose and made his way downstairs till he came within twenty steps of the door when his foot slipped and he rolled to the bottom and broke his head Then he went out unknowing whither to turn and presently fell in with two other blind men companions of his who said to him What didst thou gain to day He told them what had befallen him and added O my brothers I wish to take some of the money in my hands and provide myself with it Now the master of the house had followed him and was listening to what they said but neither my brother nor his comrades knew of this So my brother went to his lodging and sat down to await his companions and the house owner entered after him without being perceived When the other blind men arrived my brother said to them Bolt the door and search the house lest any stranger have followed us The man hearing this caught hold of a cord that hung from the ceiling and clung to it whilst they went round about the house and searched but found no one So they came back and sitting beside my brother brought out their money which they counted and lo it was twelve thousand dirhams Each took what he wanted and they buried the rest in a corner of the room Then they set on food and sat down to eat Presently my brother hearing a strange pair of jaws munching by his side FN six hundred fifty one said to his friends There is a stranger amongst us and putting forth his hand caught hold of that of the house master Thereupon all fell on him and beat him FN six hundred fifty two and when tired of belabouring him they shouted O ye Moslems a thief is come in to us seeking to take our money A crowd gathered around them whereupon the intruder hung on to them and complained with them as they complained and shutting his eyes like them so that none might doubt his blindness cried out O Moslems I take refuge with Allah and the Governor for I have a matter to make known to him Suddenly up came the watch and laying hands on the whole lot my brother being amongst them drove them FN six hundred fifty three to the Governor s who set them before him and asked What news with you Quoth the intruder Look and find out for thyself not a word shall be wrung from us save by torture so begin by beating me and after me beat this man our leader FN six hundred fifty four And he pointed to my brother So they threw the man at full length and gave him four hundred sticks on his backside The beating pained him whereupon he opened one eye and as they redoubled their blows he opened the other eye When the Governor saw this he said to him What have we here O accursed whereto he replied Give me the seal ring of pardon We four have shammed blind and we impose upon people that we may enter houses and look upon the unveiled faces of the women and contrive for their corruption In this way we have gotten great gain and our store amounts to twelve thousand dirhams Said I to my company Give me my share three thousand but they rose and beat me and took away my money and I seek refuge with Allah and with thee better thou have my share than they So if thou wouldst know the truth of my words beat one and every of the others more than thou hast beaten me and he will surely open his eyes The Governor gave orders for the question to begin with my brother and they bound him to the whipping post FN six hundred fifty five and the Governor said O scum of the earth do ye abuse the gracious gifts of Allah and make as if ye were blind Allah Allah cried my brother by Allah there is none among us who can see Then they beat him till he swooned away and the Governor cried Leave him till he come to and then beat him again After this he caused each of the companions to receive more than three hundred sticks whilst the sham Abraham kept saying to them Open your eyes or you will be beaten afresh At last the man said to the Governor Dispatch some one with me to bring thee the money for these fellows will not open their eyes lest they incur disgrace before the folk So the Governor sent to fetch the money and gave the man his pretended share three thousand dirhams and keeping the rest for himself banished the three blind men from the city But I O Commander of the Faithful went out and overtaking my brother questioned him of his case whereupon he told me of what I have told thee so I brought him secretly into the city and appointed him in the strictest privacy an allowance for meat and drink The Caliph laughed at my story and said Give him a gift and let him go but I said By Allah I will take naught till I have made known to the Commander of the Faithful what came to pass with the rest of my brothers for truly I am a man of few words and spare of speech Then the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his Fourth Brother Now as for my fourth brother O Commander of the Faithful Al Kuz al aswani or the long necked Gugglet hight from his brimming over with words the same who was blind of one eye he became a butcher in Baghdad and he sold flesh and fattened rams and great men and rich bought their meat of him so that he amassed much wealth and got him cattle and houses He fared thus a long while till one day as he was sitting in his shop there came up an old man and long o the beard who laid down some silver and said Give me meat for this He gave him his money s worth of flesh and the oldster went his ways My brother examined the Shaykh s silver and seeing that the dirhams were white and bright he set them in a place apart The greybeard continued to return to the shop regularly for five months and my brother ceased not to lay up all the coin he received from him in its own box At last he thought to take out the money to buy sheep so he opened the box and found in it nothing save bits of white paper cut round to look like coin FN six hundred fifty six so he buffeted his face and cried aloud till the folk gathered about him whereupon he told them his tale which made them marvel exceedingly Then he rose as was his wont and slaughtering a ram hung it up inside his shop after which he cut off some of the flesh and hanging it outside kept saying to himself O Allah would the ill omened old fellow but come And an hour had not passed before the Shaykh came with his silver in hand where upon my brother rose and caught hold of him calling out Come aid me O Moslems and learn my story with this villain When the old man heard this he quietly said to him Which will be the better for thee to let go of me or to be disgraced by me amidst the folk In what wilt thou disgrace me In that thou sellest man s flesh for mutton Thou liest thou accursed Nay he is the accursed who hath a man hanging up by way of meat in his shop If the matter be as thou sayest I give thee lawful leave to take my money and my life Then the old man cried out aloud Ho ye people if you would prove the truth of my words enter this man s shop The folk rushed in and found that the ram was become a dead man FN six hundred fifty seven hung up for sale So they set upon my brother crying out O Infidel O villain and his best friends fell to cuffing and kicking him and kept saying Dost thou make us eat flesh of the sons of Adam Furthermore the old man struck him on the eye and put it out Then they carried the carcass with the throat cut before the Chief of the city watch to whom the old man said O Emir this fellow butchers men and sells their flesh for mutton and we have brought him to thee so arise and execute the judgments of Allah to whom be honour and glory My brother would have defended himself but the Chief refused to hear him and sentenced him to receive five hundred sticks and to forfeit the whole of his property And indeed had it not been for that same property which he expended in bribes they would have surely slain him Then the Chief banished him from Baghdad and my brother fared forth at a venture till he came to a great town where he thought it best to set up as a cobbler so he opened a shop and sat there doing what he could for his livelihood One day as he went forth on his business he heard the distant tramp of horses and asking the cause was told that the King was going out to hunt and course so my brother stopped to look at the fine suite It so fortuned that the King s eye met my brother s whereupon the King hung down his head and said I seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this day FN six hundred fifty eight and turned the reins of his steed and returned home with all his retinue Then he gave orders to his guards who seized my brother and beat him with a beating so painful that he was well nigh dead and my brother knew not what could be the cause of his maltreatment after which he returned to his place in sorriest plight Soon afterwards he went to one of the King s household and related what had happened to him and the man laughed till he fell upon his back and cried O brother mine know that the King cannot bear to look at a monocular especially if he be blind of the right eye in which case he doth not let him go without killing him When my brother heard this he resolved to fly from that city so he went forth from it to another wherein none knew him and there he abode a long while One day being full of sorrowful thought for what had befallen him he sallied out to solace himself and as he was walking along he heard the distant tramp of horses behind him and said The judgement of Allah is upon me and looked about for a hiding place but found none At last he saw a closed door which he pushed hard it yielded and he entered a long gallery in which he took refuge but hardly had he done so when two men set upon him crying out Allah be thanked for having delivered thee into our hands O enemy of God These three nights thou hast robbed us of our rest and sleep and verily thou hast made us taste of the death cup My brother asked O folk what ails you and they answered Thou givest us the change and goest about to disgrace us and plannest some plot to cut the throat of the house master Is it not enough that thou hast brought him to beggary thou and thy fellows But now give us up the knife wherewith thou threatenest us every night Then they searched him and found in his waist belt the knife used for his shoe leather and he said O people have the fear of Allah before your eyes and maltreat me not for know that my story is a right strange And what is thy story said they so he told them what had befallen him hoping they would let him go however they paid no heed to what he said and instead of showing some regard beat him grievously and tore off his clothes then finding on his sides the scars of beating with rods they said O accursed these marks are the manifest signs of thy guilt They carried him before the Governor whilst he said to himself I am now punished for my sins and none can deliver me save Allah Almighty The Governor addressing my brother asked him O villain what led thee to enter their house with intention to murther and my brother answered I conjure thee by Allah O Emir hear my words and be not hasty in condemning me But the Governor cried Shall we listen to the words of a robber who hath beggared these people and who beareth on his back the scar of his stripes adding They surely had not done this to thee save for some great crime So he sentenced him to receive an hundred cuts with the scourge after which they set him on a camel and paraded him about the city proclaiming This is the requital and only too little to requite him who breaketh into people s houses Then they thrust him out of the city and my brother wandered at random till I heard what had befallen him and going in search of him questioned him of his case so he acquainted me with his story and all his mischances and I carried him secretly to the city where I made him an allowance for his meat and drink Then the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his Fifth Brother My fifth brother Al Nashshar FN six hundred fifty nine the Babbler the same who was cropped of both ears O Commander of the Faithful was an asker wont to beg of folk by night and live on their alms by day Now when our father who was an old man well stricken in years sickened and died he left us seven hundred dirhams whereof each son took his hundred but as my fifth brother received his portion he was perplexed and knew not what to do with it While in this uncertainty he bethought him to lay it out on glass ware of all sorts and turn an honest penny on its price So he bought an hundred dirhams worth of verroterie and putting it into a big tray sat down to sell it on a bench at the foot of a wall against which he leant back As he sat with the tray before him he fell to musing and said to himself Know O my good Self that the head of my wealth my principal invested in this glass ware is an hundred dirhams I will assuredly sell it for two hundred with which I will forthright buy other glass and make by it four hundred nor will I cease to sell and buy on this wise till I have gotten four thousand and soon find myself the master of much money With these coins I will buy merchandise and jewels and ottars FN six hundred sixty and gain great profit on them till Allah willing I will make my capital an hundred thousand dirhams Then I will purchase a fine house with white slaves and eunuchs and horses and I will eat and drink and disport myself nor will I leave a singing man or a singing woman in the city but I will summon them to my palace and make them perform before me All this he counted over in his mind while the tray of glass ware worth an hundred dirhams stood on the bench before him and after looking at it he continued And when Inshallah my capital shall have become one hundred thousand FN six hundred sixty one dinars I will send out marriage brokeresses to require for me in wedlock the daughters of Kings and Wazirs and I will demand to wife the eldest daughter of the Prime Minister for it hath reached me that she is perfect in beauty and prime in loveliness and rare in accomplishments I will give a marriage settlement of one thousand dinars and if her father consent well but if not I will take her by force from under his very nose When she is safely homed in my house I will buy ten little eunuchs FN six hundred sixty two and for myself a robe of the robes of Kings and Sultans and get me a saddle of gold and a bridle set thick with gems of price Then I will mount with the Mamelukes preceding me and surrounding me and I will make the round of the city whilst the folk salute me and bless me after which I will repair to the Wazir he that is father of the girl with armed white slaves before and behind me and on my right and on my left When he sees me the Wazir stands up and seating me in his own place sits down much below me for that I am to be his son in law Now I have with me two eunuchs carrying purses each containing a thousand dinars and of these I deliver to him the thousand his daughter s marriage settlement and make him a free gift of the other thousand that he may have reason to know my generosity and liberality and my greatness of spirit and the littleness of the world in my eyes And for ten words he addresses to me I answer him two Then back I go to my house and if one come to me on the bride s part I make him a present of money and throw on him a dress of honour but if he bring me a gift I give it back to him and refuse to accept it FN six hundred sixty three that they may learn what a proud spirit is mine which never condescends to derogate Thus I establish my rank and status When this is done I appoint her wedding night and adorn my house showily gloriously And as the time for parading the bride is come I don my finest attire and sit down on a mattress of gold brocade propping up my elbow with a pillow and turning neither to the right nor to the left but looking only straight in front for the haughtiness of my mind and the gravity of my understanding And there before me stands my wife in her raiment and ornaments lovely as the full moon and I in my loftiness and dread lordliness FN six hundred sixty four will not glance at her till those present say to me O our lord and our master thy wife thy handmaid standeth before thee vouchsafe her one look for standing wearieth her Then they kiss the ground before me many times whereupon I raise my eyes and cast at her one single glance and turn my face earthwards again Then they bear her off to the bride chamber FN six hundred sixty five and I arise and change my clothes for a far finer suit and when they bring in the bride a second time I deign not to throw her a look till they have begged me many times after which I glance at her out of the corner of one eye and then bend down my head I continue acting after this fashion till the parading and displaying are completed FN six hundred sixty six And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her per misted say When It was the Thirty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Barber s fifth brother proceeded Then I bend down my head and continue acting after this fashion till her parading and displaying are completed Thereupon I order one of my eunuchs to bring me a bag of five hundred dinars which I give as largesse to the tire women present and bid them one and all lead me to the bride chamber When they leave me alone with her I neither look at her nor speak to her but lie FN six hundred sixty seven by her side with my face to the wall showing my contempt that each and every may again remark how high and haughty I am Presently her mother comes in to me and kissing FN six hundred sixty eight my head and hand says to me O my lord look upon thine handmaid who longs for thy favour so heal her broken spirit I give her no answer and when she sees this she rises and busses my feet many times and says O my lord in very sooth my daughter is a beautiful maid who hath never known man and if thou show her this backwardness and aversion her heart will break so do thou incline to her and speak to her and soothe her mind and spirit Then she rises and fetches a cup of wine and says to her daughter Take it and hand it to thy lord But as e approaches me I leave her standing between my hands and sit propping my elbow on a round cushion purfled with gold thread leaning lazily back and without looking at her in the majesty of my spirit so that she may deem me indeed a Sultan and a mighty man Then she says to me O my lord Allah upon thee do not refuse to take the cup from the hand of thine hand maid for verily I am thy bondswoman But I do not speak to her and she presses me saying There is no help but that thou drink it and she puts it to my lips Then I shake my fist in her face and kick her with my foot thus So he let out with his toe an knocked over the tray of glass ware which fell to the ground and falling from the bench all that was on it was broken to bits O foulest of pimps FN six hundred sixty nine this comes from the pride of my spirit cried my brother and then O Commander of the Faithful he buffeted his face and rent his garments and kept on weeping and beating himself The folk who were flocking to their Friday prayers saw him and some of them looked at him and pitied him whilst others paid no heed to him and in this way my bother lost both capital and profit He remained weeping a long while and at last up came a beautiful lady the scent of musk exhaling from her who was going to Friday prayers riding a mule with a gold saddle and followed by several eunuchs When she saw the broken glass and my brother weeping her kind heart was moved to pity for him and she asked what ailed him and was told that he had a tray full of glass ware by the sale of which he hoped to gain his living but it was broken and said they there befell him what thou seest Thereupon she called up one of her eunuchs and said to him Give what thou hast with thee to this poor fellow And he gave my brother a purse in which he found five hundred dinars and when it touched his hand he was well nigh dying for excess of joy and he offered up blessings for her Then he returned to his abode a substantial man and as he sat considering some one rapped at the door So he rose and opened and saw an old woman whom he had never seen O my son said she know that prayer tide is near and I have not yet made my Wuzu ablution FN six hundred seventy so kindly allow me the use of thy lodging for the purpose My brother answered To hear is to comply and going in bade her follow him So she entered and he brought her an ewer wherewith to wash and sat down like to fly with joy because of the dinars which he had tied up in his belt for a purse When the old woman had made an end of her ablution she came up to where he sat and prayed a two bow prayer after which she blessed my brother with a godly benediction and he while thanking her put his hand to the dinars and gave her two saying to himself These are my voluntaries FN six hundred seventy one When she saw the gold she cried Praise be to Allah why dost thou look on one who loveth thee as if she were a beggar Take back thy money I have no need of it or if thou want it not return it to her who gave it thee when thy glass ware was broken Moreover if thou wish to be united with her I can manage the matter for she is my mistress O my mother asked my brother by what manner of means can I get at her and she answered O my son she hath an inclination for thee but she is the wife of a wealthy man so take the whole of thy money with thee and follow me that I may guide thee to thy desire and when thou art in her company spare neither persuasion nor fair words but bring them all to bear upon her so shalt thou enjoy her beauty and wealth to thy heart s content My brother took all his gold and rose and followed the old woman hardly believing in his luck She ceased not faring on and my brother following her till they came to a tall gate at which she knocked and a Roumi slave girl FN six hundred seventy two came out and opened to them Then the old woman led my brother into a great sitting room spread with wondrous fine carpets and hung with curtains where he sat down with his gold before him and his turband on his knee FN six hundred seventy three He had scarcely taken seat before there came to him a young lady never eye saw fairer clad in garments of the most sumptuous whereupon my brother rose to his feet and she smiled in his face and welcomed him signing to him to be seated Then she bade shut the door and when it was shut she turned to my brother and taking his hand conducted him to a private chamber furnished with various kinds of brocades and gold cloths Here he sat down and she sat by his side and toyed with him awhile after which she rose and saying Stir not from thy seat till I come back to thee disappeared Meanwhile as he was on this wise lo there came in to him a black slave big of body and bulk and holding a drawn sword in hand who said to him Woe to thee Who brought thee hither and what dost thou want here My brother could not return him a reply being tongue tied for terror so the blackamoor seized him and stripped him of his clothes and bashed him with the flat of his sword blade till he fell to the ground swooning from excess of belabouring The ill omened nigger fancied that there was an end of him and my brother heard him cry Where is the salt wench FN six hundred seventy four Where upon in came a handmaid holding in hand a large tray of salt and the slave kept rubbing it into my brother s wounds FN six hundred seventy five but he did not stir fearing lest the slave might find out that he was not dead and kill him outright Then the salt girl went away and the slave cried Where is the souterrain FN six hundred seventy six guardianess Hereupon in came the old woman and dragged my brother by his feet to a souterrain and threw him down upon a heap of dead bodies In this place he lay two full days but Allah made the salt the means of preserving his life by staunching the blood and staying its flow Presently feeling himself able to move Al Nashshar rose and opened the trap door in fear and trembling and crept out into the open and Allah protected him so that he went on in the darkness and hid himself in the vestibule till dawn when he saw the accursed beldam sally forth in quest of other quarry He followed in her wake without her knowing it and made for his own lodging where he dressed his wounds and medicined himself till he was whole Meanwhile he used to watch the old woman tracking her at all times and seasons and saw her accost one man after another and carry them to the house However he uttered not a word but as soon as he waxed hale and hearty he took a piece of stuff and made it into a bag which he filled with broken glass and bound about his middle He also disguised himself as a Persian that none might know him and hid a sword under his clothes of foreign cut Then he went out and presently falling in with the old woman said to her speaking Arabic with a Persian accent Venerable lady FN six hundred seventy seven I am a stranger arrived but this day here where I know no one Hast thou a pair of scales wherein I may weigh eleven hundred dinars I will give thee somewhat of them for thy pains I have a son a money changer who keepeth all kinds of scales she answered so come with me to him before he goeth out and he will weigh thy gold My brother answered Lead the way She led him to the house and the young lady herself came out and opened it whereupon the old woman smiled in her face and said I bring thee fat meat today FN six hundred seventy eight Then the damsel took my brother by the hand and led him to the same chamber as before where she sat with him awhile then rose and went forth saying Stir not from thy seat till I come back to thee Presently in came the accursed slave with the drawn sword and cried to my brother Up and be damned to thee So he rose and as the slave walked on before him he drew the sword from under his clothes and smote him with it making head fly from body Then he dragged the corpse by the feet to the souterrain and called out Where is the salt wench Up came the girl carrying the tray of salt and seeing my brother sword in hand turned to fly but he followed her and struck off her head Then he called out Where is the souterrain guardianess and in came the old woman to whom he said Dost know me again ill omened hag No my lord she replied and he said I am the owner of the five hundred gold pieces whose house thou enteredst to make the ablution and to pray and whom thou didst snare hither and betray Fear Allah and spare me cried she but he regarded her not and struck her with the sword till he had cut her in four Then he went to look for the young lady and when she saw him her reason fled and she cried out piteously Aman FN six hundred seventy nine Mercy So he spared her and asked What made thee consort with this blackamoor and she answered I was slave to a certain merchant and the old woman used to visit me till I took a liking to her One day she said to me We have a marriage festival at our house the like of which was never seen and I wish thee to enjoy the sight To hear is to obey answered I and rising arrayed myself in my finest raiment and ornaments and took with me a purse containing an hundred gold pieces Then she brought me hither and hardly had I entered the house when the black seized on me and I have remained in this case three whole years through the perfidy of the accursed beldam Then my brother asked her Is there anything of his in the house whereto she answered Great store of wealth and if thou art able to carry it away do so and Allah give thee good of it My brother went with her and she opened to him sundry chests wherein were money bags at which he was astounded then she said to him Go now and leave me here and fetch men to remove the money He went out and hired ten men but when he returned he found the door wide open the damsel gone and nothing left but some small matter of coin and the household stuffs FN six hundred eighty By this he knew that the girl had overreached him so he opened the store rooms and seized what was in them together with the rest of the money leaving nothing in the house He passed the night rejoicing but when morning dawned he found at the door some twenty troopers who laid hands on him saying The Governor wants thee My brother implored them hard to let him return to his house and even offered them a large sum of money but they refused and binding him fast with cords carried him off On the way they met a friend of my brother who clung to his skirt and implored his protection begging him to stand by him and help to deliver him out of their hands The man stopped and asked them what was the matter and they answered The Governor hath ordered us to bring this fellow before him and look ye we are doing so My brother s friend urged them to release him and offered them five hundred dinars to let him go saying When ye return to the Governor tell him that you were unable to find him But they would not listen to his words and took my brother dragging him along on his face and set him before the Governor who asked him Whence gottest thou these stuffs and monies and he answered I pray for mercy So the Governor gave him the kerchief of mercy FN six hundred eighty one and he told him all that had befallen him from first to last with the old woman and the flight of the damsel ending with Whatso I have taken take of it what thou wilt so thou leave me sufficient to support life FN six hundred eighty two But the Governor took the whole of the stuffs and all the money for himself and fearing lest the affair come to the Sultan s ears he summoned my brother and said Depart from this city else I will hang thee Hearing and obedience quoth my brother and set out for another town On the way thieves fell foul of him and stripped and beat him and docked his ears but I heard tidings of his misfortunes and went out after him taking him clothes and brought him secretly into the city where I assigned to him an allowance for meat and drink And presently the Caliph gave ear to The Barber s Tale of his Sixth Brother My sixth brother O Commander of the Faithful Shakashik FN six hundred eighty three or Many clamours the shorn of both lips was once rich and became poor so one day he went out to beg somewhat to keep life in him As he was on the road he suddenly caught sight of a large and handsome mansion with a detached building wide and lofty at the entrance where sat sundry eunuchs bidding and forbidding FN six hundred eighty four My brother enquired of one of those idling there and he replied The palace belongs to a scion of the Barmaki house so he stepped up to the door keepers and asked an alms of them Enter said they by the great gate and thou shalt get what thou seekest from the Wazir our master Accordingly he went in and passing through the outer entrance walked on a while and presently came to a mansion of the utmost beauty and elegance paved with marble hung with curtains and having in the midst of it a flower garden whose like he had never seen FN six hundred eighty five My brother stood awhile as one bewildered not knowing whither to turn his steps then seeing the farther end of the sitting chamber tenanted he walked up to it and there found a man of handsome presence and comely beard When this personage saw my brother he stood up to him and welcomed him and asked him of his case whereto he replied that he was in want and needed charity Hearing these words the grandee showed great concern and putting his hand to his fine robe rent it exclaiming What am I in a City and thou here an hungered I have not patience to bear such disgrace Then he promised him all manner of good cheer and said There is no help but that thou stay with me and eat of my salt FN six hundred eighty six O my lord answered my brother I can wait no longer for I am indeed dying of hunger So he cried Ho boy bring basin and ewer and turning to my brother said O my guest come forward and wash thy hands My brother rose to do so but he saw neither ewer nor basin yet his host kept washing his hands with invisible soap in imperceptible water and cried Bring the table But my brother again saw nothing Then said the host Honour me by eating of this meat and be not ashamed And he kept moving his hand to and fro as if he ate and saying to my brother I wonder to see thee eating thus sparely do not stint thyself for I am sure thou art famished So my brother began to make as though he were eating whilst his host kept saying to him Fall to and note especially the excellence of this bread and its whiteness But still my brother saw nothing Then said he to himself This man is fond of poking fun at people and replied O my lord in all my days I never knew aught more winsome than its whiteness or sweeter than its savour The Barmecide said This bread was baked by a hand maid of mine whom I bought for five hundred dinars Then he called out Ho boy bring in the meat pudding FN six hundred eighty seven for our first dish and let there be plenty of fat in it and turning to my brother said O my guest Allah upon thee hast ever seen anything better than this meat pudding Now by my life eat and be not abashed Presently he cried out again Ho boy serve up the marinated stew FN six hundred eighty eight with the fatted sand grouse in it and he said to my brother Up and eat O my guest for truly thou art hungry and needest food So my brother began wagging his jaws and made as if champing and chewing FN six hundred eighty nine whilst the host continued calling for one dish after another and yet produced nothing save orders to eat Presently he cried out Ho boy bring us the chickens stuffed with pistachio nuts and said to my brother By thy life O my guest I have fattened these chickens upon pistachios eat for thou hast never eaten their like O my lord replied my brother they are indeed first rate Then the host began motioning with his hand as though he were giving my brother a mouthful and ceased not to enumerate and expatiate upon the various dishes to the hungry man whose hunger waxt still more violent so that his soul lusted after a bit of bread even a barley scone FN six hundred ninety Quoth the Barmecide Didst thou ever taste anything more delicious than the seasoning of these dishes and quoth my brother Never O my lord Eat heartily and be not ashamed said the host and the guest I have eaten my fill of meat So the entertainer cried Take away and bring in the sweets and turning to my brother said Eat of this almond conserve for it is prime and of these honey fritters take this one by my life the syrup runs out of it May I never be bereaved of thee O my lord replied the hungry one and began to ask him about the abundance of musk in the fritters Such is my custom he answered they put me a dinar weight of musk in every honey fritter and half that quantity of ambergris All this time my brother kept wagging head and jaws till the master cried Enough of this Bring us the dessert Then said he to him Eat of these almonds and walnuts and raisins and of this and that naming divers kinds of dried fruits and be not abashed But my brother replied O my lord indeed I am full I can eat no more O my guest repeated the host if thou have a mind to these good things eat Allah Allah FN six hundred ninety one do not remain hungry but my brother rejoined O my lord he who hath eaten of all these dishes how can he be hungry Then he considered and said to himself I will do that shall make him repent of these pranks Presently the entertainer called out Bring me the wine and moving his hands in the air as though they had set it before them he gave my brother a cup and said Take this cup and if it please thee let me know O my lord he replied it is notable good as to nose but I am wont to drink wine some twenty years old Knock then at this door FN six hundred ninety two quoth the host for thou canst not drink of aught better By thy kindness said my brother motioning with his hand as though he were drinking Health and joy to thee exclaimed the house master and feigned to fill a cup and drink it off then he handed another to my brother who quaffed it and made as if he were drunken Presently he took the host unawares and raising his arm till the white of his armpit appeared dealt him such a cuff on the nape of his neck that the palace echoed to it Then he came down upon him with a second cuff and the entertainer cried aloud What is this O thou scum of the earth O my lord replied my brother thou hast shown much kindness to thy slave and admitted him into thine abode and given him to eat of thy victual then thou madest him drink of thine old wine till he became drunken and boisterous but thou art too noble not to bear with his ignorance and pardon his offence When the Barmaki heard my brother s words he laughed his loudest and said Long have I been wont to make mock of men and play the madcap among my intimates but never yet have I come across a single one who had the patience and the wit to enter into all my humours save thyself so I forgive thee and thou shalt be my boon companion in very sooth and never leave me Then he ordered the servants to lay the table in earnest and they set on all the dishes of which he had spoken in sport and he and my brother ate till they were satisfied after which they removed to the drinking chamber where they found damsels like moons who sang all manner songs and played on all manner instruments There they remained drinking till their wine got the better of them and the host treated my brother like a familiar friend so that he became as it were his brother and bestowed on him a robe of honour and loved him with exceeding love Next morning the two fell again to feasting and carousing and ceased not to lead this life for a term of twenty years at the end of which the Barmecide died and the Sultan took possession of all his wealth and squeezed my brother of his savings till he was left a pauper without a penny to handle So he quitted the city and fled forth following his face FN six hundred ninety three but when he was half way between two towns the wild Arabs fell on him and bound him and carried him to their camp where his captor proceeded to torture him saying Buy thy life of me with thy money else I will slay thee My brother began to weep and replied By Allah I have nothing neither gold nor silver but I am thy prisoner so do with me what thou wilt Then the Badawi drew a knife broad bladed and so sharp grinded that if plunged into a camel s throat it would sever it clean across from one jugular to the other FN six hundred ninety four and cut off my brother s lips and waxed more instant in requiring money Now this Badawi had a fair wife who in her husband s absence used to make advances to my brother and offer him her favours but he held off from her One day she began to tempt him as usual and he played with her and made her sit on his lap when behold in came the Badawi who seeing this cried out Woe to thee O accursed villain wouldest thou debauch my wife for me Then he took out a knife and cut off my brother s yard after which he bound him on the back of a camel and carrying him to a mountain left him there He was at last found by some who recognised him and gave him meat and drink and acquainted me with his condition whereupon I went forth to him and brought him back to Baghdad where I made him an allowance sufficient to live on This then O Commander of the Faithful is the history of my six brothers and I feared to go away without relating it all to thee and leave thee in the error of judging me to be like them And now thou knowest that I have six brothers upon my hands and being more upright than they I support the whole family When the Caliph heard my story and all I told him concerning my brothers he laughed and said Thou sayest sooth O Silent Man thou art indeed spare of speech nor is there aught of forwardness in thee but now go forth out of this city and settle in some other And he banished me under edict I left Baghdad and travelled in foreign parts till I heard of his death and the accession of another to the Caliphate Then I returned to Baghdad where I found all my brothers dead and chanced upon this young man to whom I rendered the kindliest service for without me he had surely been killed Indeed he slanders me and accuses me of a fault which is not in my nature and what he reports concerning impudence and meddling and forwardness is idle and false for verily on his account I left Baghdad and travelled about full many a country till I came to this city and met him here in your company And was not this O worthy assemblage of the generosity of my nature The End of the Tailor s Tale Then quoth the Tailor to the King of China When we heard the Barber s tale and saw the excess of his loquacity and the way in which he had wronged this young man we laid hands on him and shut him up after which we sat down in peace and ate and drank and enjoyed the good things of the marriage feast till the time of the call to mid afternoon prayer when I left the party and returned home My wife received me with sour looks and said Thou goest a pleasuring among thy friends and thou leavest me to sit sorrowing here alone So now unless thou take me abroad and let me have some amusement for the rest of the day I will cut the rope FN six hundred ninety five and it will be the cause of my separation from thee So I took her out and we amused ourselves till supper time when we returned home and fell in with this Hunchback who was brimful of drink and trolling out these rhymes Clear s the wine the cup s fine Like to like they combine It is wine and not cup Tis a cup and not wine So I invited him to sup with us and went out to buy fried fish after which we sat down to eat and presently my wife took a piece of bread and a fid of fish and stuffed them into his mouth and he choked and though I slapped him long and hard between the shoulders he died Then I carried him off and contrived to throw him into the house of this leach the Jew and the leach contrived to throw him into the house of the Reeve and the Reeve contrived to throw him on the way of the Nazarene broker This then is my adventure which befell me but yesterday Is not it more wondrous than the story of the Hunchback When the King of China heard the Tailor s tale he shook his head for pleasure and showing great surprise said This that passed between the young man and the busy body of a Barber is indeed more pleasant and wonderful than the story of my lying knave of a Hunchback Then he bade one of his Chamberlains go with the Tailor and bring the Barber out of jail saying I wish to hear the talk of this Silent Man and it shall be the cause of your deliverance one and all then we will bury the Hunchback for that he is dead since yesterday and set up a tomb over him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say When it was the Thirty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King of China bade Bring me the Barber who shall be the cause of your deliverance then we will bury this Hunchback for that he is dead since yesterday and set up a tomb over him So the Chamberlain and the Tailor went to the jail and releasing the Barber presently returned with him to the King The Sultan of China looked at him and considered him carefully and lo and behold he was an ancient man past his ninetieth year swart of face white of beard and hoar of eyebrows lop eared and proboscis nosed FN six hundred ninety six with a vacant silly and conceited expression of countenance The King laughed at this figure o fun and said to him O Silent Man I desire thee to tell me somewhat of thy history Quoth the Barber O King of the age allow me first to ask thee what is the tale of this Nazarene and this Jew and this Moslem and this Hunchback the corpse I see among you And prithee what may be the object of this assemblage Quoth the King of China And why dost thou ask I ask he replied in order that the King s majesty may know that I am no forward fellow or busy body or impertinent meddler and that I am innocent of their calumnious charges of overmuch talk for I am he whose name is the Silent Man and indeed peculiarly happy is my sobriquet as saith the poet When a nickname or little name men design Know that nature with name shall full oft combine Then said the King Explain to the Barber the case of this Hunchback and what befell him at supper time also repeat to him the stories told by the Nazarene the Jew the Reeve and the Tailor and of no avail to me is a twice told tale They did his bidding and the Barber shook his head and said By Allah this is a marvel of marvels Now uncover me the corpse of yonder Hunchback They undid the winding sheet and he sat down and taking the Hunchback s head in his lap looked at his face and laughed and guffaw d FN six hundred ninety seven till he fell upon his back and said There is wonder in every death FN six hundred ninety eight but the death of this Hunchback is worthy to be written and recorded in letters of liquid gold The bystanders were astounded at his words and the King marvelled and said to him What ails thee O Silent Man Explain to us thy words O King of the age said the Barber I swear by thy beneficence that there is still life in this Gobbo Golightly Thereupon he pulled out of his waist belt a barber s budget whence he took a pot of ointment and anointed therewith the neck of the Hunchback and its arteries Then he took a pair of iron tweezers and inserting them into the Hunchback s throat drew out the fid of fish with its bone and when it came to sight behold it was soaked in blood Thereupon the Hunchback sneezed a hearty sneeze and jumped up as if nothing had happened and passing his hand over his face said I testify that there is no god but the God and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God At this sight all present wondered the King of China laughed till he fainted and in like manner did the others Then said the Sultan By Allah of a truth this is the most marvellous thing I ever saw O Moslems O soldiers all did you ever in the lives of you see a man die and be quickened again Verily had not Allah vouchsafed to him this Barber he had been a dead man Quoth they By Allah tis a marvel of marvels Then the King of China bade record this tale so they recorded it and placed it in the royal muniment rooms after which he bestowed costly robes of honour upon the Jew the Nazarene and the Reeve and bade them depart in all esteem Then he gave the Tailor a sumptuous dress and appointed him his own tailor with suitable pay and allowances and made peace between him and the Hunchback to whom also he presented a splendid and expensive suit with a suitable stipend He did as generously with the Barber giving him a gift and a dress of honour moreover he settled on him a handsome solde and created him Barber surgeon FN six hundred ninety nine of state and made him one of his cup companions So they ceased not to live the most pleasurable life and the most delectable till there came to them the Destroyer of all delights and the Sunderer of all societies the Depopulator of palaces and the Garnerer for graves Yet O most auspicious King continued Shahrazad this tale is by no means more wonderful than that of the two

is kept in an etui called Makhalah and applied with a thick blunt needle to the inside of the eyelid drawing it along the rim hence etui and probe denote the sexual rem in re and in cases of adultery the question will be asked Didst thou see the needle in the Kohl pot Women mostly use a preparation of soot or lamp black Hind Kajala Kajjal whose colour is easily distinguished from that of Kohl The latter word with the article Al Kohl is the origin of our alcohol though even M Littre fails to show how fine powder became spirits of wine I found this powder wherewith Jezebel painted her eyes a

consanguineous marriage was not attended by the evil results idiotcy congenital deafness et cetera observed in mixed races like the English and the Anglo American When a Badawi speaks of the daughter

The Alfaz Adwiya French translation explains Tabannuj by Endormir quelqu un en lui faisant avaler de la jusquiame In modern parlance Tabannuj is our anaesthetic administered before an operation a deadener of pain like myrrh and a number of other drugs For this purpose hemp is always used at least I never heard of henbane and various preparations of the drug are sold at an especial bazar in Cairo See the powder of marvellous virtue in Boccaccio iii eight and iv ten Of these intoxicants properly so termed I shall have something to say in a future page The use of Bhang doubtless dates from the dawn of civilisation whose earliest social pleasures would be inebriants Herodotus iv c seventy five shows the Scythians burning the seeds leaves and capsules in worship and becoming drunken with the fumes as do the S African Bushmen of the present day This would be the earliest form of smoking it is still doubtful whether the pipe was used or not Galen also mentions intoxication by hemp

unknown the grain mostly Holcus is made to germinate then pounded boiled and left to ferment In Egypt the drink is affected chiefly by Berbers Nubians and slaves from the Upper Nile but it is a

Gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations one dollar to five thousand dollars are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all fifty states of the United States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http pglaf org While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States U S laws alone swamp our small staff
