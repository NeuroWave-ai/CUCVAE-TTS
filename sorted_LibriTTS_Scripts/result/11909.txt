XXV HOMEWARD BOUND CONCLUSION CHAPTER I BOB MAKES TROUBLE Bob Bob called a woman in loud tones as she came to the kitchen door her arms with the sleeves rolled up to her elbows covered with flour Bob I want you to go to the store for me I need some more lard for this pie crust There was no answer and the woman looked across the big yard at one side of the cottage Where can that boy be missus Henderson murmured I saw him here a little while ago He s never around when I want him I shouldn t be surprised but what he was planning some joke Oh dear I wish he was more steady and wasn t always up to some mischief Still he s a good boy at heart and perhaps he ll grow better when he gets older She rubbed her left cheek with the back of her hand leaving a big patch of flour under one eye Then she called once more Bob Bob Henderson Where are you I want you to go to the store Here I am mother Were you calling me asked a boy emerging from behind a big apple tree He was not a bad looking lad even if his nose did turn up a bit though his hair was tinged with red and his face covered with freckles His blue eyes however seemed to sparkle with mischief Did I call you repeated missus Henderson I m hoarse after the way I had to shout and you within hearing distance all the while Why didn t you answer me I guess I was so busy thinking mom that I didn t hear you Thinking More likely thinking of some trick What s that you ve got Nothing and Bob tried to stuff pieces of paper into a basket that was already filled to overflowing Yes tis too something You re making some more of those paper snappers that the teacher kept you in after school for the other night Bob can t you settle down and not be always up to some trick I wasn t making these for myself mom honest I wasn t expostulated Bob with an innocent look that did not seem in accord with the mischief in his blue eyes I was making em for Jimmy Smith Yes and Jimmy Smith would pop em off in school and when he got caught he d say you gave em to him and you d both be kept in Oh Bob I don t know what will happen to you next Why I wasn t doing anything honest I wasn t mom Oh how funny you look with that patch of flour on your cheek Just like a clown in a circus only he has white stuff all over his face Well I must say Bob Henderson you re not very complimentary to your mother telling her she looks like a circus clown I didn t say you did mom You only look like half a clown That s just as bad Bob took advantage of this little diversion to hide the paper snappers behind the tree while his mother was wiping the flour off her face The snappers were oblong pieces of stout wrapping paper folded in such a way that when swung through the air they went off like a bag blown up and crushed between the hands Bob was an expert in their manufacture Come went on missus Henderson when she was satisfied that her face was no longer adorned with flour I want you to go to the store for some lard Tell mister Hodge you want the best Here s the money All right mom I ll go right away Do you want anything else Now Bob usually made more of a protest than this when asked to go to the store which was at the other end of the village of Moreville where he lived He generally wanted to stay at his play or was on the point of going off with some boy of his acquaintance But this time he prepared to go without making any complaint and had his mother not been so preoccupied thinking of her housework she might have suspected that the lad had some mischief afoot some scheme that he wanted to carry out and which going to the store would further No I guess the lard is all I need now she said Now do hurry Bob Don t stop on the way for I want to get these pies baked before supper I ll hurry mom There was a curious smile on Bob s face and as he got his hat from the ground before setting off on the errand he looked in his pocket to see if he had a certain long stout piece of cord I guess that will do the trick murmured the boy to himself Oh yes I ll hurry back all right Guess I ll have to if I don t want Bill Hodge to catch me There was a cunning look on Bob s face and the twinkle in his eyes increased as he set off down the village street I hope he doesn t get into mischief murmured missus Henderson as she went back to her work in the kitchen If he wasn t such an honest boy I would be more worried than I am about him But I guess he will outgrow it she added hopefully Bob Henderson who is to be the hero of our Story was the only son of mister and missus Enos Henderson They lived in Moreville a thriving New England town and Bob s father was employed in a large woolen mill in the place Bob attended the local school and he was a sort of leader among a certain class of boys They were all manly chaps but perhaps were inclined more to mischief than they should be And none of them was any more inclined that way than Bob He was rather wild and some of the things he did were unkind and harmful to those on whom he played jokes Bob was always the first to acknowledge he had been in the wrong and when it was pointed out to him that he had not done what was right he always apologized Only this was always after the mischief had been done and he was just as ready half an hour later to indulge in another prank Nearly every one in Moreville knew Bob some to their sorrow But in spite of his tricks he was well liked even though some nervous women predicted that he would land in jail before he got to be much older It was a pleasant afternoon in June and Bob had not been home from school long when his mother sent him after the lard As it happened this just suited the youth s purpose for he contemplated putting into operation a trick he had long planned against William Hodge the proprietor of the village grocery store So Bob trudged along whistling a merry tune and jingling in his pocket the money his mother had given him He ll be as mad as hops he murmured but it can t do much harm He ll turn it off before much runs out This may seem rather a puzzle to my young readers but if you have patience you will soon understand what Bob meant though I hope none of you will follow his example As Bob walked along he met another lad about his own age Hello Bob greeted Ted Neefus Where you goin Store What store Bill Hodge s What fer Lard Want me t go long If you want to and there was a half smile on Bob s face Ted knew the meaning of that smile He had more than once been associated with Bob in his tricks Kin I watch ye he asked eagerly What for asked Bob with an air of assumed indignation What do you think I m going to do Oh that s all right returned Ted I won t say anythin Let me watch will yer I don t s pose I can stop you replied Bob with an appearance of lofty virtue The street s public property I haven t any right to say you shan t stand in front of Bill s store until I come out You can if you want to Maybe I won t then exclaimed Ted Better not walk along with me advised Bob Folks might think we were up to something That s so Like when we burned some feathers under the church when they were having prayer meeting Don t speak so loud cautioned Bob You ll give things away Thus admonished Ted took a position well to his chum s rear Meanwhile Bob continued on and was soon at the grocery store Good afternoon mister Hodge he said politely Arternoon replied mister Hodge for he was not fond of boys least of all Bob Henderson What d you want He had an air as if he was saying Now none of your tricks you young rapscallion If you play any jokes on me you ll smart for it Mother wants a pound of lard the best lard mister Hodge said Bob I don t keep any but the best Then I want a pound It s a fine day isn t it I don t see nothin the matter with it Tain t rainin anyhow Now don t you upset anything while I go fer the lard I have t keep it down cellar it s so hot up here Bob knew this In fact he counted on it for what he was about to do No sooner had the storekeeper started down the cellar stairs than Bob pulled from his pocket a long stout piece of cord He quickly fastened one end of it to the spigot of a molasses barrel which stood about half way back in the store Then he ran the cord forward and across the doorway about six inches from the floor and fastened the other end to a barrel of flour as a sort of anchor By this time mister Hodge was coming upstairs with the lard in a thin wooden dish a piece of paper being over the top Bob stood near the counter piling the scale weights up in a regular pyramid Here let them alone growled the storekeeper Fust thing you know they ll fall an mebby crack I wouldn t have that happen said Bob earnestly but with a lurking smile on his lips How much is the lard mister Hodge Fourteen cents It s gone up Something else will be going down soon murmured Bob He paid over the money took the lard and started out As soon as he reached the front stoop of the store he gave a hasty look around He saw Ted dodging behind a tree across the street Suddenly Bob opened his mouth and let out a yell like that which an Indian might have given when on the warpath It was a shriek as if some one had been hurt Then he jumped off the porch and hid underneath it one end being open An instant later mister Hodge thinking some accident had happened rushed to the front door of his store But just as he reached it he went down in a heap tripped by the string Bob had stretched across the opening The storekeeper was more surprised than hurt for he was quite stout and his fat protected him As he got up muttering vengeance on whatever had upset him he went to the door to look out There was not a person in sight It must have been that pesky Bob Henderson he exclaimed He s always yellin an shoutin He turned back into the store rubbing his shins As he did so he uttered an exclamation of dismay And well he might for the spigot of the molasses barrel was wide open and the sticky brown fluid was running all over the floor CHAPTER II ANOTHER PRANK Drat that boy cried mister Hodge I ll make him suffer fer this I ll have him arrested fer malicious mischief an I ll sue his father I ll see if I can t put a stop to sech nonsense He did not waste time in words however but hastened to shut the spigot of the molasses barrel to stop the wasteful flow However two gallons or more had run all over the floor making a sticky pool Meanwhile Bob had crawled out from under the stoop and had crossed the street to Join Ted Did you see anything he asked Did I asked Ted Well I should say I did It was great How d ye think of it Did I do anything asked Bob innocently I thought Bill Hodge stubbed his toe and fell Probably he slipped in some molasses Did you pull the spigot open Me No I didn t but maybe the string did I guess I ve got to hurry home with this lard Mom wants to make some pies Bob got home much sooner than his mother expected he would He gave her the lard and then went out under the apple tree where he had left the paper snappers He s back quick mused missus Henderson I don t see how he had time to do any mischief Perhaps he didn t play any tricks on any one this time for Bob seldom went through the village but what he did so However missus Henderson was mistaken as we know During this time mister Hodge was busy wiping as much of the molasses off the floor as he could with old cloths and pieces of newspaper While he was doing this a customer came in and inquired What s the matter Molasses barrel spring a leak Bill Leak No it was that pesky Bob Henderson Wait till I git hold of him I ll make him smart An I m goin to sue his father What did he do Why Bill you walk lame What s the matter got rheumatiz It s all on account of Bob What did he do Came here for some lard When I was down cellar gittin it he tied a string to the molasses barrel spigot and stretched it across the doorway What the spigot No the string Ye know what I mean Then he went out on the stoop an yelled like sin I thought somebody was killed an I run out I tripped over the string an it pulled the spigot open I barked my shins an when I looked in the store after seein nobody was hurt the molasses was runnin all over Oh wait till I git hold of that pesky boy I s pose if you hadn t been so curious to see who was killed it wouldn t have happened observed Adiran Meelik Curious Ain t I got a right to run an see who s killed in front of my store I s pose so But there wasn t anybody killed only you came near being That s so I ll bring an action against Bob Henderson s father for damages for personal injuries that s what I ll do Then there s the wasted molasses That boy plays too many tricks observed mister Meelik as he took the brown sugar he had come in to purchase and walked out Altogether too many tricks Still he added with a smile I would like to have seen Bill stumble and watched his face when he seen that molasses runnin to waste The storekeeper lost no time in putting his plan into action But as he was a cautious man and did not want to waste money hiring a lawyer to bring suit if he could collect damages without doing so he decided to call on mister Henderson himself A short time after mister Hodge had succeeded in cleaning up as much of the molasses as possible his wife came in to relieve him of tending the store as was her custom She had had an early supper and was to remain in the place until mister Hodge had also satisfied his appetite By this arrangement there was no need of hiring a clerk They lived in some rooms over the store Your supper s ready William she said I guess supper ll have to wait to night Why Cause I m goin to see if I can t collect damages from Enos Henderson fer what his son done What s that mister Hodge explained and his wife agreed with him that it would be wise first to try what a personal demand would do It was about six o clock when mister Hodge reached the Henderson home mister Henderson stopped work at five and he was at supper when the storekeeper entered Bob knew the object of the visit and making an excuse that he wanted to see one of his boy chums was about to leave the table My business is with him too said mister Hodge in rather surly tones With Bob asked mister Henderson and his heart sank He realized that his son must have been up to some prank in which the storekeeper was involved for mister Hodge was not a person to pay friendly calls Yes I ve come t see if ye ll settle my claim fer damages without a lawsuit A lawsuit inquired mister Henderson now becoming quite alarmed while Bob s mother grew pale Bob himself not a little frightened as the result of his joke sank down in a chair I want damages fer personal injuries as well as fer five gallons of molasses that run to waste It couldn t have been more than three gallons interrupted Bob Molasses runs awful slow and the spigot wasn t open more than three minutes It runs fast in hot weather observed the storekeeper What is it all about asked mister Henderson Then mister Hodge explained dwelling on the pain he had suffered as a result of the fall from the string that tripped him and on the loss of the molasses I want ten dollars damage he concluded A dollar fer the molasses an the rest fer personal injuries I am afraid I cannot afford to pay so much said mister Henderson who while he made good wages was trying to save up enough to pay for his home Then I ll sue ye I would not like you to do that but I cannot afford to pay ten dollars at least not now I have some interest to meet this week Well maybe I might take a little less said mister Hodge as he saw a prospect of Bob s father coming to a settlement I ll make it eight dollars an ye can pay me in installments I suppose that will be fair admitted mister Henderson He spoke very quietly but he was much exercised over what had happened Can ye pay me anythin now asked mister Hodge eagerly rubbing his shins which to tell the truth were only slightly bruised and did not hurt him in the least now I could give you two dollars But first I want to ask Bob if he is responsible for this To his sorrow mister Henderson did not have much doubt of it Oh I guess he won t deny it said the storekeeper Did you do this Bob inquired his father I I guess so but I didn t mean anything Bob was not so happy over his prank as he had been at first mister Henderson said nothing He took two dollars from his wallet a wallet that did not have any too much money in it and handed the bills to the storekeeper who eagerly pocketed them When kin ye give me some more he asked Next week I am sorry mister Hodge that my son did this So am I But I s pose boys will be boys mister Hodge seemed in better mood The truth was he had not expected to receive any money and as he was a sort of miser it made him feel better to think he was going to get damages without having to pay a lawyer In reality not more than fifty cents worth of molasses had run to waste When the storekeeper had left mister Henderson further questioned Bob getting all the particulars of the trick I m sorry dad said Bob when he had finished his recital That is what you say every time my son You said it after you frightened missus Anderson s cow and they had to have the veterinarian for the animal but that did not pay his bill I had to settle for it I know dad I ll not do it again And that s another thing you always say Bob Now this is getting serious You must mend your ways This will be quite a heavy expense to me I was going to spend that two dollars for a new pair of shoes Now I will have to wait I m sorry dad But that doesn t give me my shoes mister Henderson spoke gravely and Bob felt quite badly over what he had done for he loved his father and mother very much and would not intentionally pain them The trouble was he was like many other boys thoughtless He did not count the consequences when indulging in pranks A little later after giving his son quite a severe lecture and obtaining his promise to be better in the future mister Henderson prepared to go to bed Bob also retired to his room for he felt in no mood to go out with the village boys that night I m sure I don t know what to do with Bob said missus Henderson to her husband when she was locking up the house I m afraid he ll get into serious trouble I hope not I think I must punish him severely the next time he plays any tricks He is too big to whip I know it I must think of some other method Bob fell asleep resolving to mend his ways or at least to play in the future only harmless tricks to which no one would object But in the morning his good resolutions had lost some of their power like many others made during the night That day in school Bob snapped several of the paper crackers and in consequence was kept in However his mother was visiting a neighbor and when he came home late that afternoon she did not see him That evening Ted Neefus called for Bob They were chums of long standing Let s take a walk suggested Ted Aw that s no fun What ll we do then Bob thought a few seconds I ll tell you he said We ll put a tic tac on missus Mooney s window She lives all alone and she ll think it s a ghost rapping Good Come on Have you got some string Sure So you see how poorly Bob remembered his promise of the night before and with what thoughtlessness he again started to indulge in a prank a prank which might throw a nervous woman into hysterics Yet in this Bob was just like thousands of other boys he didn t mean anything The trouble was he did not think So the two boys their heads full of the project of making a tic tac stole quietly through the village streets toward the cottage of the Widow Mooney CHAPTER III A STRANGE PROPOSITION Perhaps some of my readers may not know what the contrivance known as a tic tac is like Those of you who have made them of course do not need to be told If you ever put them on any person s window I hope you selected a house where there were only boys and girls or young people to be startled by the tic tac It is no joke though at first it may seem like one to scare an old person with the affair So if any boy or girl makes a tic tac after the description given here I trust he or she will be careful on whom the prank is played To make a tic tac a long string a pin and a small nail are all that is required A short piece of string is broken from the larger piece and to one end of this latter the pin is fastened by being thrust through a knot To the other end or the short cord is attached the nail Then the long string is tied to the short string a little distance above the nail With this contrivance all made ready Bob and Ted sneaked up under the front window of the widow s house It was the work of but a moment for Bob to stick the point of the pin in the wooden part of the window frame so that the nail dangled against the glass Then holding the free end of the long string he and Ted withdrew to the shadow of some lilac bushes All ready asked Ted Sure Here she goes Bob then gently jerked the string This swung the nail to and fro and it tapped on the window pane as if some one was throwing pebbles against the glass This was kept up for several seconds The widow who was reading in the dining room heard the tapping at the glass It startled her at first and then thinking some one might be at the door she conquered her nervousness and opened the portal Of course she saw no one and the string was not observed Neither were the boys hidden in the bushes We fooled her chuckled Ted for they could see all that happened Sure we did added Bob Wait till she goes in and we ll do it some more Somewhat puzzled the Widow Mooney closed the door No sooner was she back in the dining room than the tapping at the pane was resumed This time it was louder The widow who was quite timid and nervous felt frightened She had years before believed in spirits and she had not altogether gotten over this Once more she went to the door the boys observing her from their hiding place They were so delighted with their prank which they thought a fine joke that they laughed heartily having to hold their hands over their mouths so as not to betray themselves She don t know what it is whispered Ted Maybe she thinks it s night hawks pecking at the window suggested Bob Go ahead Tap some more She s going in Much puzzled by the queer noises for no one had ever before put a tic tac on her window missus Mooney went back to her dining room But she could not read I must find out what that is she said to herself If it s burglars I m going to call for help Suppose it should be thieves trying to cut one of the window panes I ve read of such doings Now the widow was less afraid of something bodily like burglars than she was of spirits so she resolved the next time she heard the queer tapping to run out and call for help In a little while Bob pulled the string again and the dangling nail went tap tap tap against the pane Here she comes exclaimed Ted in a whisper as the door opened And this time instead of contenting herself by merely looking about missus Mooney came out on the porch Then she started down the front walk toward the lilac bushes though she did not know the boys were there She s comin after us whispered Ted Come on Bob Bob was aware of the danger of getting caught He prepared to run Now there is this advantage to a tic tac Once you want to escape you can take it with you by the simple process of pulling on the long string when the pin is jerked from the window frame and you can drag the nail and all with you thus leaving no evidence behind This was what Bob did Quickly winding up the string as he pulled the pin and nail toward him he and Ted started to run crouching down low so as not to be seen But Ted unfortunately for the success of their plan stumbled and fell making so much noise that missus Mooney heard it Thieves Burglars Police she screamed Come on cried Bob desperately We ll be caught missus Mooney ran back into the house slammed the front door shut and locked it She believed she had surprised thieves at work for she saw two dim forms running toward the street Leg it whispered Bob I am replied Ted They reached the gate together but that was as far as they got for just as they arrived at it they collided with a large man who was running toward the house He was so large that the combined impact of Bob and Ted against him never staggered him but it almost threw them off their feet They were running head down and had not seen him Hold hard there my hearties exclaimed the man in a gruff but not unpleasant voice What are you trying to cross my bows for in this fashion That s no way to run not showing a masthead light or even blowing a whistle Avast and belay You might have sunk me if I didn t happen to be a heavier craft than you As the man spoke he instinctively grasped the two boys preventing them from continuing their flight What s the trouble he went on I heard a female crying sounding a distress signal like Where are the burglars Are you going for the police No sir It was us playing tic tac explained Bob thinking it best to make a clean breast of the affair Tic tac eh I haven t heard that since I was a boy On whose window The Widow Mooney s sir And it was the widow I presume who was signaling for aid Well I ll stand by and see what s wanted You d better come back also Aw we don t want to spoke Ted No I suppose not Still you re coming The man had both boys firmly by their arms and he turned in the gateway with them As he did so missus Mooney hearing voices ventured to open her door The light streamed out and showed the face of the man At the sight of it Bob uttered an exclamation Why it s Captain Spark he cried That s what You read my signals right my lad and if I m not mistaken you re Bob Henderson Yes sir Captain Jeremiah Spark was an old seafaring man He was a distant relative of Bob s mother and in fact he was on his way to call on her having just returned from a long voyage when he ran into the boys or rather they collided with him So you re playing tricks on a poor lone widow woman are you asked the captain in no very pleasant tones We we didn t mean any harm said Bob No I suppose not Boys never do but the harm comes Now I m going to march you two lads right up before the mast and you re going to apologize to the widow If you don t why I reckon a cat o nine tails will fit the case pretty well missus Mooney was standing in her door as the captain led the two boys up to her Here s the burglars you were shouting about ma am he said One of em a relative of mine I m sorry to say They ve come to beg your pardon Go ahead boys I m sorry about the tic tac said Bob in a low voice We didn t mean nothin added Ted Was it you boys asked the widow I was so frightened I thought burglars were trying to cut out a pane of glass I don t believe they ll do it again remarked Captain Spark Will you boys No sir they chorused That s right Now come on Bob I m going to your house The captain was warmly welcomed by mister and missus Henderson a little later Bob was wondering whether the captain would say anything about the recent prank but the old seaman said nothing though his eyes twinkled when in response to a question from mister Henderson as to where the captain had met Bob the former replied that there had been a collision in the dark That night after Bob had gone to bed missus Henderson had a talk with her relative I don t know what to do with Bob she said He is always getting into mischief He is not a bad boy at heart but he is thoughtless Yes that he is agreed Captain Spark I am almost sure he was up to some prank tonight went on Bob s mother I shall probably hear about it in the morning when some of the neighbors call to make a complaint Oh dear I wish I knew what to do I ll tell you what suddenly exclaimed the captain banging his fist down on the table with emphasis Let me take him to sea with me aboard the Eagle Take him to sea Take Bob on a voyage asked missus Henderson That s it You let me take him and I ll guarantee I ll make a man of him The land is no place for a boy anyhow He needs a bit of ocean travel to broaden his views That is a strange proposition said mister Henderson We must think it over CHAPTER IV TALKING IT OVER Captain Spark was invited to spend a week or more at the Henderson home He was up bright and early the next morning in fact before any one else and Bob hearing some one moving around downstairs and knowing his father and mother were not in the habit of having such an early breakfast descended to see who it was Good morning my lad greeted the mariner I suppose you are going to take the morning watch and holystone the decks Nothing like being active when you re young It will keep you from getting old Yes sir replied Bob for he did not know what else to say Haven t got any more tic tacs have you and there was a twinkle in the captain s eyes No sir That s right If you ve got to play tricks do it on somebody your size Then it s fair Don t scare lone widows I won t do it again promised Bob who felt a little ashamed of his prank of the previous night Soon missus Henderson came downstairs to get breakfast and when the meal was over Bob got ready for school mister Henderson leaving for his work in the woolen mill When Bob was safely out of the way Captain Spark once more brought up before missus Henderson the proposition he had made the night before Well Lucy he said for he called missus Henderson by her first name have you thought over what I said about taking Bob to sea Yes I have And what do you think of it Well to tell you the truth I don t like the idea Why not I m sure it would be good for him It might I m sure you mean it well but I couldn t bear to have him go It will make a man of him cure him of some of his foolish ways I m sure Perhaps it would Bob is very wild I know but I think I have more influence over him than any one else He will do anything for me or for his father either for that matter I am afraid if Bob got away from our influence he would be worse than he is now Oh we have a few good influences aboard the Eagle said the captain with a grim smile Only we don t call em influences We call em ropes ends or cat o nine tails or a belaying pin I ve known a limber rope s end applied in the right place do more good to a boy than lots of medicine Oh but captain I couldn t have Bob beaten No of course not I was only joking Not that it doesn t do a boy good though once in a while to have a good tanning But I don t recommend it for a steady diet Bob s father has never whipped him since he was a small lad went on missus Henderson Not that he doesn t seem to deserve it sometimes even now but mister Henderson believes in talking to him and showing him how wrong he has acted Yes talk is good admitted the mariner but if there s a rope s end handy it sometimes makes the talk a little more effective just a little bit I suppose life aboard a sailing ship is very hard now a days ventured missus Henderson Somehow she dwelt on the plan of having the captain take Bob though she felt she could not consent to it No harder than it ever was In fact it s easier than when I was a boy and ran away to sea Those were hard days and I ve never forgot em That s why I try to treat all my sailors and cabin boys as if they were human beings Now you d better think my plan over It would do Bob a world of good to go to sea You d hardly know him when he got back Oh I don t know what to do said Bob s mother No I don t think I can consent He might be drowned and I would never forgive myself I don t believe his father would consent either Well think it over advised the captain I m going to be in this port for some time We re loading for a trip around Cape Horn and it will take two weeks or more to get in shape There s time enough to decide between now and then I don t believe I could ever consent declared missus Henderson I think Bob will settle down pretty soon and give up playing pranks I don t said the captain to himself That boy is too full of mischief He needs a sea voyage to soak some of it out of him But that s the way with mothers Well I ll wait a while I think something may happen to make her change her mind before I sail The captain did not know what a good prophet he was When Bob came home from school that noon time he was surprised to see his mother and Captain Spark in earnest conversation At first Bob thought the mariner might be telling of the escapade of the tic tac but when his mother made a warning gesture of silence to Captain Spark on beholding Bob the boy was puzzled They must have been talking about me he decided but what could it be I don t think he would tell about the tic tac but there s certainly something queer afoot The truth was that the captain was renewing his plan of taking Bob to sea Had the boy known of it he would have been much surprised for he never dreamed of such a thing How did you get along at school to day asked Captain Spark as missus Henderson went out to get dinner Pretty well Didn t put any bent pins in the teacher s chair did you No sir The boy hoped the captain would not ask him what other prank he had been up to for the truth was that Bob had that morning taken a live mouse to the classroom releasing it during a study period and nearly sending the woman teacher and the girl pupils into hysterics His part had not been discovered but the teacher had threatened to keep the whole class of boys in that night until the guilty one confessed and Bob knew he would have to tell sooner or later if some of his companions did not squeal on him in order that they might be released from suspicion That s right went on the mariner Never put bent pins in the teacher s chair As Bob feared some one during the afternoon session told of his part in the mouse episode and he was the only one kept in The teacher made him stay while she corrected a lot of examination papers and in the silent schoolroom the boy began to wish he had not been so fond of a joke The teacher who was a kind hearted woman talked seriously to her rather wild pupil pointing out that it was a cowardly thing for a boy to frighten girls Bob had never looked at it in just that light and he was pretty well ashamed of himself when he was allowed to go home with an admonition that he must mend his ways or be liable to expulsion I ll bet he s been up to some mischief Lucy said Captain Spark when Bob came home quite late that afternoon Perhaps he has I hope it was nothing serious Shall I ask him what it was No we ll find it out sooner or later and I don t want his father to worry more than he has to He has hard work at the mill and I like his evenings to be as free from care as possible That s just like a woman growled the mariner to himself They take more than their share of the burdens that the men and boys ought to bear But never mind I ll get Bob yet and when I do I ll make a man of him or know the reason why He ll find it much different on board ship from what he has it here in this quiet little village Bob was all unconscious of what fate had in store for him CHAPTER V A JOKE THAT WENT WRONG For several days after the prank with the mouse Bob did not play any jokes The teacher ascribed that fact to the lecture she had given him Bob s mother who also noticed that he was much more quiet than usual feared he was going to be sick I never knew him to be so subdued she thought I think I must give him some sulphur and molasses Perhaps he is getting some disease She mentioned it to the captain Nonsense said the mariner He s hatching up some trick that s what he s doing You want to look out Oh captain I don t think so Well I do Now you mark my words It s down on the chart that Bob is up to some mischief He s hauled down his colors for a while but that s only to fool the enemy First thing you know he ll hoist the Jolly Roger and then there ll be some queer doings in these waters Hoist the Jolly Roger I mean turn pirate so to speak You keep your eye on that boy Lucy Something s going to break loose or I m a Dutchman Bob s father thought his son s subdued behavior on the few days following the captain s arrival was due to a hint Bob had obtained that unless he mended his ways he might be sent on a long voyage to work his passage Now the truth was that Bob was merely waiting for a good chance to play a trick He was not particular what sort of a trick it was so long as it created a laugh The consequences never gave him a thought or worry So as he could think of nothing sufficiently funny to do he remained quiet But all the while he was looking about to see if he and his boon companion Ted Neefus could not perpetrate some prank that would be worth while Things are awful slow complained Ted one afternoon as he and Bob walked home from school That s right agreed Bob But wait I ve got a plan What is it Bob looked carefully up and down the street Then he glanced behind him Next he drew Ted into some bushes that lined the thoroughfare on which they were walking You know what s going to happen Friday night don t you Bob asked No what The annual donation party for the minister Well what of it I m going That s nothing Don t you generally go So do I though I don t see much fun in it Ma makes me She says it saves gittin a meal at home but I don t like the stuff they have there I don t either not much but I m going this time and so are you Because listen something s going to happen Honest Bob nodded vigorously several times There was a bright twinkle in his eyes Don t say a word to anybody he cautioned Ted but just you be on hand This is going to be the best joke yet Maybe he ll get mad What if he does He won t know who did it You and I will be up in the gallery or somewhere and no one will see us I ll bet there ll be some fun The chief trouble was as I have pointed out before that Bob s ideas of fun and those of other persons did not always agree Boys and older folks seldom think the same on any subject and so how can they be expected to about jokes The minister s donation party was an annual affair in Moreville reverend Daniel Blackton who had charge of the only church in the village did not receive a very large salary and it was the custom to give him a donation party once a year to help pay him This usually took the form of a supper held in the church parlors The women of the congregation provided the food and a small price was charged for the meal Nearly every one including the men folks and the children attended and sometimes quite a fair sum was realized in this way In addition every one who could afford to was expected to bring some donation for the minister The women would knit him mittens or slippers or socks they would crochet articles for the minister s wife or bring jars of preserves which were very welcome at the parsonage The men would donate wood garden products or whatever they could best afford In this way while the reverend gentleman s salary was not large he managed to obtain a comfortable living It was to this donation party or supper that Bob and Ted were going and as they crouched in the shadow of the bushes they perfected Bob s plan for some fun missus Henderson was usually on the committee of arrangements for the supper and this occasion was no exception For a week before she was busy making pies and cakes and getting great pans of baked beans ready for the supper victuals were of a plain but very wholesome sort As Captain Spark was a guest at the Henderson home at the time the supper was to be held he of course was invited to attend an invitation he quickly accepted for he was fond of hearty eating and he was not ashore often enough so that such affairs as donation suppers were distasteful to him as they are to some persons At last the eventful evening came Bob dressed in his best suit prepared to accompany his parents and Captain Spark to the church Such a thing as their son attempting a joke at the donation supper never occurred to mister or missus Henderson It is true that at the affair there was more or less jollity and good natured fun after the formal function of supper was over and the minister had asked the blessing But no one had ever dared play such a joke as Bob contemplated If his mother had in the least suspected him of even dreaming of it she would have made him stay at home There was a good sized throng in the church when the Henderson party arrived Long tables had been set in the parlors which were back of the church proper Women in long white aprons were hurrying to and fro getting ready to serve the meal Bob followed his parents and the captain into the edifice Is everything all ready asked Ted Neefus in a whisper as he approached Bob Don t come near me was the cautious answer Folks ll suspect if they see us together So Ted quickly glided away and was lost in the crowd The tables were all set the victuals put on and nearly every one had arrived I guess we d better get the chairs up now proposed missus Olney who with missus Henderson was superintending things Some of the boys can do it I will mom volunteered Bob who stood near his mother I ll get some of the fellows to help me That s good said missus Henderson Bob hurried away and soon he Ted Neefus Will Merton Sam Shoop and some other chums were placing the chairs at the long tables Is it all ready asked Ted in a hoarse whisper Hush can t you cautioned Bob Do you want to give it away All was in readiness for the grown folks to sit down They would eat first then the tables would be set anew and the young people would have their turn There was always more fun at the second table and Bob and his chums would take their meals there Some one told reverend Daniel Blackton that supper was ready and he moved up to the head of the table prepared to say grace In honor of missus Henderson who was one of the chief workers in the church her relative Captain Spark had been accorded a place next to the minister Come on up in the gallery now said Bob to Ted We can see the fun from there Bob had been busy straightening the chairs near the head of the table Just as the boys reached the gallery the assembled diners took their seats The reverend gentleman stood up to say grace and then sat down How long before it works asked Ted It s working now replied Bob but you won t see the full effect until he gets up Think he ll make much of a fuss Naw He s too good natured He ll only laugh The meal progressed To and fro went the women with big plates of food Every one seemed to have a good appetite and some young people who were hungry began to think the grown folks would never get done But at last there was a general scraping of chairs as they were pushed back Watch now called Bob to several of his cronies who were with him in the gallery that overlooked the room where supper was being served He s getting up In fact nearly every one was leaving the table The tall form of reverend Daniel Blackton was seen to rise Something else arose also It was the minister s chair He felt that something was wrong and half turned around What he saw caused a deep flush to spread over his pale face His chair was glued fast to him and wherever he moved the chair went too Oh exclaimed Bob in a hoarse and horrified whisper I put the stuff on the wrong chair I wanted Captain Spark to stick fast and I put it on the minister s chair by mistake By this time the dominie was endeavoring to pull the chair loose from the seat of his trousers But the glue Bob had spread was very sticky Pull and tug as he did the minister could not free himself First there was a murmur then some one laughed In a moment the whole room was in an uproar You ll catch it prophesied Ted in an awestruck whisper I won t unless some of you squeal on me declared Bob He looked over the balcony railing at the struggling minister who was trying in vain to get free from the chair Nobody ll squeal declared Will Merton Of course not added Sam Shoop CHAPTER VI missus HENDERSON S DECISION The minister very much embarrassed was doing his best to get rid of the chair It was hard work for if he turned around to one side to grasp it the chair naturally swung away from him It was several seconds before any one thought to aid him Then Captain Spark came to his relief Guess I ll have to give you a hand dominie he said You re anchored pretty hard and fast on a shoal and you ll need help to break loose How did it happen Did you sit down on an egg Some one put glue in the chair I did not notice it until I tried to get up Glue eh The captain s eyes had a queer look in them Yes I suppose some of the boys did it for a joke Pretty poor sort of a joke remarked missus Olney I could almost put my hand on the boy that did it too She looked to see if missus Henderson had heard her but Bob s mother was on the other side of the room and was not fully aware of what had happened Captain Spark tried to pull the chair loose from the minister but the glue had taken a firm hold and the only result of his efforts was to drag the reverend gentleman about the room Illustration Captain Spark tried to pull the chair loose All this while the people were trying hard not to laugh But it was impossible Men were chuckling and endeavoring to suppress their mirth and nearly all the women were red in the face from holding in their laughter Guess you d better sit down dominie advised the captain If I do I ll stick faster than before Well if you do I ll put my feet on the rounds of the chair and hold it down while you get up Maybe you can pull loose I m afraid said reverend mister Blackton Afraid of what I might tear my trousers and he added in a whisper to the captain they re the best pair I have Might as well be killed for a sheep as a goat replied the mariner They re spoiled anyhow by this glue Better try to pull loose Go on I ll hold your chair down Thus advised the minister sat down The crowd watched with anxiety not unmixed with mirth Even the clergyman himself could not help smiling though it was quite an embarrassing position for a dignified gentleman Would you mind putting your feet on the rounds on the other side asked the captain of mister Henderson Between us both I guess we can hold him down The two men bore heavily on the chair rounds and mister Blackton strained to rise There was a pulling ripping sound and he hesitated Then feeling that he must get loose no matter what happened he gave a mighty tug and was free But his trousers though only slightly torn were covered with glue Now that it was over and the excitement was beginning to cool down the minister began to feel a little natural anger at the perpetrator of the Joke His best trousers were spoiled and the donation supper had been thrown into confusion Who did it was the question asked on every side The boys came slowly down from the gallery and mingled unnoticed with the throng Bob was a little worried He had not meant to humiliate the minister but had counted on Captain Spark getting stuck to the chair The captain he knew would make light of the prank But it was no small matter to have done this thing to the clergyman Going to supper asked Ted of Bob No I don t feel like eating Guess I ll go home But Bob s plan was frustrated His mother who had been looking for her son caught sight of him Oh Bob she exclaimed I hope none of the boys that you go with played that horrid trick on the minister It was a very mean thing to do But you had better have your supper The table will soon be ready again Bob did not have much appetite He was afraid of being discovered The chair with the glue on it had been taken to the cellar and the minister had gone home to change his trousers Captain Spark who had begun to turn certain things over in his mind approached Bob He had a sharp eye had the mariner and in looking closely at his relative s son he saw a bit of evidence that Bob had not counted on This was nothing more nor less than a big spot of glue on the lad s coat sleeve What s this asked the seaman pointing to the sticky place I don t know Glue I guess replied Bob turning pale Glue eh Seems to be about as sticky as that on the minister s chair At the mention of glue several persons about Bob and the captain looked curiously at them missus Henderson who was just then passing carrying a big platter of baked beans stopped to listen to what the seaman was saying Yes it s glue remarked the mariner Just like that on the chair Bob he asked suddenly did you put that glue there Now with all his faults Bob would never tell a lie He regarded that as cowardly and he was always willing to take whatever punishment was coming to him for his jokes Yes captain he said in a low voice I did it Ha I thought so Bob Henderson exclaimed his mother her face flushing red with mortification Did you play that horrid joke on the minister Yes but I didn t mean to You didn t mean to No I thought some one else was going to sit on that chair You thought some one else was Why that s just as bad almost Who did you think would sit there Captain Spark You young rascal exclaimed the commander of the Eagle but he did not seem very angry So that was intended to anchor me down eh Well I must look into this I thought you d sit there went on Bob So I was going to but the minister made me change as he s a little deaf on one side and he wanted to ask me some questions about the Fiji Islanders There was now quite a crowd around Bob his mother and the captain missus Henderson did not know what to do Up to now Bob s pranks had been bad enough but to play this trick on the minister and at the annual donation supper where nearly every person in the village was present was the climax She felt that she had been much humiliated Bob s father heard what had happened and came up to his son Bob he said in a curiously quiet voice you must go home at once I shall have to punish you severely for this Bob knew what that meant He wished most heartily that he had not played this last prank But it was too late now I told you I thought he was up to something whispered the captain to missus Henderson Yes you were right she admitted Now my mind is made up Captain I wish you would take him to sea with you at once I can stand his foolishness no longer Bob was out of the room by this time and did not hear his mother s decision Do you mean that Lucy asked Captain Spark eagerly Yes I do I am determined Bob shall go to sea Perhaps it will teach him a lesson and he will mend his ways It will be the making of him declared the captain heartily I m glad you decided this I ll make arrangements at once CHAPTER VII BOB IS DELIGHTED The excitement caused by Bob s prank had somewhat quieted down and the preparations went on for giving the young people their supper Several of Bob s chums however fearful that they might be suspected of having taken part in the trick left the church As a matter of fact though Bob alone was concerned He had thought of the trick procured a bottle of liquid glue from the drug store and watching his chance had poured it on the chair Then he had told his chums of it and they had withdrawn with him to the gallery to watch events which came quickly enough At the supper table of the young people little was talked of but Bob s prank and opinion was pretty evenly divided as to what would happen Maybe the minister will have him arrested suggested one girl Oh I don t think so was the opinion of another mister Blackton is a kind hearted man and he likes Bob But I don t believe he ll like him after tonight Maybe not It was a mean thing to do but I couldn t help laughing when the minister stood up and the chair went with him swinging around every time he moved the legs hitting everybody Yes it was odd I had to laugh too The girls and several of their companions indulged in merriment at the recollection The minister soon returned to the church parlors wearing a different pair of trousers and he seemed to have regained his good humor Who was the boy who wanted me to remain seated all the evening and perhaps longer he asked It was Bob Henderson volunteered several Yes mister Blackton said missus Henderson I am sorry to have to admit that it was my son who played that prank But he is going to be punished for it His father has sent him home and has followed after him I hope he will not punish Bob too severely It was a boyish prank due more to thoughtlessness than to malice I suppose it was but Bob plays altogether too many such pranks I think this will be the last Well tell Bob I forgive him though my trousers are ruined mister Henderson will arrange with you about that What er what chastisement does he contemplate administering to Bob asked the minister He and missus Henderson were conversing off to one side in a corner of the room I hope he will not whip him Bob is too big a boy to be whipped Still parson you know what the Good Book says Spare the rod and spoil the child Yes missus Henderson I know Chastisement is all right in many cases but there are other means And it is my plan to take them went on Bob s mother I have just made arrangements with Captain Spark to take Bob with him on a long sea voyage A sea voyage That ought to be fine Yes I think that will be better than whipping Bob Tell your husband I said so I shall Now if you will excuse me I must see that these young people have plenty to eat They are a hungry lot Indeed they are Don t forget to tell Bob I forgive him I don t want him to worry Tell him also that he must be a little more thoughtful I will When Captain Spark and missus Henderson went home from the donation supper that night they discussed on the way the further plans of sending Bob to sea We must consult mister Henderson about it said the captain I shall this very night I will put up with Bob s nonsense no longer mister Henderson was found sitting in the dining room reading a paper He had sent Bob to bed on arriving at the house for mister Henderson was a man who did not believe in inflicting punishment in the heat of passion He wanted to calm down before he decided how his son ought to be made to realize the wrong he had done To tell the truth he was quite at a loss just what punishment to inflict He had thought of a sound whipping but he realized as had the minister that Bob was too old for this Nothing so breaks the proud spirit of a boy as personal chastisement after he has reached a certain age And as yet mister Henderson was not aware of the proposition Captain Spark had made to Bob s mother and her practical acceptance of it Of course mister Henderson had heard the first talk of sending Bob to sea but after his wife s refusal to consider it he had thought no more about it Well Enos asked missus Henderson as she and the captain entered have you considered what to do with Bob I have Lucy but I have reached no conclusion I have You have What is it I am going to send him on a voyage with Captain Spark That is if you consent I will agree to anything you think best But I think you will find it hard work to get Bob to go I fear he will dislike the idea very much Why so inquired the captain Well Bob has many friends in the village many boy chums and I think he would object very strongly to leaving them and going off among a lot of strange men in a ship I wouldn t be a stranger to him No you would not but the others would be And I think he would be somewhat afraid Afraid What s there to be afraid of on the ocean with a stout deck beneath your feet The ocean is the safest place in the world I m frightened half out of my wits every time I come on land There are so many chances of accidents The train may run off the track steam boilers may blow up there may be an earthquake a wild bull may chase you you may fall down a coal hole and break your neck or a building may topple over on you while you re walking peacefully along the street No such things as those can happen to you on the ocean No perhaps not but there are others as bad or worse captain Nonsense It may blow a bit now and then but all you ve got to do is mind your helm and you ll come out all right I am glad you think so I should be very glad to have Bob make a trip with you I think it would do him good but I fear he will object to it I don t think so We ll propose it to him in the morning Bob came down to breakfast feeling rather sheepish He had been wondering during the time he was not sleeping what form of punishment his father would inflict The lad had an uneasy feeling that he might have to make a public apology before the whole church congregation This he felt would be very embarrassing He also had an idea that his father might take him from school and put him to work in the mill mister Henderson had once threatened this when Bob had played some particularly annoying prank And Bob liked his school very much in spite of the tricks he played Well my son said mister Henderson more solemnly than he usually spoke I trust you have a proper feeling of regret for what you did last night Yes I wish I hadn t done it said Bob I didn t think it would make so much trouble I didn t mean to use so much glue Well there is no use in discussing that now The thing is done You remember I told you I would have to punish you Yes sir I have talked it over with your mother and Captain Spark and we have made up our minds what to do You are going to be sent on a long sea voyage with Captain Spark in the Eagle You will be away from home a long time and when you return I trust you will have mended your ways For a few seconds Bob did not speak The proposition was so sudden to him that he did not exactly comprehend it I m to go to sea with Captain Spark he asked slowly That is the punishment we have decided on my son Where are you going captain asked Bob I m bound for round Cape Horn this trip Oh you ll get all the ocean you want but it will make a man of you When are you going to sail asked Bob in a quiet voice Next week Good exclaimed the youth suddenly I ll be ready Oh I always wanted to make a sea voyage and now I have the chance This is the best ever Hurrah That s the stuff A life on the ocean wave a home on the bounding deep Avast and belay my hearties Shiver my timbers All hands on deck to take in sail There she blows Bob had not read sea stories for nothing That s the way to talk exclaimed the captain I knew he d like the idea mister Henderson seemed somewhat amazed He had expected Bob to make strong objections Instead the boy was delighted I am sorry to see you leave home Bob said his mother with just the hint of tears in her eyes but I think it will be the best thing for you So do I mom Hurrah This is the best ever Then Bob began to dance a sailor s hornpipe It seems to me said mister Henderson to himself as he started for the mill that Bob s punishment is more of a pleasure than anything else Still if it does him good I ll not regret it CHAPTER VIII GETTING READY Captain Spark s ship the Eagle was a large craft and in her he had made many voyages At present the vessel was docked at a seaport town not many miles from Moreville The day it was announced to Bob that he was to make a sea voyage the captain left the village to visit the Eagle at the dock and see how the loading of the cargo was progressing I want to sail as soon as possible he said and though I left a good mate in charge still I like to look after certain matters myself I ll be back in a few days and let you know Bob the exact date for sailing In the meanwhile you can be getting ready Aye aye sir answered the boy trying as he had read of sailors doing to pull a lock of his reddish hair but finding it too short He had decided to adopt all the sea practices he had ever read about Get your bag ready went on the captain have your mother put some needles and thread in for you ll have to mend your own clothes at sea and I ll look it over when I get back Aye aye sir The captain laughed at Bob s sudden enthusiasm for the sea and ship terms but he was not displeased As for Bob he thought the time would never pass until he would find himself aboard the Eagle That very day he began to sort over his clothes trying to decide which he should take and he had such a miscellaneous collection of garments that when his mother saw them she laughed Bob she exclaimed It would take three trunks to hold them and I don t believe sailors are ever allowed more than one At least in all the pictures I ever saw of sailors going on board a ship they only had a small box or bag on their shoulder and of course that must have contained all their clothes I guess you re right mother I ll have to sort out some of these Never mind I ll do that But what in the world are you doing with those rubber boots I was going to take them along Sailors seldom wear rubber boots They go barefoot when it s wet on deck For missus Henderson knew something about seafaring men from her long acquaintance with Captain Spark Another mistake admitted Bob good naturedly Guess I ve got lots to learn about the ocean and ships Yes indeed Bob And I hope you will profit by it It is no place to play pranks either on board a ship But I ve read that when the ship crosses the equator the sailors cut up all kinds of high jinks Yes I suppose they do but that is not very often I have no doubt Captain Spark will permit fun on that occasion If we go down around Cape Horn and up the west coast of North and South America we ll cross the equator twice went on Bob We can have fun both times I m afraid you re thinking more of the fun you are going to have than the real reason for this voyage Bob It is a punishment for your prank on the minister I know it but mom I can t seem to feel that way about it And I don t know as I blame you Bob though of course it was very wrong to put glue on the reverend gentleman s chair Bob felt he must tell the news of his prospective voyage to his chums Leaving his mother to sort out his clothes he went out in the street It was Saturday and there was no school In fact the term would close in another week so Bob would miss little instruction by taking the cruise The first lad Bob met was Ted Neefus His chum hurried up to him and Inquired Did he hurt you very much Who Your father My father What do you mean Didn t he give you a good walloping for that joke No Not a bit of it I m going on a sea voyage with Captain Spark Honest Cross my heart and Bob went through a rapid motion with his hands somewhere over the region of his stomach Where to Around Cape Horn No jokin Of course not But that s nothing Captain Spark has been all over the world Bob spoke as though doubling the Horn was the easiest thing a mariner meets with I wonder if he doesn t want another boy mused Ted wistfully Don t believe so Wish he did We could have jolly times together I m going out to learn how to sail a ship not to have fun replied Bob with an air of lofty virtue He had said nothing about this voyage being a sort of discipline as punishment for his prank He did not think that necessary When are you goin Next week And then the two boys fell to discussing the trip in all its aspects Soon other boys joined Bob and Ted but the perpetrator of the glue joke was the center of attraction In fact Bob was regarded as a sort of village hero There was more interest manifested in geography at school the following week than ever before Everybody knew without telling where Cape Horn was and as for the Straits of Magellan they could have pointed them out in the dark The prospect of the trip too had a certain effect on Bob His mind was so filled with the thought of it that he actually forgot about planning any jokes Nor would he take part in any with the other village boys Let s go down past old Mary Bounder s house and throw stones at the door Then she ll come out and chase us and one of us can go in and get her pet cat and tie a can to its tail proposed Ted the following Monday Mary Bounder was a curious old woman who lived all alone in a cabin near the woods and was the mark for many a joke on the part of the boys Nope said Bob firmly What s the matter Sick asked Ted in surprise No but I ve got to do some studying Studying Why there s only a little more school I don t mean that kind of studying I m learning the different parts of a ship so I ll know em when I get to sea Ted had momentarily forgotten about Bob s voyage That s so he said You ll be going away soon Say we ought to have some fun before you go Guess I ve played enough jokes for a while But we ought to have one more Come down to Mary Bounder s Sam Shoop will go He ll catch the cat Nope I m going home I got a new book on sea terms and I want to look at it All right Then Sam and I ll go You ll wish you d come We ll have some fun But Bob could not be persuaded His mother and father noticed the change in him and they were delighted I believe we made no mistake when we consented to the captain s plan said mister Henderson If it will only last added his wife That day a letter came from Captain Spark saying he would be detained a few days longer and would not reach Moreville until Wednesday The ship will sail the following Saturday he stated in his note I could sail Friday but I don t want to take any chances Some of my sailors are superstitious and I want them all to be in good humor I trust Bob has not changed his mind about going No indeed said the boy when the letter was shown to him That afternoon as Bob was coming back from the store he met on the main street of the village an old man who lived on the outskirts of the town His name was Captain Obediah Hickson and he had once been a sailor though he told so many different versions of his life at sea that it was hard to say where truth began and fiction left off Still he might not have meant to deceive any one for he was rather simple minded What s this I hear about you going to take a long sea voyage he asked of Bob It s true Captain Obed which was what every one called the aged man I m going around Cape Horn with Captain Spark We start soon Around Cape Horn eh Then you ll strike the Southern Pacific I expect so A curious change seemed to come over the old man He looked carefully up and down the street to see that no one was in sight and then approaching quite closely to Bob he whispered Bob come to my house to night What for Hush Not so loud I ve a great secret to disclose What about asked Bob with a smile thinking to humor the old captain About buried treasure It s on a lonely island in the Southern Pacific Ocean I m the only living man who knows where it is If I wasn t so old I d go along and help find it But I m too old It needs some one young and strong You ll dig it up for me won t you If I could find it replied Bob believing the aged man was speaking of some delusion Oh you can find it I have the secret map I ll give it to you Come to my house to night but after dark after dark mind And once more looking around to see that no one had observed him Captain Obed shuffled on down the street Bob did not know what to think CHAPTER IX BOB S LAST LAND JOKE Returning home Bob said nothing to his mother about what Captain Obed had said The boy wanted to think more about it If he could combine a treasure hunt with his sea voyage it would be a fine thing Besides why should not the old man know something of hidden treasure He had sailed in many waters and been on many ships Bob decided he would visit him that night Accordingly when it grew dusk he set off for the lonely house where the old sailor lived It was quite a walk but in his eagerness Bob covered the ground in short time As he was passing a clump of bushes not far from his destination he was surprised to hear a voice calling sharply from the darkness Avast there Who is it asked Bob It s me replied Captain Obed in his husky voice I hid out here to signal you so s you wouldn t be followed Followed Who by By persons anxious to get hold of the secret map that tells of the treasure buried on the island Are you all alone Bob Of course Then go ahead into my house I ll follow as soon as I ve taken an observation The boy thought the old man must be rather queer to imagine any one would try to steal his secret if secret he had Bob was half inclined to give the whole thing up But he walked on and was soon inside the rather humble home of the retired mariner Presently Captain Obed entered and quickly closed the door Have to be very careful very careful he said in a whisper If any one knowed I had this map they d rob me of it He pulled down the shades of the windows and then carefully locking the door he went to another room Bob heard him fumbling about and soon the old man came out with a yellowish piece of paper in his hand Feel of it he said to Bob Bob did so It was stiff and crackly Parchment parchment whispered Captain Obed The map is drawed on parchment that s sheepskin instead of paper He wanted it to last for years and years Who did Once more Captain Obed looked around to see if by chance any one had stolen into the room He made Bob rather nervous Captain Kidd he answered in a lower whisper than he had yet used Captain Kidd drawed that map It gives the real secret of his buried treasure I m the only one that knows where it is There s lots of maps of Captain Kidd s treasure but I ve got the only real one All them others was jest drawed so as to fool folks An they did fool em Cause why Cause nobody ain t never yet found the captain s treasure But you ll find it an you ll bring it home to Captain Obed won t you Bob Of course you will You re a good boy and if you bring it home safe why I ll give you he paused and seemed to make a great effort yes I ll give you a hundred dollars or maybe a hundred and fifty There What do you say to that How much treasure is there asked Bob hardly knowing whether to laugh at the old man or take him seriously How much It must be near a million dollars O h there s lots of treasure It struck Bob that if there was that amount he would not be getting much for his share Now you take that map went on Captain Obed It gives the exact location or the island and shows where the treasure is buried on it right in the center of a place where four trees grow The island is about eighty two degrees west longitude and twenty one degrees south latitude It ll be easy to locate Just cruise about in that locality for a few days and you ll find it Then dig up the treasure But suppose Captain Spark doesn t want to cruise around there It s his ship Oh you give him twenty five dollars or so out of your share mind you and he ll be glad enough to do it Now Bob I rely on you You re the only one I ever told my secret to and I want you to keep it close Don t let em get that map away from you They ll try oh they ll try dreadful hard I got it from my grandfather who had it direct from Captain Kidd himself so I know it s correct Now Bob you d better go Take good care of the map and bring me the treasure He thrust the yellow crackling piece of parchment into Bob s hands and opened the door Put it in your pocket he cautioned as Bob went out Some one might see you Now Bob was quite a level headed youth and though he knew that sometimes treasure might be found on islands in the ocean where it had been hidden by modern pirates or illegal pearl fishers he did not take much stock in what Captain Obed had told him Still he thought it would be no harm to take the parchment and show it to Captain Spark That seasoned mariner would soon be able to tell if it was worth anything At any rate Bob was not going to lie awake at night over the possibility the very small possibility of securing the treasure Guess I ll have to make a better bargain for my share of it before I do much searching he decided The boy said nothing to his parents about the parchment map He preferred letting Captain Spark know of it first as that seemed fairer to the old sailor who had given it to him Then as the time was drawing nearer to the date of sailing Bob s thoughts dwelt more and more on his prospective trip Don t you notice quite a change in Bob asked missus Henderson of her husband the next day He seems to have settled down and he hasn t played a joke in a long time No he hasn t But you know the proverb about a new broom sweeping clean Just now Bob s mind is so full of the sea that he thinks of nothing else Wait a while If he gets away with Captain Spark without playing some sort of a trick before he goes I ll be agreeably disappointed I think he will I m so glad the captain came to pay us a visit when he did It was a lucky thing for Bob I think it was He was getting quite reckless in his pranks The subject of this conversation was of course not aware of it The truth was that Bob was fairly holding himself in He saw many opportunities to play jokes more in fact than he had ever seen before It was a great temptation to indulge in pranks but he reflected that if he got into any more trouble he might not be allowed to take the sea voyage And I wouldn t want that to happen for the world he said to himself Still I know a couple of dandy jokes I could play before I go Maybe I might get Ted Neefus to do em but I don t believe he could do em as good as I can Bob was pondering over the rather queer fact to him that old folks don t care half as much for jokes as boys do when his mother asked him to go on an errand for her This was to take a message to missus Dodson who lived in a large house on a hill just outside the village She was quite wealthy and missus Henderson used to do some fine embroidering for her Bob who was always ready to oblige his mother took the package of sewing and the note which went with it and started off On the way he passed the wagon of a certain old crusty farmer he knew The vehicle was in front of a house where the farmer had gone to sell some butter and eggs Dangling from the back of the wagon was a long rope and it was a great temptation to Bob to take the rope and tie one of the rear wheels so that it would not revolve The farmer coming out in a hurry would not notice it and would wonder what was the matter when he started to drive off But I guess I d better not thought Bob with a sigh He d be sure to tell dad and then I d be in more trouble I ve got a pretty good reputation since the donation supper and I don t want to spoil it Bob delivered the embroidery and note to missus Dodson and was on his way back home when he saw Susan Skipper missus Dodson s hired girl and Dent Freeman the hired man of the place washing the big front windows of the house that is Dent was washing them perched upon a step ladder for Susan was quite heavy and was afraid to trust herself very high in the air However she was doing her share by handing up pails of warm water to Dent Now Dent and Susan as Bob well knew were what the country people call sweet on one another Susan was very fond of the hired man and as for Dent he thought there never had been a better cook than Susan They lost no chance of talking to each other and as the window cleaning operations afforded them a good opportunity they were taking advantage of it All at once a daring plan came into Bob s mind It seemed as if he could not resist it for he thought of what he considered a fine joke As he was well acquainted with the hired man and cook he walked toward them Perhaps he would not have been flattered if he had heard what they said as he approached Here comes that Henderson lad remarked Dent He s allers up to some trick Look out for him Susan Oh I can look out for myself It s you that wants to be cautious He d just like to spill your pail of water So they did not look with much favor on Bob s appearance However Bob once he had set his mind on a bit of mischief knew how to carry it through Hello Dent he said good naturedly Dad wants to know if you have any more of that rheumatic medicine you made It fixed him up in great shape This was true enough though mister Henderson had not given the message to Bob that day having some time previously requested him to deliver it the first chance he got Sure I have some more replied the hired man If he was open to flattery on any point it was on his skill as a maker of rheumatism cures He had tried several and had at last decided that he had hit on one that was infallible He had a notion of setting up in the drug business I ll get you a bottle if you wait a while Bob he said I ll wait This was not very welcome news to Susan She wanted to have a private conversation with Dent and she could not while Bob was present But the boy s plan was not completed As he stood idly by the step ladder on the top of which was Dent washing away at the windows with the pail of warm water beside him Bob appeared to be toying with a bit of string I don t s pose you have any doughnuts left Susan he ventured rather wistfully Now Susan had not forgiven Bob for a little joke he had played on her some time before so at his hint to show her displeasure she turned her back and did not answer This was just what Bob wanted Looking up to see that Dent was not observing him he passed one end of the string about the step ladder Tying it securely he fastened the other end to Susan s apron strings in such a manner that it would not pull off I ll wait for you out in the barn he said to Dent when it became evident that Susan was not going to take the hint and get the doughnuts In fact Bob much as he liked them would have been disappointed if she had gone in for some He wanted to get out of the way before a certain thing happened He strolled off but instead of going to the barn he hid around the corner of the house Susan and Dent conversed for several minutes longer the man meanwhile busy at the windows Then the cook hearing her mistress calling her started for the house in a hurry The result was disastrous As she started off the string tied to the ladder and her apron tightened As Susan was a woman of heavy weight it did not take much effort on her part to pull over the ladder together with Dent and the pail of water Dent came down to the ground fortunately landing on his feet like a cat The pail of water described a graceful curve and splashed on both Susan and the man The cook whose feet became tangled up in the falling ladder slipped and fell knocking Dent down and there they were in a heap both soaking wet And that was Bob s joke Hidden around the corner of the house he laughed so he almost betrayed his position Oh that s too funny he whispered It was like clowns in a circus CHAPTER X OFF ON THE TRIP For a few seconds both the cook and the hired man whose feet Susan had knocked from under him did not move The suddenness of it all was too much for them Then Dent arose after a struggle Did you do that on purpose he asked Susan an angry look coming over his face Do what on purpose What do you mean Did you upset my ladder Upset your ladder Well I guess not But I d like to know why you tried to throw that pail of water over me If it was meant for a joke I think it was a pretty poor one The woman started to arise but found herself somewhat tangled up in the cord and ladder Throw water on you repeated Dent with a puzzled look I didn t throw any water It got on me as much as it did on you This was as near to a quarrel as these two had ever approached Bob listening around the corner of the house was holding his sides to keep from bursting into laughter though my own opinion is that he should have felt sorry for his joke It might have resulted disastrously for either Susan or the hired man might have broken a leg or an arm But Bob never thought of that His sole idea was to create a laugh for himself Dent and Susan dripping wet looked at each other Then the cook wiping some of the water from her face got up As she did so the cord tied to her apron strings became tightened and as Dent was partly standing on the step ladder Susan s progress was suddenly stopped There she exclaimed That s what did it My apron string got tangled in the ladder Dent examined the cord No it didn t get tangled he announced It was tied there by some one and I know who did it Who Bob Henderson Wait till I catch him He did this for a joke The young rascal pretending he wanted some rheumatism medicine for his father I ll fix him Bob thought it was time to be moving on He did not like the tone of Dent s voice But if the boy hoped to get off unseen he was disappointed As he started to run he slipped and fell Dent heard the noise the lad made and while Susan was loosening the cord from her apron the man ran forward Bob however was up like a flash and ran off but not before Dent had nearly caught him Then the hired man knew it would be of no use to chase the mischievous lad as Bob was very fleet of foot You wait cried Dent shaking his fist at Bob I ll fix you You can t was the answer I m going on a voyage I hope you never come back here said Dent angrily I hope you get lost on a desert island where there s nothing to eat but seaweed That would serve him right added the cook The idea of hinting for some of my doughnuts I ll tell his mother on him And I ll tell his father added Dent Bob was a little afraid lest missus Dodson might come out and seeing the state her employees were in would know the lad had had a hand in it The effects might be more unpleasant than they now promised to be So Bob hastened his pace and was soon out of sight of the big house on the hill He left behind him two very angry persons yet when they glanced at each other neither Susan nor Dent could help laughing They looked as if they had been through a cyclone and cloud burst both at the same time as the hired man expressed it Bob s father did hear of the trick but not in the way the lad expected he would On cooling down neither the hired man nor the cook felt like going and making a complaint about what Bob had done The trick however had been witnessed by the coachman and he told some friends in the village In this way it became known to several persons and mister Henderson heard of it Bob he said to his son very sternly that night I thought you had given up such foolishness as playing those tricks I thought I had too dad but I couldn t help doing this Her apron strings came just in the right place Do you think it was a nice thing to do No sir I s pose not mister Henderson sighed Bob was so frank to acknowledge a fault that it was hard to punish him I don t know what s going to become of you he said Well that was my last land joke dad Your last land joke What do you mean I m going to sail with Captain Spark soon and I ll not have time for any more That s so and I m glad of it If you try any jokes on the sailors you may find they know a trick or two themselves Oh I m going to turn over a new leaf It s about time Bob really intended to mend his ways This perhaps was due as much to a fear of what the sailors on the ship might do to him if he played any pranks on them as it was to a desire to reform That same night Captain Spark arrived at the Henderson home a little ahead of time He announced that his ship was ready to sail and that he and Bob would depart the next morning for the seaport town All ready Bob he asked Aye aye sir That s the way to talk We may have to lay at the dock for a couple of days longer than I calculated on but that will give you a chance to get acquainted with the ship before we strike blue water That will be good With the return of the captain Bob s visions of a life on the ocean wave were redoubled missus Henderson cried a little when it came time to part the next morning and there was a suspicious dampness in the eyes of mister Henderson Bob also in spite of the happy life he thought lay before him was not altogether devoid of emotion He felt the separation more than he thought he would Now be a good boy Bob counseled his mother I will It s your first long trip and it certainly is a big one spoke his father Prove yourself a man Bob I ll try sir Bob felt new responsibilities now and made any number of good resolutions Ahoy my hearties called the bluff cheerful voice of Captain Spark Heave up the anchor brace around the yards for we ve got a good wind a free course and a fair sky And with a chorus of good bys the two started off toward the depot The trip was begun CHAPTER XI 
6459-70120-0000	train-other-500	THE EAGLE SAILS Bob had often been on railroad journeys so there was nothing especially interesting about the first part of his trip
none	none	 But his mind was so taken up with what was to follow that even the familiar scenes 
6459-70120-0001	train-other-500	as the train sped on out of the village seemed full of delight to him Well I s pose you ve been pretty steady since I ve been gone haven t you Bob asked the captain following a rather long pause
6459-70120-0002	train-other-500	Well pretty good I guess I only played one joke What was It Bob related the circumstances of the step ladder the cook and the hired man Hum
none	none	 remarked the commander of the Eagle reflectively So they came down in a heap eh and the water splashed all over em 
6459-70120-0003	train-other-500	Yes replied Bob trying not to chuckle at the recollection Hum remarked the captain again and he seemed to be having some difficulty with his breathing Bob wondered if his friend was choking he was so very red in the face
6459-70120-0004	train-other-500	but he did not know that the mariner was trying hard not to laugh The thought of the sight of the pair tangled up in the step ladder was too much for him
none	none	 though he did not want to encourage Bob 
6459-70120-0005	train-other-500	in his reckless ways by showing enough interest to laugh By the way went on the captain suddenly becoming rather solemn I s pose you ve learned the principal parts of the ship by now By names yes sir But I m afraid I ve got lots yet to learn
none	none	 I should say you had 
6459-70120-0006	train-other-500	You know about as much how to sail a ship
none	none	 as I would how to run a steam engine from seeing a tea kettle boil 
6459-70120-0007	train-other-500	Captain Spark believed in making boys know their place
none	none	 and he made up his mind he had a hard subject in Bob 
6459-70120-0008	train-other-500	Still he was determined to reform him if it was possible
none	none	 When do you expect to get into the Southern Pacific 
6459-70120-0009	train-other-500	asked Bob as he thought of the secret map Captain Obed had given him It all depends on what weather we have Why Here s something a friend of mine gave me said Bob pulling out the wrinkled piece of parchment
6459-70120-0010	train-other-500	He says there is treasure buried on an island in the Southern Pacific Treasure
none	none	 Let me see Captain Spark looked critically at the rather faint tracing of lines on the yellow sheet I m afraid somebody has been playing a joke on you or on Captain Obed 
6459-70120-0011	train-other-500	he remarked handing the parchment back
none	none	 after Bob had told him how he became possessed of it 
6459-70120-0012	train-other-500	A joke Yes That s a map sure enough but no sailor could ever find the island by those directions Why not I said he never could
none	none	 Perhaps I should have said he might by accident 
6459-70120-0013	train-other-500	Why look Bob Whoever made this map only marked the location of the Island by degrees
none	none	 that is the degree of longitude and that of latitude 
6459-70120-0014	train-other-500	Every circle is divided into three hundred and sixty degrees and as the earth is round It follows that a circle drawn around it would be the same Each degree therefore means a distance at the equator of about seventy miles
6459-70120-0015	train-other-500	So unless whoever drew this map is positive that the island is exactly at the intersection of the degrees of latitude and longitude which you have given me it might be seventy miles one way or the other off from the location given here
none	none	 And seventy miles is a good distance on the water 
6459-70120-0016	train-other-500	Besides the map only states that the location is about right I guess we ll never find that treasure Bob I don t believe it s there Would you think it worth trying for
none	none	 I don t believe I would 
6459-70120-0017	train-other-500	I might have to sail around for a week merely to locate the island and the chances would be I d miss it Then if I did find it
none	none	 it would be very unlikely that anything would be buried there 
6459-70120-0018	train-other-500	I don t take any stock in those Captain Kidd yarns There s too many of em being spun by retired sailors If Captain Kidd had any money he took good care of it you can wager Besides I haven t any time to fool around looking for an island
6459-70120-0019	train-other-500	I have to get my cargo to port on time Bob was a little disappointed that he could not take part in a search for Captain Obed s treasure but he reflected that what Captain Spark said was probably right resides
none	none	 no one ever believed the stories Captain Obed told 
6459-70120-0020	train-other-500	The aged man s mind was not to be depended on During the remainder of the journey by rail Captain Spark gave Bob some good advice as to how to conduct himself while aboard the ship
6459-70120-0021	train-other-500	He imparted some useful information concerning navigation and promised to show Bob more about it after they had sailed I m anxious to get out on deep water said the mariner I don t like this city life
6459-70120-0022	train-other-500	There are too many risks in it In due time they arrived at the seaport town and having seen that Bob s baggage would be transported to the dock Captain Spark led the way to where the Eagle was waiting the hoisting of her white sails
6459-70120-0023	train-other-500	to catch the ocean breezes The ship was a large one square rigged and had three masts it being of good tonnage
none	none	 As the voyage was a long one great care had to be taken in loading the cargo 
6459-70120-0024	train-other-500	and this had caused a little delay Not all the freight was aboard yet Well mister Carr how are things moving asked the captain of a tall thin man who stood near the gangway as he and Bob went up the plank
none	none	 Very well sir I think we shall be loaded by to morrow I hope so This lying at dock doesn t suit me 
6459-70120-0025	train-other-500	By the way let me introduce a friend of mine This is Bob Henderson His mother is a relative of mine and Bob is taking a voyage for his health Bob this is my first mate mister Carr He looks healthy enough
6459-70120-0026	train-other-500	remarked the first mate as he cordially shook hands with Bob Things are not always what they look like replied the captain with a smile Bob found matters rather too lively for him ashore and his folks think it will quiet him down to go with me
6459-70120-0027	train-other-500	I see replied mister Carr in answer to his commander s sly wink He now understood something of the situation I ll leave you here a while went on the commander to the boy
6459-70120-0028	train-other-500	You can look about a bit while I go below and work on my manifest mister Carr will tell you anything you want to know But Bob was so interested in watching the sailors at work stowing away the cargo while others were cleaning various parts of the ship
6459-70120-0029	train-other-500	that he did not ask many questions All the rest of that day the loading went on Bob and the captain went ashore for their meals
none	none	 as the commander had some business to attend to in the port 
6459-70120-0030	train-other-500	but Bob spent that night in his bunk
none	none	 It was the first time he had ever slept in a ship s berth and he rather liked the novelty The next day the loading was rapidly proceeded with 
6459-70120-0031	train-other-500	and by noon all the cargo was stowed away Captain Spark was below in his cabin making out the final papers and waiting for his clearance documents from the harbor master mister Carr and his assistants were busy getting the Eagle ready to sail
6459-70120-0032	train-other-500	while Bob stood near the rail watching with curious eyes everything that was going on While he stood there he saw a short stout pale faced man coming up the gangplank The man carried a valise in each hand
none	none	 while behind him walked a longshoreman with a trunk on his shoulder 
6459-70120-0033	train-other-500	Now my man be very careful of that trunk urged the short stout pale man Don t drop it for the world I m not going to sir
none	none	 and the longshoreman attempted to touch his hat as a mark of respect 
6459-70120-0034	train-other-500	Don t do that exclaimed the nervous man You might drop it and something would break All right sir Very well sir and once more the longshoreman made as if to touch his hat
none	none	 It was a habit of his to do this whenever spoken to by those who employed him 
6459-70120-0035	train-other-500	There you go again cried the man in rather whining tones Don t do it I say There Keep your hands on the trunk Seeing that this last order was obeyed the nervous man advanced up the gangplank He came on deck
6459-70120-0036	train-other-500	set his two valises very carefully down
none	none	 watched the longshoreman place the trunk on end as if it contained eggs and then he asked of Bob Is this ship the Eagle Yes sir Are you sure now 
6459-70120-0037	train-other-500	I don t want any mistake made I don t see the name on it anywhere It is on the bows and under the stern Bob rather prided himself on this nautical knowledge Hum
none	none	 Well perhaps it may be You are positive it is the Eagle 
6459-70120-0038	train-other-500	Yes sir Positive A distant relative of my mother is the captain Is it Captain Spark Yes sir Are you sure I don t want to be on the wrong ship
none	none	 Yes sir I am very sure 
6459-70120-0039	train-other-500	I came on board with him Are you going to sail on the ship asked Bob politely I expect to if this is the right vessel I wish I was sure Perhaps you might be mistaken and he glanced nervously around No I am positive
6459-70120-0040	train-other-500	There is Captain Spark now he added as the commander came up a companionway Oh yes I shall speak to him The nervous man started off Just then Captain Spark having received his clearance papers by messenger
6459-70120-0041	train-other-500	gave orders to cast off The Eagle was about to sail
none	none	 All ashore that s going ashore 
6459-70120-0042	train-other-500	called the first mate The longshoreman started down the gangplank which was about to be hauled in Wait I must pay you called the nervous passenger turning back toward the man who had brought his trunk aboard The longshoreman waited
6459-70120-0043	train-other-500	Cast off that stern line shouted the captain Oh dear I wish I was sure this was the Eagle spoke the nervous passenger It is Bob assured him smiling at the man s manner
6459-70120-0044	train-other-500	First he would advance a little way toward the captain intending to ask him the momentous question then he would turn toward the longshoreman who was waiting for his money Lively with that gangplank now ordered the commander
6459-70120-0045	train-other-500	Oh if I have made a mistake and gotten on the wrong ship it will be terrible murmured the man Why don t you throw off that stern line again shouted the captain What shall I do exclaimed the nervous man
none	none	 If you re goin t pay me your honor you ll have t hustle advised the longshoreman I will my man Never mind touching your hat Oh you are not carrying my trunk now I forgot 
6459-70120-0046	train-other-500	Here s a dollar Never mind the change All ashore that s going ashore yelled mister Carr again Up came the gangplank The longshoreman leaped over the side of the ship and landed on the dock
6459-70120-0047	train-other-500	There was a puffing from the tug that had been engaged to pull the Eagle out into the channel Are you sure this is the right ship appealed the man to Bob once more
none	none	 Positively yes sir Anyhow it s too late now 
6459-70120-0048	train-other-500	Too late How What do you mean
none	none	 I mean that we re under way now The nervous passenger ran to the side and looked over True enough the Eagle was some distance from the wharf The tug was straining on the big hawser The ship had begun her long voyage around Cape Horn CHAPTER XII SOME JOKES ON BOB Seeing that he was now indeed afloat and that the ship was some distance from land the man became more nervous than ever He paced up and down the deck looking anxiously at the fast receding shore Suddenly he ran toward the bow of the ship and leaned far over the rail Hey there yelled Bob thinking the man was going to Jump overboard and swim ashore What are you doing I was trying to see the name of the vessel answered the man whose face was now red instead of pale caused by his exertion in bending over the rail You can t see it by leaning over replied Bob It s painted away up by the figurehead I know I can t see it answered the nervous passenger Oh I wish I was sure I tell you you re on the Eagle declared Bob Can t you take my word When you get as old as I am and have been through as much trouble you ll never take anybody s word for anything was the answer I must be sure I m off for a long voyage and I don t want to make a mistake You re not making any mistake if you want to be aboard the Eagle Here comes Captain Spark now You can ask him At that moment the commander having seen his vessel well under way came to where Bob and the nervous passenger were standing Is this mister Hiram Tarbill asked the mariner holding out his hand Yes sir Are you Captain Jeremiah Spark That s who I am Is this the schooner Eagle bound around Cape Horn Yes sir with a mixed cargo consigned to various firms in Lima Peru Would you like to look at my papers No I guess it s all right and mister Tarbill seemed much relieved You see my train was late he went on and I came aboard in such a hurry that I was not sure I was on the right ship I dislike to make mistakes especially as my health is not very good Yes you re on the right ship Captain Spark assured mister Tarbill Now if you ll come with me I ll show you to your stateroom But first let me introduce to you a relative of mine and he presented Bob Yes I have been talking with him said mister Tarbill He assured me I was on the right vessel but I did not know whether he knew or not Oh yes Bob knows that much about the ship But he s going to learn more soon The captain conducted the nervous passenger to the stateroom set apart for him and then came back on deck What do you think of him he asked Bob He seems all right but very nervous That s the trouble He s too nervous His doctor recommended him to take a long sea voyage to see if it would cure him I think it will I never knew a sailor who was nervous and it s all because of the salt water Now Bob amuse yourself as best you can until the tug drops us I have several matters to attend to After a bit I ll give you some regular duties to perform every day They will not be hard but I shall expect you to perform them as well as you are able While in the main this is a pleasure trip for you undertaken for a purpose with which you are familiar I want you to derive some benefit from it Don t you think that wise Yes sir answered Bob who had formed several good resolutions regarding his future conduct Very well then You can roam about the ship at your pleasure until I am ready for you Now a ship is one of the best places in the world for the circulation of news It is a little village in itself and what happens in the captain s cabin though there may be a desire to keep it secret is soon known in the forecastle or fo kesel as the sailors pronounce it Consequently it was not long before it was known that Bob was being sent on the voyage to reform him for certain roguish tricks to which he was addicted This was known to the majority of the crew before the ship sailed Consequently they were not only on their guard against any pranks which the boy might try to perpetrate but several of the younger men resolved to give Bob a taste of his own medicine There was some whispering among members of the crew as they observed Bob strolling about the deck and one of the men said something to mister Carr The first mate nodded and smiled A little later as Bob was watching the men coil up the big hawser which the tug had cast off the Eagle now proceeding along under her own sails one of the sailors stepped up to him Would you mind doing us a favor he asked respectfully Of course not I ll do anything I can for you answered Bob glad to make the closer acquaintance of the men Then would you kindly go to Captain Spark and ask him for a left handed marlinspike We need it to splice this hawser with He keeps it in his cabin because there s only one on board and it s quite a valuable instrument The man spoke as gravely as a judge A left handed marlinspike repeated Bob I suppose one of the sailors must be left handed he thought He knew what a marlinspike was from having seen the men use the sharp pointed irons to pick apart the strands of rope preparatory to splicing so anxious to be of service he hurried to Captain Spark s cabin The men sent me for a left handed marlinspike he said interrupting the commander who was busy over his accounts A left handed marlinspike repeated the commander at once understanding the joke Yes sir I m sorry was the answer gravely given but I lost it overboard a while ago You d better go to mister Carr and ask him for the scuttle butt That will do as well Yes sir replied Bob who not suspecting anything hunted up the first mate and made his request You ll find it right over there said mister Carr pointing to a big water barrel on deck It was one from which the sailors drank If it s too heavy for you you d better get help said mister Carr trying not to smile But Bob was aware now that he had been made the butt of a joke and though he felt a little embarrassed he had to laugh in spite of himself That s pretty good he said A left handed marlinspike turns into a scuttle butt and that turns into a water barrel I ve got lots to learn yet He could hear the sailors laughing at the trick they had played with the consent of the first mate and with a grim smile Bob resolved to get even CHAPTER XIII BOB TRIES A PRANK The Eagle was sailing along under a spanking breeze and already the motion of Old Briny was beginning to make itself felt The vessel rolled to a considerable degree and as she passed farther and farther out to sea this became more pronounced Bob who had been active in visiting different parts of the ship watching the sailors at their duties and picking up bits of information here and there soon got over his little indignation against those who had played the joke on him But he soon became conscious of another feeling This was a decidedly uneasy one and for the first time since he had begun to think of the voyage Bob began to fear he was going to be seasick I certainly do feel queer said our hero to himself as he leaned against the railing amidships I wonder what I d better do Perhaps I m moving around too much I ll keep quiet He sat down on a hatch cover and tried to think of other things The sea was beginning to turn blue the blue of deep water and the sun was shining brightly There was a strong wind and a healthful smell of salt in the air Still Bob did not appear to care for any of those things His own feelings seemed to increase Sitting still is worse than moving around he began to think Just then mister Carr passed the boy What s the matter he asked You look rather white about the gills messmate I I don t feel very well replied Bob Better go and lie down then I guess you re in for a spell of seasickness mister Tarbill has already got his Bob thought it would be best to follow the advice He went to his berth and soon he was a very sick boy He would have given up all his chances of rounding the Horn yes he would even have sacrificed his share in the rather mythical treasure of Captain Obed if he could only have found some place that was not heaving pitching and tossing But the ship rolled on and the motion seemed to increase rather than diminish It was a week before Bob was entirely well During that time he stayed in his bunk but Captain Spark saw to it that the boy was well looked after and doctored with such simple remedies as are used in that common form of illness which attacks nearly all who first venture upon the sea At the end of the week Bob found that he could stand up without feeling his head go buzzing around He ventured out on deck and the salt breeze brought some color into his pale cheeks You sort of look as if you had been drawn through a knothole remarked Tom Manton one of the sailors Yes old Father Neptune has been playing tricks on him I reckon added Sam Bender the second mate I feel as if I had been drawn through two knot holes one right after the other spoke Bob with an attempt at a smile You ll soon be all right again now comforted Tom Get a little salt horse and sea biscuit down for a foundation and you can build up on that the finest thing in the way of a meal you ever saw For the first time since his illness Bob could think of food without a shudder He really began to feel hungry The old sailor proved a good prophet Bob began to mend steadily and in a few days he was as active as ever more so in fact Now s the time to look for trouble remarked Captain Spark to his mate one day Trouble How Bob is himself again He ll be up to some tricks or I m a Dutchman But we must meet him half way Give him back some of his own coin He s on this voyage to be cured and I m going to do it If I have to keelhaul him I guess the men will be only too anxious to do their share They like Bob but he mustn t play too many pranks on them No Well I guess they can look out for themselves I guess so answered the mate with a smile Later that day Captain Spark instructed Bob in some simple duties which would be his to perform during the voyage He was to act in the capacity of cabin boy Now that Bob was in his usual spirits he began to feel an inclination to be at some of his pranks He thought with a sigh that he had not played a good joke since the affair of the step ladder the cook and the hired man So he began to look about and consider the possibilities of indulging in some pranks But Bob had about made up his mind not to bother the sailors He was a little afraid of them as they were big strong men and he had a suspicion that they were only waiting for him to begin operations before they would do something on their own account Bob had an idea they might tie him to a rope throw him overboard and duck him That he thought would be pretty harsh treatment I wish mister Tarbill would come from his stateroom Bob mused I guess it would be safe to play a little joke on him I ve simply got to have some fun mister Tarbill had suffered very much from seasickness though he was now recovered He came on deck the next day but he was more nervous than ever Oh my he exclaimed as a big wave struck the Eagle heeling her over considerably Are we going down Oh I guess not replied Bob confidently He and mister Tarbill were together on the quarterdeck The nervous passenger s fears gave Bob an idea I ll give him a real scare thought the boy Maybe it will cure him of being nervous My reader can easily understand that Bob had one thought for mister Tarbill and two for himself The boy considered matters a few minutes during which time the nervous passenger seemed to grow more and more frightened of the big waves which had been piled up by quite a heavy blow the previous night Presently Bob went to the after rail and looked intently into the water Then he uttered an exclamation Oh Oh he cried It s coming right after us Have you a revolver mister Tarbill A revolver What for What is coming after us my dear young friend A big whale He s just under the surface of the water He s trying to break off the rudder Quick give me your revolver I haven t any Oh dear I m so nervous Do you think he will damage the ship my dear young friend I m afraid so Look out Hold on Here he comes Bob pretended to grasp the rail to prevent being tossed overboard by the expected shock mister Tarbill did the same and with anxious fears waited for what would happen next Then the ship seemed to give a great shiver as a big wave struck under the port bow He s hit us cried Bob trying not to laugh Quick Get me a life preserver exclaimed mister Tarbill A life preserver The ship is sinking Illustration A life preserver The ship is sinking What s all the excitement about suddenly asked Captain Spark appearing at the head of the ladder that led to the quarterdeck The ship has been struck by a monster whale exclaimed the nervous passenger He s rammed us captain and I m going to get a life preserver Then I must save my valuables in my cabin He rushed from the deck while the captain with a grim look on his face glanced at Bob who burst into laughter CHAPTER XIV mister TARBILL GETS A SHOCK This is one of your jokes I suppose remarked the captain Yes It was too funny answered Bob He really believed a whale was after us Do you think it was a good thing to do alarm him so I er well I thought it might do his nerves good stammered Bob Hum murmured the captain I must say Bob you have a queer idea of what is good for the nerves Now I can t allow this mister Tarbill is a guest of mine and I will not have his comfort interfered with He is taking a voyage for his health and I don t want him annoyed I m sorry began Bob always ready to repent though usually it did not last long Then don t do it again I ll not sir I didn t think he d believe me He knows very little about the ocean In fact there are some things you don t know and if they wanted to some of the old sailors could spin you yarns that would make your hair stand up I wish they would then said Bob I like sea stories captain I guess I ll have to take stronger measures with him thought the commander as he walked forward A few minutes later mister Tarbill rushed up on deck He had a life preserver strapped about him and in either hand was a valise while over his shoulder was some spare clothing he had not had time to pack in the satchels Are the lifeboats ready he asked of mister Carr who was the first person he met on deck The lifeboats What for Why the ship has been rammed by a whale and is sinking Who told you so That boy Bob Henderson I thought so exclaimed the mate That s one of his so called jokes There s no danger mister Tarbill That was only a big wave that hit us You are perfectly safe Are you sure Quite sure Don t you think I had better see the captain and ask him about it before I take off my life preserver Oh no there is no need of that The ship is in no danger and the mate tried not to smile at the nervous passenger s fears Then if you say so I ll go and take this life preserver off It is quite heavy Do so by all means The young rascal added the mate under his breath as he thought of Bob I ll have to teach him a lesson Bob was not a little alarmed at the result of his thoughtless prank He did not know what the captain might do to punish him and in the future he resolved to restrain his impulses Maybe he ll send me home by some passing ship the boy thought and I wouldn t like that a bit The weather was fine for the next few days The Eagle continued on her way south the climate getting warmer and warmer as they approached the equator Bob meanwhile had learned much about the ship and the manner of sailing it He got the names of the various ropes and sails by heart and it would have taken a pretty ingenious sailor to have sent him on a foolish errand now after some part of the ship s gear Captain Spark was encouraged by Bob s behavior and began to think the voyage was doing the lad good So it was but the cure was not complete as you shall see mister Tarbill resented Bob s joke and had not spoken to the boy since the whale incident But Bob did not mind this There was plenty to keep him occupied with his duties to perform and sailors stories to listen to When they were out about two weeks there came a day when there was only the lightest breeze The Eagle barely had steerageway over the sea which was as quiet and still as a small lake The blue waters sparkled in the bright sun and as Bob lounged about on deck he felt a lazy contentment which was probably caused by the near approach to the tropical zone He looked up at the towering masts and an idea came to him If I could climb up there he said I could have a fine view I ought to be able to see a vessel from that height Guess I ll do it I never tried it but it looks easy and there s not enough motion to pitch me off With Bob usually to think was to act Looking around to see that neither the captain nor the mates were in sight to forbid him he stepped to the rail mounted Into the shrouds or ladders that are formed by the wire ropes supporting the mast and was soon ascending toward the maintop the highest point of the largest mast It was rather difficult work but Bob kept on and soon was a great distance above the deck He looked around him noted several ships which were not visible from below and then glanced down He saw mister Tarbill come out on deck and then more in good spirits than because he wanted to cause the nervous passenger a scare Bob gave a great shout mister Tarbill looked up saw the boy far in the air clinging to what at that distance Seemed but a slender stick and then he cried Quick Somebody come quick What is it shouted mister Carr thinking from the tones of mister Tarbill s voice some one had fallen overboard That boy That awful boy replied the nervous man What about him Is he overboard Which side I ll throw him a life preserver No he isn t overboard He s up there On the mast Oh Suppose he falls My nerves are in such a state This is an awful shock What a dreadful boy I wish he had never come aboard this ship or else that I hadn t Come on up cried Bob all unconscious of the excitement he had created It s fine up here Oh I feel as if I was going to faint exclaimed mister Tarbill growing paler than usual Come down Bob ordered mister Carr making a trumpet of his hands If it isn t one thing it s another thought the mate I ll be glad when this voyage is over CHAPTER XV THE STORM Bob came down wondering why he was not allowed to stay at the maintop for a while longer Oh Oh exclaimed mister Tarbill when the boy reached the deck You ve given me such a fright I didn t mean to replied Bob honestly enough Oh but you did I think I ll have to go to my cabin and take some nerve medicine The passenger left the deck and mister Carr said Don t do that again Bob No sir not if you don t want me to It s too dangerous added the first mate Bob was not very sharply reprimanded by Captain Spark for this escapade as the commander realized that the boy meant no harm But it was several days before mister Tarbill got over the shock Urged on by brisk winds the Eagle made excellent speed and several days before he calculated he would reach it Captain Spark found his vessel crossing the line that is passing over the imaginary circle which marks the equator Bob enjoyed his life on board the ship more than ever now that the tropics were reached The usual pranks were indulged in by the sailors when Father Neptune came aboard the day the line was crossed and Bob came in for not a little horse play But he did not mind it and in turn he played several jokes on the sailors and was not rebuked It was a time of freedom from restraint Continuing on south the Eagle passed from the hot region and once more was in the temperate zone But now the weather which had been fine for several weeks began to show signs of a change We ll soon be in for a troublesome time said the captain as he sat in the main cabin one night looking over some charts How asked Bob We re approaching the Horn To navigate the Straits of Magellan is no small matter There are always more or less storms in that region and I wish I was well through it Then we re liable to have a hard passage More than likely The captain s fears were verified A few days later when they were within a hundred miles of the dreaded Straits it began to blow There was a steady increase to the wind and Captain Spark wore an anxious look as he paced the quarterdeck Still there seemed to be nothing more than a heavy blow and Bob was beginning to hope they might get through with less trouble than the commander anticipated The captain had decided to try the passage of the Straits rather than to actually go around Cape Horn But it was not to be The next day toward evening when they were preparing to navigate the difficult passage there came a veritable hurricane Fortunately Captain Spark had in a measure anticipated it and had taken in sail bending on some heavy storm canvas which small as it was sent the ship ahead at a terrific pace As night came on the Eagle was seen to be in a mass of swirling tumbling waves which seemed anxious to overpower the stanch craft mister Tarbill was in a great fright He tried to stay in his cabin but when the ship began to pitch and toss he could not stand it So donning a life preserver he came on deck Here he was much in the way for the sailors had to be constantly rushing here and there making ropes fast and attending to their duties To add to the discomforts of the situation it began to rain in torrents Oh I know we re going to sink cried the nervous passenger Do you think it will be soon captain What soon asked the commander who was too busy to pay much attention to mister Tarbill Will we sink soon Sink We re not going to sink at all if I can help it This is no worse than lots of storms You had better go to your cabin and lie down Oh I wouldn t dare to The ship might sink while I was there I know we ll get caught in a whirlpool or in a waterspout or some other dreadful thing This is terrible Awful Fearful The wind was increasing and great waves dashed over the Eagle s bow It s bad luck to have such a storm croaker as that aboard murmured one of the sailors He s a regular Jonah I wish he d go below muttered the captain and Bob overheard him He s frightening every one up here and we re going to have a hard enough time as it is without a nervous man on deck Bob though he was frightened at the storm which was constantly growing worse determined to stick it out He wanted to see what would happen But he saw a chance to do a service to the captain though it would involve playing an innocent trick on mister Tarbill Accordingly when there came a little lull in the wind Bob made his way to where the nervous passenger stood with his back braced against a deckhouse It ll be here pretty soon now said Bob shouting to make himself heard above the noise of the storm What will my dear young friend asked mister Tarbill forgetting his former anger at Bob under the stress of the circumstances Do you mean to tell us anything else is going to happen Something surely is mister Tarbill said Bob with an air of great earnestness moving closer to the man so as to get away from the driving rain as mister Tarbill stood under shelter What is coming Do tell me I am so very nervous The Jilla Jilly wind We ll be in the midst of it soon You d better look out The Jilla Jilly wind For mercy sakes what s that It s a kind of a hurricane said Bob inventing something on the spur of the moment Only instead of blowing straight ahead or around in a circle it blows up and down It s liable to snatch you right up to the clouds or suck you down into the ocean That is terrible my dear young friend Terrible I should say it was What had I better do You ll surely be blown overboard if you stay on deck That Jilla Jilly wind is the most terrible wind you ever heard of We ll soon strike it There that sounds like it now Don t you feel as if you were being lifted up The nervous fears of mister Tarbill made him anticipate almost any sensation that was vividly described to him He was in such a state of mind that he would have believed almost anything he heard Yes Yes he exclaimed I feel it coming Oh dear What shall I do Go below quickly yelled Bob for that was the object he had in mind in inventing the Jilla Jilly wind for the occasion I will I ll go at once And holding on to hand lines which had been stretched about the deck for safety the nervous passenger made his way to his cabin while the ship tossed more than ever CHAPTER XVI WRECK OF THE SHIP Though the vessel was in great danger Bob could not help smiling at the success of his prank When mister Tar bill with every evidence of terror had left the deck Bob crept cautiously forward to peer ahead into the wild waste of waves that threatened to overwhelm the Eagle If it isn t a Jilla Jilly wind it s almost as bad thought our hero If he had known more about the ocean and its terrors he would have been more frightened than he was If it was not exactly an instance of where ignorance is bliss tis folly to be wise it was in Bob s case the next thing to it Wow That was a bad one exclaimed the boy as an extraordinarily large wave made the ship tremble At the same instant a frightened shriek rang out through the darkness It was one full of terror It s got me It s got me yelled the voice What in the world is that shouted Captain Spark above the din of the storm Is some one overboard Sounds like mister Tarbill replied the mate putting his lips close to the captain s ear so as to be heard Maybe something has happened to him suggested the commander Better look after him mister Carr We shall do very well for the time being We ve got her before the gale now and she s scudding along very nicely Once the first fury of the storm was past and it settled down to a steady blow Captain Spark knew how to handle his vessel mister Carr went below He found mister Tarbill in the main cabin pacing to and fro and starting nervously at every unexpected lurch of the ship Is it blowing Is the ship going up or down asked the nervous passenger Is what blowing The Jilla Jilly wind The Jilla Jilly wind repeated the mate in wonder thinking mister Tarbill might be out of his head Yes Bob told me about it It blows up and down and is liable to take one up Into the clouds or down into the ocean What nonsense Look here mister Tarbill that was one of Bob s jokes I ll scold him for this Yet secretly the mate was not sorry that Bob s trick had been effective in getting the frightened man off the deck Then there isn t any such wind Of course not Don t be frightened Is the ship in any danger Well to be honest I can t say that she is not There is always danger in a storm such as this is particularly near Cape Horn But we re doing our best Oh I knew something was going to happen What s going to happen asked the mate You must not be so nervous Oh I wish I had never come on this dreadful voyage mister Carr wished the same on behalf of the nervous man but he said nothing The mate soon went back on deck where he found plenty to do as one of the storm sails had blown off the bolt ropes and another canvas had to be bent on Captain Spark had sent Bob below as it was risky for any one but an experienced sailor to move about the constantly sloping deck That night was one of terror First the storm seemed to abate and then it began again with redoubled violence Once the Eagle was almost on her beam ends but skilful handling brought her once more up into the teeth of the wind and she rode the waves lightly like the gallant craft she was The nervousness of mister Tarbill increased He would not stay alone in his cabin and finally begged for Bob to keep him company Bob was a little diffident about going in after the trick he had played but the nervous passenger seemed to forget all about that The two sat up and talked instead of going to their berths for sleep was out of the question amid the howling of the gale It was nearly morning when Captain Spark wearing an anxious look came into the cabin Has the ship foundered Has it sprung a leak asked mister Tarbill for he saw that something was troubling the commander No we are safe yet replied mister Spark gravely But I think you had better put on life preservers Why asked Bob beginning to feel a nameless fear We are approaching a dangerous reef If this wind holds we can barely wear off enough to pass it If we strike it that will be the last of the Eagle We are going to do our best to wear the ship off but we may not succeed It is best to be prepared At this ominous warning mister Tarbill seemed to collapse However with Bob s help he donned one of the cork jackets and the boy did likewise Captain Spark would not allow them on deck but promised to give them timely warning if the ship struck Then came an hour of anxious waiting Outside there sounded the dash of rain the screaming of the wind and the rush of sailors about the deck as they hastened to obey the captain s commands Then very gradually there seemed to come a slack in the storm The ship rode more easily and Bob began to take heart A little later mister Carr came down into the cabin He breathed a sigh of relief as he said We re all right We ve passed the reef and we have nothing more to fear for the present The gale is going down That s the best news I ve heard in a year exclaimed mister Tarbill Never again will I take a sea voyage for my health I ve lost seven pounds to night I know I have mister Carr s words were soon verified When morning broke the wind and rain had ceased though there was still a heavy sea on which made the Eagle toss and pitch in a dangerous way Bob managed to get out on deck however and through the clear atmosphere that followed the storm he saw the dim outlines of Terra del Fuego The Land of Fire as part of the end of the South American continent is called They finished the passage of the Straits of Magellan without further incident After that it seemed as if their troubles would be at an end The sea went down and as they made the turn around the South American coast and once more began to approach the equator the Eagle skimmed along like the bird whose name it bore If this weather and the fair breezes keep up said Captain Spark one day we ll arrive ahead of time I guess you didn t think so during the storm did you inquired Bob No indeed It seemed as if it was going to be touch and go with us one spell But how do you like your trip so far Very much I m glad of it I promised your mother it would do you good and I think it will Captain Spark was secretly delighted with the success of his experiment He thought Bob had given up all his tricks but that same day showed how much mistaken he was The boy seeing a chance to have some sport with one of the sailors a German sewed up the sleeves of the man s Jersey When the man tumbled out of his bunk in a hurry to take his watch on deck he could not understand the reason why he could not put on his garment Vot s der madder he exclaimed struggling with the sleeves Der vitches haf been at vork I am bevitched More like that onery critter of a boy done it suggested his messmate a practical Yankee So I plays a joke on him alretty yet Vatch And the German was as good as his word The next afternoon Bob suddenly felt himself being pitched over the rail toward the sea He yelled and made a grab for the mizzen shroud near which he was standing but he suddenly found himself brought up with a round turn for the German had caught the boy s feet in a bight of cable so that he would not go overboard So he exclaimed You sews up my sleeves eh I t inks you don t do so no more Eh More tricks exclaimed the captain when matters had been explained to him I wonder if he ll ever be cured But Bob s cure was nearer at hand than either he or the captain expected The fine weather continued for a week during which time the Eagle made good progress Then came several days of dead calm when they were near the Tropic of Capricorn and they suffered much from the heat of the sun I don t like this remarked Captain Spark one day as he looked up at the brassy sky Why not asked Bob with the familiarity of a relative I think this means a storm and we re in a poor location for a bad blow I don t like it As the day wore on it became evident that the captain s prophecy was about to be verified The wind sprang up suddenly almost before sail could be shortened and the Eagle heeled over until if seemed as if she would not right That was the beginning of a storm that was worse than the other Scudding along under mere rags of canvas the ship headed right into the swirl of waters agitated by the wind As night settled down the captain prepared for the worst It was evident that he feared something and every man was on the alert The wind increased but there was no rain On and on rushed the ship all through the night The captain seemed to grow more anxious and would not leave his place at the wheel Suddenly just as the darkness was giving place to the gray light of morning the Eagle hit something A shiver seemed to run through the whole length of the ship Breakers ahead yelled the lookout Breakers all around us I feared as much cried the captain We ve struck on a reef The Eagle seemed to back off probably the recoil from the blow The wind swirled around and then once more the good ship was driven on the rocks Once more she crashed upon the low lying barrier and this time an ominous splintering sound followed There was a terrific crash and the foremast went by the board At the same time there was a pounding beneath the bows of the vessel There s a big hole stove in the bows sir cried a sailor running to Captain Spark The water s coming in fast I m afraid we re foundering added mister Carr Stand by to lower the lifeboats yelled the captain Every man to his place With a great crash the mizzen mast went over the side crushing one of the lifeboats that hung on davits there What has happened yelled mister Tarbill rushing up on deck The Eagle is wrecked replied the captain speaking calmly though only a sailor could know what anguish the words cost him CHAPTER XVII ADRIFT IN SMALL BOATS The scene was now one of wild excitement The sailors were working like Trojans to launch the boats as it could not be told when the Eagle would founder Already she was settling in the water For once mister Tarbill seemed too stunned to know what to do Bob made up his mind to save a few of his own possessions if he could and he hurried to his berth Put on a life preserver Bob called the captain to him The boy thought of the time when this order had been given before but not needed Now there was real cause for it Oh Bob Help me pleaded mister Tarbill who was trembling with terror I will If there s anything valuable in your cabin you d better get it out Everything I have is valuable Well you can t take it all The boat won t hold it Have we got to go in small boats out on this dreadful ocean It s the only way to save our lives mister Tarbill selected some of his possessions as did Bob and then the only two passengers on the ship having donned the cork jackets went on deck again The sailors were busy putting provisions and water into the small boats of which fortunately there were enough to hold all even with the loss of the one the mast had smashed Is there no way of saving the ship asked Bob of the captain as he stood calm yet stern on the quarter deck No Her bows are stove in and the foremast has pounded a big hole in her quarter The Eagle is doomed There must be an uncharted reef about here or else we were blown off our course Boats are all ready sir reported a sailor running up Very well tell the men to get in mister Carr will be in command of one boat mister Bender the other and I will go in my gig Bob you and mister Tarbill will go with me Pull well away from the wreck men and lay to until we are all together Then we ll try to get our bearings It was getting lighter now but the storm showed no signs of abating The Eagle was fairly impaled on a sharp point of the sunken reef and was immovable but the waves were dashing high over the bows Suddenly the ship gave a shudder and seemed as if about to tear herself loose ready to sink beneath the billows Lively men exclaimed the captain She ll not last much longer The orders were given to lower the boats Bob went forward to watch the work holding on by stray cables that dangled from the wrecked masts As the boat of which mister Bender was to take charge was being lowered one of the ropes in the davit pulley that at the bow fouled and as the sailors at the other davit were letting their line run free the boat tilted There was imminent risk of the oars sail and mast besides the supplies being spilled out Bob saw the danger and sprang forward with a shout intending to lend a hand As he did so a big piece of one of the yards of the broken mizzen mast which had been hanging by splinters was whipped loose by a gust of wind and fell almost at his feet missing him by a small margin Had it struck him squarely it would have killed him Bob only hesitated an instant though the narrow escape gave him a faint feeling in his stomach Then before he could make the sailors understand what the trouble was he grabbed the rope that was running free and taking a turn about a cleat prevented the further lowering of the boat Good shouted Second Mate Bender who had seen what had taken place You saved the boat Bob In another second all the stuff would have been afloat Lively now men Straighten out that line and lower away She s settling fast In the meanwhile mister Carr had succeeded in lowering his boat and he and his men were in it The crew of the captain s gig were busy with that craft and it was all ready to lower Get in Bob said the commander of the Eagle And you too mister Tarbill Aren t you coming asked Bob I m the last one in was the sad answer and then the boy understood that the captain is always the last to leave a sinking ship Shall we get in before you lower it asked Bob of the sailors who stood at the davit ropes Yes We can lower it with you two in The captain and we can slide down the ropes We re used to it but it s ticklish business for land lubbers And the man grinned even in that time of terror Captain Spark had gone to his cabin for his log book the ship s papers and his nautical instruments As he came out the red sun showed for an instant above the horizon If we had seen that a few hours sooner we wouldn t be here now remarked the commander sadly But it s too late now The other boats had pulled away from the wreck Bob and mister Tarbill got into the gig and were lowered to the surface of the heaving ocean Take an oar and fend her away from the ship s side a bit the captain advised Bob Else a wave may smash the gig Bob did so mister Tarbill was shivering too much with fear to be of any help A few seconds later the two sailors who had lowered the boat at the captain s orders leaped into the gig as a wave lifted it close to the Eagle s rail Then the commander carrying a few of his possessions and with a last look around his beloved ship made the same jump and was in his gig Pull away he commanded sorrowfully and the sailors rowed out from the foundered ship When they were a little way off they rested on their oars All around them was a waste of heaving waters The two other boats came up and the occupants looked at the Eagle settling lower and lower as the water filled her The wrecked ship now sunk almost to her deck level seemed save for the three boats to be the only object in sight on the bosom of the tumultuous ocean Well men give way at length called the captain with a sigh We may be sighted by some vessel or we may land on an island There are several islands hereabouts if we are not too far away from them Then bending to the oars the sailors sent the boats away from the wreck Bob and his friends were afloat on the big ocean in small boats that at any moment might be swamped by a mighty wave for the wind was still blowing hard though the sun shone brightly in the eastern sky CHAPTER XVIII BOB ON AN ISLAND Keep together men called the captain as they pulled away We don t want to lose one another Which way shall we pull sir asked the first mate I ll tell you presently I ll look at my charts and see if I can t locate an island somewhere here abouts Keep up your courage Luckily this didn t happen down in the Straits At least we have warm weather here For the first time Bob noticed that it was very warm It had been so of course for several days preceding the wreck but the thought that they were in a tropical climate had been forgotten in the excitement of the foundering of the ship Now it was a thing for which to be thankful Oh Isn t this the most terrible thing that could occur exclaimed mister Tarbill from a seat where he was huddled up It is awful It s not half so awful as if we were drowned and in Davy Jones s locker remarked the captain I ve lost my ship and the cargo but fortunately both were insured We are lucky to have had time to get off in the boats well provisioned as they are As soon as this wind goes down a bit we ll hoist the small sails and head for the nearest land The captain was soon busy over his charts He made some calculations and announced his belief that there was a group of islands about a hundred miles off He could not be sure for while they showed on the chart he could not exactly determine the position of the ship when she struck as no observation had been taken since the previous noon and the rate of sailing under the force of the gale was mere guesswork So the men rowed on The Eagle was now a mere blot on the surface of the ocean a speck of blackness amid a swirl of foam caused by the waves breaking over the ship and the reef The wind continued too high to risk raising the sail with which each boat was provided and it was slow progress with the oars The day was one of terror for many times waves would break over the small craft forcing the men to bail for their lives Only cold provisions could be eaten but in spite of this the little band of shipwrecked men maintained a cheerful demeanor As for Bob he did not deny that he was frightened He thought with sorrow of his father and mother and wondered if he would ever see them again He and the others had removed their life preservers as they did not need them in the gig That was a plucky thing you did saving that boat from going down stern first complimented the captain a little later that day when they were talking over the events of the wreck You showed good judgment Bob Oh I guess anybody would have done the same No they wouldn t You deserve great credit Bravery in the face of danger is bravery indeed Your father and mother can be proud of you There came to Bob s mind a memory of certain times when these words of the captain would not have been true He resolved if his life was spared to be a more manly boy in the future to live up to the captain s new estimate of him Wearily the men labored at the oars It was hard work to keep the boats heads to the waves which to those in the small craft looked like great green mountains of water Now the boats would be down in a vast hollow with towering walls on either side Then the stanch craft would be lifted up and poising on the crests would slide down a watery hill with a sickening feeling present at least in the hearts of Bob and mister Tarbill that they were going straight for the bottom The nervous passenger sat huddled up in a heap scarcely speaking The wind seemed to increase as night drew on The motion of the captain s gig was such that he could not take an observation and when the blackness settled down they had no idea where they were nor in which direction the nearest land lay I m afraid we ll be separated in the darkness said the captain but there is no help for it The day of terror was succeeded by a night of peril The sea and wind seemed combining to wreck the small boats The one commanded by mister Carr managed to remain within hailing distance of the captain s gig but the other seemed to have disappeared A feeling of gloom settled down over the castaways It must have been about the middle of the night that Bob working his way aft to get a drink of water from one of the casks stumbled over part of the sail that was folded in the bottom of the gig He put out his hands instinctively to save himself but as there was nothing to cling to he only grasped the air Then with a cry of terror which he could not suppress he plunged overboard and was soon struggling in the water He went down but being a good swimmer he at once began to strike out and as he got his head above the surface and shook the water from his ears he heard one of the sailors cry Bob s overboard Bob Bob Where are you shouted the captain Here s a life preserver The boy heard a splash in the water near him and struck out for it Back water he heard the captain cry Aye aye sir replied the sailors heartily At the same time the captain shouted to mister Carr s boat word of what had happened Bob was weighted down by his wet clothes and he felt he could not long keep up but he was swimming strongly hoping every moment one of the boats would pick him up Here I am he shouted but his voice did not carry far above the wind He began to have a hopeless feeling as if he was doomed to drown there all alone on the vast ocean A nameless terror seized him Then to his joy his fingers touched something It was the floating cork life preserver and he knew he could keep himself up with it for a long time Once more he shouted but there came no answering hail Have they rowed away and left me thought the boy He held this idea but for an instant Then he guessed the truth of what had happened The boats had been swept on by wind and wave and in the darkness it was impossible to see so small an object as the boy s head in the water The sailors in the two boats rowed about frantically urged on by Captain Spark His mother will never forgive me he whispered to himself I d rather have lost a dozen ships than have Bob drown But though they rowed about the spot where he had disappeared neither the captain nor mister Carr nor any of the sailors could find a trace of the boy We ll stand by until morning decided the commander and they began their weary vigil Meanwhile Bob was swimming right away from the boats for he could not get the right direction in the darkness He managed to fasten the life preserver to him and with the buoyancy of the cork to aid him he swam easily though he did not make very fast progress After the first shock of terror was over Bob became calm He had a momentary fear of sharks but he resolved not to think about these monsters or the sea as it sent a cold chill over him and he found he could not swim so well I ll just paddle on until morning he decided and by that time maybe the men in the boats will pick me up So through the remainder of the night he swam leisurely In spite of the storm it was very warm and the water felt pleasant If he had only had an idea of where he was Bob would not have minded his position so very much It was just getting light when happening to let his legs down for an instant to rest them he felt his feet touch something At first he had an unreasoning terror that it might be a big fish a whale or a shark that had come up under him Then he felt whatever it was under his feet to be firm and hard A dim shape loomed up before him It s land exclaimed Bob I ve struck land It must be one of those islands the captain told about and that is the sandy beach my feet are touching He swam on a little further and again let down his feet To his delight he could stand upright the water coming to his chest Then as it grew lighter he could make out a low sandy shore lying stretched out before him Land Land exclaimed the boy I m on land But where are the others CHAPTER XIX FINDING mister TARBILL Bob hurried forward as fast as he could through the water no longer swimming but wading Soon he reached the beach and saw beyond it that the land was covered with green grass while trees which he easily recognized as the kind found in warm countries grew to a great height I m on a tropical island thought the castaway Just like Robinson Crusoe only I haven t any of the things he had 
6459-70128-0000	train-other-500	and the wreck of the Eagle isn t near enough for me to get anything from the ship Still I ought to be thankful I m not drowned or eaten by a shark Bob was tired after his long swim
6459-70128-0001	train-other-500	and stretched out under the trees on the grass to rest It was already beginning to get much warmer
none	none	 though the sun was only just peeping up 
6459-70128-0002	train-other-500	seemingly from beneath the ocean Wonder if I m going to find anything to eat here the boy thought Doesn t look as if any one lived here I ll have to take a look around It s going to be very lonesome here
6459-70128-0003	train-other-500	I wonder if any ships ever pass this place There were so many questions that needed answering he did not know where to stop asking them of himself But he decided the first and best thing to do
6459-70128-0004	train-other-500	would be to get off his wet clothes Not that he was afraid of taking cold but he knew he would be more comfortable in dry garments So taking everything out of his pockets which was no small operation by the way
6459-70128-0005	train-other-500	as Bob was a typical boy he stripped himself of his heavier garments and hung them on tree limbs to dry Now if I could find something to eat I d be right in it at least for a while thought the castaway
6459-70128-0006	train-other-500	as he walked around on the warm grass And I need a drink for I swallowed a lot of salt water and I m as dry as a powder horn He looked out on the ocean but not a trace of a boat was visible
6459-70128-0007	train-other-500	Bob walked some distance from where he had landed keeping a sharp lookout for a spring of water
none	none	 All the while he was getting more and more thirsty 
6459-70128-0008	train-other-500	and he began to think he would have to dig a little well near shore with clam shells as he had read of shipwrecked sailors doing But fortunately he was not forced to this As he penetrated a little way into the wood
none	none	 he heard the gurgle of water 
6459-70128-0009	train-other-500	That sounds good he remarked Stepping cautiously because of his bare feet he went on a little farther and presently saw a small waterfall caused by a stream tumbling over a little ledge of rocks
6459-70128-0010	train-other-500	and splashing into a pool below That looks better than it sounds thought Bob And a moment later he was drinking his fill
none	none	 Seems as if there might be fish in there 
6459-70128-0011	train-other-500	he went on glancing at the pool Guess I ll try it Bob was fond of hunting and fishing and knew considerable about wood lore Searching under the stones he soon found some worms
6459-70128-0012	train-other-500	and tossing one into the middle of the pool he saw a hungry fish rise to it Now if I had a pole hook and line
none	none	 I d soon have a breakfast 
6459-70128-0013	train-other-500	he went on to himself I have the line all right and I ought to have a hook in one of my pockets I generally do As for a pole I can easily cut one
none	none	 Bob hurried back to where he had piled the things he took from his pockets 
6459-70128-0014	train-other-500	It did not take him long to discover that he had a stout cord that would answer for a line
none	none	 while he also had several hooks 
6459-70128-0015	train-other-500	With his knife he cut a pole and baiting the hook with a worm he cast in Probably no one unless it might have been some unfortunate castaway in years gone by had ever angled in that pool
6459-70128-0016	train-other-500	The fish at once rose to the bait
none	none	 and soon Bob had several beauties on the grass beside him 
6459-70128-0017	train-other-500	Now to cook them he said to himself Lucky I bought a water proof match box before I started on this voyage I can now make a fire Bob went back to the place he called home
6459-70128-0018	train-other-500	where he had first landed and looked in the water tight match box
none	none	 which he always had carried since he had come aboard the Eagle 
6459-70128-0019	train-other-500	To his delight the little fire sticks were not harmed by his bath He only wished he had more of them Finding his clothes were now nearly dry he put part of them on and proceeded to kindle a fire
6459-70128-0020	train-other-500	Then he cleaned the fish and set them to broil by the simple process of hanging them in front of the fire on a pointed stick one end of which was thrust into the ground That smells good exclaimed Bob
6459-70128-0021	train-other-500	as the fish began to brown But I almost forgot There s plenty of fruit to be had
none	none	 For he had noticed several trees well laden as he passed through the woods 
6459-70128-0022	train-other-500	I ll not starve here as long as I have fruit and fish He gathered some things that looked a cross between an orange and a tangerine and ate several finding them delicious
none	none	 By the time the fish were well done 
6459-70128-0023	train-other-500	Bob preparing to eat his odd breakfast was suddenly startled by a groan It seemed to come from behind a pile of rocks off to the left I wonder what that was thought Bob An animal or a human being
6459-70128-0024	train-other-500	I wonder if there are any South Sea natives on this island He put down his fish on some big green leaves he had plucked for plates and went toward the rocks
none	none	 As he approached the groans became louder Peering cautiously over the stones Bob saw the figure of a man lying on the sand as if he had managed to crawl out of the water Illustration Bob saw the figure of a man lying on the sand For an instant the boy could scarcely believe his eyesight Then with a cry he rushed forward It s mister Tarbill 
6459-70128-0025	train-other-500	he exclaimed He too must have fallen overboard and been washed ashore But he seems to be hurt The man s eyes were closed and he was scarcely breathing He s dying thought Bob his heart beating hard
6459-70128-0026	train-other-500	Then thinking perhaps the man might be partly drowned the young castaway began to put into operation as much of the directions as he remembered for restoring partially drowned persons to life
6459-70128-0027	train-other-500	He had not worked long before he saw mister Tarbill s eyes open Then the nervous passenger began to breathe better Where where am I he asked faintly You re safe replied Bob On an island with me
6459-70128-0028	train-other-500	But where is the captain and the others Boat foundered Wave washed over it soon after you fell overboard No chance to get life preservers It was every one for himself Are they drowned
6459-70128-0029	train-other-500	I don t know Oh it is terrible I swam as long as I could then I seemed to be sinking You re all right now said Bob cheerfully You re just in time to have some breakfast
6459-70128-0030	train-other-500	He helped mister Tarbill to his feet The nervous man seemed to recover rapidly and when at Bob s suggestion he had taken off most of his wet clothes and was drying out near the fire
none	none	 his face took on a more cheerful look 
6459-70128-0031	train-other-500	Those fish smell fine he said
none	none	 I m very fond of fish Are you sure those are not poisonous 
6459-70128-0032	train-other-500	I m not sure replied Bob
none	none	 and I m too hungry to care much They re a sort of big sun fish such as I used to catch at home 
6459-70128-0033	train-other-500	The meat looks nice and white
none	none	 Better have some 
6459-70128-0034	train-other-500	I ll warm them again He put them once more on the pointed sticks near the fire and when they were sizzling he laid them on the green leaves Then with sticks for knives and forks the two castaways made a fairly good meal
none	none	 I thought I never would see land again 
6459-70128-0035	train-other-500	said the nervous man as he began to dress in his dry clothes after the breakfast This has been a terrible experience for me I guess it has admitted Bob And for all of us I wish I knew what has happened to the captain and the others
6459-70128-0036	train-other-500	Our boat was swamped by a big wave said mister Tarbill and suddenly we were all thrown into the water That is the last I remember Perhaps the captain and some of the crew may have swum ashore
none	none	 on another part of this island 
6459-70128-0037	train-other-500	I hope so We ll search for them I guess we re in for a long stay Have we got to remain here demanded mister Tarbill I don t see what else there is to do replied Bob
6459-70128-0038	train-other-500	We haven t any boat we can t walk on the water
none	none	 and we ll have to stay until a ship comes and takes us off 
6459-70128-0039	train-other-500	Oh dear exclaimed the nervous man
none	none	 I wish I had stayed at home 
6459-70128-0040	train-other-500	Bob thought he might at least be thankful that his life was spared and that he was not where he would starve but the lad concluded it would be wise to say nothing
none	none	 If you like we ll take a walk around the island see how large it is and if there s a place where we can make a sort of shelter proposed Bob I guess that will be the best thing to do I leave it all to you My nerves are in such shape that I can do nothing Bob felt not a little proud of the responsibility thus thrust upon him 
6459-70128-0041	train-other-500	He resolved to act wisely and cautiously for there was no telling how long they would have to live on the island With the boy in the lead the two started off The sun was now hot and strong
6459-70128-0042	train-other-500	and they found it advisable to keep in the shade of the woods as much as possible Bob saw a big turtle crawling down the beach toward the water and knowing the flesh was good for food he ran forward to catch it
6459-70128-0043	train-other-500	He was too late however and when he turned with a feeling of disappointment
none	none	 to catch up with mister Tarbill who had continued on 
6459-70128-0044	train-other-500	Bob was surprised to hear the man utter an exclamation He had come to a halt near a pile of rocks and was looking over the tops What s the matter asked the boy
none	none	 There are two men down there on the beach Perhaps they are cannibals We had better go back 
6459-70128-0045	train-other-500	Let me take a look proposed Bob Cautiously he went forward gave one glance at the figures to which mister Tarbill pointed
none	none	 and then he uttered a cry 
6459-70128-0046	train-other-500	Hurrah he shouted
none	none	 They are Captain Spark and Tim Flynn one of the sailors They ve managed to get to shore Ahoy captain Ahoy Here we are and he ran down the beach toward them CHAPTER XX MAKING THE BEST OF IT Captain Spark and the sailor turned at the sound of Bob s voice The captain gave a joyful cry and started forward But Tim Flynn the sailor with a yell of fear ran off down the beach in a different direction Here Come back cried the captain pausing What s the matter with you Tim Sure I don t want to meet no ghost exclaimed the man Ghost What do you mean Him replied Tim pointing a shaking finger at Bob Didn t we see him drown an now ain t he here ahead of us to haunt us Let me go cap n He was about to run off again but Bob who began to understand the superstitious rears of the man called out It s me Tim I m alive all right The sailor paused turned and after a long and rather doubting look at the boy came slowly bade Well maybe it s all right he said but it s mighty queer How d ye git here Swam until I struck land But how did you get here captain and Bob clasped his relative warmly by the hand Our boat must have been close to the island when it capsized replied the former commander of the Eagle A big wave did the business for us and then it was every man for himself Poor Tarbill he s lost and so is Pete Bascom We ll never see either of em again And I m afraid the rest of the crew are gone too No boat could live long in that sea mister Tarbill is alive said Bob How do you know He s right behind those rocks He didn t come on because he feared you were cannibals I ll call him Bob set up a shout and in a few seconds the nervous passenger came cautiously over the top of a pile of stones When he saw Captain Spark he was reassured and advanced boldly There was a general shaking of hands and then the captain remarked Well now we re here we ll have to sec what we can find in the way of food and shelter I don t believe this island is inhabited I didn t know we were so near one It isn t down on the charts There is plenty of fish and fruit said Bob telling how he had used his hook and line to advantage Good exclaimed the captain I could eat a fish raw I believe and my mouth is dry for need of some fresh water Then come on to my camp said Bob proudly leading the way The captain could not but note the change in the boy He had a confident air about him now as if he could take charge of matters The experience of the shipwreck terrible as it had been had taught Bob some needed lessons But he had yet more to learn While Captain Spark and Tim Flynn were wringing the water out of their heavier garments Bob replenished the fire and soon had some fish broiling for he had caught more than he needed It did not take long to finish the simple meal and then the captain spoke We d better take a survey of the island he said to see what sort of a place we ve landed on If there are any natives here we want to know it We also want to know what we can expect in the way of things to eat and if there are animals on it I don t believe there are however as the place is too small Let s start right away proposed Bob Perhaps we can find some driftwood or something to make a hut of though it s warm enough to sleep out of doors without shelter But not exactly safe in tropical countries objected the captain I hope we can construct some kind of a house If we can t we ll have to make the best of it though for we haven t any tools to work with except knives They started to make a circuit of the island It was not very large being about two miles across The center was thickly wooded with tropical growth and the captain was glad to note that there were several varieties of good fruit including a number of cocoanut trees If worst comes to worst we can make a hut of cocoanut leaves he said The natives often do that Oh dear I hope there are no cannibals here said mister Tarbill at the mention of the word natives Suppose they should eat us up They d have to fight first observed the captain grimly I ll not be eaten without a struggle But I never fought a cannibal in my life objected the nervous castaway I shouldn t know how to go about it No more would I but I d soon learn But don t think about such things mister Tarbill I can t help it I wonder how long it will be before we are rescued That is a grave question said the captain slowly I fear this island is too far out of the regular course of ships to hope that we will be picked up soon We must make some kind of a distress signal and hoist it where it will be seen We ll do that as soon as we have completed the circuit of the island It was long past noon to judge by the position of the sun when they had circled the island and again reached the place where Bob had built the fire They had seen no signs of natives nor any of animals though there might be small beasts Well we know what to expect now said the Captain as they sat down under the trees to talk matters over We ll have to depend for a living on fish turtles and fruit We have no natives to fear and our situation is not so bad as it might be Now we had better set about matters in a shipshape and orderly fashion In the first place we will name our island There s nothing like having an address where your friends can write to you he added with grim humor Let s call it Lonely Land suggested Bob I have a better name said the commander It is the custom to call islands and mountains after the person who discovers them I propose that we name this Bob s Island for he discovered it first Aye aye sir cried Tim Flynn heartily Bob blushed and was about to protest but to his surprise mister Tarbill joined in and favored the proposition That s settled then spoke the captain Now you needn t say anything Bob we re three to one and we re going to have our way So far so good The next thing is to rig up our distress signal I ll leave that to Flynn Tim climb the highest tree you can find and run up a signal Aye aye sir replied the sailor saluting and starting off Now then we d better catch some more fish for dinner the captain continued I ll leave that to you Bob and I ll build another fire for this one is out mister Tarbill can go and see if he can t catch a couple of turtles Turtles I never caught a turtle in my life exclaimed the nervous man I d be afraid to Not the least danger the captain assured him All you have to do is to get between them and the water as they re on the beach sunning themselves and turn them on their backs They ll stay there until I can come and get them It s time you learned to catch turtles Oh dear sighed mister Tarbill I wish I was safe home But the captain paid no attention to his protest It ll do him good he murmured as the nervous one walked dejectedly off He ll not have any nerves left when we get through with him Bob had good luck with his hook and line and soon returned with a dozen fine fish In the meanwhile the captain had built a big fire and had a bed of red coals ready to broil the fish over for he knew just how to do it When the dinner was in process of cooking Tim returned Did you hoist the signal asked the captain Aye aye sir What did you use for a flag My shirt sir Your shirt Aye aye sir You see I had two on an outer shirt and an inner shirt I didn t need the outer shirt as it s so hot here so I hoisted that on top of a tall tree It s flying in the breeze now sir You can see it from here He led the way down to the edge of the water and pointed inland Sure enough flying from a tall cocoanut tree was a white shirt It could be seen for a long distance That s a fine idea complimented the captain I forgot when I sent you off that you hadn t any signal flag But here comes mister Tarbill I wonder if he turned any turtles Any luck he called as the nervous man approached No sir The turtles all ran when they heard me coming Some of them left a lot of eggs behind Did you bring any No I didn t think they were good Good Of course they re good We ll gather some later But come on It s long past dinner time and I guess we re all hungry Every one proved it by the manner in which he ate The meal was a primitive one with sticks for forks though they all had pocket knives which answered very well to cut the fish For plates Captain Spark substituted large clam shells in place of the leaves Bob had used Now I think we had better rig up some kind of a hut for shelter against the night dews proposed the captain when they were done eating Gather all the cocoanut leaves you can and I ll make a sort of framework Bob started up ready to go off into the forest after leaves with the sailor and mister Tarbill As he gazed out to sea where the big waves were still rolling he saw something that caused him to utter a cry of astonishment What is it asked Captain Spark hurrying to Bob s side There replied the boy pointing to some dark object that was rising and falling on the swell It s a boat A boat capsized exclaimed Captain Spark We must secure it It s one from the Eagle Probably the one we were in Shall I swim out to it asked Bob Perhaps I can tow it in No the current is setting toward the beach It will drift in presently CHAPTER XXI MORE ARRIVALS All interest in building a hut was temporarily forgotten as the four castaways watched the slow approach of the boat As it came nearer it was seen to be the captain s gig in which Bob and his friends had left the ill fated Eagle Do you think there ll be anything left in her asked Bob There will unless she is smashed replied mister Spark The lockers in which most of the supplies were packed are water tight and securely fastened This is a piece of good luck if the boat is not stove in She has turned bottom up but she may still be sound She ll soon be here When the gig was close enough so that they could wade out to it Bob and Tim Flynn rolled up their trousers and went through the shallow surf The beach gradually shelved at this point and they could wade out nearly a quarter of a mile at low tide She s all right cap n called the sailor when he and Bob reached the small craft Sound as a dollar and the lockers are closed he added as the boat rolled partly over Good cried the commander Pull her in as close as you can and we ll unload her Then we ll get her above high water mark This boat may save our lives How asked mister Tarbill Why when the sea goes down we can leave the island in her Leave the island Never I m on dry land now and I m never going to trust myself in a boat again Maybe you ll think differently after a bit said the captain By this time Bob and Tim had the boat in very shallow water They managed to turn it on the keel and the first thing they saw was the sail in the bottom Ropes fastened to various projections had prevented the canvas from floating away There cried the captain when he saw it That solves our shelter problem for us We ll make a tent Oh we re in luck all right Bob s Island isn t such a bad place after all Bob blushed with pleasure Then and there he made up his mind that his foolishness should be a thing of the past He was of some importance in the world now and it would not do to be playing childish pranks But if the captain was delighted at finding the sail he was much more so when on opening the lockers which fastened with patent catches everything was found to be as dry as a bone as Tim Flynn expressed it Now we can have a change from the fish and fruit diet said the captain as he showed where the canned food had been stowed away There were tins of ship s biscuits some jars of jam and marmalade plenty of canned beef tongue and other meats rice flour in short a bountiful supply for the small party of castaways Captain Spark had ordered the boats to be well provisioned when he knew the Eagle was doomed and his forethought now stood them in good stead In another locker was a kit of carpenter s tools which would come in very handy if they were to remain long on the island and in another water tight compartment the captain had stowed his chronometer his instruments for finding the position of the ship and some charts Owing to the fact that the lockers remained tightly closed when the boat capsized nothing had been lost out of them and they had also served to make the gig more buoyant Practically nothing was missing from the boat save the personal belongings of Bob and the others their clothing in the valises the mast which had floated away and some of the captain s papers relating to the ship But this did not worry them as they were now in good shape to live on the island at least for several weeks All hands to lighten ship called the captain when he had looked over what the boat contained They made short work of carrying the things from the lockers well up on the beach With the boat thus made lighter it was pulled out of reach of the waves Now for a shelter the commander called when the gig had been safely moored This sail will make a fine tent So it proved when it was set up on some poles which Tim Flynn cut with a light hatchet found among the tools mister Tarbill could not be depended on to do anything and he was so mournful standing around and lamenting the fact that he had ever undertaken the trip that to get rid of him Captain Spark sent him off once more to catch turtles or if he could not do that to gather some of the eggs This last mister Tarbill was able to do but he was not successful in turning any of the crawling creatures over on their backs The tent was erected before dark and with a cheerful fire burning in front of it supper was prepared This time they had tin dishes to eat from as a supply was found in the gig s lockers Tired out with their day s work and by the struggle with the sea the castaways all slept soundly Nor was there any need to stand guard during the night On beds of palm leaves under the tent they slumbered undisturbed until the sun shining in on them awoke all four Well I m beginning to feel quite to home remarked the captain who could be cheerful under misfortune His good spirits should have been a lesson to mister Tarbill That gentleman had lost nothing but what could be easily replaced but the captain had lost his fine ship Still he did not complain and Bob seeing his demeanor under trying circumstances resolved to try and be like the stanch mariner After breakfast Captain Spark looked carefully over the gig to see if the craft was seaworthy He decided that it was and he sent Tim to look about for a suitable small tree to be cut down as a mast for the sail Are you going to sail away asked mister Tarbill nervously I don t know I want to be all ready to do so in case we find it necessary This noon I will work out our position and locate this island on the chart Then I can determine how far it is to the nearest mainland or to a larger island I ll never go in a small boat on this big ocean declared mister Tarbill Captain Spark who had completed his examination of the gig was standing near it idly gazing off across the waste of water which had greatly subsided since the storm when he caught sight of some small object about two miles off shore Bob he called bring me the binoculars for a pair of marine glasses had been found in one of the lockers The captain gazed through the glasses for several seconds Then he cried out More arrivals Prepare for company Bob Who captain There s a boat off there and in it are mister Carr the first mate and Ned Scudd But they seem to be in trouble for they are bailing fast Their boat must have a hole in it We d better go to their rescue CHAPTER XXII AFLOAT ONCE MORE Captain Spark laid aside his binoculars and began shoving the gig down toward the line of surf The tide was about half in Lend a hand cried the commander to mister Tarbill There was no need to urge Bob who had already grasped one side of the gunwale and was helping to push the boat down the beach It was almost too much for the captain and Bob as mister Tarbill however willing he was could not bring much strength to the work Fortunately however Tim Flynn came from the woods at that moment dragging after him a long thin pole to serve as a mast He saw what the captain wanted and ran up to help Between the three they managed to get the gig afloat Now then Lively cried the commander Their boat is settling fast Tim did not need to be told what the object was in launching the gig Fortunately there had been a spare pair of oars in the craft when she came ashore the big blades being fastened so they could not float away With these the captain and Tim began to propel the boat toward the sinking craft in which were mister Carr and Ned Scudd The two latter were bailing so fast that they had no chance to row Bob also went in the gig but mister Tarbill remained on shore nervously running up and down wringing his hands and uttering vain wishes that he had never undertaken a sea voyage for his health It was not long before the gig was close to the other boat and Captain Spark called out a glad greeting to his first mate and the sailor What happened he asked We hit some floating wreckage last night explained mister Carr Stove quite a hole but I managed to stuff part of a sail in it and we did very well until early this morning Then some of the seams began to open and we re filling fast I ll take you aboard said the commander We ve got a nice little island waiting for you Where are the other men Drowned replied mister Carr solemnly That is those who were with me When we got the hole in us they became frightened and leaped overboard that is all but Ned here I tried to make em stay in but they wouldn t That is the last I saw of them The other boat with Sam Bender and his crew we lost sight of Poor fellows murmured the captain The first mate and Ned were soon in the captain s gig and shortly afterward the boat with the hole in her filled and sank Never mind consoled the captain It s shallow here and at low tide we may be able to get her Anything left in her mister Carr Considerable provisions in the water tight compartments Also some supplies Very good We ll need em all We re quite a party of castaways now How did you find Bob asked the first mate for his boat had been near when the boy fell overboard Oh Bob discovered the island for us replied the commander and he explained the various happenings Shore was soon reached and then mister Carr and Ned neither of whom had been able to eat much because of the necessity of bailing to keep from sinking were given a good meal The two latest arrivals looked with interest on what had already been done to form a camp When their wet trousers were hung up to dry in the hot sun they rested in the shade of the tent and Bob explained his adventures on first reaching the island Have you any idea where we are captain asked mister Carr after a mutual exchange of experiences Only a slight one I m going to take an observation this noon Fortunately my chronometer did not stop and I can get the correct reckoning But the captain was disappointed At noon the sun was hidden under a dense bank of clouds and as dead reckoning would have been of no avail since they had no previous record to go by he had to postpone matters However there was plenty to do When the tide went out late that afternoon they saw that it would be possible to get most of the things from the wrecked boat This kept them busy until dark Then a big campfire was lighted and though the tent was rather crowded with six in it they managed to sleep fairly comfortably The next day it rained and the castaways put in rather a miserable existence Fortunately they had carried the food into the tent where it was protected from the terrific tropical downpour The rain kept up for three days and during all that time mister Tarbill never ceased complaining As for Bob and the others they did not mind getting wet through for the weather was very warm Under the captain s directions they had built a sort of screen for the fire at the first sign of a storm making it of green cocoanut tree leaves on slanting poles like a lean to and this kept the blaze going in spite of the wetness as plenty of dry wood had been gathered before the rain began On the fourth day the sun shone brightly the downpour had ceased and they rejoiced in the beautiful scenery around them even though they were shipwrecked and on a strange island We must build a more substantial shelter than the tent Captain Spark decided that morning We may have to stay here for several months and the tent is not large enough Besides we must keep our supplies dry They decided to make a small log cabin and with this end in view Bob the two sailors and mister Carr set off into the woods to hew down trees for this purpose Captain Spark and mister Tarbill remained behind to get the camp in better shape after the storm The commander also wished to take a sun observation that noon and work out the position of the island As Bob and his three companions were going through the wood they were surprised to see several birds of brilliant plumage Some of them sang sweetly That s a good sign exclaimed mister Carr Why asked Bob Because if there are birds on this small island it shows that there must be a larger island not far away Birds of this kind live in large forests and as there are none here on account of the size of this island that shows they must come from some other one or from the mainland I hope you re right said Bob We might be able to get to some other island in the gig and then we would stand a better chance of being rescued When the little party got back to camp carrying a number of poles for the beginning of the hut they found Captain Spark preparing to take an observation as it was nearly noon He asked mister Carr to assist him In a few minutes after taking the altitude of the sun through the sextant and working out a calculation from his table of figures the captain was able to announce the result giving the latitude and longitude of the island Why exclaimed Bob that is about the location of the island shown on the parchment map that Captain Obed gave me So it is cried the captain Where is the map Bob Lost overboard with the rest of my things I suppose when the boat capsized was the rueful answer That s so Now we ll never know whether there was any treasure or not However there s no use worrying about that The best news is that we are not far off from a very large island at which ships frequently touch for water and provisions Good cried mister Carr About how far off captain Not more than two hundred miles But how can we go two hundred miles asked mister Tarbill In the small boat my gig to be sure We have sufficient provisions for twice that journey and the boat is large enough I ll never venture to sea in a small boat declared the nervous passenger The others paid little attention to him being too much interested in what the captain had to say about the other island He had never been there but he had heard of it It was inhabited by a tribe of friendly natives Shall we start soon asked mister Carr I think we ll wait a week or two and see what turns up here We are very comfortable and I don t want to undertake the voyage in the small boat if there is any chance of a ship taking us off from here The thought that they were not so very far from an island where the chances of rescue were most excellent put every one in good humor save mister Tarbill He remained gloomy and nervous It was decided to proceed with the building of the hut and in a few days it was finished and thatched with thick green leaves that were almost as good as shingles There now let it rain if it wants to said mister Carr We ll be good and dry The tent can be used as a storehouse for what the hut won t hold It seemed as if the rain was going to take them at their word for there came a steady downpour the next day and it lasted a week with but few intermissions They were very weary of it Yet through it all Bob kept up his good spirits He was a changed boy and though once or twice the spirit of mischief seemed about to break out in him he restrained it to the secret delight of Captain Spark I was right after all he said to mister Carr one day when the rain had ceased It needed a sea voyage to straighten Bob out but I didn t figure on a shipwreck doing it The boy was very helpful about camp No task was too hard for him no labor too much and he never grumbled He had grown almost used to life on the island as had the other castaways But Captain Spark had not given up the plan of sailing for the large island He waited until he thought the weather had settled down and then one fine morning he gave the word to load the small boat with all their supplies Do you think we can make it asked mister Carr I think so We can try at any rate We ll have this island and the log cabin to return to in case we have to turn back Are you really going to put to sea in that small boat asked mister Tarbill nervously when the time for departure came That s what we are replied the captain Then I m not going Very well If you want to stay we ll leave you some provisions and perhaps in six months a ship may pass here and see the shirt signal Six months Well maybe longer maybe a shorter time And I ll have to stay here all alone That s what you will answered Captain Spark shortly for he was beginning to tire of mister Tarbill s cowardice Oh dear What shall I do exclaimed the nervous man Come along with us suggested Bob I m afraid Then stay on the island That won t sink said the captain I m afraid of that too Well we re going announced the commander preparing to aid in shoving the boat down to the water s edge Oh Don t leave me behind I ll go I ll go But I know I ll be drowned I m sure of it You re a cheerful passenger murmured the captain as mister Tarbill got into the boat Let her go boys A few minutes later they were afloat once more leaving Bob s Island behind Would they be able to reach the other one That was the question in every heart CHAPTER XXIII A SERIOUS LOSS Under a bright blue sky with the sun shining down almost a little too warm for comfort and with the sea very calm the voyage that meant so much to all of them was begun They looked back with a little regret at the small island they were leaving There at least they knew they would be safe but unless they desired to risk the chance of staying there many months they must make this venture Well it was a fine little camp murmured Bob with a tone of sorrow in his voice Indeed it was declared mister Tarbill I wish I was back there now Perhaps we all will be said Captain Spark gravely but there is no use discovering a leak in your boat until it s actually there which was his way of saying that it was bad luck to cross a bridge until you came to it Now we ve got to have some system about this voyage went on the commander We ve got enough provisions and water to last us for the trip if we are careful of them We ll not be able to have any banquets and I depend upon every one in which I include myself to be sparing of the food and drink There is no telling what may happen I have a very good appetite since taking this sea voyage murmured mister Tarbill I can t bear to think of being hungry Well perhaps there ll be no need for it I only wanted to warn you Now I propose to take command of this gig for it is my property and I m going to be obeyed just as if we were on the Eagle Aye aye sir replied the sailors promptly I ll do my best to bring the craft to the larger island as soon as possible We ll have to depend somewhat on the wind for we can t row all that distance in time to make our provisions last Fortunately I have a reliable pocket compass so I can lay our course fairly accurately Now Ned Scudd and Tim Flynn step the mast and hoist the sail and we ll see how our craft behaves under canvas The two sailors soon had the sail hoisted and under the influence of a stiff breeze the gig shot rapidly ahead the oars being shipped They had two pairs now one the spare lot from the gig and the other from the boat mister Carr had commanded Captain Spark arranged his pocket compass on the stern seat near the tiller and sitting there he directed the course of the small boat as nearly as he could toward the large island He and mister Carr were to divide the watches of the day and night There would be four of six hours each That is Captain Spark would be in charge of the boat for six hours and then mister Carr would go on watch for the same length of time until it became the captain s turn again In this way each one could get sufficient rest The two sailors Bob and mister Tarbill were divided between the two heads of the watch Bob and Tim Flynn being chosen by the captain The food had been carefully stowed away in the lockers the captain s charts chronometer and sextant were put where he could easily get at them and as they had breakfasted before they set off on their voyage there was nothing to do for several hours but to make themselves as comfortable as possible in the boat Had it not been for the worry over what might be the outcome and had not the dreadful memory of the shipwreck been in all their minds they might have enjoyed the sail As it was no one felt very jolly mister Tarbill was particularly miserable and was continually finding fault Oh dear It s dreadfully hot he exclaimed when they had been sailing for several hours and Bob s Island was out of sight I m afraid I shall be sunstruck Get in the shadow of the sail Go forward advised Captain Spark I m afraid to move for fear I ll slip overboard as Bob did Well if you do we can see to fish you out It s daylight now Oh I m miserable I wish I had never come on this trip I know I shall never live to see home again I too wish you hadn t come thought the captain but he really felt sorry for the nervous man Finally it grew so hot that mister Tarbill could stand it no longer He decided he would make his way forward where he could be in the shade of the sail The others were very warm also but they did not complain Even Bob who was not used to roughing it as were the sailors stood it bravely though the hot sun made his head ache mister Tarbill who was in the stern near Captain Spark arose and started forward As he did so a wave larger than any that the boat had previously encountered careened the craft a bit Oh I m going overboard exclaimed mister Tarbill He made a frantic clutch at the air and really did almost go over the side but it was due more to his own awkwardness than to anything else Then he slipped down into the bottom of the gig but as he did so his arm shot out and something bright and shining was knocked from the after locker over the gunwale into the sea where it fell with a little splash Now you have done it cried the captain standing up and making a vain grab Done it Done what asked mister Tarbill You ve knocked overboard the only compass we had How we re going to find the island now is more than I can tell This is a serious loss CHAPTER XXIV DAYS OF HOPELESSNESS The captain s announcement struck terror to every heart Even Bob with the little knowledge of the sea he possessed realized what that meant They would have to go it blind now and the chances of finding a comparatively small island in that vast ocean were little indeed Did I knock the compass overboard asked mister Tarbill You certainly did spoke the captain grimly I I didn t mean to No I don t suppose you did Still it s on the bottom of the ocean by this time Oh dear What shall we do The best we can Fortunately I have a general idea of the direction of our course and at night I can make a shift to steer by the stars but it s going to be pretty much guesswork If we can t find the big island can t we go back to the small one where we were asked Bob hopefully It would be about as hard to find that as it s going to be to locate the other now Still we ll have to do the best we can It s your watch mister Carr Keep her as near as you can about as she is while this wind holds We ll have a bit to eat now The captain dealt out the food and the supply of water The amount of the latter was very small as they did not have many casks in which to store a supply for their voyage Still no one complained even mister Tarbill being too stunned by what he had done to find any fault The day passed slowly and the breeze kept up But whether they were being urged on toward the island or whether the wind had shifted and was bearing them in another direction was something no one could tell A deeper gloom than any that had prevailed since the shipwreck fell upon them all When it got dark and the stars came out Captain Spark was able to direct the boat to a little better advantage but when morning came after the long darkness during which no one had slept well they found themselves on a vast heaving expanse of water Where are we asked mister Tarbill Is the island in sight Captain Spark swept the horizon with his glasses There s not a sail to be seen he said and no sign of land I thought we would raise the island by this morning Then don t you know where we are asked the nervous man I haven t the least idea except that we are somewhere on the Pacific Ocean The captain spoke rather hopelessly Never mind said Bob cheerfully We ve got food enough for a week and by that time something may happen Yes something may said mister Carr with a gloomy look That s the way to talk Bob exclaimed the captain Never say die We ll cheat old Davy Jones and his locker yet Indeed Bob s cheerfulness under trying circumstances was something that the captain had marked with satisfaction The very character of the boy had undergone a change because of what he had been through He seemed to have grown older and to have a fitting idea of responsibility Bob was beginning to realize that life was not all play It was rather hopeless sailing now not knowing whether they were headed right or not Still they kept on They ate all they wanted for the food was more plentiful than water and they knew if worst came to worst they could live for several days without victuals but not without water Slowly the time dragged on Nobody aboard the craft knew what to do Once Bob tried to cheer up and hum a ditty but the effort was a dismal failure Bob I reckon you are sorry now that you left home and came with me observed the captain soberly I m not sorry that I left home answered the lad promptly But I must confess I am sorry that all of us are in such a pickle as this If I had known my ship was going to be wrecked I d not have taken you on this voyage It is an awful loss Yes but I sha n t mind it so much if only we reach a place of safety Oh if only I was home sighed mister Tarbill If only I was home Wouldn t just dry land suit you queried Bob with a bit of his old time humor I I suppose so but I d like home best Any land would suit me just now put in the captain Supposing we should land among cannibals murmured the nervous passenger I don t believe there are any around here answered Captain Spark But are you sure No I am not sure I knew it Oh if the savages got us it would be terrible And mister Tarbill shuddered Well he s a wet blanket if ever there was one declared mister Carr in deep disgust I am er a wet blanket demanded the nervous passenger Yes you are declared the other And I for one am tired of hearing you croak Hum murmured mister Tarbill and then for the time being he said no more The constant rocking of the boat made him somewhat sick at the stomach and he was anything but happy Bob could not help but think of home and of his dear mother and father If he was lost what would they say and what would they do Dear folks at home he murmured If I ever get back you ll find me a different boy yes indeed you will No more silly tricks for Bob And he shut his lips with a firmness that meant a great deal The boy had just closed his eyes to take a nap when a loud cry from Tim Flynn awoke him What s the matter he questioned What do you see Tim asked the captain The sailor was at the bow standing up on the seat and gazing far across the rising and falling waters He did not answer until the craft was on the crest of a high wave A ship he exclaimed Where came from all of the others in concert Dead ahead Both the captain and mister Carr looked and saw that the report was true Far far away could be seen a low lying dark object with a trail of smoke behind it It s a steamer said Captain Spark Is it headed this way asked Bob eagerly I believe so Are you sure sir came from mister Tarbill Please don t make any mistake No I am not sure Tim what do you think went on the captain The sailor shrugged his shoulders He was too anxious to even venture an opinion How eagerly all on board the little craft watched that dark object so far away One minute they felt certain the steamer was headed toward them the next they were afraid it was moving off to the northward Let s sail after the steamer suggested Bob It won t help us much answered mister Carr Never mind it will help some came from Captain Spark and they sailed and rowed with all the skill and strength they possessed Are we closer asked mister Tarbill Not yet answered the captain Can t we call to them No but we can fire a shot answered Captain Spark and not one shot but half a dozen were discharged If only the lookout sees us said Bob I wish we could hoist some big signal But they had nothing larger than the sail and a shirt mister Carr furnished the garment and it was tied to the masthead But if those on the steamer saw the signal they gave no sign She s goin away wailed Tim Flynn at last Bad luck to her fer lavin us Going away ejaculated Bob and his heart sank like a lump of lead in his bosom Don t say that wailed mister Tarbill Shout fire a gun anything They must come and rescue us And in his nervousness the man began to caper about wildly Look out or you ll go overboard shouted Captain Spark Scarcely had he spoken when the boat was caught by a big wave and stood up almost on end With a yell mister Tarbill slid to the stern clutched at the gunwale and disappeared with a splash Man overboard Of all the fools muttered mister Carr Why couldn t he sit still and behave himself His patience so far as the nervous passenger was concerned was completely exhausted Bob reached for the boathook and as soon as mister Tarbill came up he caught the iron in the man s coat and hauled him to the side Then the captain and Tim Flynn hauled him back on board Help I am drowning Save me spluttered the nervous passenger I ll go to the bottom of the Pacific No you won t answered Captain Spark But after this you had better sit still Oh what a trying experience wailed the unfortunate one He cleared his mouth of water Why did you let me go overboard he demanded Why didn t you stop me when you saw me slipping Didn t have time answered the captain You ought to thank Bob for hooking you He tore my coat sleeve said mister Tarbill examining the garment And it s the only coat I have now he added mournfully Never mind maybe you won t need a coat soon put in mister Carr who was more disgusted than ever How s that If we go down the fish won t care if we have coats on or not guess they d rather eat us without coats Oh dear Oh dear gasped the nervous passenger and then he all but collapsed The steamer is turning cried Tim Flynn who had climbed up the mast to obtain a better view Good luck to her if she comes this way If only we could send her a wireless message said Bob Yes here is where that newfangled telegraphing would come in handy returned Captain Spark But we ain t got no apparatus so we can t do it With anxious eyes all watched the big steamer which looked to be steering almost for them The craft was a long way off so they could make out nothing distinctly It s clouding down we are going to have a squall cried Captain Spark suddenly He pointed to the eastward and the others saw that he was right As if by magic dark clouds were rolling up from the horizon The wind died out and then came in uncertain puffs The steamer is leaving us cried mister Carr Oh don t say that please don t wailed mister Tarbill Here comes the squall cried Captain Spark and he was right Soon a sudden gust of wind struck the sailboat almost keeling her over As quickly as it could be done the sail was lowered and stowed away The squall was of short duration lasting all told not more than ten minutes Only a few drops of rain fell Then the clouds rolled off to the westward and it became as clear as before The steamer It s gone shouted mister Carr What cried Captain Spark Gone I tell you With great anxiety all strained their eyes to catch some sight of the large craft At last Tim Flynn pointed with his finger There she is sailin right away from us he said bitterly The words of the Irish tar proved true the steamer had again altered her course In a few minutes her dark form was swallowed up in the distant haze It must be admitted that all were much cast down by this happening When the steamer had headed directly for them they had thought sure they would be rescued They must have done it deliberately said mister Tarbill Oh the villains the scoundrels I don t believe that answered Captain Spark More n likely they didn t see us No captain would be so inhuman as to pass us by Two hours dragged by slowly Tim Flynn was tired out with much watching and had lain down and Ned Scudd had taken his place I see something said Ned presently Don t know what it is He pointed to the southward There was some low lying object with the waves dashing against it Perhaps it s a ship with the masts gone said mister Carr Or a dead whale suggested Bob It s too big for either a ship or a whale said the captain Let us sail toward it and make an inspection Don t don t run into any new danger pleaded mister Tarbill Anything is better than to remain out on this dreary waste of waters answered mister Carr The castaways turned their boat in the direction of the distant object It was further off than they had anticipated and as they slowly approached they made out a long low lying island covered with bushes and grass Over the island hovered myriads of birds An island cried Bob Now we can go ashore anyhow Not much of a place I am afraid answered Captain Spark slowly taking in the spot from end to end with his sharp eyes Well it s better nor nuthin came from Tim Flynn Sure an some av thim burds will make good eatin so they will We want to be careful how we go ashore cautioned the captain We don t want to damage our boat They approached the new land cautiously The water all around it seemed to be deep so there was no danger of striking a hidden reef Presently the captain espied a sandy beach and straight for this the craft was headed As the boat struck Bob Tim and Ned leaped out followed by mister Carr and aided by the swells pulled her well up Am I er to get out asked mister Tarbill timidly As you please answered Captain Spark grimly I am going ashore Then I ll go too I don t want to be left alone said the nervous passenger Soon all were on the beach and then the boat was dragged higher up still and tied to several of the low trees near by Let me shoot some birds they will make fine eating said Bob to the captain and permission being given the young castaway went on a brief hunt The birds were so thick that he had little difficulty in bringing down several dozen Now we can have a bird pot pie for supper declared mister Carr and he looked greatly pleased and so did the others All realized that the island upon which they had landed was not to be compared to that upon which they had previously been cast The trees were of small account none of them bearing fruit fit to eat Some of the bushes contained berries and Ned began to gather a cupful Go slow there Ned said the captain They may be poisonous They can t be for I saw the birds feeding on them said Bob Oh well then it is all right But the berries proved rather bitter to the taste and nobody felt like eating many of them Tim started a fire and over this they broiled and roasted the birds each fixing the evening meal in the way that best suited him Are there any cannibals here asked mister Tarbill I don t believe there is a soul on the island besides ourselves answered the captain I can t go to sleep if there are cannibals groaned the nervous passenger As late as it was Bob Ned and the captain took a tramp around the island It was not over a quarter of a mile long and an eighth of a mile wide There was fairly good walking close to the shore but the interior was a mass of stunted trees thorny bushes and long trailing vines to get through which was impossible I haven t seen what I d like most to see said the captain after the walk was ended What is that questioned Bob A spring of good fresh water That s so we didn t see any spring at all exclaimed Ned Scudd Too bad We need water The castaways were thoroughly tired out and that night all went to bed and slept soundly Nothing came to disturb them although at daybreak mister Tarbill leaped up in alarm Hark he cried Somebody is coming It must be the cannibals What exclaimed Captain Spark and he jumped up followed by the others Then all listened From the interior of the little island came a most unearthly screaming Somebody is being murdered gasped mister Tarbill and sank on his knees Oh oh why did I leave home They listened intently and then mister Carr set up a laugh What is it asked Bob curiously Parrots my boy nothing but parrots To be sure I should have knowed it came from the captain They allers screech like that in the morning Are you sure they are parrots asked the nervous passenger Dead certain answered mister Carr If you don t believe it just go over to yonder trees and shoo them up into the air I I don t think I care to do that they might fly at me and peck me Well they are parrots and they won t hurt you if you leave em alone During the morning the search for a spring of water was resumed At last they found several pools the water coming up in them from underground But the birds used the pools for drinking places and they were consequently far from clean How long are we to stay on this island asked mister Tarbill while they were eating a breakfast of broiled birds fish and crackers Not very long I m thinking answered the captain In a storm it wouldn t be a very safe place The water must sweep the land pretty well and our boat would be stove to pieces But where are you going We ll try to make that big island I spoke about went on the captain Then of a sudden he bent closer to the nervous man What s that on your watch chain he demanded My watch chain Yes It looks like a tiny compass to me Why er it is a compass stammered mister Tarbill And you never told us that you had it roared the captain I I forgot it stammered the passenger I I was so upset you know Let me see it Captain Spark took the compass and examined it with care It was small but of good manufacture and looked as if it might point true Not near as good as the one we lost he said to mister Carr But it is better than nothing Indeed it is was the reply I thought that was a locket said Bob I noticed it on the watch chain several times It was given to me by my uncle years ago said mister Tarbill Please don t lose it I ll keep it safe don t fear answered the captain Reckon it is safer in my keepin than yours he added With the discovery of the tiny compass the hopes of the castaways revived All felt that it would be a waste of time to remain on the small island and accordingly preparations were made to leave on the following morning To add to their stock of provisions the men and Bob brought down a large quantity of birds and also caught a lot of fish and these were broiled and cooked to keep them from spoiling They also got what water they could and stored it in a cask and Bob picked a capful of berries Some of the parrots are beautiful said the boy to the captain If I was sure of getting home again I d like to take some of the feathers along for my mother s hat Better not bother Bob I ll not I was only thinking sir I have great hopes of reaching that large island went on Captain Spark But when we embark again we ll have to take what comes That little compass will help us some but it may not be as accurate as is necessary Why not stay on this island till a ship comes along I don t consider this as safe as the other island was That night Bob went to bed early He awoke in the middle of the night to feel somebody or something pulling at his foot Hi who is there he shouted sitting up At the same moment came a wild yell from mister Tarbill The cannibals have come yelled the nervous man One of em has me by the throat Stop that row came from Captain Spark There are no savages here Maybe he s got the nightmare suggested mister Carr No no I am attacked bawled mister Tarbill I know what they are shouted Bob Get out of here you imp And he struck something with a stick that was handy There was a wild chattering and off into the darkness stole several impish figures What were they asked Ned who was still sleepy Monkeys answered the youth Pretty big ones too Are you sure they weren t cannibals queried mister Tarbill Some of the wild men are very small you know In Africa they are not over three feet high Monkeys true enough said the captain I saw some of em watching our camp when we had supper They were afraid to come close when we were stirring but I suppose when we were quiet their curiosity got the best of them and they had to come and feel of us Ugh I don t want any more of them to come near me said mister Tarbill with a shudder The weather was all that could be desired and the captain determined to make the most of it An early breakfast was had and then the things were taken back to the boat All aboard shouted Captain Spark And may we now locate that large island without further trouble Oh I wish I was home groaned mister Tarbill The boat was floated without difficulty and the castaways got aboard They rowed for some distance and then the sail was hoisted Inside of an hour the little island faded from their view and once more they found themselves alone on the bosom of the broad Pacific The captain had great hopes of the small compass but he and the others were doomed to disappointment The compass proved unreliable as they discovered that night when the stars came out It s no use said Captain Spark We have got to sail by our wits if we ever expect to reach a place of safety And all that day they kept on not knowing if they were heading in the proper direction or not It was just getting dusk of the second day of their voyage when Tim Flynn opening a forward locker to set out some things for the evening meal made a startling discovery The gig has sprung a leak he exclaimed A leak cried the captain Yes this locker is half full of water and all the stuff in it is soaked It was true enough The salt water had come in through some opening of the seams of the previously tight compartment and had done much damage The victuals were only fit to throw overboard Half rations from now on said the captain sternly Half rations repeated mister Tarbill Why I m awful hungry And you re liable to be for some days to come answered the commander We ll share and share alike but every one will have to curb his appetite Oh this dreadful shipwreck I wish I had stayed home The others wished the same thing It was a night without hope and the morning broke dull and gray with the promise of a storm The wind shifted from point to point until the castaways did not know in which direction they were going for there was no sun to guide them The leaky locker was tightly closed so that there was no danger of the boat filling from it The amount of breakfast seemed woefully small to Bob and he recalled with a start the wish Dent Freeman the hired man had expressed that the boy who tormented him would have to eat seaweed Perhaps I shall before we re through with this said the lad to himself There isn t much more food left Still he did not complain setting a good example in this respect to mister Tarbill who did nothing but find fault until Captain Spark ordered him to take an oar and with one of the sailors aid in propelling the boat for the wind had suddenly died out For two days more they sailed or rowed on The weather continued unsettled but fortunately not breaking into a storm Sometimes there was a breeze and again there was a dead calm when they took turns at the oars It was all guesswork as to whether or not they were headed for the island The food became less and less until finally they were living on three dry biscuits a day each The water too was getting lower and lower in the one cask that remained and it had a warm brackish taste Still it was the most precious thing they possessed More and more worried became the look on Captain Spark s face How anxiously each morning and a dozen times a day did he scan the horizon with his glasses for a sight of the island or a ship But nothing was to be seen save the heaving billows mister Tarbill became weak minded and babbled of cooling streams of water and delicious food until Ned Scudd losing all patience threatened to throw the nervous man overboard if he did not cease This had the effect of quieting him for a while The faces of all were haggard and thin Their eyes were unnaturally bright Poor Bob bore up bravely though tears came into his eyes as he thought of his father and mother and the pleasant and happy home now so far away Bob s as good as a man whispered the captain to mister Carr and the first mate nodded an assent It was the third day of absolute hopelessness The water was reduced to so little that only a small cupful could be served to each one as the day s supply Enough biscuits for two days remained They had lost all sense of direction for a fog obscured the sun On the morning of the fourth day Bob awoke from a troubled sleep to find mister Carr dozing at the helm There was no need to steer for there had been a dead calm for many hours and they did not row during the night Bob s tongue felt like a piece of rubber in his mouth His throat was parched and dry and his stomach craved woefully for food He stood up on a forward locker and taking the captain s glasses slowly swept them around the sky line Was it imagination or did he really see some small black object off to the left His heart beat fast and his nerves were throbbing so he could not hold the glasses steady Captain Spark roused himself from a brief nap He saw what Bob was doing See anything he asked listlessly I don t know I m not sure there s something off there that looks like Let me take the glasses cried the commander He fairly snatched them from the boy With his trained vision he looked long where Bob pointed Then he cried Thank God There s a boat coming toward us I think we re saved There are natives in it but they don t seem to have any weapons I believe they re from the big island Row men row as hard as you can and we ll meet them the sooner Tim and Ned caught up the oars and sent the gig over the calm water at a fast rate of speed CHAPTER XXV HOMEWARD BOUND CONCLUSION Before an hour had passed the oncoming boat was in plain sight Then the castaways could see it contained four brown skinned natives But though they were savages they were not warlike In fact they waved their hands in welcome and called encouragingly to those in the gig I hope they have some water aboard said mister Tarbill I d give anything for some right off the ice I d be glad of some out of a tea kettle said the captain for the last in the cask had been dealt out some time before A little later the commander was exchanging a few words with the natives as he found he could speak a little of their language We re within a few miles of the big island he told his anxious companions This is a fishing party in one of their big native canoes They ll show us the way back and they have plenty of water The parched throats and swelling tongues of the castaways were soon relieved by a fairly cool drink from the filled skins in the native boat Then the brown men passed over some cocoanuts and other fruit that were grateful to the palates of the half starved ones Captain Spark conversed a little longer with the friendly savages and some news they gave him seemed to give him great satisfaction There s an American ship in port at the island he said and she s homeward bound around the Horn We can take passage in her Hurrah men our troubles seem to be over Thank God said mister Carr fervently and so great was the strain on mister Tarbill that when it was relieved by the good news he cried like a child Nor were Bob s eyes altogether dry A little breeze had sprung up and guided by the natives the castaways were soon at the island It was a large one and the first sight they had of it showed them a big ship in the harbor At this they set up a cheer It did not take Captain Spark long to arrange matters with the American skipper He agreed to let the sailors Bob and mister Tarbill work their passage home and Captain Spark was to give his services as assistant navigator in lieu of passage money As the ship was taking on part of a cargo of native produce from the island she was not quite ready to sail and in the meanwhile Bob and the captain went about the island a bit Bob collecting a number of curiosities The natives treated them kindly and the four who had saved the lives of the castaways by appearing in the nick of time felt well repaid by the present of a few trinkets which Bob and the sailors had in their pockets Finally the time came for them to take passage on the Walrus which was the name of the American ship They sailed one bright morning and under a spanking breeze the big island was presently low down on the horizon Bob was soon a favorite with every one on the ship he was so anxious to learn and so ready and obliging He never grumbled even when the work was hard But mister Tarbill never ceased lamenting the fact that he had ever left home As for our hero he seemed to have settled down in life and was fast learning to become a good sailor The pranks he used to play were now a thing of the past and he fully justified the good opinion Captain Spark had of him It was a six months trip home for they were delayed two weeks or more by contrary winds and several days longer in making the passage of Magellan Straits As the Walrus was to put in at Charleston South Carolina it was necessary for Captain Spark Bob and mister Tarbill to make the rest of the journey home by rail mister Carr and the two sailors secured berths in the Walrus Though Captain Spark had lost all his money in the shipwreck he was able to borrow enough for the fares of himself Bob and mister Tarbill Bob reached home a little short of a year from the time he had left He was a much better boy than when he went away His father and mother did not need to be told of the change in him They could see it for themselves What did I tell you asked Captain Spark triumphantly of missus Henderson I said the voyage would make a man of Bob and it did The voyage or the shipwreck asked missus Henderson I guess it needed both ventured Bob s father Of course Bob was the hero of all his associates and they never tired of hearing his stories of what had happened Later it was learned that Second Mate Bender and his men had been picked up by a passing vessel and saved As for Captain Obediah Hickson when he heard that Bob had returned he hastened to
