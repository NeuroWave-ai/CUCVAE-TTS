NEW YORK AND LONDON nineteen nineteen COPYRIGHT nineteen seventeen BY FUNK WAGNALLS COMPANY Printed in the United States of America Copyright under the Articles of the Copyright Convention of the Pan American Republics and the United States August eleven nineteen ten Published October nineteen seventeen One cannot always live in the palaces and state apartments of language but we can refuse to spend our days in searching for its vilest slums William Watson Words without thought are dead sounds thoughts without words are nothing To think is to speak low to speak is to think aloud Max Muller The first merit which attracts in the pages of a good writer or the talk of a brilliant conversationalist is the apt choice and contrast of the words employed It is indeed a strange art to take these blocks rudely conceived for the purpose of the market or the bar and by tact of application touch them to the finest meanings and distinctions Robert Louis Stevenson It is with words as with sunbeams the more they are condensed the deeper they burn Southey No noble or right style was ever yet founded but out of a sincere heart Ruskin Words are things and a small drop of ink falling like dew upon a thought produces that which makes thousands perhaps millions think Byron A good phrase may outweigh a poor library Thomas W Higginson PLAN OF CLASSIFICATION SECTION I USEFUL PHRASES II SIGNIFICANT PHRASES III FELICITOUS PHRASES IV IMPRESSIVE PHRASES V PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES VI BUSINESS PHRASES VII LITERARY EXPRESSIONS VIII STRIKING SIMILES IX CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES X PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES XI MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES INTRODUCTION The most powerful and the most perfect expression of thought and feeling through the medium of oral language must be traced to the mastery of words Nothing is better suited to lead speakers and readers of English into an easy control of this language than the command of the phrase that perfectly expresses the thought Every speaker s aim is to be heard and understood A clear crisp articulation holds an audience as by the spell of some irresistible power The choice word the correct phrase are instruments that may reach the heart and awake the soul if they fall upon the ear in melodious cadence but if the utterance be harsh and discordant they fail to interest fall upon deaf ears and are as barren as seed sown on fallow ground In language nothing conduces so emphatically to the harmony of sounds as perfect phrasing that is the emphasizing of the relation of clause to clause and of sentence to sentence by the systematic grouping of words The phrase consists usually of a few words which denote a single idea that forms a separate part of a sentence In this respect it differs from the clause which is a short sentence that forms a distinct part of a composition paragraph or discourse Correct phrasing is regulated by rests such rests as do not break the continuity of a thought or the progress of the sense GRENVILLE KLEISER who has devoted years of his diligent life to imparting the art of correct expression in speech and writing has provided many aids for those who would know not merely what to say but how to say it He has taught also what the great HOLMES taught that language is a temple in which the human soul is enshrined and that it grows out of life out of its joys and its sorrows its burdens and its necessities To him as well as to the writer the deep strong voice of man and the low sweet voice of woman are never heard at finer advantage than in the earnest but mellow tones of familiar speech In the present volume mister Kleiser furnishes an additional and an exceptional aid for those who would have a mint of phrases at their command from which to draw when in need of the golden mean for expressing thought Few indeed are the books fitted to day for the purpose of imparting this knowledge yet two centuries ago phrase books were esteemed as supplements to the dictionaries and have not by any manner of means lost their value The guide to familiar quotations the index to similes the grammars the readers the machine made letter writer of mechanically perfect letters of congratulation or condolence none are sententious enough to supply the need By the compilation of this praxis mister Kleiser has not only supplied it but has furnished a means for the increase of one s vocabulary by practical methods There are thousands of persons who may profit by the systematic study of such a book as this if they will familiarize themselves with the author s purpose by a careful reading of the preliminary pages of his book To speak in public pleasingly and readily and to read well are accomplishments acquired only after many days weeks even of practise Foreigners sometimes reproach us for the asperity and discordance of our speech and in general this reproach is just for there are many persons who do scanty justice to the vowel elements of our language Although these elements constitute its music they are continually mistreated We flirt with and pirouette around them constantly If it were not so English would be found full of beauty and harmony of sound Familiar with the maxim Take care of the vowels and the consonants will take care of themselves a maxim that when put into practise has frequently led to the breaking down of vowel values the writer feels that the common custom of allowing the consonants to take care of themselves is pernicious It leads to suppression or to imperfect utterance and thus produces indistinct articulation The English language is so complex in character that it can scarcely be learned by rule and can best be mastered by the study of such idioms and phrases as are provided in this book but just as care must be taken to place every accent or stress on the proper syllable in the pronouncing of every word it contains so must the stress or emphasis be placed on the proper word in every sentence spoken To read or speak pleasingly one should resort to constant practise by doing so aloud in private or preferably in the presence of such persons as know good reading when they hear it and are masters of the melody of sounds It was Dean Swift s belief that the common fluency of speech in many men and most women was due to scarcity of matter and scarcity of words He claimed that a master of language possessed a mind full of ideas and that before speaking such a mind paused to select the choice word the phrase best suited to the occasion Common speakers he said have only one set of ideas and one set of words to clothe them in and these are always ready on the lips Because he holds the Dean s view sound to day the writer will venture to warn the readers of this book against a habit that growing far too common among us should be checked and this is the iteration and reiteration in conversation of the battered stale and trite phrases the like of which were credited by the worthy Dean to the women of his time Human thought elaborates itself with the progress of intelligence Speech is the harvest of thought and the relation which exists between words and the mouths that speak them must be carefully observed Just as nothing is more beautiful than a word fitly spoken so nothing is rarer than the use of a word in its exact meaning There is a tendency to overwork both words and phrases that is not restricted to any particular class The learned sin in this respect even as do the ignorant and the practise spreads until it becomes an epidemic The epidemic word with us yesterday was unquestionably conscription several months ago it was preparedness Before then efficiency was heard on every side and succeeded in superseding vocational teaching only to be displaced in turn by life extension activities Safety first had a long run which was brought almost to abrupt end by strict accountability but these are mere reflections of our cosmopolitan life and activities There are others that stand out as indicators of brain weariness These are most frequently met in the work of our novelists English authors and journalists are abusing and overworking the word intrigue to day Sir Arthur Quillercouch on page eighty one of his book On the Art of Writing uses it We are intrigued by the process of manufacture instead of being wearied by a description of the ready made article missus Sidgwick in Salt and Savour page two hundred thirty two wrote But what intrigued her was Little Mamma s remark at breakfast From the Parliamentary news one learns that mister Harcourt intrigued the House of Commons by his sustained silence for two years and that London is interested in and not a little intrigued by the statement This use of intrigue in the sense of perplex puzzle trick or deceive dates from sixteen hundred Then it fell into a state of somnolence and after an existence of innocuous desuetude lasting till seventeen ninety four it was revived only to hibernate again until eighteen ninety four It owes its new lease of life to a writer on The Westminster Gazette a London journal famous for its competitions in aid of the restoring of the dead meanings of words One is almost exasperated by the repeated use and abuse of the word intimate in a recently published work of fiction by an author who aspires to the first rank in his profession He writes of the intimate dimness of the room a fierce intimate whispering a look that was intimate the noise of the city was intimate et cetera Who has not heard The idea What s the idea Is that the idea Yes that s the idea with increased inflection at each repetition And who is without a friend who at some time or another has not sprung meticulous upon him Another example is afforded by the endemic use of of sorts which struck London while the writer was in that city a few years ago Whence it came no one knew but it was heard on every side She was a woman of sorts he is a Tory of sorts he had a religion of sorts he was a critic of sorts While it originally meant of different or various kinds as hats of sorts offices of sorts cheeses of sorts et cetera it is now used disparagingly and implies something of a kind that is not satisfactory or of a character that is rather poor This as Shakespeare might have said is Sodden business There s a stewed phrase indeed Footnote Troilus and Cressida act iii sc one The abuse of phrases and the misuse of words rife among us can be checked by diligent exercises in good English such as this book provides These exercises in conjunction with others to be found in different volumes by the same author will serve to correct careless diction and slovenly speech and lead to the art of speaking and writing correctly for after all accuracy in the use of words is more a matter of habit than of theory and once it is acquired it becomes just as easy to speak or to write good English as bad English It was Chesterfield s resolution not to speak a word in conversation which was not the fittest he could recall All persons should avoid using words whose meanings they do not know and with the correct application of which they are unfamiliar The best spoken and the best written English is that which conforms to the language as used by men and women of culture a high standard it is true but one not so high that it is unattainable by any earnest student of the English tongue FRANK H VIZETELLY HOW TO USE THIS BOOK The study of words phrases and literary expressions is a highly interesting pursuit There is a reciprocal influence between thought and language What we think molds the words we use and the words we use react upon our thoughts Hence a study of words is a study of ideas and a stimulant to deep and original thinking We should not however study sparkling words and sonorous phrases with the object of introducing them consciously into our speech To do so would inevitably lead to stiltedness and superficiality Words and phrases should be studied as symbols of ideas and as we become thoroughly familiar with them they will play an unconscious but effective part in our daily expression We acquire our vocabulary largely from our reading and our personal associates The words we use are an unmistakable indication of our thought habits tastes ideals and interests in life In like manner the habitual language of a people is a barometer of their intellectual civil moral and spiritual ideals A great and noble people express themselves in great and noble words Ruskin earnestly counsels us to form the habit of looking intensely at words We should scrutinize them closely and endeavor to grasp their innermost meaning There is an indefinable satisfaction in knowing how to choose and use words with accuracy and precision As Fox once said I am never at a loss for a word but Pitt always has the word All the great writers and orators have been diligent students of words Demosthenes and Cicero were indefatigable in their study of language Shakespeare infinite in faculty took infinite pains to embody his thought in words of crystal clearness Coleridge once said of him that one might as well try to dislodge a brick from a building with one s forefinger as to omit a single word from one of his finest passages Milton master of majestic prose under whose touch words became as living things Flaubert who believed there was one and one only best word with which to express a given thought De Quincey who exercised a weird like power over words Ruskin whose rhythmic prose enchanted the ear Keats who brooded over phrases like a lover Newman of pure and melodious style Stevenson forever in quest of the scrupulously precise word Tennyson graceful and exquisite as the limpid stream Emerson of trenchant and epigrammatic style Webster whose virile words sometimes weighed a pound and Lincoln of simple Saxon speech all these illustrious men were assiduous in their study of words Many persons of good education unconsciously circumscribe themselves within a small vocabulary They have a knowledge of hundreds of desirable words which they do not put into practical use in their speech or writing Many too are conscious of a poverty of language which engenders in them a sense of timidity and self depreciation The method used for building a large vocabulary has usually been confined to the study of single words This has produced good results but it is believed that eminently better results can be obtained from a careful study of words and expressions as furnished in this book where words can be examined in their context It is intended and suggested that this study should be pursued in connection with and as a supplement to a good standard dictionary Fifteen minutes a day devoted to this subject in the manner outlined will do more to improve and enlarge the vocabulary than an hour spent in desultory reading There is no better way in which to develop the mental qualities of clearness accuracy and precision and to improve and enlarge the intellectual powers generally than by regular and painstaking study of judiciously selected phrases and literary expressions PLAN OF STUDY First examine the book in a general way to grasp its character scope and purpose Carefully note the following plan of classification of the various kinds of phrases and choose for initial study a section which you think will be of the most immediate value to you I USEFUL PHRASES II SIGNIFICANT PHRASES III FELICITOUS PHRASES IV IMPRESSIVE PHRASES V PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES VI BUSINESS PHRASES VII LITERARY EXPRESSIONS VIII STRIKING SIMILES IX CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES X PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES XI MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES There are many advantages in keeping before you a definite purpose in your study of this book A well defined plan will act as an incentive to regular and systematic effort and incidentally develop your power of concentration It is desirable that you set apart a certain convenient time each day for this study Regularity tends to produce maximum results As you progress with this work your interest will be quickened and you will realize the desirability of giving more and more time to this important subject When you have chosen a section of the book which particularly appeals to you begin your actual study by reading the phrases aloud Read them slowly and understandingly This tends to impress them more deeply upon your mind and is in itself one of the best and most practical ways of acquiring a large and varied vocabulary Moreover the practise of fitting words to the mouth rapidly develops fluency and facility of speech Few persons realize the great value of reading aloud Many of the foremost English stylists devoted a certain period regularly to this practise Cardinal Newman read aloud each day a chapter from Cicero as a means of developing his ear for sentence rhythm Rufus Choate in order to increase his command of language and to avoid sinking into mere empty fluency read aloud daily during a large part of his life a page or more from some great English author As a writer has said The practise of storing the mind with choice passages from the best prose writers and poets and thus flavoring it with the essence of good literatures is one which is commended both by the best teachers and by the example of some of the most celebrated orators who have adopted it with signal success This study should be pursued with pencil in hand so that you may readily underscore phrases which make a special appeal to you The free use of a pencil in marking significant parts of a book is good evidence of thoroughness This too will facilitate your work of subsequent review The habit of regularly copying in your own handwriting one or more pages of phrases will be of immense practical value This exercise is a great aid in developing a facile English style The daily use of the pen has been recommended in all times as a valuable means of developing oral and literary expression A helpful exercise is to pronounce a phrase aloud and then fit it into a complete sentence of your own making This practice gives added facility and resourcefulness in the use of words As an enthusiastic student of good English you should carefully note striking and significant phrases or literary expressions which you find in your general reading These should be set down in a note book reserved for this exclusive purpose In this way you can prepare many lists of your own and thus greatly augment the value of this study The taste for beauty truth and harmony in language can be developed by careful study of well selected phrases and literary expressions as furnished in this book A good literary style is formed principally by daily study of great English writers by careful examination of words in their context and by a discriminating use of language at all times GRENVILLE KLEISER New York City July nineteen seventeen SECTION I USEFUL PHRASES A abandoned hope abated

dazzling tints to fancy It moved me to a strange exhilaration It parted to a liquid horizon and showed the gray rim of the sea It proved a bitter disillusion It seemed intolerably tragic It seemed to exhale a silent and calm authority It was a breathless night of suspense It was a desolating vision It was a night of little ease to his toiling mind It was a night of stupefying surprises It was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye It was an evening of great silences and spaces wholly tranquil It was sheer exuberant instinctive unreasoning careless joy It was the ecstasy and festival of summer It was torture of the most exquisite kind J Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling Joy rioted in his large dark eyes Judging without waiting to ponder over bulky tomes K Kind of unscrupulous contempt for gravity Kiss provoking lips L Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle Language of excessive flattery and adulation Lapped in soft music of adulation Lapse into pathos and absurdity Large dark luminous eyes that behold everything about them Latent vein of whimsical humor Lead to the strangest aberrations Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire lambent effortlessly brilliant Leave to the imagination the endless vista of possibilities Life flowed in its accustomed stream Lights and shadows of reviving memory crossed her face Lionized by fashionable society Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets Lost in a delirious wonder Lost in irritable reflection Love hovered in her gaze Ludicrous attempts of clumsy playfulness and tawdry eloquence Luke warm assurance of continued love Lulled by dreamy musings Luminous with great thoughts M Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties Making the ear greedy to remark offense Marching down to posterity with divine honors Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom Mawkishly effeminate sentiment Memories plucked from wood and field Memory was busy at his heart Merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion Microscopic minuteness of eye Misgivings of grave kinds Mockery crept into her tone Molded by the austere hand of adversity Moments of utter idleness and insipidity Moods of malicious reaction and vindictive recoil Morn in yellow and white came broadening out of the mountains Mumble only jargon of dotage My body is too frail for its moods N Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts unwonted unusual New ambitions pressed upon his fancy New dreams began to take wing in his imagination Night after night the skies were wine blue and bubbling with stars Night passes lightly in the open world with its stars and dews and perfumes Nights of fathomless blackness No mark of trick or artifice Noble and sublime patience Nursed by brooding thought O Obsessed with the modishness of the hour Occasional flashes of tenderness and love Oddly disappointing and fickle One gracious fact emerges here One long torture of soul One of the golden twilights which transfigure the world Oppressed and disheartened by an all pervading desolation Oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material cumbrous cumbersome Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness Over and over the paroxysms of grief and longing submerged her Overhung and overspread with ivy Overshadowed by a vague depression P Pale and vague desolation Pallor of reflected glories Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility Panting after distinction Peace brooded over all Pelted with an interminable torrent of words Penetrate beneath the surface to the core Peopled the night with thoughts Perpetual gloom and seclusion of life Pertinent to the thread of the discussion Pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content Piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon Platitudinous and pompously sentimental Plaudits of the unlettered mob Pleasant and flower strewn vistas of airy fancy Pledged with enthusiastic fervor Plumbing the depth of my own fears Poignant doubts and misgivings Power of intellectual metamorphosis Power to assuage the thirst of the soul Precipitated into mysterious depths of nothingness Preening its wings for a skyward flight Pressing cares absorbed him Pride working busily within her Proclaimed with joyous defiance Prodigal of discriminating epithets Prodigious boldness and energy of intellect Products of dreaming indolence Profound and chilling solitude of the spot Proof of his imperturbability and indifference Provocative of bitter hostility Pulling the strings of many enterprises Purge the soul of nonsense Q Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth Quivering with restrained grief R Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth Ransack the vocabulary Red tape of officialdom Redolent of the night lamp Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars Regarded with an exulting pride Rehabilitated and restored to dignity Remorselessly swept into oblivion Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric Respect forbade downright contradiction Restless and sore and haughty feelings were busy within Retort leaped to his lips Rigid adherence to conventionalities Rudely disconcerting in her behavior Rudely reminded of life s serious issues S

of old songs The air was raw and pointed The allurements of a coquette The ambition and rivalship of men The angry blood burned in his face The anguish of a spiritual conflict tore his heart The artificial smile of languor The awful and implacable approach of doom The babble of brooks grown audible The babbledom that dogs the heels of fame The bait proved incredibly successful The balm of

for the star The dimness of the sealed eye and soul The dreamy solicitations of indescribable afterthoughts The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening The early morning of the Indian summer day was tinged with blue mistiness The earth looked despoiled The east alone frowned with clouds The easy grace of an unpremeditated agreeable talker The easy going indolence of a sedentary life The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills The empurpled hills standing up solemn and sharp out of the green gold air The enchanting days of youth The eternal questioning of inscrutable fate The evening comes with slow steps The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night The exaggerations of morbid hallucinations The excitement of rival issues The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity The eye of a scrutinizing observer The eyes burnt with an amazing fire The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity The father

untried wings The foreground was incredibly shabby The fragrance of a dear and honored name The freshening breeze struck his brow with a cooling hand The freshness of some pulse of air from an invisible sea The fruit of vast and heroic labors The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion The give and take was delicious The gloom of the afternoon deepened The gloom of winter dwelt on everything The gloomy insolence of self conceit The glow of the ambitious fire The golden gloom of the past and the bright hued hope of the future The golden riot of the autumn leaves The golden sunlight of a great summer day The gray air rang and rippled with lark music The grimaces and caperings of buffoonery The grotesque nightmare of a haunting fear The hand of time sweeps them into oblivion The haunting melody of some familiar line of verse The haunting phrase leaped to my brain The headlong vigor of sheer improvisation The heights of magnanimity and love The high bred pride of an oriental The hills were clad in rose and amethyst The hill tops gleam in morning s spring The hinted sweetness of the challenge aroused him The hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her The hungry

opulent nature The intercepted glances of wondering eyes The intrusive question faded The invidious stigma of selfishness invidious rousing ill will The iron hand of oppression The irresistible and

none	none	 Lovely the land unknown and like a river flowing M March on my soul nor like the laggard stay Me on whose heart as a worm she trod Meaningless as the syllables of an unknown tongue Men moved hither and thither like insects in their crevices Mentality as hard as bronze Mentally round shouldered and decrepit Merge imperceptibly into one another like the hues of the prism Meteors that dart like screaming birds Milk white pavements clear and richly pale like alabaster More variegated than the skin of a serpent Motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber Motionless as a plumb line Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea Moving in the same dull round like blind horses in a mill Mute as an iceberg My age is as a lusty Winter My body broken as a turning wheel My breath to Heaven like vapor goes My head was like a great bronze bell with one thought for the clapper My heart is as some famine murdered land My heart is like a full sponge and must weep a little My heart like a bird doth hover My heart will be as wind fainting in hot grass My life floweth away like a river My life was white as driven snow My love for thee is like the sovereign moon that rules the sea My love s like the steadfast sun My lungs began to crow like chanticleer chanticleer rooster My mind swayed idly like a water lily in a lake My muscles are as steel My skin is as sallow as gold My soul was as a lampless sea My spirit seemed to beat the void like the bird from out the ark My thoughts came yapping and growling round me like a pack of curs My thoughts ran leaping through the green ways of my mind like fawns at play N Night falls like fire No longer shall slander s venomed spite crawl like a snake across his perfect name Now every nerve in my body seemed like a strained harp string ready to snap at a touch Now like a wild nymph she veils her shadowy form Now like a wild rose in the fields of heaven slipt forth the slender figure of the Dawn Now memory and emotion surged in my soul like a tempest Now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau stripped of his gaudy hues O Obscured with wrath as is the sun with cloud Odorous as all Arabia Often enough life tosses like a fretful stream among rocky boulders Oh lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud Old as the evening star Old happy hours that have long folded their wings Once again like madness the black shapes of doubt swing through his brain One bleared star faint glimmering like a bee One bright drop is like the gem that decks a monarch s crown One by one flitting like a mournful bird One deep roar as of a cloven world One winged cloud above like a spread dragon overhangs the west Oppressed by the indefiniteness which hung in her mind like a thick summer haze Or shedding radiance like the smiles of God Our enemies were broken like a dam of river reeds Our hearts bowed down like violets after rain Our sail like a dew lit blossom shone Overhead the intense blue of the noonday sky burst like a jewel in the sun P Pale and grave as a sculptured nun Pale as a drifting blossom Passed like a phantom into the shadows Passive and tractable as a child Peaceful as a village cricket green on Sunday Peevish and impatient like some ill trained man who is sick Perished utterly like a blown out flame Philosophy evolved itself like a vast spider s loom Pillowed upon its alabaster arms like to a child o erwearied with sweet toil Polished as the bosom of a star Poured his heart out like the rending sea in passionate wave on wave Pouting like the snowy buds o roses in July Presently she hovered like a fluttering leaf or flake of snow Pride and self disgust served her like first aid surgeons on the battlefield Proud as the proudest of church dignitaries Pure as a wild flower Pure as the azure above them Pure as the naked heavens Pure as the snowy leaves that fold over the flower s heart Purple crimson and scarlet like the curtains of God s tabernacle Put on gravity like a robe Q Quaking and quivering like a short haired puppy after a ducking Questions and answers sounding like a continuous popping of corks Quiet as a nun s face Quietly as a cloud he stole Quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water Quivering like an eager race horse to start R Rage rage ye tears that never more should creep like hounds about God s footstool Ran like a young fawn Rattle in the ear like a flourish of trumpets Rays springing from the east like golden arrows Red as the print of a kiss might be Redolent with the homely scent of old fashioned herbs and flowers Reflected each in the other like stars in a lake Refreshed like dusty grass after a shower Refreshing as descending rains to sunburnt climes Remote as the hidden star Restless as a blue bottle fly on a warm summer s day Revealed his doings like those of bees in a glass hive Rich as the dawn Ride like the wind through the night Rivers that like silver threads ran through the green and gold of pasture lands Roared like mountain torrents Rolling it under the tongue as a sweet morsel Round my chair the children run like little things of dancing gold Ruddy as sunrise Ruddy his face as the morning light Ruffling out his cravat with a crackle of starch like a turkey when it spreads its feathers Running to and fro like frightened sheep Rushing and hurrying about like a June bug S Sanctuaries where the passions may like wild falcons cover their faces with their wings Sayings that stir the blood like the sound of a trumpet Scattered love as stars do light Sea gulls flying like flakes of the sea Sentences level and straight like a hurled lance Shadowy faces known in dreams pass as petals upon a stream Shake like an aspen leaf Shaken off like a nightmare Shapeless as a sack of wool Shattered like so much glass She brightened like a child whose broken toy is glued together She could summon tears as one summons servants She danced like a flower in the wind She disclaimed the weariness that dragged upon her spirits like leaden weights She exuded a faint and intoxicating perfume of womanliness like a crushed herb She felt like an unrepentant criminal She fled like a spirit from the room She flounders like a huge conger eel in an ocean of dingy morality She gave him a surprised look like a child catching an older person in a foolish statement She gave off antipathies as a liquid gives off vapor She has great eyes like the doe She heard him like one in a dream She let the soft waves of her deep hair fall like flowers from Paradise She looked like a tall golden candle She looked like the picture of a young rapt saint lost in heavenly musing She moved like mirth incarnate She nestles like a dove She played with a hundred possibilities fitfully and discursively as a musician runs his fingers over a key board She played with grave cabinets as a cat plays with a mouse She saw this planet like a star hung in the glistening depths of even She seemed as happy as a wave that dances on the sea She shall be sportive as the fawn She stood silent a moment dropping before him like a broken branch She that passed had lips like pinks She walked like a galley slave She walks in beauty like the night She was as brilliant and as hard too as electric light She was silent standing before him like a little statuesque figure Shining like the dewy star of dawn Shivering pine trees like phantoms Showy as damask rose and shy as musk Shrill as the loon s call Shrivel like paper thrust into a flame Shy as the squirrel Sights seen as a traveling swallow might see them on the wing Silence deep as death Silence now is brooding like a gentle spirit o er the still and pulseless world Silence that seemed heavy and dark like a passing cloud Sinks clamorous like mill waters at wild play Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne Skies as clear as babies eyes Sleek and thick and yellow as gold Slender and thin as a slender wire Slowly as a tortoise Slowly as the finger of a clock her shadow came Slowly moved off and disappeared like shapes breathed on a mirror and melting away Slowly unnoted like the creeping rust that spreads insidious had estrangement come Small as a grain of mustard seed Smooth as a pond Smooth as the pillar flashing in the sun Snug as a bug in a rug Soaring as swift as smoke from a volcano springs So elusive that the memory of it afterwards was wont to come and go like a flash of light So my spirit beat itself like a caged bird against its prison bars in vain Soft as a zephyr Soft as sleep the snow fell Soft as Spring Soft as the down of the turtle dove Soft as the landscape of a dream Soft as the south wind Soft in their color as gray pearls Soft vibrations of verbal melody like the sound of a golden bell rung far down under the humming waters Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past as though driven to their land of shadows by shuddering fear Some minds are like an open fire how direct and instant our communication with them Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor Something resistant and inert like the obstinate rolling over of a heavy sleeper after he has been called to get up Something sharp and brilliant like the glitter of a sword or a forked flash of lightning Sorrowful eyes like those of wearied kine spent from the plowing kine cows Spread like wildfire Squirrel in the cage kind of movement Stamping like a plowman to shuffle off the snow Stared about like calves in a pen Steadfast as the soul of truth Steals lingering like a river smooth Still as death Stood like a wave beaten rock Straight as a ray of light Straight as an arrow Streamed like a meteor through the troubled air Streamed o er his memory like a forest flame Streaming tears like pearl drops from a flint Striking with the force of an engine of destruction Strong as a bison Style comes if at all like the bloom upon fruit or the glow of health upon the cheek Subtle as jealousy Sudden a thought came like a full blown rose flushing his brow Sudden sprays of rain like volleys of sharp arrows rattled gustily against the windows Suddenly like death the truth flashed on them Sunbeams flashing on the face of things like sudden smilings of divine delight Sunday mornings which seem to put on like a Sabbath garment an atmosphere of divine quietude Supple and sweet as a rose in bloom Sway like blown moths against the rosewhite flame Sweet as a summer night without a breath Sweet as music she spoke Sweet as the rain at noon Sweet as the smile of a fairy Swift as a swallow heading south Swift as lightning Swift as the panther in triumph Swifter than the twinkling of an eye T Talking and thinking became to him like the open page of a monthly magazine Tall lance like reeds wave sadly o er his head That like a wounded snake drags its slow length along The anemone that weeps at day break like a silly girl before her lover The army blazed and glowed in the golden sunlight like a mosaic of a hundred thousand jewels The army like a witch s caldron seethed The beating of her heart was like a drum The beauty of her quiet life was like a rose in blowing The billows burst like cannon down the coast The birds swam the flood of air like tiny ships The boat cuts its swift way through little waves like molten gold and opal The boom of the surf grew ever less sonorous like the thunder of a retreating storm The breast plate of righteousness The breathless hours like phantoms stole away The breeze is as a pleasant tune The calm white brow as calm as earliest morn The camp fire reddens like angry skies The chambers of the house were haunted by an incessant echoing like some dripping cavern The church swarmed like a hive The city is all in a turmoil it boils like a pot of lentils The clouds that move like spirits o er the welkin clear welkin sky The clustered apples burnt like flame The colored bulbs swung noon like from tree and shrub The crimson close of day The curl d moon was like a little feather The curling wreaths like turbans seem The dark hours are swept away like crumbling ashes The dark mass of her hair shook round her like a sea The dawn is rising from the sea like a white lady from her bed The dawn had whitened in the mist like a dead face The dawn with silver sandaled feet crept like a frightened girl The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way The day was sweeter than honey and the honey comb The day have trampled me like armed men The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans The deep like one black maelstrom round her whirls The deepening east like a scarlet poppy burnt The desolate rocky hills rolled like a solid wave along the horizon The dome of heaven is like one drop of dew The dreams of poets come like music heard at evening from the depth of some enchanted forest The eagerness faded from his eyes leaving them cold as a winter sky after sunset The earth was like a frying pan or some such hissing matter The eternal sea which like a childless mother still must croon her ancient sorrows to the cold white moon The evening sky was as green as jade The excitement had spread through the whole house like a piquant and agreeable odor The excitement of the thought buoyed his high strung temperament like a tonic The feathery meadows like a lilac sea The firm body like a slope of snow The first whiff of reality dissipated them like smoke The floor newly waxed gleamed in the candle light like beaten moonbeams The fragrant clouds of hair they flowed round him like a snare The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn The gesture was all strength and will like the stretching of a sea bird s wings The girl s voice rang like a bird call through his rustling fancies The glimmer of tall flowers standing like pensive moon worshipers in an ecstasy of prayerless bloom The guides sniffed like chamois the air chamois extremely agile goat antelope The heavens are like a scroll unfurled The hills across the valley were purple as thunder clouds The hoofs of the horses rang like the dumb cadence of an old saga The hours crawled by like years The hum of the camp sounds like the sea The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings The impalpable presence of the new century rose like a vast empty house through which no human feet had walked The inexorable facts closed in on him like prison warders hand cuffing a convict The lake glimmered as still as a mirror The land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell The land was like a dream The level boughs like bars of iron across the setting sun The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn The lights blazed up like day The lilies were drooping white and wan like the head and skin of a dying man The mellowing hand of time The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly like a haunting perfume of pressed flowers The Milky Way lay like diamond dust upon the robe of some great king The monk s face whitened like sea foam The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth The moon on the tower slept soft as snow The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud The moonlight lay like snow The moonlight like a fairy mist upon the mesa spreads The mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down The mountain shadows mingling lay like pools above the earth The mountains loomed up dimly like phantoms through the mist The music almost died away then it burst like a pent up flood The name that cuts into my soul like a knife The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet The night like a battle broken host is driven before The night yawned like a foul wind The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves like aged dogs wondering why no one takes them for a walk The old infamy will pop into daylight like a toad out of fissure in the rock The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven The phrase was like a spear thrust The pine trees waved as waves a woman s hair The place was like some enchanted town of palaces The plains to northward change their color like the shimmering necks of doves The poppy burned like a crimson ember The prime of man has waxed like cedars The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds like a shipload of monkeys in a storm The purple heather rolls like dumb thunder The rainbows flashed like fire The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life like a spirited boy before the face of inscrutable nature The roofs with their gables like hoods The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk The satire of the word cut like a knife The scullion with face shining like his pans The sea reeled round like a wine vat splashing The sea song of the trampling waves is as muffled bells The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor The sea that gleamed still like a myriad petaled rose The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected The setting of the sun is like a word of peace The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears The ships like sheeted phantoms coming and going The silence seemed to crush to earth like a great looking glass and shiver into a million pieces The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world The sky burned like a heated opal The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel The sky was as a shield that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun The sky was clear and blue and the air as soft as milk The sky was like a peach The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life The sound is like a noon day gale The sound is like a silver fountain that springeth in a golden basin The sound of a thousand tears like softly pattering wings The sound of your running feet that like the sea hoofs beat The spear tongued lightning slipped like a snake The Spring breaks like a bird The stacks of corn in brown array like tattered wigwams on the plain The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below The stars lay on the lapis lazuli sky like white flower petals on still deep water lapis lazuli opaque to translucent blue violet blue or greenish blue gemstone The stars pale and silent as a seer The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses suddenly gave way like snow melting in the spring The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought The sun like a great dragon writhes in gold The sun on the sea wave lies white as the moon The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy flinging itself upon the shore The terrible past lay afar like a dream left behind in the night The tide was in the salt weed and like a knife it tore The time gliding like a dream The torrent from the hills leaped down their rocky stairways like wild steeds The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows The veiled future bowed before me like a vision of promise The velvet grass that is like padding to earth s meager ribs The villa dips its foot in the lake smiling at its reflection like a bather lingering on the brink The voice of Fate crying like some old Bellman through the world The voice that rang in the night like a bugle call The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind The waves were rolling in long and lazy like sea worn travelers The whole truth naked cold and fatal as a patriot s blade The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white winged geese The wind comes and it draws its length along like the genii from the earthen pot The wine flows like blood The woman seemed like a thing of stone The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell The words of the wise fall like the tolling of sweet grave bells upon the soul The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria The world is bitter as a tear The world is in a simmer like a sea The world wavers within its circle like a dream The years stretched before her like some vast blank page out to receive the record of her toil The years vanished like a May snowdrift The yellow apples glowed like fire Their glances met like crossed swords Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart Their minds rested upon the thought as chasing butterflies might rest together on a flower Their music frightful as the serpent s hiss Their touch affrights me as a serpent s sting Then fall unheeded like the faded flower Then felt I like some watcher of the skies Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies like a full orchestra playing under the sea Then the lover sighing like furnace Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms There is an air about you like the air that folds a star There like a bird it sits and sings There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence of a Father watching His myriad children at play There she soars like a seraph There she stood straight as a lily on its stem There slowly rose to sight a country like a dragon fast asleep There streamed into the air the sweet smell of crushed grass as though many fields had been pressed between giant s fingers and so had been left These eyes like stars have led me These final words snapped like a whip lash These thoughts pierced me like thorns They are as cruel as creeping tigers They are as white foam on the swept sands They are as white swans in the dusk thy white hands They are painted sharp as death They broke into pieces and fell on the ground like a silvery shimmering shower of hail They dropped like panthers They fly like spray They had hands like claws They had slipped away like visions They have as many principles as a fish has bones They have faces like flowers They hurried down like plovers that have heard the call plovers wading birds They look like rose buds filled with snow They seem like swarming flies the crowd of little men They seemed like floating flowers They shine as sweet as simple doves They stand like solitary mountain forms on some hard perfectly transparent day They vanished like the shapes that float upon a summer s dream Thick as wind blown leaves innumerable Thickly the flakes drive past each like a childish ghost Thine eyes like two twin stars shining This life is like a bubble blown up in the air This love that dwells like moonlight in your face This thought is as death This tower rose in the sunset like a prayer Those ancestral themes past which so many generations have slept like sea going winds over pastures Those death like eyes unconscious of the sun Those eyelids folded like a white rose leaf Those eyes like bridal beacons shine Thou art to me but as a wave of the wild sea Thou as heaven art fair and young Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea Thou must wither like a rose Thou shalt be as free as mountain winds Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood Though bright as silver the meridian beams shine Though thou be black as night Thoughts vague as the fitful breeze Three cornered notes fly about like butterflies Through the forest like a fairy dream through some dark mind the ferns in branching beauty stream Through the moonlit trees like ghosts of sounds haunting the moonlight stole the faint tinkle of a guitar Through the riot of his senses like a silver blaze ran the legend Thy beauty like a beast it bites Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot Thy carven columns must have grown by magic like a dream in stone Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame Thy name will be as honey on men s lips Till death like sleep might steal on me Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven Time drops in decay like a candle burnt out Time like a pulse shakes fierce To drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play Transitory as clouds without substance Transparent like a shining sun Tree and shrub altered their values and became transmuted to silver sentinels Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag s antlers Trembling like an aspen leaf Truths which forever shine as fixed stars Turning easily and securely as on a perfect axle U Unbends like a loosened bow Unbreakable as iron Unconscious as an oak tree of its growth Under the willow tree glimmered her face like a foam flake drifting over the sea Unheralded like some tornado loosed out of the brooding hills it came to pass Unknown like a seed in fallow ground was the germ of a plan Unmoving as a tombstone Untameable as flies Unutterable things pressing on my soul like a pent up storm craving for outlet Upcast like foam of the effacing tide Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings Uplifting their stony peaks around us like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress Urgent as the seas Uttering wild cries like a creature in pain V Vague as a dream Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind like long sad vapors through the twilight sky Vanish into thin air like ghosts at the cockcrow Vanished like snow when comes a thaw Vanished like vapor before the sun Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave W Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale Wearing their wounds like stars Weary wind who wanderest like the world s rejected guest When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle guttering To melt through the side of the hollow in a candle formed by a burning wick to burn low and unsteadily flicker When arm in arm they both came swiftly running like a pair of turtle doves that could not live asunder day or night When cards invitations and three corn d notes fly about like white butterflies When she died her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole When the fever pierced me like a knife Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon Where heroes die as leaves fall Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on like a mill Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds o er a tender sky Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers White as a ghost from darkness White as chalk White as dove or lily or spirit of the light White as the driven snow White as the moon s white flame White as the sea bird s wing White clouds like daisies White hands she moves like swimming swans White hands through her hair like white doves going into the shadow of a wood White like flame White sails of sloops like specters Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods Whose little eyes glow like the sparks of fire Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new born age Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter Winged like an arrow to its mark With a sting like a scorpion With all the complacency of a homeless cat With an angry broken roar like billows on an unseen shore their fury burst With hate darkling as the swift winter hail With music sweet as love With sounds like breakers With strength like steel With the whisper of leaves in one s ear With words like honey melting from the comb Wits as sharp as gimlets gimlet small hand tool for boring holes Women with tongues like polar needles Words as fresh as spring verdure verdure lush greenness of flourishing vegetation Words as soft as rain Words like the gossamer film of the summer Words sweet as honey from his lips distill d Words were flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead Wordsworth thy music like a river rolls Worthless like the conjurer s gold Wrangle over details like a grasping pawnbroker Wrinkled and scored like a dried apple Writhing with an intensity that burnt like a steady flame Y Yielding like melted snow Yonder flimsy crescent bent like an archer s bow above the snowy summit You are as gloomy to night as an undertaker out of employment You are as hard as stone You gave me such chill embraces as the snow covered heights receive from clouds Your blood is red like wine Your charms lay like metals in a mine Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake Your eyes as blue as violets Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day Your frail fancies are swallowed up like chance flowers flung upon the river s current Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise Your heart is as dry as a reed Your locks are

this interesting discussion I am sorry to say it is impossible I am speaking plainly I am still a little of an idealist I am suppressing many of the details I am sure it sounds very strange to you I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment I am sure you will hear me out I am surprised I confess I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner I am vastly obliged to you I am vastly your debtor for the information I am very far from being a fanatic I am very glad of this opportunity I am very grateful very much flattered I am wholly in agreement with you I am willing to accept all the

most painful to me I assure you my knowledge of it is limited I bear no malice about that I beg your indulgence I beg your pardon but you take it too seriously I brazenly confess it I can easily

to make a jest of what I m going to say I cannot say definitely at the moment I cannot say that in fact it is always so I cannot see how you draw that conclusion I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration I compliment you on your good sense I confess I find it difficult I could ask for nothing better I could never forgive myself for that I dare say your intuition is quite right I decline to commit myself beforehand I detest exaggeration I didn t mean that exactly I do not comprehend your meaning I don t deny that it is interesting I don t doubt it for a moment I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments I do not exactly understand you I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views I don t feel that it is my business I do not find it an unpleasant subject I don t insist on your believing me I don t justify my presumption I don t know quite why you should say that I don t know that I can do that I don t know when I have heard anything so lamentable I don t know why you should be displeased I don t make myself clear I see I don t pretend to explain I don t see anything particularly wonderful in it I don t underrate his kindness I don t want to disguise that

impressions I give my word gladly I give you my most sacred word of honor I had better begin at the beginning I had no intention of being offensive I hadn t thought of it in that light I hardly think that could be so I have a hundred reasons for thinking so I have a peculiar affection for it I have an immense faith in him I have been constrained by circumstances I have been decidedly impressed I have been longing to see more of you I have been puzzling over a dilemma I have every reason to think so I have given you the best proof of it I have gone back to my first impressions I have known striking instances of the kind I have never heard it put so well I have no delusions on that score I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that I have not the influence you think I have not the

again I hope you will forgive an intruder I hope you will not think me irreverent I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness I indulge the modest hope I know it is very presumptuous I know my request will appear singular I like it immensely I like your frankness I make no reflection whatever I mean it literally I might question all that I mistrust these wild impulses I most certainly agree with you I most humbly ask pardon I must add my congratulations on your taste I must apologize for intruding upon you I must ask you one more question if I may I must confess I have never thought of that I must refrain from any comment I must respectfully decline to tell you I must take this opportunity to tell you I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility I never heard anything so absurd I offer my humblest apologies I owe the idea wholly to you I partly agree with you I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness I place myself entirely at your service I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense I prefer to reserve my judgment I purposely evaded the question I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it I quite see what the advantages are I really am curious to know how you guessed that I realize how painful it must be to you I recollect it clearly I rely on your good sense I remember the occasion perfectly I resent that kind of thing I respect you for that I respect your critical faculty I say it in all modesty I see disapproval in your face I see it from a different angle I see you are an enthusiast I see your point of view I seem to have heard that sentiment before I shall at once proceed to forget it I shall await your pleasure I shall be glad if you will join me I shall be interested to watch it develop I shall be most proud and pleased I shall certainly take you at your word I shall feel highly honored I shall make a point of thinking so I shall never forget your kindness I shall respect your confidence I should appreciate your confidence greatly I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise I should like your opinion of it I should not dream of asking you to do so I should think it very unlikely I simply cannot endure it I spoke only in jest I stand corrected I suppose I ought to feel flattered I surmised as much I sympathize deeply with you I take that for granted I think extremely well of it I think he has very noble ideals I think I can answer that for you I think I know what you are going to say I think it has its charm I think it is superb I think it quite admirable I think its tone is remarkably temperate I think that is rather a brilliant idea I think what you say is reasonable I think you are quibbling I think you are rather severe in your opinions I think you have great appreciation of values I think you have summed it up perfectly I think your candor is charming I thoroughly agree with you I thought it most amusing I thought you were seriously indisposed I trust you will not consider it an impertinence I understand exactly how you feel about it I understand your delicacy of feeling I venture to propose another plan I very rarely allow myself that pleasure I want to have a frank understanding with you I was at a loss to understand the reason for it I was hoping that I could persuade you I was on the point of asking you I was speaking generally I watched you with admiration I will answer you frankly I will listen to no protestations I will take it only under compulsion I will tell you what puzzles me I will think of it since you wish it I will with great pleasure I wish I could explain my point more fully I wish I knew what you meant by that I wish to be perfectly fair I wish to put things as plainly as possible I wonder how much truth there is in it I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me I would agree if I understood I wouldn t put it just that way If ever I can repay it command me If I mistake not you were there once If I speak strongly it is because I feel strongly If I were disposed to offer counsel If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning If you don t mind my saying so If you insist upon it If you will pardon me the frankness In a manner that sometimes terrifies me In one respect you are quite right In that case let me rob you of a few minutes In what case for example

1379_130517_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Most dangerous

1379_130517_000104_000000	train-clean-360	Still you might make an exception

rather awkward That is really good of you That is the prevailing idea That is tragic That is true and I think you are right That is very amiable in you That is very curious That is very felicitous That is very gracious That is what I call intelligent criticism That is what I meant to tell you That is a humiliating thought That is a most interesting idea That is such a hideous idea That is the

judgment That theory isn t tenable That was exceedingly generous That was intended ironically That was very thoughtful of you That was very well reasoned That will blast your chances I am afraid That will suit me excellently That would be somewhat serious That would be very discreditable The agreement seems to be ideal The idea is monstrous The inference is obvious The notion is rather new to me The pleasure is certainly not all on your side The reason is not so far to seek The same problem has perplexed me The sentiment is worthy of you The simplest thing in the world The situation is uncommonly delicate The story seems to me incredible The subject is extremely interesting The tone of it was certainly hostile The very obvious moral is this The whole thing is an idle fancy Then I have your permission Then you re really not disinclined Then you merely want to ask my advice There are endless difficulties There are reasons which make such a course impossible There is a good deal of sense in that There is a grain of truth in that I admit There is food for reflection in that There is my hand on it There is no resisting you There is nothing I should like so much There is one

words will suffice to answer A further objection is A great many people have said A little indulgence may be due to those A majority of us believe A man in my situation has A more plausible objection is found A proof of this is A servile mind can never know A short time since A specific answer can be given A thought occurred to me Able men have reasoned out Above all things let us not forget Absolutely true it is Abundant reason is there Accordingly by reason of this circumstance Add this instance to After a careful study of all the evidence After full deliberation After reminding the hearer After this it remains only to say Again can we doubt Again I ask the gentleman Again in this view Again it is quite clear that Again it is urged Again let us compare Again very numerous are the cases Again we have abundant instances Against all this concurring testimony All confess this to be true All I ask is All of us know All that I will say now All the facts which support this All the signs of the time indicate All these things you know All this being considered All this is historical fact All this is very well All this suggests All this we take for granted Allow me for a moment to turn to Allow me to tell a story Altho I say it to myself Amazing as it may seem Am I mistaken in this Among many examples Among the distinguished guests who honor Among the problems that confront us An answer to this is now ready An argument has often been put forward An example or two will illustrate An indescribably touching incident An opinion has now become established And again it is said And again it is to be presumed And coming nearer to our own day And did a man try to persuade me And do you really think And everybody here knows And for myself as I said And further all that I have said And hence the well known doctrine And here again when I speak And here allow me to call your attention And here I am led to observe And here I come to the closing evidence And here I have an opportunity And here I reproach And here 
1383_130533_000162_000000	train-clean-360	I wish you to observe
none	none	 And here let me define my position And here let me give my explanation And here let us recall to mind And how is it possible to imagine And I am bound to say And I beg of you And I call on you And I might say this And I refuse assent And I rejoice to know And I say it were better for you And I should in like manner repudiate And I speak with reverence And I submit to you And I trust that you will consider And I will make a practical suggestion And I will tell you why And I would moreover submit And if a man could anywhere be found And if any of you should question And if I know anything of my countrymen And if I may presume to speak And if I take another instance And if this be true And if you come to a decision And if you think it your duty And in conclusion And in like manner And in order to see this And in thus speaking I am not denying And is not this lamentable And is there not a presumption And it happens And it is certainly true And it is doubtful if And it is not difficult to see And it is not plain And it is one of the evidences And it is precisely in this And it is strikingly suggested to us And it is undeniable I say And it is well that this should be so And last of all And lest anyone should marvel And let it be observed And lo and behold And more than this And next I would ask And now allow me to call attention And now behold a mystery And now consider And now having discussed And now I beg that I may be permitted And now I go back to the statement And now I have completed my review And now I have said enough to explain And now I must touch upon one point And now if I may take for granted And now it would be very pleasant for me And now observe how And now sir what I had first to say And now supposing this point to be settled And now that I have mentioned And now the chief points of it And now the question is asked me And now to close let me give you And now to what purpose do I mention And of course you are aware And of this I am perfectly certain And quite as difficult is it to create And right here lies the cause And sir a word And so again as regard And so I am reminded of a story And so I leave these words with you And so I may point out And so I might recount to you And so in the other cases I have named And so in the present case And so on And so through all phases And so upon every hand And sometimes it will be difficult And that gave another distorted view And the reason is very obvious And the same holds good And then again And then hastily to conclude And then I may be reminded And then there is another thought And then when it is said And there are reasons why And there is also this view And therefore am I truly glad And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted And therefore it is not without regret And this brings me to the last thing And this is really the sense And this leads me to say a word And thus consistently And thus it is conceivable And thus it seems to me And thus we are led on then to further question And to all this must be added And to return to the topic And to this conclusion you must come And unquestionably And we are brought to the same conclusion And what do you suppose will be And when I have shown to you And when I recall that event And when we pass beyond the bounds of And where let me ask And why should I insist And will you still insist And with these thoughts come others And yet I can not but reflect And yet I feel justified in believing And yet I think we all feel And yet let me say to you And yet one more quotation And yet this notion is I conceive And yet though this be true And yet we ought if we are wise And you may also remember this Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty Another consideration which I shall adduce adduce cite as an example Another instance of signal success Another of these presumptions Another point is made as clear as crystal Another reason of a kindred nature Another reflection which occurs to me Another sign of our times Another signal advantage Another striking instance Answers doubtless may be given Are there not many of us Are we content to believe Are we forever to deprive ourselves Are we not startled into astonishment Are we satisfied to assume As a general rule I hold As a last illustration As a matter of fact As a proof of this As an illustration of this truth As briefly as I may As far as my limits allow As far as this is true As far as this objection relates As far as we know As for the rest As I have now replied to As I look around on this assembly As I rise to respond to the sentiment As I understand this matter As memory scans the past As society is now constituted As some one has well said As the foregoing instances have shown As to the particular instance before us As well might we compare As we shall see in a few moments Assuredly it is this At the outset of this inquiry At the risk of digression At the same time I candidly state At the utmost we can say At this juncture At this solemn moment Away then with the notion B Be assured then Be confident therefore Be it so Be not deceived Be sure that in spite of Be these things as they may Be your interests what they may be Bear with me for a few moments Bearing on this point Before attempting to answer this question Before going further Before I close I will particularly remark Before I come to the special matter Before I proceed to compare Being fully of the opinion Being persuaded then Believing as I do Beyond all question we Bidden by your invitation to a discussion Broadly speaking But above all things let us But after all I think no one can say But again when we carefully consider But am I wrong in saying But apart from the fact But besides these special facts But can this question But depend upon it But despite all this But do not let us depend But do you imagine But doubts here arise But even admitting these possibilities But everyone who deserves But first of all remark I beg you But further I shall now demonstrate But gentlemen I must be done But grave problems confront us But here I am discussing But here let me say But how can we pass over But how shall I describe my emotions But however that may be But I am bound to say But I am certain from my own experience But I am very sorry to say But I am willing enough to admit But I can at least say But I can not conceive But I can promise But I cherish the hope But I confess that I should be glad But I digress But I do not propose all these things But I do say this But I have been insisting simply But I have heard it argued But I have no fear of the future But I leave this train of thought But I may be permitted to speak But I may say in conclusion But I need hardly assert But I pass that over But I propose to speak to you But I repeat But I resist the temptation But I return to the question But I shall go still further But I simply ask But I submit the whole subject But I trust that you will all admit But I venture to assure you But I will allude But I will not further impress any idea But I would earnestly impress upon you But if I may even flatter myself But if I seek for illustrations But if you want more evidence But if you wish to know But in making this assertion But in my opinion there is no need But in the course of time But is it quite possible to hold But is this any reason why But it does not follow from this But it happens very fortunately But it has been suggested to me But it is a fact But it is impossible for one But it is necessary to explain But it is no use protesting But it is not fair to assert But it is not my intention But it is not necessary to suppose But it is not possible to believe But it is not really so But it is otherwise with But it is sometimes said But it may be doubted whether But it may happen that I forgot But it will be a misfortune But it will naturally be asked But it will perhaps be argued But it would be vain to attempt But let me ask you to glance But let me before closing refer But let none of you think But let us also keep ever in mind But let us look a little further But lo all of a sudden But mark this But more than all things else But my allotted time is running away But my answer to this objection But my friends pause for a moment But never was a grosser wrong But not for one moment But notwithstanding all this But now look at the effect But now take notice of But on the other hand But on what ground are we But passing these by But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly But perhaps you are not yet weary But putting these questions aside But quite contrary to this you will find But recollect I pray you how But sir it is manifest But some other things are to be noted But some will ask me But sooner or later But still I repeat But suppose the fact But surely you can not say But that I may not divert you from But that is not all But that must be always the impression But the fact is But the final value But the greatest proof of all But the most formidable problem But the necessity of the case But the question may arise But then let us ask ourselves But there is another duty imposed But there is much more than this But this I do not hesitate to say But this I fearlessly affirm But this I know But this is a circuitous argument But this is no place for controversy But this is not all But this is what I mean But this much I affirm as true But this warns me But this we may put aside But to go still further But to say the truth But we are met with the assertion But we are to recollect But we ask perhaps But we may depend upon it But we think it is not wise But we want something more for explanation But what a blunder would be yours But what is the fact But what we must needs guard against But when it is declared But when we look a little deeper But while it may be admitted But who has not seen But why do I numerate these details But with these exceptions But yet nothing can be more splendid But you should know By no means By the way I have not mentioned By this time it will be suspected C Can it be supposed Can the long records of humanity teach us Can there be a better illustration Can we pretend Can you lightly contemplate Can you yield yourselves Cautious and practical thinkers ask Certain it is Certainly I am not blind to the faults Certainly one can conceive Clearly enough Coming back to the main subject Coming down to modern times Coming to present circumstances Common sense indicates Consequently I am not discussing this matter Consider I beg you what

believing Do not imagine Do not let us conceal from ourselves Do not suppose for a moment Do not talk to me of Do not think me guilty of Do we not know Do what you will Do you ask how that can be Do you believe this can be truthfully said Do you not know I am speaking of Do you remember a concrete instance Do you think then Does any man say Does it ever occur to you Does it not seem something

forcibly reminded I am resolved not to permit I am sensible sir I am simply endeavoring to show I am so surrounded on every hand I am sometimes inclined to think I am somewhat relieved to know I am sorry to say I am suggesting the reason why I am sure at any rate I am sure every impartial man will agree I am sure I feel no hostility I am sure that I echo the sentiment I am sure this generous audience will pardon me I am sure you all hope I am sure you feel the truth I am sure you will acquit me I am sure you will be kind enough I am sure you will do me the justice I am sure you will not be surprised I am surely not here to assert I am tempted further to offer to you I am thankful for the privilege I am thoroughly convinced I am to speak to you this evening I am to urge the interest of I am told occasionally I am told on authority I am too well aware of the difficulties I am totally at a loss to conceive I am trespassing too long on your time I am unable to understand I am unconscious of intentional error I am under a very great obligation I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude I am under the impression I am unwillingly bound to add I am uttering no paradox when I say I am very far from thinking I am very glad to have the honor I am very happy to be here I am very much in the condition of I am very sure that if you ponder I am very sure you will believe I am well aware I am willing to know I anticipate with pleasing expectation I appeal in the first place I appeal to any man to say I appeal to the better judgment I appreciate the significance I argue this cause I ask again I ask no greater blessing I ask permission to speak to you I ask the attention I ask the audience I ask the audience to return with me I ask this of you I ask you calmly and dispassionately I ask you gentlemen do you think I ask you if it is possible I ask you if you please to rise and give the toast I ask you in all candor I ask you now to follow me I ask you to consider I ask you to join me in drinking a toast I ask you to pledge with me I ask your attention I ask your indulgence I assert sir that it is I assure myself I assure you of my own personal knowledge I attribute it to I avail myself of the opportunity I beg again to thank you for the honor I beg all to remember I beg and implore of you I beg emphatically to say I beg leave to make some observations I beg of you to remember I beg to tender my most fervent wishes I beg you not to mistake my meaning I beg you to accept my grateful expression I begin by observing I begin with expressing a sentiment I believe from my own personal experience I believe I can speak for all I believe I shall make it clear to you I believe I voice the sentiment I believe it to be the simple truth I believe most profoundly I believe that I am within the mark I believe that in this instance I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome I bow with you in reverent commemoration I call on you to answer I call to mind how I can by no calculation justify I call hardly conceive I can make allowance for I can most truthfully assure you I call never sufficiently express my gratitude I can not allow myself to believe I can not avoid confessing I can not be content with I can not believe I will not believe I can not better illustrate this argument I can not better sum up I can not boast of I can not bound my vision I can not but reflect I can not but see what mischief I can not charge myself with I can not close without giving expression I can not conceive a greater honor I can not feel any doubt myself I can not forbear from offering I can not give you a better illustration I can not help expressing a wish I can not help speaking urgently I can not here go into details I can not hesitate to say I can not hope adequately to respond I can not justly be responsible because I can not let this opportunity pass I can not persuade myself I can not prevail on myself I can not refrain from saying for myself I can not resist the train of thought I can not say how glad I am I can not say with confidence I can not stop to give in detail I can not sufficiently thank you I can not take back my word I can not take it for granted I can not thank you enough I can not well avoid saying I can only congratulate you I can only hope for indulgence I can readily understand I can scarcely concede anything more important I can scarcely find fitting words I can strongly recommend I can understand moreover I can with propriety speak here I certainly have not so good an opinion I challenge any man I cheerfully own I cheerfully submit myself I claim a share also for I class them altogether under the head I close with the words I close with this sentiment I come at length to I come next to the question of I come to the other assumption I conceive this to be I confess I feel not the least alarmed I confess I have had my doubts I confess I have little sympathy I confess it affects me very deeply to I confess it is very difficult to I confess that I do not entirely approve I confess that it is a comfort to me I confess that my notions are widely different I confess to a little embarrassment I confess to you that I have no fear I confine myself to saying I congratulate you upon the auspicious character I consider I have said enough in proof I consider it amply explains I contend I content myself with pursuing I could do no less than I could easily mention I could enlarge upon it I could never understand I could wish that this belief I dare say you know I dare venture the remark I declare to you I deem it both necessary and just I deem it proper here to remind I deem myself honored I deny once and for all I deny the inference I desire to be brief I desire to bear my testimony I desire to call attention I desire to know I desire to lay emphatic stress I dissent from the opinion I distrust all general theories of I do again and again urge upon you

none	none	 I have already alluded to I have already shown the ground of my hope 
1379_130530_000023_000000	train-clean-360	I have already stated and now repeat
1379_130530_000024_000000	train-clean-360	I have always been under the impression
none	none	 I have always listened with the greatest satisfaction I have always maintained I have another objection I have another observation to add 
1379_130530_000029_000000	train-clean-360	I have anticipated the objection
none	none	 I have assumed throughout 
1379_130530_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I have attempted thus hastily
1379_130530_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I have barely touched some of the points
none	none	 I have been allowed the privilege 
1379_130530_000034_000000	train-clean-360	I have been asked several times
none	none	 I have been extremely anxious I have been given to understand I have been glad to observe I have been heretofore treating I have been insisting then on this I have been interested in hearing I have been pointing out how I have been profoundly moved 
1379_130530_000043_000000	train-clean-360	I have been requested to say a word
1379_130530_000044_000000	train-clean-360	I have been told by an eminent authority
none	none	 I have been too long accustomed to hear I have been touched by the large generosity 
1379_130530_000047_000000	train-clean-360	I have been trying to show
1379_130530_000048_000000	train-clean-360	I have before me the statistics
1379_130530_000049_000000	train-clean-360	I have but one more word to add
1379_130530_000050_000000	train-clean-360	I have demonstrated to you
1379_130530_000051_000000	train-clean-360	I have depicted
none	none	 I have endeavored to emphasize I have enlarged on this subject 
1379_130530_000054_000000	train-clean-360	I have felt it almost a duty to
1379_130530_000055_000000	train-clean-360	I have found great cause for wonder
none	none	 I have frequently been surprised at I have gazed with admiration 
1379_130530_000058_000000	train-clean-360	I have generally observed
1379_130530_000059_000000	train-clean-360	I have gone so far as to suggest
none	none	 I have good reason for I have had steadily in mind I have had the honor I have had to take a long sweep I have heard it objected I have heard with relief and pleasure I have hitherto been adducing instances adduce cite as an example I have hitherto been engaged in showing I have in a measure anticipated I have in my possession I have incidentally dwelt on I have introduced it to suggest I have labored to maintain I have laid much stress upon I have lately observed many strong indications I have listened with the utmost interest I have little hope that I can add anything I have lived to see I have long ago insisted 
1379_130530_000079_000000	train-clean-360	I have long been of the conviction
none	none	 I have never heard it suggested 
1379_130530_000081_000000	train-clean-360	I have never whispered a syllable
none	none	 I have no acquaintance with 
1379_130530_000083_000000	train-clean-360	I have no doubt whatever
none	none	 I have no excuse for intruding I have no fear of myself I have no fears for the success I have no hesitation in asserting I have no intention to moralize I have no particular inclination I have no prejudice on the subject I have no pretention to be regarded I have no reason to think I have no scruple in saying I have no such gloomy forebodings I have no sympathy with the men I have no thought of venturing to say I have no wish at all to preach 
1379_130530_000098_000000	train-clean-360	I have not accustomed myself
none	none	 I have not allowed myself 
1379_130530_000100_000000	train-clean-360	I have not been able to deny

none	none	 I have nothing more to say 
1379_130530_000107_000000	train-clean-360	I have noticed of late years
1379_130530_000108_000000	train-clean-360	I have now explained to you
1379_130530_000109_000000	train-clean-360	I have now made bold to touch upon
1379_130530_000110_000000	train-clean-360	I have now rather more than kept my word
1379_130530_000111_000000	train-clean-360	I have now said all that occurs to me
none	none	 I have often been impressed with 
1379_130530_000113_000000	train-clean-360	I have often been struck with the resemblance
1379_130530_000114_000000	train-clean-360	I have often lingered in fancy
1379_130530_000115_000000	train-clean-360	I have one step farther to go
1379_130530_000116_000000	train-clean-360	I have only partially examined
1379_130530_000117_000000	train-clean-360	I have partly anticipated
none	none	 I have pleasant memories of I have pointed out 
1379_130530_000120_000000	train-clean-360	I have pride and pleasure in quoting
1379_130530_000121_000000	train-clean-360	I have racked this brain of mine
1379_130530_000122_000000	train-clean-360	I have read with great regret
1379_130530_000123_000000	train-clean-360	I have said and I repeat
none	none	 I have said over and over again I have said what I solemnly believe 
1379_130530_000126_000000	train-clean-360	I have scant patience
none	none	 I have seen for myself I have seen it stated in a recent journal I have seen some signs of encouragement I have shown I have some sort of fear I have sometimes asked myself I have sometimes fancied I have sometimes wondered whether 
1379_130530_000135_000000	train-clean-360	I have still two comments to make
none	none	 I have taken pains to know I have the confident hope I have the greatest possible confidence 
1379_130530_000139_000000	train-clean-360	I have the honor to propose
none	none	 I have then to investigate 
1379_130530_000141_000000	train-clean-360	I have thought it incumbent on me
1379_130530_000142_000000	train-clean-360	I have thought it right on this day
none	none	 I have thought it well to suggest I have throughout highly appreciated 
1379_130530_000145_000000	train-clean-360	I have thus been led by my feelings
none	none	 I have thus stated the reason I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy I have to force my imagination 
1379_130530_000149_000000	train-clean-360	I have touched very cursorily
1379_130530_000150_000000	train-clean-360	I have tried to convey to you
1379_130530_000151_000000	train-clean-360	I have undertaken to speak
1379_130530_000152_000000	train-clean-360	I have very much less feeling of
1379_130530_000153_000000	train-clean-360	I have watched with some attention
1379_130530_000154_000000	train-clean-360	I have witnessed the extraordinary
none	none	 I have yet a more cogent reason 
1379_130530_000156_000000	train-clean-360	I have yet to learn
none	none	 I hazard nothing in saying I hear it sometimes said I hear you say to yourselves I heartily feel the singular claims I hesitate to take an instance 
1379_130530_000162_000000	train-clean-360	I hold it to be clearly expedient
none	none	 I hold myself obliged to 
1379_130530_000164_000000	train-clean-360	I hold the maxim no less applicable
none	none	 I hold this to be a truth 
1379_130530_000166_000000	train-clean-360	I hold to the principle
1379_130530_000167_000000	train-clean-360	I hope by this time we are all convinced
none	none	 I hope for our own sakes 
1379_130530_000169_000000	train-clean-360	I hope I have expressed myself explicitly
none	none	 I hope I may be allowed to intimate I hope I shall not be told I hope it is no disparagement I hope most sincerely and truly I hope none who hear me 
1379_130530_000175_000000	train-clean-360	I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes
none	none	 I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate 
1379_130530_000177_000000	train-clean-360	I hope the day may be far distant
1379_130530_000178_000000	train-clean-360	I hope the time may come again
1379_130530_000179_000000	train-clean-360	I hope to be excused if
none	none	 I hope to be forgiven if 
1379_130530_000181_000000	train-clean-360	I hope we may forget
none	none	 I hope you will not accuse me 
1384-130531-0000	train-other-500	I imagine that no one will be disposed I insist upon it I intend to propose I know from experience how I know full well
1384-130531-0001	train-other-500	I know I am treading on thin ice I know it has been questioned I know it is said I know it will be said
none	none	 I know many reasons why 
1384-130531-0002	train-other-500	I know not how else to express I know not in what direction to look I know not of my own knowledge I know not where else to find I know perfectly well
1384-130531-0003	train-other-500	I know that it is impossible for me to I know that this is the feeling I know that what I may say is true I know there are some who think I know there is a theory among us
1384-130531-0004	train-other-500	I know too well I know very well the difference between I know well it is not for me I know well the sentiments I know you are all impatient to hear
1384-130531-0005	train-other-500	I know you will do all in your power I know you will interpret what I say I labor under a degree of prejudice I lately heard it affirmed
1384-130531-0006	train-other-500	I lay it down as a principle I leave history to judge I leave it to you I leave the arduous task I leave to others to speak
1384-130531-0007	train-other-500	I long to speak a word or two I look hopefully to I look in vain I look with encouragement I look with inexpressible dread I look with mingled hope and terror
1384-130531-0008	train-other-500	I make my appeal to I make no extravagant claim I make this abrupt acknowledgment I marvel that I may add speaking for my own part
1384-130531-0009	train-other-500	I may be allowed to make one remark I may be permitted to add I may confess to you I may safely appeal I may say to you calmly
1384-130531-0010	train-other-500	I may seem to have been diffuse I may take as an instance I may venture upon a review I mean by this I mean moreover
1384-130531-0011	train-other-500	I mean something more than that I mention it to you to justify I mention these facts because I mention this not by way of complaint
1384-130531-0012	train-other-500	I might bring you another such case I might deny that I might enter into such detail I might go further I might go on indefinitely
1384-130531-0013	train-other-500	I might go on to illustrate I might of course point first I might reasonably question the justice I might try to explain I might venture to claim
1384-130531-0014	train-other-500	I might well have desired I might well think I must ask an abrupt question I must be careful about what I say I must be contented with
1384-130531-0015	train-other-500	I must be excused if I say I must bow in reverence I must call your attention for a moment I must conclude abruptly I must confess that I became rather alarmed
none	none	 I must consider this as 
1384-130531-0016	train-other-500	I must crave your indulgence I must express to you again I must fairly tell you I must find some fault with I must for want of time omit I must here admit
1384-130531-0017	train-other-500	I must lament I must leave any detailed development I must mention with praise I must not allow myself to indulge I must not for an instant be supposed
1384-130531-0018	train-other-500	I must not overlook I must now beg to ask I must pause a moment to I must proceed I must qualify the statement
1384-130531-0019	train-other-500	I must remind my hearers of I must reply to some observations I must return to the subject I must say that I am one of those I must speak plainly
1384-130531-0020	train-other-500	I must suppose however I must take occasion to say I must thank you once more I must try to describe to you I myself have boundless faith
none	none	 I need not assure this brilliant company I need not dwell 
1384-130531-0021	train-other-500	I need not enter into I need not follow out the application I need not I am certain assure you I need not say how much I thank you
1384-130531-0022	train-other-500	I need not show how inconsistent I need not specially recommend to you I need not wander far in search I need only to observe
1384-130531-0023	train-other-500	I need say nothing in praise I need scarcely observe I need to guard myself right here I neither affirm nor deny I next come to the implicit assumption
1384-130531-0024	train-other-500	I note with particular pleasure I notice it as affording an instance I noticed incidentally the fact I now address you on a question
1384-130531-0025	train-other-500	I now come sir to the second head I now have the pleasure of presenting to you I now pass to the question of I now proceed to inquire I now reiterate
none	none	 I object strongly to the use 
1384-130531-0026	train-other-500	I observe then in the first place I only ask a favorable construction of I only marvel I only wish you to recognize
1384-130531-0027	train-other-500	I open the all important question I ought to give an illustration I own I can not help feeling I particularly allude to I pass on from that
1384-130531-0028	train-other-500	I pass then to our second division I pause for a moment to say I pause to confess once more I pay tribute to I personally know that it is so
1384-130531-0029	train-other-500	I pray God I may never I predict that you will I prefer a practical view I presume I shall have to admit I presume that I shall not be disbelieved
1384-130531-0030	train-other-500	I proceed to another important phase I profess I propose briefly to glance at I propose therefore to consider
none	none	 I protest I never had any doubt 
1384-130531-0031	train-other-500	I purposely have avoided I question whether I quite endorse what has been said I rather look forward to a time I readily grant
none	none	 I really can not think it necessary to 
1384-130531-0032	train-other-500	I really do not know I really thought that you would excuse me I recall another historical fact I recognize the high compliment conveyed
none	none	 I recollect hearing a sagacious remark sagacious sound judgment I refer especially 
1384-130531-0033	train-other-500	I refuse to believe I regard as an erroneous view I regard it as a tribute I regard it as a very great honor I regret that I am not able to remember
1384-130531-0034	train-other-500	I regret that it is not possible for me I regret the time limits me I regret this the less I rejoice in an occasion like this I rejoice that events have occurred
none	none	 I rejoice to think I remark here 
1383_130532_000002_000000	train-clean-360	I remember a reference made
1383_130532_000003_000000	train-clean-360	I remember an intimation
none	none	 I remember full well I remember the enjoyment with which 
1383_130532_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I remember to have heard
1383_130532_000007_000000	train-clean-360	I repeat I am not speaking
none	none	 I repeat my statement in another form 
1383_130532_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I respectfully counsel

1383_130532_000018_000000	train-clean-360	I said a little way back
none	none	 I said it would be well 
1383_130532_000020_000000	train-clean-360	I said that I thought

1383_130532_000023_000000	train-clean-360	I saw an ingenious argument the other day
none	none	 I say frankly I say in moderation 
1383_130532_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I say it is extremely important
1383_130532_000027_000000	train-clean-360	I say it most confidently
1383_130532_000028_000000	train-clean-360	I say no more of these things
none	none	 I say not one syllable against I say then my first point is

1383_130532_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I say without fear of contradiction
1383_130532_000034_000000	train-clean-360	I see around me
none	none	 I see as clearly as any man possibly can I see little hope of 
1383_130532_000037_000000	train-clean-360	I see no exception
none	none	 I see no possibility of

none	none	 I seem to hear you say I seize upon this opportunity I seriously desire 
1383_130532_000043_000000	train-clean-360	I set out with saying

none	none	 I shall address myself to a single point 
1383_130532_000046_000000	train-clean-360	I shall ask you to look very closely

none	none	 I shall presently show I shall proceed without further preface I shall recur to certain questions I shall say all this without entering into 
1383_130532_000080_000000	train-clean-360	I shall show that I am not

none	none	 I shall touch upon one or two questions 
1383_130532_000087_000000	train-clean-360	I shall waste no time in refuting
none	none	 I shall with your sanction I should be false to my own manhood 
1383_130532_000090_000000	train-clean-360	I should be surprised if
1383_130532_000091_000000	train-clean-360	I should be the last man to deny
none	none	 I should fail in my duty if I should find it hard to discover 
1383_130532_000094_000000	train-clean-360	I should have forfeited my own self respect
none	none	 I should like at least to mention I should like to emphasize 
1383_130532_000097_000000	train-clean-360	I should like to go a step farther
1383_130532_000098_000000	train-clean-360	I should like to refer to two events
none	none	 I should like to see that view answered 
1383_130532_000100_000000	train-clean-360	I should like to day to examine briefly
1383_130532_000101_000000	train-clean-360	I should much prefer
1383_130532_000102_000000	train-clean-360	I should not be satisfied with myself
1383_130532_000103_000000	train-clean-360	I should think it too absurd

1383_130532_000105_000000	train-clean-360	I shudder at the doctrine
none	none	 I simply lay my finger on a fact I simply pause here to ask I sincerely regret the absence I sincerely wish it were in my power 
1383_130532_000110_000000	train-clean-360	I solemnly declare
none	none	 I sometimes hear a wish expressed I sorrowfully call to mind I speak forth my sentiment 
1383_130532_000114_000000	train-clean-360	I speak from no little personal observation

none	none	 I submit that in such a case I submit that it is high time I submit this proposition I summon you to do your share I suppose it is right to answer

none	none	 I suppose most men will recollect I suppose that everyone who listens to me 
1383_130532_000136_000000	train-clean-360	I suppose there is no one here
1383_130532_000137_000000	train-clean-360	I suppose we are all of one opinion
none	none	 I suspect that is why we so often I sympathize most heartily 
1383_130532_000140_000000	train-clean-360	I take a broader and bolder position
1383_130532_000141_000000	train-clean-360	I take it for granted

none	none	 I take one picture as an illustration I take pleasure in saying I take the liberty of observing I take this instance at random

1383_130533_000035_000000	train-clean-360	I think we may say therefore

1383_130533_000050_000000	train-clean-360	I tremble at the task
none	none	 I tremble to think I trust I may be indulged I trust it is not presumptuous I trust that as the years roll on I trust that I shall have the indulgence I trust that this will not be regarded as I turn gentlemen to the case I use the word advisedly I use the word in the sense 
1383_130533_000060_000000	train-clean-360	I use very plain language
none	none	 I utter this word with the deepest affection I value very much the honor I venture to ask permission I venture to say I verily believe

none	none	 I was not without some anxiety 
1383_130533_000083_000000	train-clean-360	I was overwhelmed
none	none	 I was sincerely astonished 
1383_130533_000085_000000	train-clean-360	I was very much interested

none	none	 I will ask you to bear witness 
1383_130533_000094_000000	train-clean-360	I will dwell a little longer
1383_130533_000095_000000	train-clean-360	I will endeavor in a brief way
none	none	 I will endeavor to illustrate I will endeavor to show you 
1383_130533_000098_000000	train-clean-360	I will enlarge no further
none	none	 I will even express a hope at the outset I will even go further and say I will first call your attention to I will give one more illustration 
1383_130533_000103_000000	train-clean-360	I will illustrate this point by

1383_130533_000106_000000	train-clean-360	I will not allude
none	none	 I will not argue this 
1383_130533_000108_000000	train-clean-360	I will not attempt to note

none	none	 I will not enumerate at present I will not pause to maintain I will not positively say I will not pretend to inquire into I will not quarrel with I will not relinquish the confidence I will not repeat the arguments here I will not try to gauge 
1383_130533_000119_000000	train-clean-360	I will now consider with you
none	none	 I will now leave this question I will now take an instance 
1383_130533_000122_000000	train-clean-360	I will only speak to one point
none	none	 I will only sum up my evidence I will only take an occasion to express I will only venture to remind you I will point out to your attention I will say at once I will speak but a word or two more I will speak plainly I will state with perfect distinctness I will suppose the objection to be I will take one more instance 
1383_130533_000133_000000	train-clean-360	I will take the precaution to add
none	none	 I will tell you what I think of I will try to make the thing intelligible I will venture a single remark I will venture to add 
1383_130533_000138_000000	train-clean-360	I will venture to express the hope
none	none	 I will yield the whole question I willingly admit I wish also to declare positively 
1383_130533_000142_000000	train-clean-360	I wish at the outset
1383_130533_000143_000000	train-clean-360	I wish emphatically to reaffirm
none	none	 I wish I had the time and the power 
1383_130533_000145_000000	train-clean-360	I wish it first observed
1383_130533_000146_000000	train-clean-360	I wish rather to call your attention
none	none	 I wish sir that justice might be done 
1383_130533_000148_000000	train-clean-360	I wish to ask if you honestly and candidly believe

1383_130533_000150_000000	train-clean-360	I wish to begin my statement

1383_130533_000152_000000	train-clean-360	I wish to do full justice to
1383_130533_000153_000000	train-clean-360	I wish to draw your attention
1383_130533_000154_000000	train-clean-360	I wish to express my profound gratification
none	none	 I wish to give these arguments their full weight I wish to know whether I wish to offer a few words relative to I wish to remind you in how large a degree I wish to say a word or two I wish to state all this as a matter of fact I wish you success and happiness I wish you to observe 
1383_130533_000163_000000	train-clean-360	I would also gratefully acknowledge
none	none	 I would as soon believe I would desire to speak simply and directly 
1383_130533_000166_000000	train-clean-360	I would enter a protest
1383_130533_000167_000000	train-clean-360	I would further point out to you
none	none	 I would have you understand I would infinitely rather I would like to say one word just here 
1383_130533_000171_000000	train-clean-360	I would not be understood as belittling
none	none	 I would not dwell upon that matter if I would not push the suggestion so far I would now gladly lay before you I would rather a thousand times I would recommend to your consideration 
1383_130533_000177_000000	train-clean-360	I would suggest first of all
none	none	 I would that my voice could reach the ear I would urge and entreat you 
1383_130533_000180_000000	train-clean-360	I would urge upon you
1383_130533_000181_000000	train-clean-360	I would venture to point out
none	none	 I yielded to the earnest solicitations If any man be so persuaded If anyone could conceive If anyone is so dim of vision If any other answer be made If at first view this should seem If however you determine to If I am asked for the proof If I am wrong If I can carry you with me If I can succeed in describing If I could find words If I have done no more than view the facts If I have in any way deserved If I may be allowed a little criticism If I may be allowed modestly to suggest If I may be allowed to refer If I may reverently say so If I may say so without presumption If I may so speak If I may take for granted If I may venture to say anything If I mistake not the sentiment If I recollect aright If I understand the matter at all If I venture a few remarks If I were asked If I were to act upon my conviction If I were to recapitulate If I wished to prove my contention If in consequence we find it necessary If in the glow of conscious pride If in the years of the future If it be difficult to appreciate If it be so If it be true If it is contended If it means anything it means this If more were needed to illustrate If my opinions are true If on the contrary we all foresee If on the other hand I say If one seeks to measure If only we go deep enough If still you have further doubt If the bare facts were studied If the experience of the world is worth anything If then I am asked If then I should here rest my cause If there be any among us If there be one lesson more than another If this be so If this seems doubtful to anyone If unhappily the day should ever come If we accept at all the argument If we are not blind to If we are rightly informed If we are to reason on the fact If we cast our glance back If we embark upon a career If we had the whole case before us If we isolate ourselves If we may trust to experience If we pursue a different course If we pursue our inquiries through If we sincerely desire If we survey If we would not be beguiled If what has been said is true If you remain silent If you seek the real meaning of If you think for a moment If you want to look If you were asked to point out If you will allow me to prophesy If you will forgive me the expression If you wish for a more interesting example If you wish to get at the bottom of facts If you would see the most conclusive proof If your view is right In a significant paragraph In a wider sense In a word gentlemen In a word I conceive In actual life I suspect In addition to these arguments In addressing myself to the question In addressing you I feel In agreement with this obvious conclusion In all ages of the world In all or any of these views In all times and places In an unguarded moment In answering the inquiry In any view of the case In closing my speech I ask each of you In conclusion let me say In conclusion may I repeat In consequence it becomes a necessity In contemplating the causes In days to come In examining this part of the subject In fine it is no extravagance to say In former ages and generations In further illustration In further proof of my assertion In illustration of what I have said In like manner are to be explained In like manner I would advise In listening to the kind words In looking about me In many instances In meeting this difficulty I will not urge In most cases I hold In my estimation In my humble opinion In my view In offering to you these counsels In one other respect In one point I wish no one to mistake me In one sense this is undoubtedly true In order to appreciate the force of In order to complete the proof In order to do justice to the question In order to prove plainly and intelligibly In order to realize adequately In other words In our estimate of the past In point of fact In precisely the same way In pursuance of these views In pursuing the great objects In regard to In rising to return my sincere thanks In saying all of this I do not forget In saying this I am not disposed to deny In short I say In solving this difficulty In something of a parallel way In spite of the fact In such cases strictly speaking In support of this assertion In that matchless epitome In that mood of high hope In the anomalies of fortune In the course of these remarks In the existing circumstances In the first place therefore I consider In the first place we see In the first place we should be all agreed In the fullest sense In the fullness of time In the last suggestion In the meantime I will commend to you In the next place be assured In the presence of this vast assembly In the present situation In the progress of events In the remarks I have made In the same manner I rely In the second place it is quite clear In the suggestion I have made In the very brief space at our disposal In these extraordinary circumstances In these sentiments I agree In this brief survey In this connection I may be permitted to refer In this connection I remind myself In this necessarily brief and imperfect review In this rapid and slight enumeration In this respect In this sense only In this there is no contradiction In very many instances In very truth In view of these reflections In what has now been said In what I have now further to say In widening our view 
1636-130535-0000	train-other-500	Indeed can anyone tell me Indeed I am not convinced Indeed I can not do better Indeed I have heard it whispered Indeed I may fairly say
none	none	 Indeed it will generally be found 
1636-130535-0001	train-other-500	Indeed we know Instances abound Is it logically consistent Is it not legitimate to recognize Is it not marvelous
1636-130535-0002	train-other-500	Is it not obvious Is it not quite possible Is it not then preposterous Is it not universally recognized
1636-130535-0003	train-other-500	Is it not wise to argue Is it possible can it be believed Is it then any wonder
none	none	 Is not that the common sentiment 
1636-130535-0004	train-other-500	Is there any evidence here Is there any language of reproach Is there any possibility of mistaking Is there any reason in the world It affords me gratification
1636-130535-0005	train-other-500	It also pleases me very much It amounts to this It appears from what has been said It appears to me on the contrary
1636-130535-0006	train-other-500	It can rightly be said It certainly follows then It comes to this It could not be otherwise It does not necessarily follow
1636-130535-0007	train-other-500	It exhibits a state of mind It follows as a matter of course It follows inevitably It gives us an exalted conception
1636-130535-0008	train-other-500	It grieves me to relate It hardly fits the character It has at all times been a just reproach It has been a very great pleasure for me
1636-130535-0009	train-other-500	It has been generally assumed It has been justly objected It has been my privilege It has been suggested fancifully
none	none	 It has been well said It has ever been my ambition It has struck me very forcibly It is a circumstance of happy augury augury sign of something coming omen It is a common error It is a curious trait It is a fact well known It is a falsehood to say It is a familiar charge against It is a good augury of success augury sign of something coming omen It is a great pleasure to me It is a living truth 
1636-130535-0010	train-other-500	It is a matter of absorbing interest It is a matter of amusement It is a matter of fact It is a matter of just pride
1636-130535-0011	train-other-500	It is a melancholy story It is a memory I cherish It is a mischievous notion It is a mistake to suppose It is a most extraordinary thing
1636-130535-0012	train-other-500	It is a most pertinent question It is a noble thing It is a peculiar pleasure to me It is a perversion of terms It is a pleasing peculiarity
1636-130535-0013	train-other-500	It is a popular idea It is a rare privilege It is a recognized principle It is a remarkable and striking fact It is a strange fact
1636-130535-0014	train-other-500	It is a sure sign It is a theme too familiar It is a thing commonly said It is a touching reflection It is a true saying
1636-130535-0015	train-other-500	It is a very significant fact It is a vision which still inspires us It is a wholesome symptom It is all things considered a fact
1636-130535-0016	train-other-500	It is all very fine to think It is all very well to say It is almost proverbial It is also possible It is also probably true
none	none	 It is always pleasant to respond 
1636-130535-0017	train-other-500	It is amazing how little
none	none	 It is an easy matter It is an egregious mistake egregious conspicuously and outrageously reprehensible It is an established rule It is an incredible thing It is an interesting fact It is an unforgivable offense It is an unquestionable truth 
1636-130535-0018	train-other-500	It is appropriate that we should celebrate It is asserted It is assumed as an axiom It is at once inconsistent
1636-130535-0019	train-other-500	It is but fair to say It is but too true It is by no means my design It is certainly especially pleasant It is certainly remarkable
none	none	 It is common in these days to lament 
1636-130535-0020	train-other-500	It is commonly assumed It is comparatively easy It is curious sophistry It is curious to observe It is desirable for us
1636-130535-0021	train-other-500	It is difficult for me to respond fitly It is difficult to avoid saying It is difficult to describe It is difficult to overstate
1636-130535-0022	train-other-500	It is difficult to put a limit It is difficult to surmise It is doubtful whether It is easy enough to add
1636-130535-0023	train-other-500	It is easy to instance cases It is easy to understand It is eminently proper It is every man s duty to think
1636-130535-0024	train-other-500	It is evident that the answer to this It is evidently supposed by many people It is exceedingly gratifying to hear It is exceedingly unfortunate
1636-130535-0025	train-other-500	It is fair that you should hear It is fair to suppose It is far from me to desire It is fatal to suppose It is fitting
1636-130535-0026	train-other-500	It is for me to relate It is for others to illustrate It is for this reason It is for us to ask It is greatly assumed
1636-130535-0027	train-other-500	It is gratifying to have the honor It is hardly for me It is hardly necessary to pass judgment It is idle to think of It is immaterial whether
1636-130535-0028	train-other-500	It is impossible to avoid saying It is in every way appropriate
none	none	 It is in the highest degree worthy 
1636-130535-0029	train-other-500	It is in this characteristic It is in vain It is in your power to give It is indeed a strange doctrine It is indeed not a little remarkable
1636-130535-0030	train-other-500	It is indeed true It is indeed very clear It is indispensable to have It is interesting and suggestive It is interesting to know
1636-130535-0031	train-other-500	It is just so far true It is likewise necessary It is made evident It is manifest It is manifestly absurd to say
1636-130535-0032	train-other-500	It is merely common sense to say It is more than probable It is my agreeable duty It is my belief It is my earnest wish
1636-130535-0033	train-other-500	It is my grateful duty to address you It is my hope
none	none	 It is my present purpose It is natural to ask the question It is necessary to refer It is necessary to take some notice It is needful to a complete understanding It is needless before this audience to repeat It is no doubt true It is no exaggeration to say It is no part of my business It is no significant thing It is no small indication It is no wonder It is not a practical question It is not altogether satisfactory It is not an unknown occurrence It is not by any means It is not difficult to comprehend It is not difficult to discern It is not easy for me to find words It is not enough to say It is not entirely clear to me It is not evident It is not for me on this occasion It is not given to many men It is not likely that any of you It is not logical to say It is not my intention to enter into It is not my purpose to discuss It is not necessarily true It is not necessary for me even to sketch It is not necessary for our purpose It is not often in these modern days It is not ours to pronounce It is not out of place to remind you It is not possible to recount It is not quite clear It is not to me so very surprising It is not too much to say It is not unknown to you It is not within the scope of this address It is now high time for me It is now perfectly plain It is observable enough It is obvious It is of course difficult It is of great importance to show It is of no moment It is of very little importance It is often remarked It is on these grounds It is one of the burning questions of the day It is one of the most natural visions It is one of the most significant things It is one of the queerest freaks of fate It is only a few short years since It is only just to say It is our duty to examine It is ours to bear witness It is owing to this truth It is peculiarly befitting at this time It is perfectly apparent It is pitiable to reflect It is pleasant to meet this brilliant company It is rather a pleasant coincidence It is rather an arduous task It is rather startling It is related It is ridiculous to say It is said and I think said truly It is said to be impossible It is satisfactory to notice It is scarcely necessary to insist It is scarcely questioned It is self evident It is sometimes hard to determine It is still an open question It is still more surprising It is substantially true It is surely necessary for me It is the clear duty of It is the doctrine of It is the fashion to extol It is the universal testimony It is therefore evident It is therefore necessary It is this which lies at the foundation It is to be expected It is to be remembered It is to me a very sincere satisfaction It is told traditionally It is too plain to be argued It is true It is unnecessary for me to remind you It is upon this line of reasoning It is very common to confuse It is very doubtful whether It is very interesting and pleasant It is well known It is with great pleasure It is with pity unspeakable It is within the memory of men now living It is worth while to notice It may appear absurd It may at first sight seem strange It may be added It may be conjectured It may be imagined It may be plausibly objected It may be rightly said It may be useful to trace It may be worth your while to keep in view It may indeed be unavoidable It may not be altogether certain It may not be uninteresting to any of you It may or may not be true It may perhaps seem wonderful It may seem a little strange It may still more probably be said It must be a cause of delight It must be borne in mind It must be the verdict of history It must create astonishment It must doubtless be admitted It must ever be recollected It must never be forgotten It must not be supposed It must seem to every thoughtful man It needs scarcely be said It now becomes my pride and privilege It only remains now to speak It ought to animate us It proves a great deal It remains only to speak briefly It remains that I inform you of It remains that I should say a few words It reminds me of an anecdote It reminds one of the compliment It requires no effort of imagination It scarcely seems to be in keeping It seems almost desperate to think of It seems almost incredible It seems now to be generally admitted It seems strange to be told It seems then that on the whole It seems to me a striking circumstance It seems to me idle to ask It seems to me singularly appropriate It seems to me the primary foundation It seems to me unphilosophical It should always be borne in mind It should be remembered It so happens It sometimes seems to me It still remains to be observed It strikes me with wonder It suggests at the outset It summons our imagination It surely is not too much to expect It therefore astonishes me It used to be a reproach It was a brilliant answer It was a fine and delicate rebuke It was a fit and beautiful circumstance It was a propitious circumstance propitious auspicious favorable It was certainly a gracious act It was in the full understanding It was my good fortune It was not to be expected It was said by one who ought to know It was therefore inevitable It was under these circumstances It will appeal to It will appear from what has been said It will be asked me how It will be easy to say too much It will be easy to trace the influence It will be evident to you It will be idle to imply It will be interesting to trace It will be just as reasonable to say It will be rather to our advantage It will be recollected It will be seen at a glance It will be well and wise It will carry out my meaning more fully It will I suppose be denied It will not be expected from me It will not be safe It will not do for a man to say It will not I trust be concluded It will not surely be objected It will not take many words to sum up It will thus be seen It would be a misfortune It would be a proud distinction It would be a very remarkable fact It would be absurd to pretend It would be an inexcusable omission It would be idle for me It would be imprudent in me It would be invidious for me invidious rousing ill will animosity It would be natural on such an occasion It would be no less impracticable It would be out of place here It would be preposterous to say It would be presumptuous in me It would be the height of absurdity It would be unfair to praise It would be unjust to deny It would be well for us to reflect It would indeed be unworthy It would seem perhaps most fitting J Just the reverse is true L

can do Notwithstanding all that has been said Notwithstanding all this I hold Now bear with me when I say Now comes the question Now comparing these instances together Now from these instances it is plain Now having spoken of Now I admit Now I am far from denying Now I am far from undervaluing Now I am justified in calling this Now I am obliged to say Now I do not wish you to believe Now I have a

sympathize Of one thing however I am certain Of this briefly Of this statement I will only say Of this truth I shall convince you by On a review of the whole subject On occasions of this kind On such a day as this On the contrary I am assuming On the occasion to which I refer On the other hand it is clear On the whole then I observe On this auspicious occasion On this point I do not mean to dwell On this subject you need not suspect Once again there are those Once more I emphasize Once more let me try to put into words One additional remark One almost wishes One can not decline to note One concluding remark has to be made One fact is clear and indisputable One further word One important topic remains One is fairly tempted to wish One lesson history may be said to repeat One might be challenged to produce One of the ancients said One of the most commonly known One of the most extraordinary incidents One of the things I recollect with most pride One of these signs is the fact One or two points are made clear One other circumstance One other remark suggests itself One remark I will make One thing more will complete this question One thing which always impressed me One very striking tendency One word in courtesy I must say One word more in a serious vein One would naturally suppose Only so much do I know Opinions are divided as to whether Or to come nearer home Or to take but one other example Ordinarily speaking such deductions Others may hold other opinions Ought we not to think Our thoughts wander back Over and above all this P Pardon me if Perhaps another reason why Perhaps however in speaking to you Perhaps however some among you will be Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate Perhaps I ought to say Perhaps it may be doubted Perhaps sir I am mistaken in Permit me frankly to say Permit me to add another circumstance Permit me to bring home to you Personally I am far too firm a believer Pray sir let me say R Read but your history aright Recollect sir Reflections such as these Rely upon it Remember I do not seek to Remembering some past occurrences Returning then to the consideration S Seriously then do I beg you Shall I tell you Shall we complain Should there be objection I answer Since then it is provided Since then this is the case Sir with all my heart I respond So accustomed are we So at least it seems to me So far as I know So far as my observation and experience goes So far in general So I say to you So it comes to pass So long as we continue to love truth and duty So men are asking So much at first sight So much on this subject So that I may venture to say So that if you were persuaded So then ought we also So to add one other example So too I may go on to speak So when I hear people say Some have insisted Some of you can recall the time Some of you may think this visionary Some of you will remember Some one will perhaps object Some prejudice is attached Some writer has said Sometimes I venture to think Sometimes it may happen Speaking in this place Startling as this may appear to you Stating only the truth I affirm Still another encouraging fact Still further Still I can not part from my subject Still I have generally found Still I imagine you would consider it Still I know what answer I can make to Still it may with justice be said Still one thing more Still we ought to be grateful Strange as it may seem Strictly in confidence I do not think Strictly speaking there is no such thing Such a doctrine is essentially superficial Such are the rather tolerant ideas Such considerations as these Such I believe would be the consequences Such illustrations are not frequent Such in brief is the story Such is steadfastly my opinion Such is the deep prejudice now existing Such is the intellectual view we take Such is the lesson which I am taught Such is the progress Such is the truth Such sir I conceive to be Such then is the true idea Such too is the characteristic of Suffer me to point out Suffice it to say here Summing up what I have said Suppose we turn our eyes to Surely I do not misinterpret Surely it is a paradox Surely it is not too much for me to say T Take another instance Take one of the most recent cases Take the simple fact Take this example Taking a broader view Taking the facts by themselves That is a further point That is a natural boast That is a pure assumption That is all that it seems necessary to me That is all very good That is far from my thoughts That is final and conclusive That is the lesson of history That is the question of questions That you may

purpose in this address The common consent of civilized mankind The conclusion is irresistible The confusing assertion is sometimes made The day is at hand The decided objection is raised The doctrine I am combating The doctrine is admirable The effect too often is The evolution of events has brought The fact has made a deep impression on me The fact has often been insisted The fact to be particularly noted The facts are clear and unequivocal The facts may be strung together The first business of every man The first counsel I would offer The first great fact to remember is The first point to be ascertained The first practical thought is The first remarkable instance was The first thing I wish to note The first thing that we have to consider The future historian will no doubt The generous feeling that has promoted you The great mass of the people The hour is at hand The illustration is analogous The important thing is The instance I shall choose The irresistible tendency of The kindness with which I have been received The last and distinguishing feature is The latest inclination I have seen The lesson which we should take most to heart The main cause of all this The more you examine this matter The most concise tribute paid The most reasonable anticipation The most remarkable step forward The most striking characteristic The most sublime instance that I know The next point is The next question to be considered is The next thing I consider indispensable The occasion that calls us together The one central difference between The only course that remains open The only plea to be offered The other day I observed The paramount consideration is The perils that beset us here The pleasing duty is assigned me The point I have urged upon you is The point I wish a little further to speak of The point to which I shall call your attention The popular notion is The practical inference from all this The presence of this brilliant assemblage The pressing question is The prevalent opinion no doubt The proof of this statement is to be found The question is deeply involved The question then recurs The remedy I believe to be The result I fancy has been The result of the

expressed The simple rule and test The simple truth is The soundness of this doctrine depends The strongest proof I have The subject of the evening s address The subject which has been assigned to me The task has been placed in my hands The testimony of history is The theory seems at first sight The thought with which I shall close The time has manifestly now arrived The time is not far distant The time is now come for me The times are full of signs and warnings The toast I am about to propose to you The vain wish has sometimes been indulged The view I have been enforcing The view is more misleading The warmth and kindness of your reception The welcome that has been extended to me The whole story of civilization Then again in corroboration Then again when men say Then take the other side of the argument Then the question arises Then there is another story Then too it must be remembered There are certain old truths There are few spectacles There are hopeful signs of There are I believe many who think There are indeed exceptions There are indeed persons who profess There are many educated and intelligent people There are people in every community There are several reasons why There are some slight modifications There are some who are fond of looking at There are some who have an idea There are those of us who can remember There are those who wish There are two conflicting theories There can be but one answer There can be no doubt There has been a great deal of discussion lately There has been no period of time There have been differences of opinion There is a characteristic saying There is a class of person There is a common saying There is a conviction There is a degree of evidence There is a genuine grief There is a great deal of rash talking There is a growing disposition There is a large class of thinkers There is a lesson of profound interest There is a more important question There is a most serious lesson There is a multitude of facts There is a question of vital importance There is a very common tendency There is a vital difference of opinion There is an analogy in this respect There is an ancient story to the effect There is an eternal controversy There is another class of men There is another factor There is another object equally important There is another point of view There is another remarkable analogy There is another sense in which There is at any rate to be said There is but one consideration There is certainly no reason There is hardly any limit There is however another opinion There is however one caution There is little truth in There is no field of human activity There is no good reason There is no justification for There is no mistaking the purpose There is no more insidious peril There is no more striking exemplification There is no occasion to exaggerate There is no page of history There is no sense in saying There is no worse perversion There is not a shadow of evidence There is nothing more repulsive There is nothing overstated in this description There is nothing to show There is one story which it is said There is only one sense in which There is some difference of opinion There is something strangely interesting There is yet another distinction There is yet one other remark There ought certainly to be There was but one alternative There was one remarkable incident There will always be a number of men There will be no difficulty There yet remains Therefore there is no possibility of a doubt Therein lies your responsibility These alone would not be sufficient These are enough to refute the opinion These are general counsels These are generalizations These are my reasons for These are points for consideration These considerations have great weight with me These exceptions do not hold in the case of These ideas naturally present themselves These instances are far from common These instances are indications These last words lead me to say These objections only go to show These questions I shall examine These various partial views They mistake the intelligence They would persuade you to Think for a moment Think of the cool disregard This absurdity arises This appeal to the common sense This argument is especially cogent cogent powerfully persuasive This at least is sure This being the case This being true This being undeniable it is plain This being understood I ask This brings me to a single remark This brings us to a subject This episode goes to prove This fact was soon made manifest This from the nature of the case This I conceive to be the business This I consider to be my own case This I have told you This is a general statement This is a very one sided conception This is a very serious situation This is an astonishing announcement This is conceded by This is contrary to all argument This is doubtless the truth This is especially the case This is essentially an age of This is in the main just This is like saying This is not all This is not the main point of objection This is not the occasion or the place This is obvious This is on the whole reasonable This is only another illustration of This is owing in great measure to This is precisely what we ought to do This is said in no spirit of This is suggested to us This is the design and intention This is the great fact This is the main point on which the inquiry turns This is the meaning of This is the obvious answer This is the point I want to impress upon you This is the point of view This is the position of our minds This is the radical question This is the sentiment of mankind This is the starting point This is the sum This is to be found in the fact This is what I am led to say This is what may be objected This is why I take the liberty This language is plain This leads me to the question This leads us to inquire This may be said without prejudice This might be illustrated at length This much is certain This sentiment was well nigh universal This surely is the conclusion This then is the answer This then is the drift of my illustration This then is what I mean by saying This will be evident at once This you can not deny Those who have watched the tendencies Thus a great deal may be done Thus analogy suggests Thus far I willingly admit Thus I am led on to another remark Thus if you look into Thus instances occur now and then Thus it comes to pass Thus my imagination tells me Thus much however I may say Thus much I may be allowed to say Thus much may be sufficient to recall Thus we see Time would not permit me To a man of the highest public spirit To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood To be more explicit To be sure we sometimes hear To bring the matter nearer home To convince them of this To feel the true force of this argument To illustrate To make my story quite complete To me however it would appear To my way of conceiving such matters To prevent misapprehension To some it may sound like a paradox To sum up all that has been said To sum up in one word To take a very different instance To the conclusion thus drawn To the enormous majority of persons To these general considerations To this I answer To this it will be replied To what other cause can you ascribe To day as never before Treading close upon the heels Tried by this standard True it is True there are difficulties Truly it is a subject for
