1092-134562-0001	train-other-500	The task of writing an autobiography is a difficult one When I try to classify my earliest impressions I find that fact and fancy look alike across the years that link the past with the present The woman paints the child s experiences in her own fantasy
1092-134562-0002	train-other-500	A few impressions stand out vividly from the first years of my life but the shadows of the prison house are on the rest Besides many of the joys and sorrows of childhood have lost their poignancy
1092-134562-0003	train-other-500	and many incidents of vital importance in my early education have been forgotten in the excitement of great discoveries In order therefore not to be tedious I shall try to present in a series of sketches
none	none	 only the episodes that seem to me to be the most interesting and important I was born on June twenty seven eighteen eighty in Tuscumbia a little town of northern Alabama The family on my father s side is descended from Caspar Keller a native of Switzerland who settled in Maryland One of my Swiss ancestors was the first teacher of the deaf in Zurich and wrote a book on the subject of their education rather a singular coincidence 
1092-134562-0004	train-other-500	though it is true that there is no king who has not had a slave among his ancestors and no slave who has not had a king among his My grandfather Caspar Keller s son entered large tracts of land in Alabama and finally settled there
none	none	 I have been told that once a year he went from Tuscumbia to Philadelphia on horseback 
1092-134562-0005	train-other-500	to purchase supplies for the plantation
none	none	 and my aunt has in her possession many of the letters to his family which give charming and vivid accounts of these trips My Grandmother Keller was a daughter of one of Lafayette s aides Alexander Moore and granddaughter of Alexander Spotswood an early Colonial Governor of Virginia She was also second cousin to Robert E Lee My father Arthur H Keller 
1092-134562-0006	train-other-500	was a captain in the Confederate Army and my mother Kate Adams was his second wife and many years younger Her grandfather Benjamin Adams married Susanna E Goodhue
none	none	 and lived in Newbury Massachusetts for many years 
1092-134562-0007	train-other-500	Their son Charles Adams was born in Newburyport Massachusetts and moved to Helena Arkansas
none	none	 When the Civil War broke out he fought on the side of the South and became a brigadier general He married Lucy Helen Everett 
1092-134562-0008	train-other-500	who belonged to the same family of Everetts as Edward Everett and doctor Edward Everett Hale After the war was over the family moved to Memphis Tennessee I lived up to the time of the illness that deprived me of my sight and hearing
1092-134562-0009	train-other-500	in a tiny house consisting of a large square room and a small one in which the servant slept It is a custom in the South to build a small house near the homestead as an annex to be used on occasion Such a house my father built after the Civil War
1092-134562-0010	train-other-500	and when he married my mother they went to live in it It was completely covered with vines climbing roses and honeysuckles From the garden it looked like an arbour The little porch was hidden from view
none	none	 by a screen of yellow roses and Southern smilax 
1092-134562-0011	train-other-500	It was the favourite haunt of humming birds and bees The Keller homestead where the family lived
none	none	 was a few steps from our little rose bower It was called Ivy Green 
1092-134562-0012	train-other-500	because the house and the surrounding trees and fences were covered with beautiful English ivy Its old fashioned garden was the paradise of my childhood Even in the days before my teacher came
1092-134562-0013	train-other-500	I used to feel along the square stiff boxwood hedges and guided by the sense of smell would find the first violets and lilies There too
none	none	 after a fit of temper I went to find comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and grass What joy it was to lose myself in that garden of flowers to wander happily from spot to spot until coming suddenly upon a beautiful vine 
1092-134562-0014	train-other-500	I recognized it by its leaves and blossoms and knew it was the vine which covered the tumble down summer house at the farther end of the garden Here also were trailing clematis drooping jessamine
1092-134562-0015	train-other-500	and some rare sweet flowers called butterfly lilies because their fragile petals resemble butterflies wings But the roses
none	none	 they were loveliest of all 
1092-134562-0016	train-other-500	Never have I found in the greenhouses of the North such heart satisfying roses as the climbing roses of my southern home They used to hang in long festoons from our porch filling the whole air with their fragrance
none	none	 untainted by any earthy smell and in the early morning washed in the dew they felt so soft so pure I could not help wondering if they did not resemble the asphodels of God s garden 
1092-134562-0017	train-other-500	The beginning of my life was simple and much like every other little life I came I saw I conquered as the first baby in the family always does There was the usual amount of discussion as to a name for me
1092-134562-0018	train-other-500	The first baby in the family was not to be lightly named every one was emphatic about that My father suggested the name of Mildred Campbell an ancestor whom he highly esteemed
1092-134562-0019	train-other-500	and he declined to take any further part in the discussion My mother solved the problem by giving it as her wish that I should be called after her mother whose maiden name was Helen Everett
1092-134562-0020	train-other-500	But in the excitement of carrying me to church my father lost the name on the way very naturally since it was one in which he had declined to have a part When the minister asked him for it
none	none	 he just remembered 
1092-134562-0021	train-other-500	that it had been decided to call me after my grandmother and he gave her name as Helen Adams I am told that while I was still in long dresses I showed many signs of an eager self asserting disposition
1092-134562-0022	train-other-500	Everything that I saw other people do I insisted upon imitating At six months I could pipe out How d ye and one day I attracted every one s attention by saying Tea tea tea quite plainly
1092-134562-0023	train-other-500	Even after my illness I remembered one of the words I had learned in these early months It was the word water and I continued to make some sound for that word after all other speech was lost I ceased making the sound wah wah
1092-134562-0024	train-other-500	only when I learned to spell the word They tell me I walked the day I was a year old My mother had just taken me out of the bath tub and was holding me in her lap
none	none	 when I was suddenly attracted by the flickering shadows of leaves that danced in the sunlight on the smooth floor 
1092-134562-0025	train-other-500	I slipped from my mother s lap and almost ran toward them The impulse gone I fell down and cried for her to take me up in her arms These happy days did not last long One brief spring
1092-134562-0026	train-other-500	musical with the song of robin and mocking bird one summer rich in fruit and roses one autumn of gold and crimson sped by and left their gifts at the feet of an eager delighted child Then in the dreary month of February
1092-134562-0027	train-other-500	came the illness which closed my eyes and ears and plunged me into the unconsciousness of a new born baby They called it acute congestion of the stomach and brain The doctor thought I could not live
none	none	 Early one morning however the fever left me as suddenly and mysteriously as it had come There was great rejoicing in the family that morning but no one not even the doctor knew that I should never 
1092-134562-0028	train-other-500	see or hear again I fancy I still have confused recollections of that illness I especially remember the tenderness
none	none	 with which my mother tried to soothe me in my waling hours of fret and pain and the agony and bewilderment 
1092-134562-0029	train-other-500	with which I awoke after a tossing half sleep and turned my eyes so dry and hot to the wall away from the once loved light which came to me dim and yet more dim each day
1092-134562-0030	train-other-500	But except for these fleeting memories if indeed they be memories it all seems very unreal like a nightmare Gradually I got used to the silence and darkness that surrounded me
none	none	 and forgot that it had ever been different until she came my teacher who was to set my spirit free But during the first nineteen months of my life I had caught glimpses of broad green fields 
1092-134562-0031	train-other-500	a luminous sky trees and flowers which the darkness that followed
none	none	 could not wholly blot out If we have once seen the day is ours and what the day has shown CHAPTER II 
1092-134563-0000	train-other-500	I cannot recall what happened during the first months after my illness I only know that I sat in my mother s lap or clung to her dress as she went about her household duties My hands felt every object and observed every motion and in this way
1092-134563-0001	train-other-500	I learned to know many things Soon I felt the need of some communication with others and began to make crude signs A shake of the head meant No and a nod Yes a pull meant Come
1092-134563-0002	train-other-500	and a push Go Was it bread that I wanted
none	none	 Then I would imitate the acts of cutting the slices and buttering them If I wanted my mother to make ice cream for dinner 
1092-134563-0003	train-other-500	I made the sign for working the freezer and shivered indicating cold My mother moreover succeeded in making me understand a good deal I always knew when she wished me to bring her something
1092-134563-0004	train-other-500	and I would run upstairs or anywhere else she indicated Indeed I owe to her loving wisdom all that was bright and good in my long night I understood a good deal of what was going on about me
none	none	 At five I learned to fold and put away the clean clothes 
1092-134563-0005	train-other-500	when they were brought in from the laundry and I distinguished my own from the rest I knew by the way my mother and aunt dressed when they were going out and I invariably begged to go with them I was always sent for when there was company
none	none	 and when the guests took their leave I waved my hand to them I think with a vague remembrance of the meaning of the gesture 
1092-134563-0006	train-other-500	One day some gentlemen called on my mother and I felt the shutting of the front door and other sounds that indicated their arrival On a sudden thought
none	none	 I ran upstairs before any one could stop me 
1092-134563-0007	train-other-500	to put on my idea of a company dress Standing before the mirror as I had seen others do I anointed mine head with oil and covered my face thickly with powder Then I pinned a veil over my head so that it covered my face
1092-134563-0008	train-other-500	and fell in folds down to my shoulders
none	none	 and tied an enormous bustle round my small waist 
1092-134563-0009	train-other-500	so that it dangled behind almost meeting the hem of my skirt Thus attired I went down to help entertain the company I do not remember when I first realized that I was different from other people but I knew it before my teacher came to me
none	none	 I had noticed that my mother and 
1092-134563-0010	train-other-500	my friends did not use signs as I did when they wanted anything done but talked with their mouths Sometimes I stood between two persons who were conversing and touched their lips I could not understand and was vexed
1092-134563-0011	train-other-500	I moved my lips and gesticulated frantically without result This made me so angry at times that I kicked and screamed until I was exhausted I think I knew when I was naughty for I knew that it hurt Ella my nurse to kick her
none	none	 and when my fit of temper was over I had a feeling akin to regret 
1092-134563-0012	train-other-500	But I cannot remember any instance in which this feeling prevented me from repeating the naughtiness when I failed to get what I wanted
none	none	 In those days a little coloured girl 
1092-134563-0013	train-other-500	Martha Washington the child of our cook and Belle an old setter
none	none	 and a great hunter in her day 
1092-134563-0014	train-other-500	were my constant companions Martha Washington understood my signs and I seldom had any difficulty in making her do just as I wished It pleased me to domineer over her
none	none	 and she generally submitted to my tyranny rather than risk a hand to hand encounter I was strong active indifferent to consequences I knew my own mind well enough and always had my own way even if I had to fight tooth and nail for it 
1092-134563-0015	train-other-500	We spent a great deal of time in the kitchen kneading dough balls helping make ice cream grinding coffee quarreling over the cake bowl
none	none	 and feeding the hens and turkeys that swarmed about the kitchen steps Many of them were so tame that they would eat from my hand and let me feel them One big gobbler snatched a tomato from me one day and ran away with it Inspired perhaps by Master Gobbler s success 
1092-134563-0016	train-other-500	we carried off to the woodpile a cake which the cook had just frosted and ate every bit of it I was quite ill afterward and I wonder if retribution also overtook the turkey The guinea fowl likes to hide her nest in out of the way places
1092-134563-0017	train-other-500	and it was one of my greatest delights to hunt for the eggs in the long grass I could not tell Martha Washington when I wanted to go egg hunting but I would double my hands and put them on the ground which meant something round in the grass
none	none	 and Martha always understood When we were fortunate enough to find a nest I never allowed her to carry the eggs home making her understand by emphatic signs that she might fall and break them The sheds where the corn was stored the stable where the horses were kept and the yard where the cows were milked morning and evening were unfailing sources of interest to Martha and me 
1092-134563-0018	train-other-500	The milkers would let me keep my hands on the cows while they milked and I often got well switched by the cow for my curiosity The making ready for Christmas was always a delight to me Of course I did not know what it was all about
1092-134563-0019	train-other-500	but I enjoyed the pleasant odours that filled the house and the tidbits that were given to Martha Washington and me to keep us quiet We were sadly in the way but that did not interfere with our pleasure in the least They allowed us to grind the spices
none	none	 pick over the raisins and lick the stirring spoons I hung my stocking because the others did 
1092-134563-0020	train-other-500	I cannot remember however that the ceremony interested me especially nor did my curiosity cause me to wake before daylight to look for my gifts Martha Washington had as great a love of mischief as I
none	none	 Two little children were seated on the veranda steps one hot July afternoon One was black as ebony with little bunches of fuzzy hair tied with shoestrings sticking out all over her head like corkscrews The other was white 
1092-134563-0021	train-other-500	with long golden curls One child was six years old the other two or three years older The younger child was blind that was I and the other was Martha Washington
none	none	 We were busy cutting out paper dolls but we soon wearied of this amusement and after cutting up our shoestrings and clipping all the leaves off the honeysuckle that were within reach 
1092-134563-0022	train-other-500	I turned my attention to Martha s corkscrews She objected at first but finally submitted Thinking that turn and turn about is fair play she seized the scissors and cut off one of my curls
none	none	 and would have cut them all off but for my mother s timely interference Belle our dog my other companion was old and lazy and liked to sleep by the open fire rather than to romp with me I tried hard to teach her my sign language but she was dull and inattentive 
1092-134563-0023	train-other-500	She sometimes started and quivered with excitement then she became perfectly rigid as dogs do when they point a bird I did not then know why Belle acted in this way but I knew she was not doing as I wished
1092-134563-0024	train-other-500	This vexed me and the lesson always ended in a one sided boxing match Belle would get up
none	none	 stretch herself lazily 
1092-134563-0025	train-other-500	give one or two contemptuous sniffs
none	none	 go to the opposite side of the hearth and lie down again and I wearied and disappointed 
1092-134563-0026	train-other-500	went off in search of Martha Many incidents of those early years are fixed in my memory isolated but clear and distinct making the sense of that silent aimless dayless life all the more intense
1092-134563-0027	train-other-500	One day I happened to spill water on my apron and I spread it out to dry before the fire which was flickering on the sitting room hearth The apron did not dry quickly enough to suit me so I drew nearer and threw it right over the hot ashes
none	none	 The fire leaped into life the flames encircled me so that in a moment my clothes were blazing I made a terrified noise that brought 
1092-134563-0028	train-other-500	Viny my old nurse to the rescue Throwing a blanket over me she almost suffocated me but she put out the fire Except for my hands and hair I was not badly burned About this time I found out the use of a key
1092-134563-0029	train-other-500	One morning I locked my mother up in the pantry where she was obliged to remain three hours as the servants were in a detached part of the house
none	none	 She kept pounding on the door while I sat outside on the porch steps and laughed with glee as I felt the jar of the pounding 
1092-134563-0030	train-other-500	This most naughty prank of mine convinced my parents that I must be taught as soon as possible After my teacher Miss Sullivan came to me I sought an early opportunity to lock her in her room
1092-134563-0031	train-other-500	I went upstairs with something which my mother made me understand I was to give to Miss Sullivan but no sooner had I given it to her
none	none	 than I slammed the door to locked it and hid the key under the wardrobe in the hall I could not be induced to tell where the key was My father was obliged to get a ladder and take Miss Sullivan out through the window much to my delight Months after I produced the key When I was about five years old we moved from the little vine covered house to a large new one The family consisted of my father and mother two older half brothers and afterward a little sister Mildred My earliest distinct recollection of my father is making my way through great drifts of newspapers to his side and finding him alone holding a sheet of paper before his face I was greatly puzzled to know what he was doing 
1092-134563-0032	train-other-500	I imitated this action even wearing his spectacles thinking they might help solve the mystery But I did not find out the secret for several years Then I learned what those papers were and that my father edited one of them
1092-134563-0033	train-other-500	My father was most loving and indulgent devoted to his home seldom leaving us except in the hunting season He was a great hunter I have been told and a celebrated shot Next to his family he loved his dogs and gun
1092-134563-0034	train-other-500	His hospitality was great almost to a fault and he seldom came home
none	none	 without bringing a guest 
1092-134563-0035	train-other-500	His special pride was the big garden where it was said
none	none	 he raised the finest watermelons and strawberries in the county and to me he brought the first ripe grapes and the choicest berries 
1092-134563-0036	train-other-500	I remember his caressing touch as he led me from tree to tree from vine to vine and his eager delight in whatever pleased me He was a famous story teller after I had acquired language
1092-134563-0037	train-other-500	he used to spell clumsily into my hand his cleverest anecdotes and nothing pleased him more than to have me repeat them at an opportune moment I was in the North
none	none	 enjoying the last beautiful days of the summer of eighteen ninety six 
1092-134563-0038	train-other-500	when I heard the news of my father s death He had had a short illness
none	none	 there had been a brief time of acute suffering 
1092-134563-0039	train-other-500	then all was over This was my first great sorrow my first personal experience with death
none	none	 How shall I write of my mother 
1092-134563-0040	train-other-500	She is so near to me that it almost seems indelicate to speak of her For a long time I regarded my little sister as an intruder I knew that I had ceased to be my mother s only darling and the thought filled me with jealousy
1092-134563-0041	train-other-500	She sat in my mother s lap constantly where I used to sit and seemed to take up all her care and time One day something happened which seemed to me to be adding insult to injury At that time
1092-134563-0042	train-other-500	I had a much petted much abused doll which I afterward named Nancy She was alas the helpless victim of my outbursts of temper
none	none	 and of affection so that she became much the worse for wear I had dolls which talked and cried and opened and shut their eyes yet I never loved one of them as I loved poor Nancy She had a cradle and I often spent an hour or more rocking her I guarded both doll and cradle with the most jealous care but once I discovered my little sister sleeping peacefully in the cradle 
1092-134563-0043	train-other-500	At this presumption on the part of one to whom as yet no tie of love bound me I grew angry I rushed upon the cradle and over turned it and the baby might have been killed had my mother not caught her as she fell Thus
none	none	 it is that when we walk in the valley of twofold solitude 
1092-134563-0044	train-other-500	we know little of the tender affections that grow out of endearing words and actions and companionship But afterward when I was restored to my human heritage
none	none	 Mildred and I grew into each other s hearts so that we were content to go hand in hand wherever caprice led us although she could not understand my finger language nor I her childish prattle CHAPTER III Meanwhile the desire to express myself grew The few signs I used became less and less adequate and my failures to make myself understood were invariably followed by outbursts of passion I felt as if invisible hands were holding me and I made frantic efforts to free myself I struggled not that struggling helped matters but the spirit of resistance was strong within me I generally broke down in tears and physical exhaustion If my mother happened to be near I crept into her arms too miserable even to remember the cause of the tempest After awhile the need of some means of communication became so urgent that these outbursts occurred daily sometimes hourly My parents were deeply grieved and perplexed We lived a long way from any school for the blind or the deaf and it seemed unlikely that any one would come to such an out of the way place as Tuscumbia to teach a child who was both deaf and blind Indeed my friends and relatives sometimes doubted whether I could be taught My mother s only ray of hope came from Dickens s American Notes She had read his account of Laura Bridgman and remembered vaguely that she was deaf and blind yet had been educated But she also remembered with a hopeless pang that doctor Howe who had discovered the way to teach the deaf and blind had been dead many years His methods had probably died with him and if they had not how was a little girl in a far off town in Alabama to receive the benefit of them When I was about six years old my father heard of an eminent oculist in Baltimore who had been successful in many cases that had seemed hopeless My parents at once determined to take me to Baltimore to see if anything could be done for my eyes The journey which I remember well was very pleasant I made friends with many people on the train One lady gave me a box of shells My father made holes in these so that I could string them and for a long time they kept me happy and contented The conductor too was kind Often when he went his rounds I clung to his coat tails while he collected and punched the tickets His punch with which he let me play was a delightful toy Curled up in a corner of the seat I amused myself for hours making funny little holes in bits of cardboard My aunt made me a big doll out of towels It was the most comical shapeless thing this improvised doll with no nose mouth ears or eyes nothing that even the imagination of a child could convert into a face Curiously enough the absence of eyes struck me more than all the other defects put together I pointed this out to everybody with provoking persistency but no one seemed equal to the task of providing the doll with eyes A bright idea however shot into my mind and the problem was solved I tumbled off the seat and searched under it until I found my aunt s cape which was trimmed with large beads I pulled two beads off and indicated to her that I wanted her to sew them on my doll She raised my hand to her eyes in a questioning way and I nodded energetically The beads were sewed in the right place and I could not contain myself for joy but immediately I lost all interest in the doll During the whole trip I did not have one fit of temper there were so many things to keep my mind and fingers busy When we arrived in Baltimore doctor Chisholm received us kindly but he could do nothing He said however that I could be educated and advised my father to consult doctor Alexander Graham Bell of Washington who would be able to give him information about schools and teachers of deaf or blind children Acting on the doctor s advice we went immediately to Washington to see doctor Bell my father with a sad heart and many misgivings I wholly unconscious of his anguish finding pleasure in the excitement of moving from place to place Child as I was I at once felt the tenderness and sympathy which endeared doctor Bell to so many hearts as his wonderful achievements enlist their admiration He held me on his knee while I examined his watch and he made it strike for me He understood my signs and I knew it and loved him at once But I did not dream that that interview would be the door through which I should pass from darkness into light from isolation to friendship companionship knowledge love doctor Bell advised my father to write to mister Anagnos director of the Perkins Institution in Boston the scene of doctor Howe s great labours for the blind and ask him if he had a teacher competent to begin my education This my father did at once and in a few weeks there came a kind letter from mister Anagnos with the comforting assurance that a teacher had been found This was in the summer of eighteen eighty six But Miss Sullivan did not arrive until the following March Thus I came up out of Egypt and stood before Sinai and a power divine touched my spirit and gave it sight so that I beheld many wonders And from the sacred mountain I heard a voice which said Knowledge is love and light and vision CHAPTER IV The most important day I remember in all my life is the one on which my teacher Anne Mansfield Sullivan came to me I am filled with wonder when I consider the immeasurable contrasts between the two lives which it connects It was the third of March eighteen eighty seven three months before I was seven years old On the afternoon of that eventful day I stood on the porch dumb expectant I guessed vaguely from my mother s signs and from the hurrying to and fro in the house that something unusual was about to happen so I went to the door and waited on the steps The afternoon sun penetrated the mass of honeysuckle that covered the porch and fell on my upturned face My fingers lingered almost unconsciously on the familiar leaves and blossoms which had just come forth to greet the sweet southern spring I did not know what the future held of marvel or surprise for me Anger and bitterness had preyed upon me continually for weeks and a deep languor had succeeded this passionate struggle Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship tense and anxious groped her way toward the shore with plummet and sounding line and you waited with beating heart for something to happen I was like that ship before my education began only I was without compass or sounding line and had no way of knowing how near the harbour was Light give me light was the wordless cry of my soul and the light of love shone on me in that very hour I felt approaching footsteps I stretched out my hand as I supposed to my mother Some one took it and I was caught up and held close in the arms of her who had come to reveal all things to me and more than all things else to love me The morning after my teacher came she led me into her room and gave me a doll The little blind children at the Perkins Institution had sent it and Laura Bridgman had dressed it but I did not know this until afterward When I had played with it a little while Miss Sullivan slowly spelled into my hand the word d o l l I was at once interested in this finger play and tried to imitate it When I finally succeeded in making the letters correctly I was flushed with childish pleasure and pride Running downstairs to my mother I held up my hand and made the letters for doll I did not know that I was spelling a word or even that words existed I was simply making my fingers go in monkey like imitation In the days that followed I learned to spell in this uncomprehending way a great many words among them pin hat cup and a few verbs like sit stand and walk But my teacher had been with me several weeks before I understood that everything has a name One day while I was playing with my new doll Miss Sullivan put my big rag doll into my lap also spelled d o l l and tried to make me understand that d o l l applied to both Earlier in the day we had had a tussle over the words m u g and w a t e r Miss Sullivan had tried to impress it upon me that m u g is mug and that w a t e r is water but I persisted in confounding the two In despair she had dropped the subject for the time only to renew it at the first opportunity I became impatient at her repeated attempts and seizing the new doll I dashed it upon the floor I was keenly delighted when I felt the fragments of the broken doll at my feet Neither sorrow nor regret followed my passionate outburst I had not loved the doll In the still dark world in which I lived there was no strong sentiment or tenderness I felt my teacher sweep the fragments to one side of the hearth and I had a sense of satisfaction that the cause of my discomfort was removed She brought me my hat and I knew I was going out into the warm sunshine This thought if a wordless sensation may be called a thought made me hop and skip with pleasure We walked down the path to the well house attracted by the fragrance of the honeysuckle with which it was covered Some one was drawing water and my teacher placed my hand under the spout As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water first slowly then rapidly I stood still my whole attention fixed upon the motions of her fingers Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness as of something forgotten a thrill of returning thought and somehow the mystery of language was revealed to me I knew then that w a t e r meant the wonderful cool something that was flowing over my hand That living word awakened my soul gave it light hope joy set it free There were barriers still it is true but barriers that could in time be swept away I left the well house eager to learn Everything had a name and each name gave birth to a new thought As we returned to the house every object which I touched seemed to quiver with life That was because I saw everything with the strange new sight that had come to me On entering the door I remembered the doll I had broken I felt my way to the hearth and picked up the pieces I tried vainly to put them together Then my eyes filled with tears for I realized what I had done and for the first time I felt repentance and sorrow I learned a great many new words that day I do not remember what they all were but I do know that mother father sister teacher were among them words that were to make the world blossom for me like Aaron s rod with flowers It would have been difficult to find a happier child than I was as I lay in my crib at the close of that eventful day and lived over the joys it had brought me and for the first time longed for a new day to come CHAPTER V I recall many incidents of the summer of eighteen eighty seven that followed my soul s sudden awakening I did nothing but explore with my hands and learn the name of every object that I touched and the more I handled things and learned their names and uses the more joyous and confident grew my sense of kinship with the rest of the world When the time of daisies and buttercups came Miss Sullivan took me by the hand across the fields where men were preparing the earth for the seed to the banks of the Tennessee River and there sitting on the warm grass I had my first lessons in the beneficence of nature I learned how the sun and the rain make to grow out of the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food how birds build their nests and live and thrive from land to land how the squirrel the deer the lion and every other creature finds food and shelter As my knowledge of things grew I felt more and more the delight of the world I was in Long before I learned to do a sum in arithmetic or describe the shape of the earth Miss Sullivan had taught me to find beauty in the fragrant woods in every blade of grass and in the curves and dimples of my baby sister s hand She linked my earliest thoughts with nature and made me feel that birds and flowers and I were happy peers But about this time I had an experience which taught me that nature is not always kind One day my teacher and I were returning from a long ramble The morning had been fine but it was growing warm and sultry when at last we turned our faces homeward Two or three times we stopped to rest under a tree by the wayside Our last halt was under a wild cherry tree a short distance from the house The shade was grateful and the tree was so easy to climb that with my teacher s assistance I was able to scramble to a seat in the branches It was so cool up in the tree that Miss Sullivan proposed that we have our luncheon there I promised to keep still while she went to the house to fetch it Suddenly a change passed over the tree All the sun s warmth left the air I knew the sky was black because all the heat which meant light to me had died out of the atmosphere A strange odour came up from the earth I knew it it was the odour that always precedes a thunderstorm and a nameless fear clutched at my heart I felt absolutely alone cut off from my friends and the firm earth The immense the unknown enfolded me I remained still and expectant a chilling terror crept over me I longed for my teacher s return but above all things I wanted to get down from that tree There was a moment of sinister silence then a multitudinous stirring of the leaves A shiver ran through the tree and the wind sent forth a blast that would have knocked me off had I not clung to the branch with might and main The tree swayed and strained The small twigs snapped and fell about me in showers A wild impulse to jump seized me but terror held me fast I crouched down in the fork of the tree The branches lashed about me I felt the intermittent jarring that came now and then as if something heavy had fallen and the shock had traveled up till it reached the limb I sat on It worked my suspense up to the highest point and just as I was thinking the tree and I should fall together my teacher seized my hand and helped me down I clung to her trembling with joy to feel the earth under my feet once more I had learned a new lesson that nature wages open war against her children and under softest touch hides treacherous claws After this experience it was a long time before I climbed another tree The mere thought filled me with terror It was the sweet allurement of the mimosa tree in full bloom that finally overcame my fears One beautiful spring morning when I was alone in the summer house reading I became aware of a wonderful subtle fragrance in the air I started up and instinctively stretched out my hands It seemed as if the spirit of spring had passed through the summer house What is it I asked and the next minute I recognized the odour of the mimosa blossoms I felt my way to the end of the garden knowing that the mimosa tree was near the fence at the turn of the path Yes there it was all quivering in the warm sunshine its blossom laden branches almost touching the long grass Was there ever anything so exquisitely beautiful in the world before Its delicate blossoms shrank from the slightest earthly touch it seemed as if a tree of paradise had been transplanted to earth I made my way through a shower of petals to the great trunk and for one minute stood irresolute then putting my foot in the broad space between the forked branches I pulled myself up into the tree I had some difficulty in holding on for the branches were very large and the bark hurt my hands But I had a delicious sense that I was doing something unusual and wonderful so I kept on climbing higher and higher until I reached a little seat which somebody had built there so long ago that it had grown part of the tree itself I sat there for a long long time feeling like a fairy on a rosy cloud After that I spent many happy hours in my tree of paradise thinking fair thoughts and dreaming bright dreams CHAPTER VI I had now the key to all language and I was eager to learn to use it Children who hear acquire language without any particular effort the words that fall from others lips they catch on the wing as it were delightedly while the little deaf child must trap them by a slow and often painful process But whatever the process the result is wonderful Gradually from naming an object we advance step by step until we have traversed the vast distance between our first stammered syllable and the sweep of thought in a line of Shakespeare At first when my teacher told me about a new thing I asked very few questions My ideas were vague and my vocabulary was inadequate but as my knowledge of things grew and I learned more and more words my field of inquiry broadened and I would return again and again to the same subject eager for further information Sometimes a new word revived an image that some earlier experience had engraved on my brain I remember the morning that I first asked the meaning of the word love This was before I knew many words I had found a few early violets in the garden and brought them to my teacher She tried to kiss me but at that time I did not like to have any one kiss me except my mother Miss Sullivan put her arm gently round me and spelled into my hand I love Helen What is love I asked She drew me closer to her and said It is here pointing to my heart whose beats I was conscious of for the first time Her words puzzled me very much because I did not then understand anything unless I touched it I smelt the violets in her hand and asked half in words half in signs a question which meant Is love the sweetness of flowers No said my teacher Again I thought The warm sun was shining on us Is this not love I asked pointing in the direction from which the heat came Is this not love It seemed to me that there could be nothing more beautiful than the sun whose warmth makes all things grow But Miss Sullivan shook her head and I was greatly puzzled and disappointed I thought it strange that my teacher could not show me love A day or two afterward I was stringing beads of different sizes in symmetrical groups two large beads three small ones and so on I had made many mistakes and Miss Sullivan had pointed them out again and again with gentle patience Finally I noticed a very obvious error in the sequence and for an instant I concentrated my attention on the lesson and tried to think how I should have arranged the beads Miss Sullivan touched my forehead and spelled with decided emphasis Think In a flash I knew that the word was the name of the process that was going on in my head This was my first conscious perception of an abstract idea For a long time I was still I was not thinking of the beads in my lap but trying to find a meaning for love in the light of this new idea The sun had been under a cloud all day and there had been brief showers but suddenly the sun broke forth in all its southern splendour Again I asked my teacher Is this not love Love is something like the clouds that were in the sky before the sun came out she replied Then in simpler words than these which at that time I could not have understood she explained You cannot touch the clouds you know but you feel the rain and know how glad the flowers and the thirsty earth are to have it after a hot day You cannot touch love either but you feel the sweetness that it pours into everything Without love you would not be happy or want to play The beautiful truth burst upon my mind I felt that there were invisible lines stretched between my spirit and the spirits of others From the beginning of my education Miss Sullivan made it a practice to speak to me as she would speak to any hearing child the only difference was that she spelled the sentences into my hand instead of speaking them If I did not know the words and idioms necessary to express my thoughts she supplied them even suggesting conversation when I was unable to keep up my end of the dialogue This process was continued for several years for the deaf child does not learn in a month or even in two or three years the numberless idioms and expressions used in the simplest daily intercourse The little hearing child learns these from constant repetition and imitation The conversation he hears in his home stimulates his mind and suggests topics and calls forth the spontaneous expression of his own thoughts This natural exchange of ideas is denied to the deaf child My teacher realizing this determined to supply the kinds of stimulus I lacked This she did by repeating to me as far as possible verbatim what she heard and by showing me how I could take part in the conversation But it was a long time before I ventured to take the initiative and still longer before I could find something appropriate to say at the right time The deaf and the blind find it very difficult to acquire the amenities of conversation How much more this difficulty must be augmented in the case of those who are both deaf and blind They cannot distinguish the tone of the voice or without assistance go up and down the gamut of tones that give significance to words nor can they watch the expression of the speaker s face and a look is often the very soul of what one says CHAPTER VII The next important step in my education was learning to read As soon as I could spell a few words my teacher gave me slips of cardboard on which were printed words in raised letters 
1092-134568-0001	train-other-500	I quickly learned that each printed word stood for an object an act or a quality I had a frame in which I could arrange the words in little sentences
none	none	 but before I ever put sentences in the frame I used to make them in objects I found the slips of paper which represented for example doll is on bed and placed each name on its object then I put my doll on the bed with the words is on bed arranged beside the doll thus making a sentence of the words 
1092-134568-0002	train-other-500	and at the same time carrying out the idea of the sentence with the things themselves One day Miss Sullivan tells me I pinned the word girl on my pinafore and stood in the wardrobe On the shelf I arranged the words is
1092-134568-0003	train-other-500	in wardrobe Nothing delighted me so much as this game
none	none	 My teacher and I played it for hours at a time 
1092-134568-0004	train-other-500	Often everything in the room was arranged in object sentences From the printed slip it was but a step to the printed book I took my Reader for Beginners and hunted for the words I knew
1092-134568-0005	train-other-500	when I found them my joy was like that of a game of hide and seek Thus I began to read Of the time when I began to read connected stories I shall speak later For a long time I had no regular lessons
1092-134568-0006	train-other-500	Even when I studied most earnestly it seemed more like play than work Everything Miss Sullivan taught me she illustrated by a beautiful story or a poem Whenever anything delighted or interested me
1092-134568-0007	train-other-500	she talked it over with me just as if she were a little girl herself What many children think of with dread as a painful plodding through grammar hard sums and harder definitions is to day one of my most precious memories
1092-134568-0008	train-other-500	I cannot explain the peculiar sympathy Miss Sullivan had with my pleasures and desires Perhaps it was the result of long association with the blind Added to this she had a wonderful faculty for description She went quickly over uninteresting details
1092-134568-0009	train-other-500	and never nagged me with questions to see if I remembered the day before yesterday s lesson She introduced dry technicalities of science little by little making every subject so real that I could not help remembering what she taught
1092-134568-0010	train-other-500	We read and studied out of doors preferring the sunlit woods to the house All my early lessons have in them the breath of the woods the fine resinous odour of pine needles blended with the perfume of wild grapes
none	none	 Seated in the gracious shade of a wild tulip tree I learned to think that everything has a lesson and a suggestion The loveliness of things taught me all their use Indeed everything that could hum or buzz or sing or bloom had a part in my education noisy throated frogs katydids and crickets held in my hand until forgetting their embarrassment they trilled their reedy note 
1092-134568-0011	train-other-500	little downy chickens and wildflowers the dogwood blossoms meadow violets and budding fruit trees
none	none	 I felt the bursting cotton bolls and fingered their soft fiber and fuzzy seeds I felt the low soughing of the wind through the cornstalks the silky rustling of the long leaves and the indignant snort of my pony as we caught him in the pasture and put the bit in his mouth 
1092-134568-0012	train-other-500	ah me how well I remember the spicy clovery smell of his breath
none	none	 Sometimes I rose at dawn and stole into the garden while the heavy dew lay on the grass and flowers 
1092-134568-0013	train-other-500	Few know what joy it is to feel the roses pressing softly into the hand
none	none	 or the beautiful motion of the lilies as they sway in the morning breeze 
1092-134568-0014	train-other-500	Sometimes I caught an insect in the flower I was plucking and I felt the faint noise of a pair of wings rubbed together in a sudden terror as the little creature became aware of a pressure from without
none	none	 Another favourite haunt of mine was the orchard where the fruit ripened early in July The large downy peaches would reach themselves into my hand and as the joyous breezes flew about the trees the apples tumbled at my feet Oh the delight with which I gathered up the fruit in my pinafore 
1092-134568-0015	train-other-500	pressed my face against the smooth cheeks of the apples still warm from the sun and skipped back to the house Our favourite walk was to Keller s Landing an old tumbledown lumber wharf on the Tennessee River used during the Civil War to land soldiers
1092-134568-0016	train-other-500	There we spent many happy hours and played at learning geography I built dams of pebbles made islands and lakes and dug river beds all for fun and never dreamed that I was learning a lesson I listened with increasing wonder
1092-134568-0017	train-other-500	to Miss Sullivan s descriptions of the great round world with its burning mountains buried cities moving rivers of ice and many other things as strange She made raised maps in clay so that I could feel the mountain ridges and valleys
1092-134568-0018	train-other-500	and follow with my fingers the devious course of rivers I liked this too
none	none	 but the division of the earth 
1092-134568-0019	train-other-500	into zones and poles confused and teased my mind
none	none	 The illustrative strings and the orange stick representing the poles seemed so real that even to this day the mere mention of temperate zone 
1092-134568-0020	train-other-500	suggests a series of twine circles and I believe that if any one should set about it he could convince me that white bears actually climb the North Pole
none	none	 Arithmetic seems to have been the only study I did not like 
1092-134568-0021	train-other-500	From the first I was not interested in the science of numbers Miss Sullivan tried to teach me to count by stringing beads in groups and by arranging kintergarten straws I learned to add and subtract
none	none	 I never had patience to arrange more than five or six groups at a time When I had accomplished this my conscience was at rest for the day and I went out quickly to find my playmates In this same leisurely manner 
1092-134568-0022	train-other-500	I studied zoology and botany Once a gentleman whose name I have forgotten sent me a collection of fossils tiny mollusk shells beautifully marked
none	none	 and bits of sandstone with the print of birds claws 
1092-134568-0023	train-other-500	and a lovely fern in bas relief These were the keys which unlocked the treasures of the antediluvian world for me With trembling fingers I listened to Miss Sullivan s descriptions of the terrible beasts with uncouth unpronounceable names
none	none	 which once went tramping through the primeval forests 
1092-134568-0024	train-other-500	tearing down the branches of gigantic trees for food and died in the dismal swamps of an unknown age For a long time these strange creatures haunted my dreams and this gloomy period formed a somber background to the joyous Now
1092-134568-0025	train-other-500	filled with sunshine and roses and echoing with the gentle beat of my pony s hoof Another time a beautiful shell was given me and with a child s surprise and delight I learned how a tiny mollusk had built the lustrous coil for his dwelling place
1092-134568-0026	train-other-500	and how on still nights when there is no breeze stirring the waves the Nautilus sails on the blue waters of the Indian Ocean in his ship of pearl
none	none	 After I had learned a great many interesting things about the life and habits of the children of the sea how in the midst of dashing waves the little polyps build the beautiful coral isles of the Pacific and the foraminifera have made the chalk hills of many a land my teacher read me The Chambered Nautilus and showed me that the shell building process of the mollusks is symbolical of the development of the mind 
1092-134568-0027	train-other-500	Just as the wonder working mantle of the Nautilus changes the material it absorbs from the water and makes it a part of itself so the bits of knowledge one gathers undergo a similar change and become pearls of thought Again it was the growth of a plant that furnished the text
1092-134568-0028	train-other-500	for a lesson We bought a lily and set it in a sunny window Very soon the green pointed buds showed signs of opening The slender fingerlike leaves on the outside opened slowly reluctant I thought
none	none	 to reveal the loveliness they hid 
1092-134568-0029	train-other-500	once having made a start however the opening process went on rapidly but in order and systematically There was always one bud larger and more beautiful than the rest which pushed her outer covering back with more pomp
1092-134568-0030	train-other-500	as if the beauty in soft silky robes knew that she was the lily queen by right divine while her more timid sisters doffed their green hoods shyly until the whole plant was one nodding bough of loveliness and fragrance
none	none	 Once there were eleven tadpoles in a glass globe set in a window full of plants I remember the eagerness with which I made discoveries about them It was great fun to plunge my hand into the bowl 
1092-134568-0031	train-other-500	and feel the tadpoles frisk about and to let them slip and slide between my fingers One day a more ambitious fellow leaped beyond the edge of the bowl and fell on the floor where I found him to all appearance more dead than alive
1092-134568-0032	train-other-500	The only sign of life was a slight wriggling of his tail But no sooner had he returned to his element than he darted to the bottom swimming round and round in joyous activity He had made his leap he had seen the great world
1092-134568-0033	train-other-500	and was content to stay in his pretty glass house under the big fuchsia tree until he attained the dignity of froghood Then he went to live in the leafy pool at the end of the garden where he made the summer nights musical with his quaint love song
1092-134568-0034	train-other-500	Thus I learned from life itself At the beginning I was only a little mass of possibilities It was my teacher who unfolded and developed them When she came everything about me breathed of love and joy and was full of meaning
1092-134568-0035	train-other-500	She has never since let pass an opportunity to point out the beauty that is in everything nor has she ceased
none	none	 trying in thought and action and example to make my life sweet and useful 
1092-134568-0036	train-other-500	It was my teacher s genius her quick sympathy her loving tact
none	none	 which made the first years of my education so beautiful It was because she seized the right moment to impart knowledge 
1092-134568-0037	train-other-500	that made it so pleasant and acceptable to me She realized that a child s mind is like a shallow brook which ripples and dances merrily over the stony course of its education and reflects here a flower there a bush yonder a fleecy cloud
1092-134568-0038	train-other-500	and she attempted to guide my mind on its way knowing that like a brook it should be fed by mountain streams and hidden springs until it broadened out into a deep river capable of reflecting in its placid surface
1092-134568-0039	train-other-500	billowy hills the luminous shadows of trees and the blue heavens as well as the sweet face of a little flower Any teacher can take a child to the classroom but not every teacher can make him learn
1092-134568-0040	train-other-500	He will not work joyously unless he feels that liberty is his whether he is busy or at rest he must feel the flush of victory and the heart sinking of disappointment before he takes with a will
1092-134568-0041	train-other-500	the tasks distasteful to him and resolves to dance his way bravely through a dull routine of textbooks My teacher is so near to me that I scarcely think of myself apart from her
none	none	 How much of my delight in all beautiful things is innate and how much is due to her influence I can never tell I feel that her being is inseparable from my own and that the footsteps of my life are in hers All the best of me belongs to her there is not a talent or an aspiration or a joy in me that has not been awakened by her loving touch CHAPTER VIII The first Christmas after Miss Sullivan came to Tuscumbia was a great event Every one in the family prepared surprises for me but what pleased me most Miss Sullivan and I prepared surprises for everybody else The mystery that surrounded the gifts was my greatest delight and amusement My friends did all they could to excite my curiosity by hints and half spelled sentences which they pretended to break off in the nick of time Miss Sullivan and I kept up a game of guessing which taught me more about the use of language than any set lessons could have done Every evening seated round a glowing wood fire we played our guessing game which grew more and more exciting as Christmas approached On Christmas Eve the Tuscumbia schoolchildren had their tree to which they invited me In the centre of the schoolroom stood a beautiful tree ablaze and shimmering in the soft light its branches loaded with strange wonderful fruit It was a moment of supreme happiness I danced and capered round the tree in an ecstasy When I learned that there was a gift for each child I was delighted and the kind people who had prepared the tree permitted me to hand the presents to the children In the pleasure of doing this I did not stop to look at my own gifts but when I was ready for them my impatience for the real Christmas to begin almost got beyond control I knew the gifts I already had were not those of which friends had thrown out such tantalizing hints and my teacher said the presents I was to have would be even nicer than these I was persuaded however to content myself with the gifts from the tree and leave the others until morning That night after I had hung my stocking I lay awake a long time pretending to be asleep and keeping alert to see what Santa Claus would do when he came At last I fell asleep with a new doll and a white bear in my arms Next morning it was I who waked the whole family with my first Merry Christmas I found surprises not in the stocking only but on the table on all the chairs at the door on the very window sill indeed I could hardly walk without stumbling on a bit of Christmas wrapped up in tissue paper But when my teacher presented me with a canary my cup of happiness overflowed Little Tim was so tame that he would hop on my finger and eat candied cherries out of my hand Miss Sullivan taught me to take all the care of my new pet Every morning after breakfast I prepared his bath made his cage clean and sweet filled his cups with fresh seed and water from the well house and hung a spray of chickweed in his swing One morning I left the cage on the window seat while I went to fetch water for his bath When I returned I felt a big cat brush past me as I opened the door At first I did not realize what had happened but when I put my hand in the cage and Tim s pretty wings did not meet my touch or his small pointed claws take hold of my finger I knew that I should never see my sweet little singer again CHAPTER IX The next important event in my life was my visit to Boston in May eighteen eighty eight As if it were yesterday I remember the preparations the departure with my teacher and my mother the journey and finally the arrival in Boston How different this journey was from the one I had made to Baltimore two years before I was no longer a restless excitable little creature requiring the attention of everybody on the train to keep me amused I sat quietly beside Miss Sullivan taking in with eager interest all that she told me about what she saw out of the car window the beautiful Tennessee River the great cotton fields the hills and woods and the crowds of laughing negroes at the stations who waved to the people on the train and brought delicious candy and popcorn balls through the car On the seat opposite me sat my big rag doll Nancy in a new gingham dress and a beruffled sunbonnet looking at me out of two bead eyes Sometimes when I was not absorbed in Miss Sullivan s descriptions I remembered Nancy s existence and took her up in my arms but I generally calmed my conscience by making myself believe that she was asleep As I shall not have occasion to refer to Nancy again I wish to tell here a sad experience she had soon after our arrival in Boston She was covered with dirt the remains of mud pies I had compelled her to eat although she had never shown any special liking for them The laundress at the Perkins Institution secretly carried her off to give her a bath This was too much for poor Nancy When I next saw her she was a formless heap of cotton which I should not have recognized at all except for the two bead eyes which looked out at me reproachfully When the train at last pulled into the station at Boston it was as if a beautiful fairy tale had come true The once upon a time was now the far away country was here We had scarcely arrived at the Perkins Institution for the Blind when I began to make friends with the little blind children It delighted me inexpressibly to find that they knew the manual alphabet What joy to talk with other children in my own language Until then I had been like a foreigner speaking through an interpreter In the school where Laura Bridgman was taught I was in my own country It took me some time to appreciate the fact that my new friends were blind I knew I could not see but it did not seem possible that all the eager loving children who gathered round me and joined heartily in my frolics were also blind I remember the surprise and the pain I felt as I noticed that they placed their hands over mine when I talked to them and that they read books with their fingers Although I had been told this before and although I understood my own deprivations yet I had thought vaguely that since they could hear they must have a sort of second sight and I was not prepared to find one child and another and yet another deprived of the same precious gift But they were so happy and contented that I lost all sense of pain in the pleasure of their companionship One day spent with the blind children made me feel thoroughly at home in my new environment and I looked eagerly from one pleasant experience to another as the days flew swiftly by I could not quite convince myself that there was much world left for I regarded Boston as the beginning and the end of creation While we were in Boston we visited Bunker Hill and there I had my first lesson in history The story of the brave men who had fought on the spot where we stood excited me greatly I climbed the monument counting the steps and wondering as I went higher and yet higher if the soldiers had climbed this great stairway and shot at the enemy on the ground below The next day we went to Plymouth by water This was my first trip on the ocean and my first voyage in a steamboat How full of life and motion it was But the rumble of the machinery made me think it was thundering and I began to cry because I feared if it rained we should not be able to have our picnic out of doors I was more interested I think in the great rock on which the Pilgrims landed than in anything else in Plymouth I could touch it and perhaps that made the coming of the Pilgrims and their toils and great deeds seem more real to me I have often held in my hand a little model of the Plymouth Rock which a kind gentleman gave me at Pilgrim Hall and I have fingered its curves the split in the centre and the embossed figures sixteen twenty and turned over in my mind all that I knew about the wonderful story of the Pilgrims How my childish imagination glowed with the splendour of their enterprise I idealized them as the bravest and most generous men that ever sought a home in a strange land I thought they desired the freedom of their fellow men as well as their own I was keenly surprised and disappointed years later to learn of their acts of persecution that make us tingle with shame even while we glory in the courage and energy that gave us our Country Beautiful Among the many friends I made in Boston were mister William Endicott and his daughter Their kindness to me was the seed from which many pleasant memories have since grown One day we visited their beautiful home at Beverly Farms I remember with delight how I went through their rose garden how their dogs big Leo and little curly haired Fritz with long ears came to meet me and how Nimrod the swiftest of the horses poked his nose into my hands for a pat and a lump of sugar I also remember the beach where for the first time I played in the sand It was hard smooth sand very different from the loose sharp sand mingled with kelp and shells at Brewster mister Endicott told me about the great ships that came sailing by from Boston bound for Europe I saw him many times after that and he was always a good friend to me indeed I was thinking of him when I called Boston the City of Kind Hearts CHAPTER X Just before the Perkins Institution closed for the summer it was arranged that my teacher and I should spend our vacation at Brewster on Cape Cod with our dear friend missus Hopkins I was delighted for my mind was full of the prospective joys and of the wonderful stories I had heard about the sea My most vivid recollection of that summer is the ocean I had always lived far inland and had never had so much as a whiff of salt air but I had read in a big book called Our World a description of the ocean which filled me with wonder and an intense longing to touch the mighty sea and feel it roar So my little heart leaped high with eager excitement when I knew that my wish was at last to be realized No sooner had I been helped into my bathing suit than I sprang out upon the warm sand and without thought of fear plunged into the cool water I felt the great billows rock and sink The buoyant motion of the water filled me with an exquisite quivering joy Suddenly my ecstasy gave place to terror for my foot struck against a rock and the next instant there was a rush of water over my head I thrust out my hands to grasp some support I clutched at the water and at the seaweed which the waves tossed in my face But all my frantic efforts were in vain The waves seemed to be playing a game with me and tossed me from one to another in their wild frolic It was fearful The good firm earth had slipped from my feet and everything seemed shut out from this strange all enveloping element life air warmth and love At last however the sea as if weary of its new toy threw me back on the shore and in another instant I was clasped in my teacher s arms Oh the comfort of the long tender embrace As soon as I had recovered from my panic sufficiently to say anything I demanded Who put salt in the water After I had recovered from my first experience in the water I thought it great fun to sit on a big rock in my bathing suit and feel wave after wave dash against the rock sending up a shower of spray which quite covered me I felt the pebbles rattling as the waves threw their ponderous weight against the shore the whole beach seemed racked by their terrific onset and the air throbbed with their pulsations The breakers would swoop back to gather themselves for a mightier leap and I clung to the rock tense fascinated as I felt the dash and roar of the rushing sea I could never stay long enough on the shore The tang of the untainted fresh and free sea air was like a cool quieting thought and the shells and pebbles and the seaweed with tiny living creatures attached to it never lost their fascination for me One day Miss Sullivan attracted my attention to a strange object which she had captured basking in the shallow water It was a great horseshoe crab the first one I had ever seen I felt of him and thought it very strange that he should carry his house on his back It suddenly occurred to me that he might make a delightful pet so I seized him by the tail with both hands and carried him home This feat pleased me highly as his body was very heavy and it took all my strength to drag him half a mile I would not leave Miss Sullivan in peace until she had put the crab in a trough near the well where I was confident he would be secure But next morning I went to the trough and lo he had disappeared Nobody knew where he had gone or how he had escaped My disappointment was bitter at the time but little by little I came to realize that it was not kind or wise to force this poor dumb creature out of his element and after awhile I felt happy in the thought that perhaps he had returned to the sea CHAPTER XI In the autumn I returned to my Southern home with a heart full of joyous memories As I recall that visit North I am filled with wonder at the richness and variety of the experiences that cluster about it It seems to have been the beginning of everything The treasures of a new beautiful world were laid at my feet and I took in pleasure and information at every turn I lived myself into all things I was never still a moment my life was as full of motion as those little insects that crowd a whole existence into one brief day I met many people who talked with me by spelling into my hand and thought in joyous sympathy leaped up to meet thought and behold a miracle had been wrought The barren places between my mind and the minds of others blossomed like the rose I spent the autumn months with my family at our summer cottage on a mountain about fourteen miles from Tuscumbia It was called Fern Quarry because near it there was a limestone quarry long since abandoned Three frolicsome little streams ran through it from springs in the rocks above leaping here and tumbling there in laughing cascades wherever the rocks tried to bar their way The opening was filled with ferns which completely covered the beds of limestone and in places hid the streams The rest of the mountain was thickly wooded Here were great oaks and splendid evergreens with trunks like mossy pillars from the branches of which hung garlands of ivy and mistletoe and persimmon trees the odour of which pervaded every nook and corner of the wood an illusive fragrant something that made the heart glad In places the wild muscadine and scuppernong vines stretched from tree to tree making arbours which were always full of butterflies and buzzing insects It was delightful to lose ourselves in the green hollows of that tangled wood in the late afternoon and to smell the cool delicious odours that came up from the earth at the close of day Our cottage was a sort of rough camp beautifully situated on the top of the mountain among oaks and pines The small rooms were arranged on each side of a long open hall Round the house was a wide piazza where the mountain winds blew sweet with all wood scents We lived on the piazza most of the time there we worked ate and played At the back door there was a great butternut tree round which the steps had been built and in front the trees stood so close that I could touch them and feel the wind shake their branches or the leaves twirl downward in the autumn blast Many visitors came to Fern Quarry In the evening by the campfire the men played cards and whiled away the hours in talk and sport They told stories of their wonderful feats with fowl fish and quadruped how many wild ducks and turkeys they had shot what savage trout they had caught and how they had bagged the craftiest foxes outwitted the most clever possums and overtaken the fleetest deer until I thought that surely the lion the tiger the bear and the rest of the wild tribe would not be able to stand before these wily hunters To morrow to the chase was their good night shout as the circle of merry friends broke up for the night The men slept in the hall outside our door and I could feel the deep breathing of the dogs and the hunters as they lay on their improvised beds At dawn I was awakened by the smell of coffee the rattling of guns and the heavy footsteps of the men as they strode about promising themselves the greatest luck of the season I could also feel the stamping of the horses which they had ridden out from town and hitched under the trees where they stood all night neighing loudly impatient to be off At last the men mounted and as they say in the old songs away went the steeds with bridles ringing and whips cracking and hounds racing ahead and away went the champion hunters with hark and whoop and wild halloo Later in the morning we made preparations for a barbecue A fire was kindled at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground big sticks were laid crosswise at the top and meat was hung from them and turned on spits Around the fire squatted negroes driving away the flies with long branches The savoury odour of the meat made me hungry long before the tables were set When the bustle and excitement of preparation was at its height the hunting party made its appearance struggling in by twos and threes the men hot and weary the horses covered with foam and the jaded hounds panting and dejected and not a single kill Every man declared that he had seen at least one deer and that the animal had come very close but however hotly the dogs might pursue the game however well the guns might be aimed at the snap of the trigger there was not a deer in sight They had been as fortunate as the little boy who said he came very near seeing a rabbit he saw his tracks The party soon forgot its disappointment however and we sat down not to venison but to a tamer feast of veal and roast pig One summer I had my pony at Fern Quarry I called him Black Beauty as I had just read the book and he resembled his namesake in every way from his glossy black coat to the white star on his forehead I spent many of my happiest hours on his back Occasionally when it was quite safe my teacher would let go the leading rein and the pony sauntered on or stopped at his sweet will to eat grass or nibble the leaves of the trees that grew beside the narrow trail On mornings when I did not care for the ride my teacher and I would start after breakfast for a ramble in the woods and allow ourselves to get lost amid the trees and vines with no road to follow except the paths made by cows and horses Frequently we came upon impassable thickets which forced us to take a round about way We always returned to the cottage with armfuls of laurel goldenrod ferns and gorgeous swamp flowers such as grow only in the South Sometimes I would go with Mildred and my little cousins to gather persimmons I did not eat them but I loved their fragrance and enjoyed hunting for them in the leaves and grass We also went nutting and I helped them open the chestnut burrs and break the shells of hickory nuts and walnuts the big sweet walnuts At the foot of the mountain there was a railroad and the children watched the trains whiz by Sometimes a terrific whistle brought us to the steps and Mildred told me in great excitement that a cow or a horse had strayed on the track About a mile distant there was a trestle spanning a deep gorge It was very difficult to walk over the ties were wide apart and so narrow that one felt as if one were walking on knives I had never crossed it until one day Mildred Miss Sullivan and I were lost in the woods and wandered for hours without finding a path Suddenly Mildred pointed with her little hand and exclaimed There s the trestle We would have taken any way rather than this but it was late and growing dark and the trestle was a short cut home I had to feel for the rails with my toe but I was not afraid and got on very well until all at once there came a faint puff puff from the distance I see the train cried Mildred and in another minute it would have been upon us had we not climbed down on the crossbraces while it rushed over our heads I felt the hot breath from the engine on my face and the smoke and ashes almost choked us As the train rumbled by the trestle shook and swayed until I thought we should be dashed to the chasm below With the utmost difficulty we regained the track Long after dark we reached home and found the cottage empty the family were all out hunting for us CHAPTER XII After my first visit to Boston I spent almost every winter in the North Once I went on a visit to a New England village with its frozen lakes and vast snow fields It was then that I had opportunities such as had never been mine to enter into the treasures of the snow I recall my surprise on discovering that a mysterious hand had stripped the trees and bushes leaving only here and there a wrinkled leaf The birds had flown and their empty nests in the bare trees were filled with snow Winter was on hill and field The earth seemed benumbed by his icy touch and the very spirits of the trees had withdrawn to their roots and there curled up in the dark lay fast asleep All life seemed to have ebbed away and even when the sun shone the day was Shrunk and cold As if her veins were sapless and old And she rose up decrepitly For a last dim look at earth and sea The withered grass and the bushes were transformed into a forest of icicles Then came a day when the chill air portended a snowstorm We rushed out of doors to feel the first few tiny flakes descending Hour by hour the flakes dropped silently softly from their airy height to the earth and the country became more and more level A snowy night closed upon the world and in the morning one could scarcely recognize a feature of the landscape All the roads were hidden not a single landmark was visible only a waste of snow with trees rising out of it In the evening a wind from the northeast sprang up and the flakes rushed hither and thither in furious melee Around the great fire we sat and told merry tales and frolicked and quite forgot that we were in the midst of a desolate solitude shut in from all communication with the outside world But during the night the fury of the wind increased to such a degree that it thrilled us with a vague terror The rafters creaked and strained and the branches of the trees surrounding the house rattled and beat against the windows as the winds rioted up and down the country On the third day after the beginning of the storm the snow ceased The sun broke through the clouds and shone upon a vast undulating white plain High mounds pyramids heaped in fantastic shapes and impenetrable drifts lay scattered in every direction Narrow paths were shoveled through the drifts I put on my cloak and hood and went out The air stung my cheeks like fire Half walking in the paths half working our way through the lesser drifts we succeeded in reaching a pine grove just outside a broad pasture The trees stood motionless and white like figures in a marble frieze There was no odour of pine needles The rays of the sun fell upon the trees so that the twigs sparkled like diamonds and dropped in showers when we touched them So dazzling was the light it penetrated even the darkness that veils my eyes As the days wore on the drifts gradually shrunk but before they were wholly gone another storm came so that I scarcely felt the earth under my feet once all winter At intervals the trees lost their icy covering and the bulrushes and underbrush were bare but the lake lay frozen and hard beneath the sun Our favourite amusement during that winter was tobogganing In places the shore of the lake rises abruptly from the water s edge Down these steep slopes we used to coast We would get on our toboggan a boy would give us a shove and off we went Plunging through drifts leaping hollows swooping down upon the lake we would shoot across its gleaming surface to the opposite bank What joy What exhilarating madness For one wild glad moment we snapped the chain that binds us to earth and joining hands with the winds we felt ourselves divine CHAPTER XIII It was in the spring of eighteen ninety that I learned to speak The impulse to utter audible sounds had always been strong within me I used to make noises keeping one hand on my throat while the other hand felt the movements of my lips I was pleased with anything that made a noise and liked to feel the cat purr and the dog bark I also liked to keep my hand on a singer s throat or on a piano when it was being played Before I lost my sight and hearing I was fast learning to talk but after my illness it was found that I had ceased to speak because I could not hear I used to sit in my mother s lap all day long and keep my hands on her face because it amused me to feel the motions of her lips and I moved my lips too although I had forgotten what talking was My friends say that I laughed and cried naturally and for awhile I made many sounds and word elements not because they were a means of communication but because the need of exercising my vocal organs was imperative There was however one word the meaning of which I still remembered WATER I pronounced it wa wa Even this became less and less intelligible until the time when Miss Sullivan began to teach me I stopped using it only after I had learned to spell the word on my fingers I had known for a long time that the people about me used a method of communication different from mine and even before I knew that a deaf child could be taught to speak I was conscious of dissatisfaction with the means of communication I already possessed One who is entirely dependent upon the manual alphabet has always a sense of restraint of narrowness This feeling began to agitate me with a vexing forward reaching sense of a lack that should be filled My thoughts would often rise and beat up like birds against the wind and I persisted in using my lips and voice Friends tried to discourage this tendency fearing lest it would lead to disappointment But I persisted and an accident soon occurred which resulted in the breaking down of this great barrier I heard the story of Ragnhild Kaata In eighteen ninety missus Lamson who had been one of Laura Bridgman s teachers and who had just returned from a visit to Norway and Sweden came to see me and told me of Ragnhild Kaata a deaf and blind girl in Norway who had actually been taught to speak missus Lamson had scarcely finished telling me about this girl s success before I was on fire with eagerness I resolved that I too would learn to speak I would not rest satisfied until my teacher took me for advice and assistance to Miss Sarah Fuller principal of the Horace Mann School This lovely sweet natured lady offered to teach me herself and we began the twenty sixth of March eighteen ninety Miss Fuller s method was this she passed my hand lightly over her face and let me feel the position of her tongue and lips when she made a sound I was eager to imitate every motion and in an hour had learned six elements of speech M P A S T I Miss Fuller gave me eleven lessons in all I shall never forget the surprise and delight I felt when I uttered my first connected sentence It is warm True they were broken and stammering syllables but they were human speech My soul conscious of new strength came out of bondage and was reaching through those broken symbols of speech to all knowledge and all faith No deaf child who has earnestly tried to speak the words which he has never heard to come out of the prison of silence where no tone of love no song of bird no strain of music ever pierces the stillness can forget the thrill of surprise the joy of discovery which came over him when he uttered his first word Only such a one can appreciate the eagerness with which I talked to my toys to stones trees birds and dumb animals or the delight I felt when at my call Mildred ran to me or my dogs obeyed my commands It is an unspeakable boon to me to be able to speak in winged words that need no interpretation As I talked happy thoughts fluttered up out of my words that might perhaps have struggled in vain to escape my fingers But it must not be supposed that I could really talk in this short time I had learned only the elements of speech Miss Fuller and Miss Sullivan could understand me but most people would not have understood one word in a hundred Nor is it true that after I had learned these elements I did the rest of the work myself But for Miss Sullivan s genius untiring perseverance and devotion I could not have progressed as far as I have toward natural speech In the first place I laboured night and day before I could be understood even by my most intimate friends in the second place I needed Miss Sullivan s assistance constantly in my efforts to articulate each sound clearly and to combine all sounds in a thousand ways Even now she calls my attention every day to mispronounced words All teachers of the deaf know what this means and only they can at all appreciate the peculiar difficulties with which I had to contend In reading my teacher s lips I was wholly dependent on my fingers I had to use the sense of touch in catching the vibrations of the throat the movements of the mouth and the expression of the face and often this sense was at fault In such cases I was forced to repeat the words or sentences sometimes for hours until I felt the proper ring in my own voice My work was practice practice practice Discouragement and weariness cast me down frequently but the next moment the thought that I should soon be at home and show my loved ones what I had accomplished spurred me on and I eagerly looked forward to their pleasure in my achievement My little sister will understand me now was a thought stronger than all obstacles I used to repeat ecstatically I am not dumb now I could not be despondent while I anticipated the delight of talking to my mother and reading her responses from her lips It astonished me to find how much easier it is to talk than to spell with the fingers and I discarded the manual alphabet as a medium of communication on my part but Miss Sullivan and a few friends still use it in speaking to me for it is more convenient and more rapid than lip reading Just here perhaps I had better explain our use of the manual alphabet which seems to puzzle people who do not know us One who reads or talks to me spells with his hand using the single hand manual alphabet generally employed by the deaf I place my hand on the hand of the speaker so lightly as not to impede its movements The position of the hand is as easy to feel as it is to see I do not feel each letter any more than you see each letter separately when you read Constant practice makes the fingers very flexible and some of my friends spell rapidly about as fast as an expert writes on a typewriter The mere spelling is of course no more a conscious act than it is in writing When I had made speech my own I could not wait to go home At last the happiest of happy moments arrived I had made my homeward journey talking constantly to Miss Sullivan not for the sake of talking but determined to improve to the last minute Almost before I knew it the train stopped at the Tuscumbia station and there on the platform stood the whole family My eyes fill with tears now as I think how my mother pressed me close to her speechless and trembling with delight taking in every syllable that I spoke while little Mildred seized my free hand and kissed it and danced and my father expressed his pride and affection in a big silence It was as if Isaiah s prophecy had been fulfilled in me The mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands CHAPTER XIV The winter of eighteen ninety two was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood s bright sky Joy deserted my heart and for a long long time I lived in doubt anxiety and fear Books lost their charm for me and even now the thought of those dreadful days chills my heart A little story called The Frost King which I wrote and sent to mister Anagnos of the Perkins Institution for the Blind was at the root of the trouble In order to make the matter clear I must set forth the facts connected with this episode which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to relate I wrote the story when I was at home the autumn after I had learned to speak We had stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual While we were there Miss Sullivan had described to me the beauties of the late foliage and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of a story which must have been read to me and which I must have unconsciously retained I thought then that I was making up a story as children say and I eagerly sat down to write it before the ideas should slip from me My thoughts flowed easily I felt a sense of joy in the composition Words and images came tripping to my finger ends and as I thought out sentence after sentence I wrote them on my braille slate Now if words and images come to me without effort it is a pretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind but stray waifs that I regretfully dismiss At that time I eagerly absorbed everything I read without a thought of authorship and even now I cannot be quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in books I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me through the medium of others eyes and ears When the story was finished I read it to my teacher and I recall now vividly the pleasure I felt in the more beautiful passages and my annoyance at being interrupted to have the pronunciation of a word corrected At dinner it was read to the assembled family who were surprised that I could write so well Some one asked me if I had read it in a book This question surprised me very much for I had not the faintest recollection of having had it read to me I spoke up and said Oh no it is my story and I have written it for mister Anagnos Accordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday It was suggested that I should change the title from Autumn Leaves to The Frost King which I did I carried the little story to the post office myself feeling as if I were walking on air I little dreamed how cruelly I should pay for that birthday gift mister Anagnos was delighted with The Frost King and published it in one of the Perkins Institution reports This was the pinnacle of my happiness from which I was in a little while dashed to earth I had been in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story similar to The Frost King called The Frost Fairies by Miss Margaret T Canby had appeared before I was born in a book called Birdie and His Friends The two stories were so much alike in thought and language that it was evident Miss Canby s story had been read to me and that mine was a plagiarism It was difficult to make me understand this but when I did understand I was astonished and grieved No child ever drank deeper of the cup of bitterness than I did I had disgraced myself I had brought suspicion upon those I loved best And yet how could it possibly have happened I racked my brain until I was weary to recall anything about the frost that I had read before I wrote The Frost King but I could remember nothing except the common reference to Jack Frost and a poem for children The Freaks of the Frost and I knew I had not used that in my composition At first mister Anagnos though deeply troubled seemed to believe me He was unusually tender and kind to me and for a brief space the shadow lifted To please him I tried not to be unhappy and to make myself as pretty as possible for the celebration of Washington s birthday which took place very soon after I received the sad news I was to be Ceres in a kind of masque given by the blind girls How well I remember the graceful draperies that enfolded me the bright autumn leaves that wreathed my head and the fruit and grain at my feet and in my hands and beneath all the piety of the masque the oppressive sense of coming ill that made my heart heavy The night before the celebration one of the teachers of the Institution had asked me a question connected with The Frost King and I was telling her that Miss Sullivan had talked to me about Jack Frost and his wonderful works Something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession that I did remember Miss Canby s story of The Frost Fairies and she laid her conclusions before mister Anagnos although I had told her most emphatically that she was mistaken mister Anagnos who loved me tenderly thinking that he had been deceived turned a deaf ear to the pleadings of love and innocence He believed or at least suspected that Miss Sullivan and I had deliberately stolen the bright thoughts of another and imposed them on him to win his admiration I was brought before a court of investigation composed of the teachers and officers of the Institution and Miss Sullivan was asked to leave me Then I was questioned and cross questioned with what seemed to me a determination on the part of my judges to force me to acknowledge that I remembered having had The Frost Fairies read to me I felt in every question the doubt and suspicion that was in their minds and I felt too that a loved friend was looking at me reproachfully although I could not have put all this into words The blood pressed about my thumping heart and I could scarcely speak except in monosyllables Even the consciousness that it was only a dreadful mistake did not lessen my suffering and when at last I was allowed to leave the room I was dazed and did not notice my teacher s caresses or the tender words of my friends who said I was a brave little girl and they were proud of me As I lay in my bed that night I wept as I hope few children have wept I felt so cold I imagined I should die before morning and the thought comforted me I think if this sorrow had come to me when I was older it would have broken my spirit beyond repairing But the angel of forgetfulness has gathered up and carried away much of the misery and all the bitterness of those sad days Miss Sullivan had never heard of The Frost Fairies or of the book in which it was published With the assistance of doctor Alexander Graham Bell she investigated the matter carefully and at last it came out that missus Sophia C Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby s Birdie and His Friends in eighteen eighty eight the year that we spent the summer with her at Brewster missus Hopkins was unable to find her copy but she has told me that at that time while Miss Sullivan was away on a vacation she tried to amuse me by reading from various books and although she could not remember reading The Frost Fairies any more than I yet she felt sure that Birdie and His Friends was one of them She explained the disappearance of the book by the fact that she had a short time before sold her house and disposed of many juvenile books such as old schoolbooks and fairy tales and that Birdie and His Friends was probably among them The stories had little or no meaning for me then but the mere spelling of the strange words was sufficient to amuse a little child who could do almost nothing to amuse herself and although I do not recall a single circumstance connected with the reading of the stories yet I cannot help thinking that I made a great effort to remember the words with the intention of having my teacher explain them when she returned One thing is certain the language was ineffaceably stamped upon my brain though for a long time no one knew it least of all myself When Miss Sullivan came back I did not speak to her about The Frost Fairies probably because she began at once to read Little Lord Fauntleroy which filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else But the fact remains that Miss Canby s story was read to me once and that long after I had forgotten it it came back to me so naturally that I never suspected that it was the child of another mind In my trouble I received many messages of love and sympathy All the friends I loved best except one have remained my own to the present time Miss Canby herself wrote kindly Some day you will write a great story out of your own head that will be a comfort and help to many But this kind prophecy has never been fulfilled I have never played with words again for the mere pleasure of the game Indeed I have ever since been tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own For a long time when I wrote a letter even to my mother I was seized with a sudden feeling of terror and I would spell the sentences over and over to make sure that I had not read them in a book Had it not been for the persistent encouragement of Miss Sullivan I think I should have given up trying to write altogether I have read The Frost Fairies since also the letters I wrote in which I used other ideas of Miss Canby s I find in one of them a letter to mister Anagnos dated September twenty nine eighteen ninety one words and sentiments exactly like those of the book At the time I was writing The Frost King and this letter like many others contains phrases which show that my mind was saturated with the story I represent my teacher as saying to me of the golden autumn leaves Yes they are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer an idea direct from Miss Canby s story This habit of assimilating what pleased me and giving it out again as my own appears in much of my early correspondence and my first attempts at writing In a composition which I wrote about the old cities of Greece and Italy I borrowed my glowing descriptions with variations from sources I have forgotten I knew mister Anagnos s great love of antiquity and his enthusiastic appreciation of all beautiful sentiments about Italy and Greece I therefore gathered from all the books I read every bit of poetry or of history that I thought would give him pleasure mister Anagnos in speaking of my composition on the cities has said These ideas are poetic in their essence But I do not understand how he ever thought a blind and deaf child of eleven could have invented them Yet I cannot think that because I did not originate the ideas my little composition is therefore quite devoid of interest It shows me that I could express my appreciation of beautiful and poetic ideas in clear and animated language Those early compositions were mental gymnastics I was learning as all young and inexperienced persons learn by assimilation and imitation to put ideas into words Everything I found in books that pleased me I retained in my memory consciously or unconsciously and adapted it The young writer as Stevenson has said instinctively tries to copy whatever seems most admirable and he shifts his admiration with astonishing versatility It is only after years of this sort of practice that even great men have learned to marshal the legion of words which come thronging through every byway of the mind I am afraid I have not yet completed this process It is certain that I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind Consequently in nearly all that I write I produce something which very much resembles the crazy patchwork I used to make when I first learned to sew This patchwork was made of all sorts of odds and ends pretty bits of silk and velvet but the coarse pieces that were not pleasant to touch always predominated Likewise my compositions are made up of crude notions of my own inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions of the authors I have read It seems to me that the great difficulty of writing is to make the language of the educated mind express our confused ideas half feelings half thoughts when we are little more than bundles of instinctive tendencies Trying to write is very much like trying to put a Chinese puzzle together We have a pattern in mind which we wish to work out in words but the words will not fit the spaces or if they do they will not match the design But we keep on trying because we know that others have succeeded and we are not willing to acknowledge defeat There is no way to become original except to be born so says Stevenson and although I may not be original I hope sometime to outgrow my artificial periwigged compositions Then perhaps my own thoughts and experiences will come to the surface Meanwhile I trust and hope and persevere and try not to let the bitter memory of The Frost King trammel my efforts So this sad experience may have done me good and set me thinking on some of the problems of composition My only regret is that it resulted in the loss of one of my dearest friends mister Anagnos Since the publication of The Story of My Life in the Ladies Home Journal mister Anagnos has made a statement in a letter to mister Macy that at the time of the Frost King matter he believed I was innocent He says the court of investigation before which I was brought consisted of eight people four blind four seeing persons Four of them he says thought I knew that Miss Canby s story had been read to me and the others did not hold this view mister Anagnos states that he cast his vote with those who were favourable to me But however the case may have been with whichever side he may have cast his vote when I went into the room where mister Anagnos had so often held me on his knee and forgetting his many cares had shared in my frolics and found there persons who seemed to doubt me I felt that there was something hostile and menacing in the very atmosphere and subsequent events have borne out this impression For two years he seems to have held the belief that Miss Sullivan and I were innocent Then he evidently retracted his favourable judgment why I do not know Nor did I know the details of the investigation I never knew even the names of the members of the court who did not speak to me I was too excited to notice anything too frightened to ask questions Indeed I could scarcely think what I was saying or what was being said to me I have given this account of the Frost King affair because it was important in my life and education and in order that there might be no misunderstanding I have set forth all the facts as they appear to me without a thought of defending myself or of laying blame on any one CHAPTER XV The summer and winter following the Frost King incident I spent with my family in Alabama I recall with delight that home going Everything had budded and blossomed I was happy The Frost King was forgotten When the ground was strewn with the crimson and golden leaves of autumn and the musk scented grapes that covered the arbour at the end of the garden were turning golden brown in the sunshine I began to write a sketch of my life a year after I had written The Frost King I was still excessively scrupulous about everything I wrote The thought that what I wrote might not be absolutely my own tormented me No one knew of these fears except my teacher A strange sensitiveness prevented me from referring to the Frost King and often when an idea flashed out in the course of conversation I would spell softly to her I am not sure it is mine At other times in the midst of a paragraph I was writing I said to myself Suppose it should be found that all this was written by some one long ago An impish fear clutched my hand so that I could not write any more that day And even now I sometimes feel the same uneasiness and disquietude Miss Sullivan consoled and helped me in every way she could think of but the terrible experience I had passed through left a lasting impression on my mind the significance of which I am only just beginning to understand It was with the hope of restoring my self confidence that she persuaded me to write for the Youth s Companion a brief account of my life I was then twelve years old As I look back on my struggle to write that little story it seems to me that I must have had a prophetic vision of the good that would come of the undertaking or I should surely have failed I wrote timidly fearfully but resolutely urged on by my teacher who knew that if I persevered I should find my mental foothold again and get a grip on my faculties Up to the time of the Frost King episode I had lived the unconscious life of a little child now my thoughts were turned inward and I beheld things invisible Gradually I emerged from the penumbra of that experience with a mind made clearer by trial and with a truer knowledge of life The chief events of the year eighteen ninety three were my trip to Washington during the inauguration of President Cleveland and visits to Niagara and the World s Fair Under such circumstances my studies were constantly interrupted and often put aside for many weeks so that it is impossible for me to give a connected account of them We went to Niagara in March eighteen ninety three It is difficult to describe my emotions when I stood on the point which overhangs the American Falls and felt the air vibrate and the earth tremble It seems strange to many people that I should be impressed by the wonders and beauties of Niagara They are always asking What does this beauty or that music mean to you You cannot see the waves rolling up the beach or hear their roar What do they mean to you In the most evident sense they mean everything I cannot fathom or define their meaning any more than I can fathom or define love or religion or goodness During the summer of eighteen ninety three Miss Sullivan and I visited the World s Fair with doctor Alexander Graham Bell I recall with unmixed delight those days when a thousand childish fancies became beautiful realities Every day in imagination I made a trip round the world and I saw many wonders from the uttermost parts of the earth marvels of invention treasuries of industry and skill and all the activities of human life actually passed under my finger tips I liked to visit the Midway Plaisance It seemed like the Arabian Nights it was crammed so full of novelty and interest Here was the India of my books in the curious bazaar with its Shivas and elephant gods there was the land of the Pyramids concentrated in a model Cairo with its mosques and its long processions of camels yonder were the lagoons of Venice where we sailed every evening when the city and the fountains were illuminated I also went on board a Viking ship which lay a short distance from the little craft I had been on a man of war before in Boston and it interested me to see on this Viking ship how the seaman was once all in all how he sailed and took storm and calm alike with undaunted heart and gave chase to whosoever reechoed his cry We are of the sea and fought with brains and sinews self reliant self sufficient instead of being thrust into the background by unintelligent machinery as Jack is to day So it always is man only is interesting to man At a little distance from this ship there was a model of the Santa Maria which I also examined The captain showed me Columbus s cabin and the desk with an hour glass on it This small instrument impressed me most because it made me think how weary the heroic navigator must have felt as he saw the sand dropping grain by grain while desperate men were plotting against his life mister Higinbotham President of the World s Fair kindly gave me permission to touch the exhibits and with an eagerness as insatiable as that with which Pizarro seized the treasures of Peru I took in the glories of the Fair with my fingers It was a sort of tangible kaleidoscope this white city of the West Everything fascinated me especially the French bronzes They were so lifelike I thought they were angel visions which the artist had caught and bound in earthly forms At the Cape of Good Hope exhibit I learned much about the processes of mining diamonds Whenever it was possible I touched the machinery while it was in motion so as to get a clearer idea how the stones were weighed cut and polished I searched in the washings for a diamond and found it myself the only true diamond they said that was ever found in the United States doctor Bell went everywhere with us and in his own delightful way described to me the objects of greatest interest In the electrical building we examined the telephones autophones phonographs and other inventions and he made me understand how it is possible to send a message on wires that mock space and outrun time and like Prometheus to draw fire from the sky We also visited the anthropological department and I was much interested in the relics of ancient Mexico in the rude stone implements that are so often the only record of an age the simple monuments of nature s unlettered children so I thought as I fingered them that seem bound to last while the memorials of kings and sages crumble in dust away and in the Egyptian mummies which I shrank from touching From these relics I learned more about the progress of man than I have heard or read since All these experiences added a great many new terms to my vocabulary and in the three weeks I spent at the Fair I took a long leap from the little child s interest in fairy tales and toys to the appreciation of the real and the earnest in the workaday world CHAPTER XVI Before October eighteen ninety three I had studied various subjects by myself in a more or less desultory manner I read the histories of Greece Rome and the United States I had a French grammar in raised print and as I already knew some French I often amused myself by composing in my head short exercises using the new words as I came across them and ignoring rules and other technicalities as much as possible I even tried without aid to master the French pronunciation as I found all the letters and sounds described in the book Of course this was tasking slender powers for great ends but it gave me something to do on a rainy day and I acquired a sufficient knowledge of French to read with pleasure La Fontaine s Fables Le Medecin Malgre Lui and passages from Athalie I also gave considerable time to the improvement of my speech I read aloud to Miss Sullivan and recited passages from my favourite poets which I had committed to memory she corrected my pronunciation and helped me to phrase and inflect It was not however until October eighteen ninety three after I had recovered from the fatigue and excitement of my visit to the World s Fair that I began to have lessons in special subjects at fixed hours Miss Sullivan and I were at that time in Hulton Pennsylvania visiting the family of mister William Wade mister Irons a neighbour of theirs was a good Latin scholar it was arranged that I should study under him I remember him as a man of rare sweet nature and of wide experience He taught me Latin grammar principally but he often helped me in arithmetic which I found as troublesome as it was uninteresting mister Irons also read with me Tennyson s In Memoriam I had read many books before but never from a critical point of view I learned for the first time to know an author to recognize his style as I recognize the clasp of a friend s hand At first I was rather unwilling to study Latin grammar It seemed absurd to waste time analyzing every word I came across noun genitive singular feminine when its meaning was quite plain I thought I might just as well describe my pet in order to know it order vertebrate division quadruped class mammalia genus felinus species cat individual Tabby But as I got deeper into the subject I became more interested and the beauty of the language delighted me I often amused myself by reading Latin passages picking up words I understood and trying to make sense I have never ceased to enjoy this pastime There is nothing more beautiful I think than the evanescent fleeting images and sentiments presented by a language one is just becoming familiar with ideas that flit across the mental sky shaped and tinted by capricious fancy Miss Sullivan sat beside me at my lessons spelling into my hand whatever mister Irons said and looking up new words for me I was just beginning to read Caesar s Gallic War when I went to my home in Alabama CHAPTER XVII In the summer of eighteen ninety four I attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf There it was arranged that I should go to the Wright Humason School for the Deaf in New York City I went there in October eighteen ninety four accompanied by Miss Sullivan This school was chosen especially for the purpose of obtaining the highest advantages in vocal culture and training in lip reading In addition to my work in these subjects I studied during the two years I was in the school arithmetic physical geography French and German Miss Reamy my German teacher could use the manual alphabet and after I had acquired a small vocabulary we talked together in German whenever we had a chance and in a few months I could understand almost everything she said Before the end of the first year I read Wilhelm Tell with the greatest delight Indeed I think I made more progress in German than in any of my other studies I found French much more difficult I studied it with Madame Olivier a French lady who did not know the manual alphabet and who was obliged to give her instruction orally I could not read her lips easily so my progress was much slower than in German I managed however to read Le Medecin Malgre Lui again It was very amusing but I did not like it nearly so well as Wilhelm Tell My progress in lip reading and speech was not what my teachers and I had hoped and expected it would be It was my ambition to speak like other people and my teachers believed that this could be accomplished but although we worked hard and faithfully yet we did not quite reach our goal I suppose we aimed too high and disappointment was therefore inevitable I still regarded arithmetic as a system of pitfalls I hung about the dangerous frontier of guess avoiding with infinite trouble to myself and others the broad valley of reason When I was not guessing I was jumping at conclusions and this fault in addition to my dullness aggravated my difficulties more than was right or necessary But although these disappointments caused me great depression at times I pursued my other studies with unflagging interest especially physical geography It was a joy to learn the secrets of nature how in the picturesque language of the Old Testament the winds are made to blow from the four corners of the heavens how the vapours ascend from the ends of the earth how rivers are cut out among the rocks and mountains overturned by the roots and in what ways man may overcome many forces mightier than himself The two years in New York were happy ones and I look back to them with genuine pleasure I remember especially the walks we all took together every day in Central Park the only part of the city that was congenial to me I never lost a jot of my delight in this great park I loved to have it described every time I entered it for it was beautiful in all its aspects and these aspects were so many that it was beautiful in a different way each day of the nine months I spent in New York In the spring we made excursions to various places of interest We sailed on the Hudson River and wandered about on its green banks of which Bryant loved to sing I liked the simple wild grandeur of the palisades Among the places I visited were West Point Tarrytown the home of Washington Irving where I walked through Sleepy Hollow The teachers at the Wright Humason School were always planning how they might give the pupils every advantage that those who hear enjoy how they might make much of few tendencies and passive memories in the cases of the little ones and lead them out of the cramping circumstances in which their lives were set Before I left New York these bright days were darkened by the greatest sorrow that I have ever borne except the death of my father mister John P Spaulding of Boston died in February eighteen ninety six Only those who knew and loved him best can understand what his friendship meant to me He who made every one happy in a beautiful unobtrusive way was most kind and tender to Miss Sullivan and me So long as we felt his loving presence and knew that he took a watchful interest in our work fraught with so many difficulties we could not be discouraged His going away left a vacancy in our lives that has never been filled CHAPTER XVIII In October eighteen ninety six I entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies to be prepared for Radcliffe When I was a little girl I visited Wellesley and surprised my friends by the announcement Some day I shall go to college but I shall go to Harvard When asked why I would not go to Wellesley I replied that there were only girls there The thought of going to college took root in my heart and became an earnest desire which impelled me to enter into competition for a degree with seeing and hearing girls in the face of the strong opposition of many true and wise friends 
1092-134579-0000	train-other-500	When I left New York the idea had become a fixed purpose and it was decided that I should go to Cambridge This was the nearest approach I could get to Harvard and to the fulfillment of my childish declaration
1092-134579-0001	train-other-500	At the Cambridge School the plan was to have Miss Sullivan attend the classes with me and interpret to me the instruction given Of course my instructors had had no experience in teaching any but normal pupils and my only means of conversing with them
none	none	 was reading their lips My studies for the first year were English history English literature German Latin arithmetic Latin composition and occasional themes Until then I had never taken a course of study 
1092-134579-0002	train-other-500	with the idea of preparing for college but I had been well drilled in English by Miss Sullivan
none	none	 and it soon became evident to my teachers that I needed no special instruction in this subject beyond a critical study of the books prescribed by the college 
1092-134579-0003	train-other-500	I had had moreover a good start in French and received six months instruction in Latin but German was the subject with which I was most familiar In spite however of these advantages there were serious drawbacks to my progress
1092-134579-0004	train-other-500	Miss Sullivan could not spell out in my hand all that the books required
none	none	 and it was very difficult to have textbooks embossed in time to be of use to me 
1092-134579-0005	train-other-500	although my friends in London and Philadelphia were willing to hasten the work For a while indeed I had to copy my Latin in braille so that I could recite with the other girls
none	none	 My instructors soon became sufficiently familiar with my imperfect speech 
1092-134579-0006	train-other-500	to answer my questions readily and correct mistakes I could not make notes in class or write exercises but I wrote all my compositions and translations at home on my typewriter
1092-134579-0007	train-other-500	Each day Miss Sullivan went to the classes with me and spelled into my hand with infinite patience all that the teachers said In study hours she had to look up new words for me and read and reread notes and books I did not have in raised print
none	none	 The tedium of that work is hard to conceive Frau Grote my German teacher and mister Gilman the principal were the only teachers in the school who learned the finger alphabet to give me instruction No one realized more fully than dear Frau Grote 
1092-134579-0008	train-other-500	how slow and inadequate her spelling was
none	none	 Nevertheless in the goodness of her heart she laboriously spelled out her instructions to me 
1092-134579-0009	train-other-500	in special lessons twice a week to give Miss Sullivan a little rest But though everybody was kind and ready to help us there was only one hand that could turn drudgery into pleasure That year I finished arithmetic reviewed my Latin grammar
1092-134579-0010	train-other-500	and read three chapters of Caesar s Gallic War In German I read partly with my fingers and partly with Miss Sullivan s assistance Schiller s Lied von der Glocke and Taucher Heine s
none	none	 Harzreise Freytag s Aus dem Staat Friedrichs des Grossen Riehl s Fluch Der Schonheit Lessing s Minna von Barnhelm and Goethe s Aus meinem Leben I took the greatest delight in these German books especially Schiller s wonderful lyrics 
1092-134579-0011	train-other-500	the history of Frederick the Great s magnificent achievements and the account of Goethe s life I was sorry to finish
none	none	 Die Harzreise so full of happy witticisms 
1092-134579-0012	train-other-500	and charming descriptions of vine clad hills streams that sing and ripple in the sunshine and wild regions sacred to tradition and legend the gray sisters of a long vanished imaginative age
none	none	 descriptions such as can be given only by those to whom nature is 
1092-134579-0013	train-other-500	a feeling a love and an appetite mister Gilman instructed me part of the year in English literature We read together As You Like It Burke s Speech on Conciliation with America and Macaulay s Life of Samuel Johnson
none	none	 mister Gilman s broad views of history and literature 
1092-134579-0014	train-other-500	and his clever explanations made my work easier and pleasanter than it could have been had I only read notes mechanically with the necessarily brief explanations given in the classes
1092-134579-0015	train-other-500	Burke s speech was more instructive than any other book on a political subject that I had ever read My mind stirred with the stirring times and the characters round which the life of two contending nations centred seemed to move right before me
1092-134579-0016	train-other-500	I wondered more and more
none	none	 while Burke s masterly speech rolled on in mighty surges of eloquence 
1092-134579-0017	train-other-500	how it was that King George and his ministers could have turned a deaf ear to his warning prophecy of our victory and their humiliation Then I entered into the melancholy details of the relation in which the great statesman stood to his party
1092-134579-0018	train-other-500	and to the representatives of the people I thought how strange it was that such precious seeds of truth and wisdom should have fallen among the tares of ignorance and corruption In a different way Macaulay s Life of Samuel Johnson
1092-134579-0019	train-other-500	was interesting My heart went out to the lonely man who ate the bread of affliction in Grub Street and yet in the midst of toil and cruel suffering of body and soul always had a kind word and lent a helping hand to the poor and despised
1092-134579-0020	train-other-500	I rejoiced over all his successes I shut my eyes to his faults and wondered not that he had them
none	none	 but that they had not crushed or dwarfed his soul But in spite of Macaulay s brilliancy and his admirable faculty of making the commonplace seem fresh and picturesque his positiveness wearied me at times and his frequent sacrifices of truth to effect kept me in a questioning attitude very unlike the attitude of reverence in which I had listened 
1092-134579-0021	train-other-500	to the Demosthenes of Great Britain At the Cambridge school for the first time in my life I enjoyed the companionship of seeing and hearing girls of my own age I lived with several others in one of the pleasant houses connected with the school the house where mister Howells used to live
1092-134579-0022	train-other-500	and we all had the advantage of home life I joined them in many of their games even blind man s buff and frolics in the snow I took long walks with them we discussed our studies and read aloud the things that interested us
none	none	 Some of the girls learned to speak to me 
1092-134579-0023	train-other-500	so that Miss Sullivan did not have to repeat their conversation At Christmas my mother and little sister spent the holidays with me and mister Gilman kindly offered to let Mildred study in his school
none	none	 So Mildred stayed with me in Cambridge and for six happy months we were hardly ever apart It makes me most happy to remember the hours we spent helping each other in study and sharing our recreation together I took my preliminary examinations for Radcliffe from the twenty ninth of June to the third of July in eighteen ninety seven 
1092-134579-0024	train-other-500	The subjects I offered were Elementary and Advanced German French
none	none	 Latin English and Greek and Roman history making nine hours in all I passed in everything and received honours in German and English Perhaps an explanation of the method that was in use when I took my examinations will not be amiss here The student was required to pass in sixteen hours twelve hours being called elementary and four advanced He had to pass five hours at a time to have them counted The examination papers were given out at nine o clock at Harvard and brought to Radcliffe by a special messenger 
1092-134579-0025	train-other-500	Each candidate was known not by his name but by a number
none	none	 I was No two hundred thirty three 
1092-134579-0026	train-other-500	but as I had to use a typewriter my identity could not be concealed It was thought advisable for me to have my examinations in a room by myself because the noise of the typewriter might disturb the other girls
none	none	 mister Gilman read all the papers to me by means of the manual alphabet A man was placed on guard at the door to prevent interruption The first day I had German mister Gilman sat beside me and read the paper through first then sentence by sentence 
1092-134579-0027	train-other-500	while I repeated the words aloud to make sure that I understood him perfectly The papers were difficult and I felt very anxious as I wrote out my answers on the typewriter mister Gilman spelled to me what I had written
none	none	 and I made such changes as I thought necessary 
1092-134579-0028	train-other-500	and he inserted them I wish to say here that I have not had this advantage since in any of my examinations At Radcliffe no one reads the papers to me after they are written and I have no opportunity to correct errors unless I finish before the time is up
1092-134579-0029	train-other-500	In that case I correct only such mistakes as I can recall in the few minutes allowed and make notes of these corrections at the end of my paper If I passed with higher credit in the preliminaries than in the finals there are two reasons In the finals
1092-134579-0030	train-other-500	no one read my work over to me and in the preliminaries I offered subjects with some of which I was in a measure familiar before my work in the Cambridge school
none	none	 for at the beginning of the year I had passed examinations in English History French and German 
1092-134579-0031	train-other-500	which mister Gilman gave me from previous Harvard papers mister Gilman sent my written work to the examiners with a certificate that I
none	none	 candidate No two hundred thirty three 
1092-134579-0032	train-other-500	had written the papers All the other preliminary examinations were conducted in the same manner None of them was so difficult as the first
none	none	 I remember that the day the Latin paper was brought to us Professor Schilling came in and informed me I had passed satisfactorily in German This encouraged me greatly and I sped on to the end of the ordeal with a light heart and a steady hand CHAPTER XIX When I began my second year at the Gilman school I was full of hope and determination to succeed But during the first few weeks I was confronted with unforeseen difficulties mister Gilman had agreed that that year I should study mathematics principally I had physics algebra geometry astronomy Greek and Latin Unfortunately many of the books I needed had not been embossed in time for me to begin with the classes and I lacked important apparatus for some of my studies The classes I was in were very large and it was impossible for the teachers to give me special instruction Miss Sullivan was obliged to read all the books to me and interpret for the instructors and for the first time in eleven years it seemed as if her dear hand would not be equal to the task It was necessary for me to write algebra and geometry in class and solve problems in physics and this I could not do until we bought a braille writer by means of which I could put down the steps and processes of my work I could not follow with my eyes the geometrical figures drawn on the blackboard and my only means of getting a clear idea of them was to make them on a cushion with straight and curved wires which had bent and pointed ends I had to carry in my mind as mister Keith says in his report the lettering of the figures the hypothesis and conclusion the construction and the process of the proof In a word every study had its obstacles Sometimes I lost all courage and betrayed my feelings in a way I am ashamed to remember especially as the signs of my trouble were afterward used against Miss Sullivan the only person of all the kind friends I had there who could make the crooked straight and the rough places smooth Little by little however my difficulties began to disappear The embossed books and other apparatus arrived and I threw myself into the work with renewed confidence Algebra and geometry were the only studies that continued to defy my efforts to comprehend them As I have said before I had no aptitude for mathematics the different points were not explained to me as fully as I wished The geometrical diagrams were particularly vexing because I could not see the relation of the different parts to one another even on the cushion It was not until mister Keith taught me that I had a clear idea of mathematics I was beginning to overcome these difficulties when an event occurred which changed everything Just before the books came mister Gilman had begun to remonstrate with Miss Sullivan on the ground that I was working too hard and in spite of my earnest protestations he reduced the number of my recitations At the beginning we had agreed that I should if necessary take five years to prepare for college but at the end of the first year the success of my examinations showed Miss Sullivan Miss Harbaugh mister Gilman s head teacher and one other that I could without too much effort complete my preparation in two years more mister Gilman at first agreed to this but when my tasks had become somewhat perplexing he insisted that I was overworked and that I should remain at his school three years longer I did not like his plan for I wished to enter college with my class On the seventeenth of November I was not very well and did not go to school Although Miss Sullivan knew that my indisposition was not serious yet mister Gilman on hearing of it declared that I was breaking down and made changes in my studies which would have rendered it impossible for me to take my final examinations with my class In the end the difference of opinion between mister Gilman and Miss Sullivan resulted in my mother s withdrawing my sister Mildred and me from the Cambridge school After some delay it was arranged that I should continue my studies under a tutor mister Merton S Keith of Cambridge Miss Sullivan and I spent the rest of the winter with our friends the Chamberlins in Wrentham twenty five miles from Boston From February to July eighteen ninety eight mister Keith came out to Wrentham twice a week and taught me algebra geometry Greek and Latin Miss Sullivan interpreted his instruction In October eighteen ninety eight we returned to Boston For eight months mister Keith gave me lessons five times a week in periods of about an hour He explained each time what I did not understand in the previous lesson assigned new work and took home with him the Greek exercises which I had written during the week on my typewriter corrected them fully and returned them to me In this way my preparation for college went on without interruption I found it much easier and pleasanter to be taught by myself than to receive instruction in class There was no hurry no confusion My tutor had plenty of time to explain what I did not understand so I got on faster and did better work than I ever did in school I still found more difficulty in mastering problems in mathematics than I did in any other of my studies I wish algebra and geometry had been half as easy as the languages and literature But even mathematics mister Keith made interesting he succeeded in whittling problems small enough to get through my brain He kept my mind alert and eager and trained it to reason clearly and to seek conclusions calmly and logically instead of jumping wildly into space and arriving nowhere He was always gentle and forbearing no matter how dull I might be and believe me my stupidity would often have exhausted the patience of Job On the twenty ninth and thirtieth of June eighteen ninety nine I took my final examinations for Radcliffe College The first day I had Elementary Greek and Advanced Latin and the second day Geometry Algebra and Advanced Greek The college authorities did not allow Miss Sullivan to read the examination papers to me so mister Eugene C Vining one of the instructors at the Perkins Institution for the Blind was employed to copy the papers for me in American braille mister Vining was a stranger to me and could not communicate with me except by writing braille The proctor was also a stranger and did not attempt to communicate with me in any way The braille worked well enough in the languages but when it came to geometry and algebra difficulties arose I was sorely perplexed and felt discouraged wasting much precious time especially in algebra It is true that I was familiar with all literary braille in common use in this country English American and New York Point but the various signs and symbols in geometry and algebra in the three systems are very different and I had used only the English braille in my algebra Two days before the examinations mister Vining sent me a braille copy of one of the old Harvard papers in algebra To my dismay I found that it was in the American notation I sat down immediately and wrote to mister Vining asking him to explain the signs I received another paper and a table of signs by return mail and I set to work to learn the notation But on the night before the algebra examination while I was struggling over some very complicated examples I could not tell the combinations of bracket brace and radical Both mister Keith and I were distressed and full of forebodings for the morrow but we went over to the college a little before the examination began and had mister Vining explain more fully the American symbols In geometry my chief difficulty was that I had always been accustomed to read the propositions in line print or to have them spelled into my hand and somehow although the propositions were right before me I found the braille confusing and could not fix clearly in my mind what I was reading But when I took up algebra I had a harder time still The signs which I had so lately learned and which I thought I knew perplexed me Besides I could not see what I wrote on my typewriter I had always done my work in braille or in my head mister Keith had relied too much on my ability to solve problems mentally and had not trained me to write examination papers Consequently my work was painfully slow and I had to read the examples over and over before I could form any idea of what I was required to do Indeed I am not sure now that I read all the signs correctly I found it very hard to keep my wits about me But I do not blame any one The administrative board of Radcliffe did not realize how difficult they were making my examinations nor did they understand the peculiar difficulties I had to surmount But if they unintentionally placed obstacles in my way I have the consolation of knowing that I overcame them all CHAPTER XX The struggle for admission to college was ended and I could now enter Radcliffe whenever I pleased Before I entered college however it was thought best that I should study another year under mister Keith It was not therefore until the fall of nineteen hundred that my dream of going to college was realized I remember my first day at Radcliffe It was a day full of interest for me I had looked forward to it for years A potent force within me stronger than the persuasion of my friends stronger even than the pleadings of my heart had impelled me to try my strength by the standards of those who see and hear I knew that there were obstacles in the way but I was eager to overcome them I had taken to heart the words of the wise Roman who said To be banished from Rome is but to live outside of Rome Debarred from the great highways of knowledge I was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented roads that was all and I knew that in college there were many bypaths where I could touch hands with girls who were thinking loving and struggling like me I began my studies with eagerness Before me I saw a new world opening in beauty and light and I felt within me the capacity to know all things In the wonderland of Mind I should be as free as another Its people scenery manners joys tragedies should be living tangible interpreters of the real world The lecture halls seemed filled with the spirit of the great and the wise and I thought the professors were the embodiment of wisdom If I have since learned differently I am not going to tell anybody But I soon discovered that college was not quite the romantic lyceum I had imagined Many of the dreams that had delighted my young inexperience became beautifully less and faded into the light of common day Gradually I began to find that there were disadvantages in going to college The one I felt and still feel most is lack of time I used to have time to think to reflect my mind and I We would sit together of an evening and listen to the inner melodies of the spirit which one hears only in leisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep sweet chord in the soul that until then had been silent But in college there is no time to commune with one s thoughts One goes to college to learn it seems not to think When one enters the portals of learning one leaves the dearest pleasures solitude books and imagination outside with the whispering pines I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day My studies the first year were French German history English composition and English literature In the French course I read some of the works of Corneille Moliere Racine Alfred de Musset and Sainte Beuve and in the German those of Goethe and Schiller I reviewed rapidly the whole period of history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the eighteenth century and in English literature studied critically Milton s poems and Areopagitica I am frequently asked how I overcome the peculiar conditions under which I work in college In the classroom I am of course practically alone The professor is as remote as if he were speaking through a telephone The lectures are spelled into my hand as rapidly as possible and much of the individuality of the lecturer is lost to me in the effort to keep in the race The words rush through my hand like hounds in pursuit of a hare which they often miss But in this respect I do not think I am much worse off than the girls who take notes If the mind is occupied with the mechanical process of hearing and putting words on paper at pell mell speed I should not think one could pay much attention to the subject under consideration or the manner in which it is presented I cannot make notes during the lectures because my hands are busy listening Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get home I write the exercises daily themes criticisms and hour tests the mid year and final examinations on my typewriter so that the professors have no difficulty in finding out how little I know When I began the study of Latin prosody I devised and explained to my professor a system of signs indicating the different meters and quantities I use the Hammond typewriter I have tried many machines and I find the Hammond is the best adapted to the peculiar needs of my work With this machine movable type shuttles can be used and one can have several shuttles each with a different set of characters Greek French or mathematical according to the kind of writing one wishes to do on the typewriter Without it I doubt if I could go to college Very few of the books required in the various courses are printed for the blind and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand Consequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls The manual part takes longer and I have perplexities which they have not There are days when the close attention I must give to details chafes my spirit and the thought that I must spend hours reading a few chapters while in the world without other girls are laughing and singing and dancing makes me rebellious but I soon recover my buoyancy and laugh the discontent out of my heart For after all every one who wishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone and since there is no royal road to the summit I must zigzag it in my own way I slip back many times I fall I stand still I run against the edge of hidden obstacles I lose my temper and find it again and keep it better I trudge on I gain a little I feel encouraged I get more eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon Every struggle is a victory One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud the blue depths of the sky the uplands of my desire I am not always alone however in these struggles mister William Wade and mister E E Allen Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind get for me many of the books I need in raised print Their thoughtfulness has been more of a help and encouragement to me than they can ever know Last year my second year at Radcliffe I studied English composition the Bible as English composition the governments of America and Europe the Odes of Horace and Latin comedy The class in composition was the pleasantest It was very lively The lectures were always interesting vivacious witty for the instructor mister Charles Townsend Copeland more than any one else I have had until this year brings before you literature in all its original freshness and power For one short hour you are permitted to drink in the eternal beauty of the old masters without needless interpretation or exposition You revel in their fine thoughts You enjoy with all your soul the sweet thunder of the Old Testament forgetting the existence of Jahweh and Elohim and you go home feeling that you have had a glimpse of that perfection in which spirit and form dwell in immortal harmony truth and beauty bearing a new growth on the ancient stem of time This year is the happiest because I am studying subjects that especially interest me economics Elizabethan literature Shakespeare under Professor George L Kittredge and the History of Philosophy under Professor Josiah Royce Through philosophy one enters with sympathy of comprehension into the traditions of remote ages and other modes of thought which erewhile seemed alien and without reason But college is not the universal Athens I thought it was There one does not meet the great and the wise face to face one does not even feel their living touch They are there it is true but they seem mummified We must extract them from the crannied wall of learning and dissect and analyze them before we can be sure that we have a Milton or an Isaiah and not merely a clever imitation Many scholars forget it seems to me that our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon the depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding The trouble is that very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory The mind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit It is possible to know a flower root and stem and all and all the processes of growth and yet to have no appreciation of the flower fresh bathed in heaven s dew Again and again I ask impatiently Why concern myself with these explanations and hypotheses They fly hither and thither in my thought like blind birds beating the air with ineffectual wings I do not mean to object to a thorough knowledge of the famous works we read I object only to the interminable comments and bewildering criticisms that teach but one thing there are as many opinions as there are men But when a great scholar like Professor Kittredge interprets what the master said it is as if new sight were given the blind He brings back Shakespeare the poet There are however times when I long to sweep away half the things I am expected to learn for the overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost It is impossible I think to read in one day four or five different books in different languages and treating of widely different subjects and not lose sight of the very ends for which one reads When one reads hurriedly and nervously having in mind written tests and examinations one s brain becomes encumbered with a lot of choice bric a brac for which there seems to be little use At the present time my mind is so full of heterogeneous matter that I almost despair of ever being able to put it in order Whenever I enter the region that was the kingdom of my mind I feel like the proverbial bull in the china shop A thousand odds and ends of knowledge come crashing about my head like hailstones and when I try to escape them theme goblins and college nixies of all sorts pursue me until I wish oh may I be forgiven the wicked wish that I might smash the idols I came to worship But the examinations are the chief bugbears of my college life Although I have faced them many times and cast them down and made them bite the dust yet they rise again and menace me with pale looks until like Bob Acres I feel my courage oozing out at my finger ends The days before these ordeals take place are spent in cramming your mind with mystic formula and indigestible dates unpalatable diets until you wish that books and science and you were buried in the depths of the sea At last the dreaded hour arrives and you are a favoured being indeed if you feel prepared and are able at the right time to call to your standard thoughts that will aid you in that supreme effort It happens too often that your trumpet call is unheeded It is most perplexing and exasperating that just at the moment when you need your memory and a nice sense of discrimination these faculties take to themselves wings and fly away The facts you have garnered with such infinite trouble invariably fail you at a pinch Give a brief account of Huss and his work Huss Who was he and what did he do The name looks strangely familiar You ransack your budget of historic facts much as you would hunt for a bit of silk in a rag bag You are sure it is somewhere in your mind near the top you saw it there the other day when you were looking up the beginnings of the Reformation But where is it now You fish out all manner of odds and ends of knowledge revolutions schisms massacres systems of government but Huss where is he You are amazed at all the things you know which are not on the examination paper In desperation you seize the budget and dump everything out and there in a corner is your man serenely brooding on his own private thought unconscious of the catastrophe which he has brought upon you Just then the proctor informs you that the time is up With a feeling of intense disgust you kick the mass of rubbish into a corner and go home your head full of revolutionary schemes to abolish the divine right of professors to ask questions without the consent of the questioned It comes over me that in the last two or three pages of this chapter I have used figures which will turn the laugh against me Ah here they are the mixed metaphors mocking and strutting about before me pointing to the bull in the china shop assailed by hailstones and the bugbears with pale looks an unanalyzed species Let them mock on The words describe so exactly the atmosphere of jostling tumbling ideas I live in that I will wink at them for once and put on a deliberate air to say that my ideas of college have changed While my days at Radcliffe were still in the future they were encircled with a halo of romance which they have lost but in the transition from romantic to actual I have learned many things I should never have known had I not tried the experiment One of them is the precious science of patience which teaches us that we should take our education as we would take a walk in the country leisurely our minds hospitably open to impressions of every sort Such knowledge floods the soul unseen with a soundless tidal wave of deepening thought Knowledge is power Rather knowledge is happiness because to have knowledge broad deep knowledge is to know true ends from false and lofty things from low To know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man s progress is to feel the great heart throbs of humanity through the centuries and if one does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving one must indeed be deaf to the harmonies of life CHAPTER XXI I have thus far sketched the events of my life but I have not shown how much I have depended on books not only for pleasure and for the wisdom they bring to all who read but also for that knowledge which comes to others through their eyes and their ears Indeed books have meant so much more in my education than in that of others that I shall go back to the time when I began to read I read my first connected story in May eighteen eighty seven when I was seven years old and from that day to this I have devoured everything in the shape of a printed page that has come within the reach of my hungry finger tips As I have said I did not study regularly during the early years of my education nor did I read according to rule At first I had only a few books in raised print readers for beginners a collection of stories for children and a book about the earth called Our World I think that was all but I read them over and over until the words were so worn and pressed I could scarcely make them out Sometimes Miss Sullivan read to me spelling into my hand little stories and poems that she knew I should understand but I preferred reading myself to being read to because I liked to read again and again the things that pleased me It was during my first visit to Boston that I really began to read in good earnest I was permitted to spend a part of each day in the Institution library and to wander from bookcase to bookcase and take down whatever book my fingers lighted upon And read I did whether I understood one word in ten or two words on a page The words themselves fascinated me but I took no conscious account of what I read My mind must however have been very impressionable at that period for it retained many words and whole sentences to the meaning of which I had not the faintest clue and afterward when I began to talk and write these words and sentences would flash out quite naturally so that my friends wondered at the richness of my vocabulary I must have read parts of many books in those early days I think I never read any one book through and a great deal of poetry in this uncomprehending way until I discovered Little Lord Fauntleroy which was the first book of any consequence I read understandingly One day my teacher found me in a corner of the library poring over the pages of The Scarlet Letter I was then about eight years old I remember she asked me if I liked little Pearl and explained some of the words that had puzzled me Then she told me that she had a beautiful story about a little boy which she was sure I should like better than The Scarlet Letter The name of the story was Little Lord Fauntleroy and she promised to read it to me the following summer But we did not begin the story until August the first few weeks of my stay at the seashore were so full of discoveries and excitement that I forgot the very existence of books Then my teacher went to visit some friends in Boston leaving me for a short time When she returned almost the first thing we did was to begin the story of Little Lord Fauntleroy I recall distinctly the time and place when we read the first chapters of the fascinating child s story It was a warm afternoon in August We were sitting together in a hammock which swung from two solemn pines at a short distance from the house We had hurried through the dish washing after luncheon in order that we might have as long an afternoon as possible for the story As we hastened through the long grass toward the hammock the grasshoppers swarmed about us and fastened themselves on our clothes and I remember that my teacher insisted upon picking them all off before we sat down which seemed to me an unnecessary waste of time The hammock was covered with pine needles for it had not been used while my teacher was away The warm sun shone on the pine trees and drew out all their fragrance The air was balmy with a tang of the sea in it Before we began the story Miss Sullivan explained to me the things that she knew I should not understand and as we read on she explained the unfamiliar words At first there were many words I did not know and the reading was constantly interrupted but as soon as I thoroughly comprehended the situation I became too eagerly absorbed in the story to notice mere words and I am afraid I listened impatiently to the explanations that Miss Sullivan felt to be necessary When her fingers were too tired to spell another word I had for the first time a keen sense of my deprivations I took the book in my hands and tried to feel the letters with an intensity of longing that I can never forget Afterward at my eager request mister Anagnos had this story embossed and I read it again and again until I almost knew it by heart and all through my childhood Little Lord Fauntleroy was my sweet and gentle companion I have given these details at the risk of being tedious because they are in such vivid contrast with my vague mutable and confused memories of earlier reading From Little Lord Fauntleroy I date the beginning of my true interest in books During the next two years I read many books at my home and on my visits to Boston I cannot remember what they all were or in what order I read them but I know that among them were Greek Heroes La Fontaine s Fables Hawthorne s Wonder Book Bible Stories Lamb s Tales from Shakespeare A Child s History of England by Dickens The Arabian Nights The Swiss Family Robinson The Pilgrim s Progress Robinson Crusoe Little Women and Heidi a beautiful little story which I afterward read in German I read them in the intervals between study and play with an ever deepening sense of pleasure I did not study nor analyze them I did not know whether they were well written or not I never thought about style or authorship They laid their treasures at my feet and I accepted them as we accept the sunshine and the love of our friends I loved Little Women because it gave me a sense of kinship with girls and boys who could see and hear Circumscribed as my life was in so many ways I had to look between the covers of books for news of the world that lay outside my own I did not care especially for The Pilgrim s Progress which I think I did not finish or for the Fables I read La Fontaine s Fables first in an English translation and enjoyed them only after a half hearted fashion Later I read the book again in French and I found that in spite of the vivid word pictures and the wonderful mastery of language I liked it no better I do not know why it is but stories in which animals are made to talk and act like human beings have never appealed to me very strongly The ludicrous caricatures of the animals occupy my mind to the exclusion of the moral Then again La Fontaine seldom if ever appeals to our highest moral sense The highest chords he strikes are those of reason and self love Through all the fables runs the thought that man s morality springs wholly from self love and that if that self love is directed and restrained by reason happiness must follow Now so far as I can judge self love is the root of all evil but of course I may be wrong for La Fontaine had greater opportunities of observing men than I am likely ever to have I do not object so much to the cynical and satirical fables as to those in which momentous truths are taught by monkeys and foxes But I love The Jungle Book and Wild Animals I Have Known I feel a genuine interest in the animals themselves because they are real animals and not caricatures of men One sympathizes with their loves and hatreds laughs over their comedies and weeps over their tragedies And if they point a moral it is so subtle that we are not conscious of it My mind opened naturally and joyously to a conception of antiquity Greece ancient Greece exercised a mysterious fascination over me In my fancy the pagan gods and goddesses still walked on earth and talked face to face with men and in my heart I secretly built shrines to those I loved best I knew and loved the whole tribe of nymphs and heroes and demigods no not quite all for the cruelty and greed of Medea and Jason were too monstrous to be forgiven and I used to wonder why the gods permitted them to do wrong and then punished them for their wickedness And the mystery is still unsolved I often wonder how God can dumbness keep While Sin creeps grinning through His house of Time It was the Iliad that made Greece my paradise I was familiar with the story of Troy before I read it in the original and consequently I had little difficulty in making the Greek words surrender their treasures after I had passed the borderland of grammar Great poetry whether written in Greek or in English needs no other interpreter than a responsive heart Would that the host of those who make the great works of the poets odious by their analysis impositions and laborious comments might learn this simple truth It is not necessary that one should be able to define every word and give it its principal parts and its grammatical position in the sentence in order to understand and appreciate a fine poem I know my learned professors have found greater riches in the Iliad than I shall ever find but I am not avaricious I am content that others should be wiser than I But with all their wide and comprehensive knowledge they cannot measure their enjoyment of that splendid epic nor can I When I read the finest passages of the Iliad I am conscious of a soul sense that lifts me above the narrow cramping circumstances of my life My physical limitations are forgotten my world lies upward the length and the breadth and the sweep of the heavens are mine My admiration for the Aeneid is not so great but it is none the less real I read it as much as possible without the help of notes or dictionary and I always like to translate the episodes that please me especially The word painting of Virgil is wonderful sometimes but his gods and men move through the scenes of passion and strife and pity and love like the graceful figures in an Elizabethan mask whereas in the Iliad they give three leaps and go on singing Virgil is serene and lovely like a marble Apollo in the moonlight Homer is a beautiful animated youth in the full sunlight with the wind in his hair How easy it is to fly on paper wings From Greek Heroes to the Iliad was no day s journey nor was it altogether pleasant One could have traveled round the word many times while I trudged my weary way through the labyrinthine mazes of grammars and dictionaries or fell into those dreadful pitfalls called examinations set by schools and colleges for the confusion of those who seek after knowledge I suppose this sort of Pilgrim s Progress was justified by the end but it seemed interminable to me in spite of the pleasant surprises that met me now and then at a turn in the road I began to read the Bible long before I could understand it Now it seems strange to me that there should have been a time when my spirit was deaf to its wondrous harmonies but I remember well a rainy Sunday morning when having nothing else to do I begged my cousin to read me a story out of the Bible Although she did not think I should understand she began to spell into my hand the story of Joseph and his brothers Somehow it failed to interest me The unusual language and repetition made the story seem unreal and far away in the land of Canaan and I fell asleep and wandered off to the land of Nod before the brothers came with the coat of many colours unto the tent of Jacob and told their wicked lie I cannot understand why the stories of the Greeks should have been so full of charm for me and those of the Bible so devoid of interest unless it was that I had made the acquaintance of several Greeks in Boston and been inspired by their enthusiasm for the stories of their country whereas I had not met a single Hebrew or Egyptian and therefore concluded that they were nothing more than barbarians and the stories about them were probably all made up which hypothesis explained the repetitions and the queer names Curiously enough it never occurred to me to call Greek patronymics queer But how shall I speak of the glories I have since discovered in the Bible For years I have read it with an ever broadening sense of joy and inspiration and I love it as I love no other book Still there is much in the Bible against which every instinct of my being rebels so much that I regret the necessity which has compelled me to read it through from beginning to end I do not think that the knowledge which I have gained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant details it has forced upon my attention For my part I wish with mister Howells that the literature of the past might be purged of all that is ugly and barbarous in it although I should object as much as any one to having these great works weakened or falsified There is something impressive awful in the simplicity and terrible directness of the book of Esther Could there be anything more dramatic than the scene in which Esther stands before her wicked lord She knows her life is in his hands there is no one to protect her from his wrath Yet conquering her woman s fear she approaches him animated by the noblest patriotism having but one thought If I perish I perish but if I live my people shall live The story of Ruth too how Oriental it is Yet how different is the life of these simple country folks from that of the Persian capital Ruth is so loyal and gentle hearted we cannot help loving her as she stands with the reapers amid the waving corn Her beautiful unselfish spirit shines out like a bright star in the night of a dark and cruel age Love like Ruth s love which can rise above conflicting creeds and deep seated racial prejudices is hard to find in all the world The Bible gives me a deep comforting sense that things seen are temporal and things unseen are eternal I do not remember a time since I have been capable of loving books that I have not loved Shakespeare I cannot tell exactly when I began Lamb s Tales from Shakespeare but I know that I read them at first with a child s understanding and a child s wonder Macbeth seems to have impressed me most One reading was sufficient to stamp every detail of the story upon my memory forever For a long time the ghosts and witches pursued me even into Dreamland I could see absolutely see the dagger and Lady Macbeth s little white hand the dreadful stain was as real to me as to the grief stricken queen I read King Lear soon after Macbeth and I shall never forget the feeling of horror when I came to the scene in which Gloster s eyes are put out Anger seized me my fingers refused to move I sat rigid for one long moment the blood throbbing in my temples and all the hatred that a child can feel concentrated in my heart I must have made the acquaintance of Shylock and Satan about the same time for the two characters were long associated in my mind I remember that I was sorry for them I felt vaguely that they could not be good even if they wished to because no one seemed willing to help them or to give them a fair chance Even now I cannot find it in my heart to condemn them utterly There are moments when I feel that the Shylocks the Judases and even the Devil are broken spokes in the great wheel of good which shall in due time be made whole It seems strange that my first reading of Shakespeare should have left me so many unpleasant memories The bright gentle fanciful plays the ones I like best now appear not to have impressed me at first perhaps because they reflected the habitual sunshine and gaiety of a child s life But there is nothing more capricious than the memory of a child what it will hold and what it will lose I have since read Shakespeare s plays many times and know parts of them by heart but I cannot tell which of them I like best My delight in them is as varied as my moods The little songs and the sonnets have a meaning for me as fresh and wonderful as the dramas But with all my love for Shakespeare it is often weary work to read all the meanings into his lines which critics and commentators have given them I used to try to remember their interpretations but they discouraged and vexed me so I made a secret compact with myself not to try any more This compact I have only just broken in my study of Shakespeare under Professor Kittredge I know there are many things in Shakespeare and in the world that I do not understand and I am glad to see veil after veil lift gradually revealing new realms of thought and beauty Next to poetry I love history I have read every historical work that I have been able to lay my hands on from a catalogue of dry facts and dryer dates to Green s impartial picturesque History of the English People from Freeman s History of Europe to Emerton s Middle Ages The first book that gave me any real sense of the value of history was Swinton s World History which I received on my thirteenth birthday Though I believe it is no longer considered valid yet I have kept it ever since as one of my treasures From it I learned how the races of men spread from land to land and built great cities how a few great rulers earthly Titans put everything under their feet and with a decisive word opened the gates of happiness for millions and closed them upon millions more how different nations pioneered in art and knowledge and broke ground for the mightier growths of coming ages how civilization underwent as it were the holocaust of a degenerate age and rose again like the Phoenix among the nobler sons of the North and how by liberty tolerance and education the great and the wise have opened the way for the salvation of the whole world In my college reading I have become somewhat familiar with French and German literature The German puts strength before beauty and truth before convention both in life and in literature There is a vehement sledge hammer vigour about everything that he does When he speaks it is not to impress others but because his heart would burst if he did not find an outlet for the thoughts that burn in his soul Then too there is in German literature a fine reserve which I like but its chief glory is the recognition I find in it of the redeeming potency of woman s self sacrificing love This thought pervades all German literature and is mystically expressed in Goethe s Faust All things transitory But as symbols are sent Earth s insufficiency Here grows to event The indescribable Here it is done The Woman Soul leads us upward and on Of all the French writers that I have read I like Moliere and Racine best There are fine things in Balzac and passages in Merimee which strike one like a keen blast of sea air Alfred de Musset is impossible I admire Victor Hugo I appreciate his genius his brilliancy his romanticism though he is not one of my literary passions But Hugo and Goethe and Schiller and all great poets of all great nations are interpreters of eternal things and my spirit reverently follows them into the regions where Beauty and Truth and Goodness are one I am afraid I have written too much about my book friends and yet I have mentioned only the authors I love most and from this fact one might easily suppose that my circle of friends was very limited and undemocratic which would be a very wrong impression I like many writers for many reasons Carlyle for his ruggedness and scorn of shams Wordsworth who teaches the oneness of man and nature I find an exquisite pleasure in the oddities and surprises of Hood in Herrick s quaintness and the palpable scent of lily and rose in his verses I like Whittier for his enthusiasms and moral rectitude I knew him and the gentle remembrance of our friendship doubles the pleasure I have in reading his poems I love Mark Twain who does not The gods too loved him and put into his heart all manner of wisdom then fearing lest he should become a pessimist they spanned his mind with a rainbow of love and faith I like Scott for his freshness dash and large honesty I love all writers whose minds like Lowell s bubble up in the sunshine of optimism fountains of joy and good will with occasionally a splash of anger and here and there a healing spray of sympathy and pity In a word literature is my Utopia Here I am not disfranchised No barrier of the senses shuts me out from the sweet gracious discourse of my book friends They talk to me without embarrassment or awkwardness The things I have learned and the things I have been taught seem of ridiculously little importance compared with their large loves and heavenly charities CHAPTER XXII I trust that my readers have not concluded from the preceding chapter on books that reading is my only pleasure my pleasures and amusements are many and varied More than once in the course of my story I have referred to my love of the country and out of door sports When I was quite a little girl I learned to row and swim and during the summer when I am at Wrentham Massachusetts I almost live in my boat Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to take my friends out rowing when they visit me Of course I cannot guide the boat very well Some one usually sits in the stern and manages the rudder while I row Sometimes however I go rowing without the rudder It is fun to try to steer by the scent of watergrasses and lilies and of bushes that grow on the shore I use oars with leather bands which keep them in position in the oarlocks and I know by the resistance of the water when the oars are evenly poised In the same manner I can also tell when I am pulling against the current I like to contend with wind and wave What is more exhilarating than to make your staunch little boat obedient to your will and muscle go skimming lightly over glistening tilting waves and to feel the steady imperious surge of the water I also enjoy canoeing and I suppose you will smile when I say that I especially like it on moonlight nights I cannot it is true see the moon climb up the sky behind the pines and steal softly across the heavens making a shining path for us to follow but I know she is there and as I lie back among the pillows and put my hand in the water I fancy that I feel the shimmer of her garments as she passes Sometimes a daring little fish slips between my fingers and often a pond lily presses shyly against my hand Frequently as we emerge from the shelter of a cove or inlet I am suddenly conscious of the spaciousness of the air about me A luminous warmth seems to enfold me Whether it comes from the trees which have been heated by the sun or from the water I can never discover I have had the same strange sensation even in the heart of the city I have felt it on cold stormy days and at night It is like the kiss of warm lips on my face My favourite amusement is sailing In the summer of nineteen oh one I visited Nova Scotia and had opportunities such as I had not enjoyed before to make the acquaintance of the ocean After spending a few days in Evangeline s country about which Longfellow s beautiful poem has woven a spell of enchantment Miss Sullivan and I went to Halifax where we remained the greater part of the summer The harbour was our joy our paradise What glorious sails we had to Bedford Basin to McNabb s Island to York Redoubt and to the Northwest Arm And at night what soothing wondrous hours we spent in the shadow of the great silent men of war Oh it was all so interesting so beautiful The memory of it is a joy forever One day we had a thrilling experience There was a regatta in the Northwest Arm in which the boats from the different warships were engaged We went in a sail boat along with many others to watch the races Hundreds of little sail boats swung to and fro close by and the sea was calm When the races were over and we turned our faces homeward one of the party noticed a black cloud drifting in from the sea which grew and spread and thickened until it covered the whole sky The wind rose and the waves chopped angrily at unseen barriers Our little boat confronted the gale fearlessly with sails spread and ropes taut she seemed to sit upon the wind Now she swirled in the billows now she spring upward on a gigantic wave only to be driven down with angry howl and hiss Down came the mainsail Tacking and jibbing we wrestled with opposing winds that drove us from side to side with impetuous fury Our hearts beat fast and our hands trembled with excitement not fear for we had the hearts of vikings and we knew that our skipper was master of the situation He had steered through many a storm with firm hand and sea wise eye As they passed us the large craft and the gunboats in the harbour saluted and the seamen shouted applause for the master of the only little sail boat that ventured out into the storm At last cold hungry and weary we reached our pier Last summer I spent in one of the loveliest nooks of one of the most charming villages in New England Wrentham Massachusetts is associated with nearly all of my joys and sorrows For many years Red Farm by King Philip s Pond the home of mister J E Chamberlin and his family was my home I remember with deepest gratitude the kindness of these dear friends and the happy days I spent with them The sweet companionship of their children meant much to me I joined in all their sports and rambles through the woods and frolics in the water The prattle of the little ones and their pleasure in the stories I told them of elf and gnome of hero and wily bear are pleasant things to remember mister Chamberlin initiated me into the mysteries of tree and wild flower until with the little ear of love I heard the flow of sap in the oak and saw the sun glint from leaf to leaf Thus it is that Even as the roots shut in the darksome earth Share in the tree top s joyance and conceive Of sunshine and wide air and winged things By sympathy of nature so do I gave evidence of things unseen It seems to me that there is in each of us a capacity to comprehend the impressions and emotions which have been experienced by mankind from the beginning Each individual has a subconscious memory of the green earth and murmuring waters and blindness and deafness cannot rob him of this gift from past generations This inherited capacity is a sort of sixth sense a soul sense which sees hears feels all in one I have many tree friends in Wrentham One of them a splendid oak is the special pride of my heart I take all my other friends to see this king tree It stands on a bluff overlooking King Philip s Pond and those who are wise in tree lore say it must have stood there eight hundred or a thousand years There is a tradition that under this tree King Philip the heroic Indian chief gazed his last on earth and sky I had another tree friend gentle and more approachable than the great oak a linden that grew in the dooryard at Red Farm One afternoon during a terrible thunderstorm I felt a tremendous crash against the side of the house and knew even before they told me that the linden had fallen We went out to see the hero that had withstood so many tempests and it wrung my heart to see him prostrate who had mightily striven and was now mightily fallen But I must not forget that I was going to write about last summer in particular As soon as my examinations were over Miss Sullivan and I hastened to this green nook where we have a little cottage on one of the three lakes for which Wrentham is famous Here the long sunny days were mine and all thoughts of work and college and the noisy city were thrust into the background In Wrentham we caught echoes of what was happening in the world war alliance social conflict We heard of the cruel unnecessary fighting in the far away Pacific and learned of the struggles going on between capital and labour We knew that beyond the border of our Eden men were making history by the sweat of their brows when they might better make a holiday But we little heeded these things These things would pass away here were lakes and woods and broad daisy starred fields and sweet breathed meadows and they shall endure forever People who think that all sensations reach us through the eye and the ear have expressed surprise that I should notice any difference except possibly the absence of pavements between walking in city streets and in country roads They forget that my whole body is alive to the conditions about me The rumble and roar of the city smite the nerves of my face and I feel the ceaseless tramp of an unseen multitude and the dissonant tumult frets my spirit The grinding of heavy wagons on hard pavements and the monotonous clangour of machinery are all the more torturing to the nerves if one s attention is not diverted by the panorama that is always present in the noisy streets to people who can see In the country one sees only Nature s fair works and one s soul is not saddened by the cruel struggle for mere existence that goes on in the crowded city Several times I have visited the narrow dirty streets where the poor live and I grow hot and indignant to think that good people should be content to live in fine houses and become strong and beautiful while others are condemned to live in hideous sunless tenements and grow ugly withered and cringing The children who crowd these grimy alleys half clad and underfed shrink away from your outstretched hand as if from a blow Dear little creatures they crouch in my heart and haunt me with a constant sense of pain There are men and women too all gnarled and bent out of shape I have felt their hard rough hands and realized what an endless struggle their existence must be no more than a series of scrimmages thwarted attempts to do something Their life seems an immense disparity between effort and opportunity The sun and the air are God s free gifts to all we say but are they so In yonder city s dingy alleys the sun shines not and the air is foul Oh man how dost thou forget and obstruct thy brother man and say Give us this day our daily bread when he has none Oh would that men would leave the city its splendour and its tumult and its gold and return to wood and field and simple honest living Then would their children grow stately as noble trees and their thoughts sweet and pure as wayside flowers It is impossible not to think of all this when I return to the country after a year of work in town What a joy it is to feel the soft springy earth under my feet once more to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks where I can bathe my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes or to clamber over a stone wall into green fields that tumble and roll and climb in riotous gladness Next to a leisurely walk I enjoy a spin on my tandem bicycle It is splendid to feel the wind blowing in my face and the springy motion of my iron steed The rapid rush through the air gives me a delicious sense of strength and buoyancy and the exercise makes my pulses dance and my heart sing Whenever it is possible my dog accompanies me on a walk or ride or sail I have had many dog friends huge mastiffs soft eyed spaniels wood wise setters and honest homely bull terriers At present the lord of my affections is one of these bull terriers He has a long pedigree a crooked tail and the drollest phiz in dogdom My dog friends seem to understand my limitations and always keep close beside me when I am alone I love their affectionate ways and the eloquent wag of their tails When a rainy day keeps me indoors I amuse myself after the manner of other girls I like to knit and crochet I read in the happy go lucky way I love here and there a line or perhaps I play a game or two of checkers or chess with a friend I have a special board on which I play these games The squares are cut out so that the men stand in them firmly The black checkers are flat and the white ones curved on top Each checker has a hole in the middle in which a brass knob can be placed to distinguish the king from the commons The chessmen are of two sizes the white larger than the black so that I have no trouble in following my opponent s maneuvers by moving my hands lightly over the board after a play The jar made by shifting the men from one hole to another tells me when it is my turn If I happen to be all alone and in an idle mood I play a game of solitaire of which I am very fond I use playing cards marked in the upper right hand corner with braille symbols which indicate the value of the card If there are children around nothing pleases me so much as to frolic with them I find even the smallest child excellent company and I am glad to say that children usually like me They lead me about and show me the things they are interested in Of course the little ones cannot spell on their fingers but I manage to read their lips If I do not succeed they resort to dumb show Sometimes I make a mistake and do the wrong thing A burst of childish laughter greets my blunder and the pantomime begins all over again I often tell them stories or teach them a game and the winged hours depart and leave us good and happy Museums and art stores are also sources of pleasure and inspiration Doubtless it will seem strange to many that the hand unaided by sight can feel action sentiment beauty in the cold marble and yet it is true that I derive genuine pleasure from touching great works of art As my finger tips trace line and curve they discover the thought and emotion which the artist has portrayed I can feel in the faces of gods and heroes hate courage and love just as I can detect them in living faces I am permitted to touch I feel in Diana s posture the grace and freedom of the forest and the spirit that tames the mountain lion and subdues the fiercest passions My soul delights in the repose and gracious curves of the Venus and in Barre s bronzes the secrets of the jungle are revealed to me A medallion of Homer hangs on the wall of my study conveniently low so that I can easily reach it and touch the beautiful sad face with loving reverence How well I know each line in that majestic brow tracks of life and bitter evidences of struggle and sorrow those sightless eyes seeking even in the cold plaster for the light and the blue skies of his beloved Hellas but seeking in vain that beautiful mouth firm and true and tender It is the face of a poet and of a man acquainted with sorrow Ah how well I understand his deprivation the perpetual night in which he dwelt O dark dark amid the blaze of noon Irrecoverably dark total eclipse Without all hope of day In imagination I can hear Homer singing as with unsteady hesitating steps he gropes his way from camp to camp singing of life of love of war of the splendid achievements of a noble race It was a wonderful glorious song and it won the blind poet an immortal crown the admiration of all ages I sometimes wonder if the hand is not more sensitive to the beauties of sculpture than the eye I should think the wonderful rhythmical flow of lines and curves could be more subtly felt than seen Be this as it may I know that I can feel the heart throbs of the ancient Greeks in their marble gods and goddesses Another pleasure which comes more rarely than the others is going to the theatre I enjoy having a play described to me while it is being acted on the stage far more than reading it because then it seems as if I were living in the midst of stirring events It has been my privilege to meet a few great actors and actresses who have the power of so bewitching you that you forget time and place and live again in the romantic past I have been permitted to touch the face and costume of Miss Ellen Terry as she impersonated our ideal of a queen and there was about her that divinity that hedges sublimest woe Beside her stood Sir Henry Irving wearing the symbols of kingship and there was majesty of intellect in his every gesture and attitude and the royalty that subdues and overcomes in every line of his sensitive face In the king s face which he wore as a mask there was a remoteness and inaccessibility of grief which I shall never forget I also know mister Jefferson I am proud to count him among my friends I go to see him whenever I happen to be where he is acting The first time I saw him act was while at school in New York He played Rip Van Winkle I had often read the story but I had never felt the charm of Rip s slow quaint kind ways as I did in the play mister Jefferson s beautiful pathetic representation quite carried me away with delight I have a picture of old Rip in my fingers which they will never lose After the play Miss Sullivan took me to see him behind the scenes and I felt of his curious garb and his flowing hair and beard mister Jefferson let me touch his face so that I could imagine how he looked on waking from that strange sleep of twenty years and he showed me how poor old Rip staggered to his feet I have also seen him in The Rivals Once while I was calling on him in Boston he acted the most striking parts of The Rivals for me The reception room where we sat served for a stage He and his son seated themselves at the big table and Bob Acres wrote his challenge I followed all his movements with my hands and caught the drollery of his blunders and gestures in a way that would have been impossible had it all been spelled to me Then they rose to fight the duel and I followed the swift thrusts and parries of the swords and the waverings of poor Bob as his courage oozed out at his finger ends Then the great actor gave his coat a hitch and his mouth a twitch and in an instant I was in the village of Falling Water and felt Schneider s shaggy head against my knee mister Jefferson recited the best dialogues of Rip Van Winkle in which the tear came close upon the smile He asked me to indicate as far as I could the gestures and action that should go with the lines Of course I have no sense whatever of dramatic action and could make only random guesses but with masterful art he suited the action to the word The sigh of Rip as he murmurs Is a man so soon forgotten when he is gone the dismay with which he searches for dog and gun after his long sleep and his comical irresolution over signing the contract with Derrick all these seem to be right out of life itself that is the ideal life where things happen as we think they should I remember well the first time I went to the theatre It was twelve years ago Elsie Leslie the little actress was in Boston and Miss Sullivan took me to see her in The Prince and the Pauper I shall never forget the ripple of alternating joy and woe that ran through that beautiful little play or the wonderful child who acted it After the play I was permitted to go behind the scenes and meet her in her royal costume It would have been hard to find a lovelier or more lovable child than Elsie as she stood with a cloud of golden hair floating over her shoulders smiling brightly showing no signs of shyness or fatigue though she had been playing to an immense audience I was only just learning to speak and had previously repeated her name until I could say it perfectly Imagine my delight when she understood the few words I spoke to her and without hesitation stretched her hand to greet me Is it not true then that my life with all its limitations touches at many points the life of the World Beautiful Everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and I learn whatever state I may be in therein to be content Sometimes it is true a sense of isolation enfolds me like a cold mist as I sit alone and wait at life s shut gate Beyond there is light and music and sweet companionship but I may not enter Fate silent pitiless bars the way Fain would I question his imperious decree for my heart is still undisciplined and passionate but my tongue will not utter the bitter futile words that rise to my lips and they fall back into my heart like unshed tears Silence sits immense upon my soul Then comes hope with a smile and whispers There is joy in self forgetfulness So I try to make the light in others eyes my sun the music in others ears my symphony the smile on others lips my happiness CHAPTER XXIII Would that I could enrich this sketch with the names of all those who have ministered to my happiness Some of them would be found written in our literature and dear to the hearts of many while others would be wholly unknown to most of my readers But their influence though it escapes fame shall live immortal in the lives that have been sweetened and ennobled by it Those are red letter days in our lives when we meet people who thrill us like a fine poem people whose handshake is brimful of unspoken sympathy and whose sweet rich natures impart to our eager impatient spirits a wonderful restfulness which in its essence is divine The perplexities irritations and worries that have absorbed us pass like unpleasant dreams and we wake to see with new eyes and hear with new ears the beauty and harmony of God s real world The solemn nothings that fill our everyday life blossom suddenly into bright possibilities In a word while such friends are near us we feel that all is well Perhaps we never saw them before and they may never cross our life s path again but the influence of their calm mellow natures is a libation poured upon our discontent and we feel its healing touch as the ocean feels the mountain stream freshening its brine I have often been asked Do not people bore you I do not understand quite what that means I suppose the calls of the stupid and curious especially of newspaper reporters are always inopportune I also dislike people who try to talk down to my understanding They are like people who when walking with you try to shorten their steps to suit yours the hypocrisy in both cases is equally exasperating The hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me The touch of some hands is an impertinence I have met people so empty of joy that when I clasped their frosty finger tips it seemed as if I were shaking hands with a northeast storm Others there are whose hands have sunbeams in them so that their grasp warms my heart It may be only the clinging touch of a child s hand but there is as much potential sunshine in it for me as there is in a loving glance for others A hearty handshake or a friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure I have many far off friends whom I have never seen Indeed they are so many that I have often been unable to reply to their letters but I wish to say here that I am always grateful for their kind words however insufficiently I acknowledge them I count it one of the sweetest privileges of my life to have known and conversed with many men of genius Only those who knew Bishop Brooks can appreciate the joy his friendship was to those who possessed it As a child I loved to sit on his knee and clasp his great hand with one of mine while Miss Sullivan spelled into the other his beautiful words about God and the spiritual world I heard him with a child s wonder and delight My spirit could not reach up to his but he gave me a real sense of joy in life and I never left him without carrying away a fine thought that grew in beauty and depth of meaning as I grew Once when I was puzzled to know why there were so many religions he said There is one universal religion Helen the religion of love Love your Heavenly Father with your whole heart and soul love every child of God as much as ever you can and remember that the possibilities of good are greater than the possibilities of evil and you have the key to Heaven And his life was a happy illustration of this great truth In his noble soul love and widest knowledge were blended with faith that had become insight He saw God in all that liberates and lifts In all that humbles sweetens and consoles Bishop Brooks taught me no special creed or dogma but he impressed upon my mind two great ideas the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man and made me feel that these truths underlie all creeds and forms of worship God is love God is our Father we are His children therefore the darkest clouds will break and though right be worsted wrong shall not triumph I am too happy in this world to think much about the future except to remember that I have cherished friends awaiting me there in God s beautiful Somewhere In spite of the lapse of years they seem so close to me that I should not think it strange if at any moment they should clasp my hand and speak words of endearment as they used to before they went away Since Bishop Brooks died I have read the Bible through also some philosophical works on religion among them Swedenborg s Heaven and Hell and Drummond s Ascent of Man and I have found no creed or system more soul satisfying than Bishop Brooks s creed of love I knew mister Henry Drummond and the memory of his strong warm hand clasp is like a benediction He was the most sympathetic of companions He knew so much and was so genial that it was impossible to feel dull in his presence I remember well the first time I saw doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes He had invited Miss Sullivan and me to call on him one Sunday afternoon It was early in the spring just after I had learned to speak We were shown at once to his library where we found him seated in a big armchair by an open fire which glowed and crackled on the hearth thinking he said of other days And listening to the murmur of the River Charles I suggested Yes he replied the Charles has many dear associations for me There was an odour of print and leather in the room which told me that it was full of books and I stretched out my hand instinctively to find them My fingers lighted upon a beautiful volume of Tennyson s poems and when Miss Sullivan told me what it was I began to recite Break break break On thy cold gray stones O sea But I stopped suddenly I felt tears on my hand I had made my beloved poet weep and I was greatly distressed He made me sit in his armchair while he brought different interesting things for me to examine and at his request I recited The Chambered Nautilus which was then my favorite poem After that I saw doctor Holmes many times and learned to love the man as well as the poet One beautiful summer day not long after my meeting with doctor Holmes Miss Sullivan and I visited Whittier in his quiet home on the Merrimac His gentle courtesy and quaint speech won my heart He had a book of his poems in raised print from which I read In School Days He was delighted that I could pronounce the words so well and said that he had no difficulty in understanding me Then I asked many questions about the poem and read his answers by placing my fingers on his lips He said he was the little boy in the poem and that the girl s name was Sally and more which I have forgotten I also recited Laus Deo and as I spoke the concluding verses he placed in my hands a statue of a slave from whose crouching figure the fetters were falling even as they fell from Peter s limbs when the angel led him forth out of prison Afterward we went into his study and he wrote his autograph for my teacher With great admiration of thy noble work in releasing from bondage the mind of thy dear pupil I am truly thy friend john J Whittier and expressed his admiration of her work saying to me She is thy spiritual liberator Then he led me to the gate and kissed me tenderly on my forehead I promised to visit him again the following summer but he died before the promise was fulfilled doctor Edward Everett Hale is one of my very oldest friends I have known him since I was eight and my love for him has increased with my years His wise tender sympathy has been the support of Miss Sullivan and me in times of trial and sorrow and his strong hand has helped us over many rough places and what he has done for us he has done for thousands of those who have difficult tasks to accomplish He has filled the old skins of dogma with the new wine of love and shown men what it is to believe live and be free What he has taught we have seen beautifully expressed in his own life love of country kindness to the least of his brethren and a sincere desire to live upward and onward He has been a prophet and an inspirer of men and a mighty doer of the Word the friend of all his race God bless him I have already written of my first meeting with doctor Alexander Graham Bell Since then I have spent many happy days with him at Washington and at his beautiful home in the heart of Cape Breton Island near Baddeck the village made famous by Charles Dudley Warner s book Here in doctor Bell s laboratory or in the fields on the shore of the great Bras d Or I have spent many delightful hours listening to what he had to tell me about his experiments and helping him fly kites by means of which he expects to discover the laws that shall govern the future air ship doctor Bell is proficient in many fields of science and has the art of making every subject he touches interesting even the most abstruse theories He makes you feel that if you only had a little more time you too might be an inventor He has a humorous and poetic side too His dominating passion is his love for children He is never quite so happy as when he has a little deaf child in his arms His labours in behalf of the deaf will live on and bless generations of children yet to come and we love him alike for what he himself has achieved and for what he has evoked from others During the two years I spent in New York I had many opportunities to talk with distinguished people whose names I had often heard but whom I had never expected to meet Most of them I met first in the house of my good friend mister Laurence Hutton It was a great privilege to visit him and dear missus Hutton in their lovely home and see their library and read the beautiful sentiments and bright thoughts gifted friends had written for them It has been truly said that mister Hutton has the faculty of bringing out in every one the best thoughts and kindest sentiments One does not need to read A Boy I Knew to understand him the most generous sweet natured boy I ever knew a good friend in all sorts of weather who traces the footprints of love in the life of dogs as well as in that of his fellowmen missus Hutton is a true and tried friend Much that I hold sweetest much that I hold most precious I owe to her She has oftenest advised and helped me in my progress through college When I find my work particularly difficult and discouraging she writes me letters that make me feel glad and brave for she is one of those from whom we learn that one painful duty fulfilled makes the next plainer and easier mister Hutton introduced me to many of his literary friends greatest of whom are mister William Dean Howells and Mark Twain I also met mister Richard Watson Gilder and mister Edmund Clarence Stedman I also knew mister Charles Dudley Warner the most delightful of story tellers and the most beloved friend whose sympathy was so broad that it may be truly said of him he loved all living things and his neighbour as himself Once mister Warner brought to see me the dear poet of the woodlands mister John Burroughs They were all gentle and sympathetic and I felt the charm of their manner as much as I had felt the brilliancy of their essays and poems I could not keep pace with all these literary folk as they glanced from subject to subject and entered into deep dispute or made conversation sparkle with epigrams and happy witticisms I was like little Ascanius who followed with unequal steps the heroic strides of Aeneas on his march toward mighty destinies But they spoke many gracious words to me mister Gilder told me about his moonlight journeys across the vast desert to the Pyramids and in a letter he wrote me he made his mark under his signature deep in the paper so that I could feel it This reminds me that doctor Hale used to give a personal touch to his letters to me by pricking his signature in braille I read from Mark Twain s lips one or two of his good stories He has his own way of thinking saying and doing everything I feel the twinkle of his eye in his handshake Even while he utters his cynical wisdom in an indescribably droll voice he makes you feel that his heart is a tender Iliad of human sympathy There are a host of other interesting people I met in New York missus Mary Mapes Dodge the beloved editor of saint Nicholas and missus Riggs Kate Douglas Wiggin the sweet author of Patsy I received from them gifts that have the gentle concurrence of the heart books containing their own thoughts soul illumined letters and photographs that I love to have described again and again But there is not space to mention all my friends and indeed there are things about them hidden behind the wings of cherubim things too sacred to set forth in cold print It is with hesitancy that I have spoken even of missus Laurence Hutton I shall mention only two other friends One is missus William Thaw of Pittsburgh whom I have often visited in her home Lyndhurst She is always doing something to make some one happy and her generosity and wise counsel have never failed my teacher and me in all the years we have known her To the other friend I am also deeply indebted He is well known for the powerful hand with which he guides vast enterprises and his wonderful abilities have gained for him the respect of all Kind to every one he goes about doing good silent and unseen Again I touch upon the circle of honoured names I must not mention but I would fain acknowledge his generosity and affectionate interest which make it possible for me to go to college Thus it is that my friends have made the story of my life In a thousand ways they have turned my limitations into beautiful privileges and enabled me to walk serene and happy in the shadow cast by my deprivation II LETTERS eighteen eighty seven nineteen oh one II LETTERS eighteen eighty seven nineteen oh one INTRODUCTION Helen Keller s letters are important not only as a supplementary story of her life but as a demonstration of her growth in thought and expression the growth which in itself has made her distinguished These letters are however not merely remarkable as the productions of a deaf and blind girl to be read with wonder and curiosity they are good letters almost from the first The best passages are those in which she talks about herself and gives her world in terms of her experience of it Her views on the precession of the equinoxes are not important but most important are her accounts of what speech meant to her of how she felt the statues the dogs the chickens at the poultry show and how she stood in the aisle of saint Bartholomew s and felt the organ rumble Those are passages of which one would ask for more The reason they are comparatively few is that all her life she has been trying to be like other people and so she too often describes things not as they appear to her but as they appear to one with eyes and ears One cause for the excellence of her letters is the great number of them They are the exercises which have trained her to write She has lived at different times in different parts of the country and so has been separated from most of her friends and relatives Of her friends many have been distinguished people to whom not often I think at the sacrifice of spontaneity she has felt it necessary to write well To them and to a few friends with whom she is in closest sympathy she writes with intimate frankness whatever she is thinking about Her naive retelling of a child s tale she has heard like the story of Little Jakey which she rehearses for doctor Holmes and Bishop Brooks is charming and her grave paraphrase of the day s lesson in geography or botany her parrot like repetition of what she has heard and her conscious display of new words are delightful and instructive for they show not only what she was learning but how by putting it all into letters she made the new knowledge and the new words her own So these selections from Miss Keller s correspondence are made with two purposes to show her development and to preserve the most entertaining and significant passages from several hundred letters Many of those written before eighteen ninety two were published in the reports of the Perkins Institution for the Blind All letters up to that year are printed intact for it is legitimate to be interested in the degree of skill the child showed in writing even to details of punctuation so it is well to preserve a literal integrity of reproduction From the letters after the year eighteen ninety two I have culled in the spirit of one making an anthology choosing the passages best in style and most important from the point of view of biography Where I have been able to collate the original letters I have preserved everything as Miss Keller wrote it punctuation spelling and all I have done nothing but select and cut The letters are arranged in chronological order One or two letters from Bishop Brooks doctor Holmes and Whittier are put immediately after the letters to which they are replies Except for two or three important letters of nineteen oh one these selections cease with the year nineteen hundred In that year Miss Keller entered college Now that she is a grown woman her mature letters should be judged like those of any other person and it seems best that no more of her correspondence be published unless she should become distinguished beyond the fact that she is the only well educated deaf and blind person in the world LETTERS eighteen eighty seven nineteen oh one Miss Sullivan began to teach Helen Keller on March third eighteen eighty seven Three months and a half after the first word was spelled into her hand she wrote in pencil this letter TO HER COUSIN ANNA missus GEORGE T

doctor Alexander Graham Bell and called on President Cleveland On May twenty sixth they arrived in Boston and went to the Perkins Institution here Helen met the little blind girls with whom she had corresponded the year before Early in July she went to Brewster Massachusetts and spent the rest of the summer Here occurred her first encounter with the sea of which she has since written TO MISS MARY C MOORE So Boston Mass Sept eighteen eighty eight My dear Miss Moore Are you very glad to receive a nice letter from your darling little friend I love you very dearly because you are my friend My precious little sister is quite well now She likes to sit in my little rocking chair and put her kitty to sleep Would you like to see darling little Mildred She is a very pretty baby Her eyes are very big and blue and her cheeks are soft and round and rosy and her hair is very bright and golden She is very good and sweet when she does not cry loud Next summer Mildred will go out in the garden with me and pick the big sweet strawberries and then she will be very happy I hope she will not eat too many of the delicious fruit for they will make her very ill Sometime will you please come to Alabama and visit me My uncle James is going to buy me a very gentle pony and a pretty cart and I shall be very happy to take you and Harry to ride I hope Harry will not be afraid of my pony I think my father will buy me a beautiful little brother some day I shall be very gentle and patient to my new little brother When I visit many strange countries my brother and Mildred will stay with grandmother because they will be too small to see a great many people and I think they would cry loud on the great rough ocean When captain Baker gets well he will take me in his big ship to Africa Then I shall see lions and tigers and monkeys I will get a baby lion and a white monkey and a mild bear to bring home I had a very pleasant time at Brewster I went in bathing almost every day and Carrie and Frank

to see me and he hugged and kissed me The little girls are coming back to school next Wednesday Will you please tell Harry to write me a very long letter soon When you come to Tuscumbia to see me I hope my father will have many sweet apples and juicy peaches and fine pears and delicious grapes and large water melons I hope you think about me and love me because I am a good little child With much love and two kisses From your little friend HELEN A KELLER In this account of a visit to some friends Helen s thought is much what one would expect from an ordinary child of eight except perhaps her naive satisfaction in the boldness of the young gentlemen TO missus KATE ADAMS KELLER So Boston Mass Sept twenty fourth eighteen eighty eight My dear Mother I think you will be very glad to know all about my visit to West Newton Teacher and I had a lovely time with many kind friends West Newton is not far from Boston and we went there in the steam cars very quickly missus Freeman and Carrie and Ethel and Frank and Helen came to station to meet us in a huge carriage I was delighted to see my dear little friends and I hugged and kissed them Then we rode for a long time to see all the beautiful things in West Newton Many very handsome houses and large soft green lawns around them and trees and bright flowers and fountains The horse s name was Prince and he was gentle and liked to trot very fast When we went home we saw eight rabbits and two fat puppies and a nice little white pony and two wee kittens and a pretty curly dog named Don Pony s name was Mollie and I had a nice ride on her back I was not afraid I hope my uncle will get me a dear little pony and a little cart very soon Clifton did not kiss me because he does not like to kiss little girls He is shy I am very glad that Frank and Clarence and Robbie and Eddie and Charles and George were not very shy I played with many little girls and we had fun I rode on Carrie s tricicle and picked flowers and ate fruit and hopped and skipped and danced and went to ride Many ladies and gentlemen came to see us Lucy and Dora and Charles were born in China I was born in America and mister Anagnos was born in Greece mister Drew says little girls in China cannot talk on their fingers but I think when I go to China I will teach them Chinese nurse came to see me her name was Asu She showed me a tiny atze that very rich ladies in China wear because their feet never grow large Amah means a nurse We came home in horse cars because it was Sunday and steam cars do not go often on Sunday Conductors and engineers do get very tired and go home to rest I saw little Willie Swan in the car and he gave me a juicy pear He was six years old What did I do when I was six years old Will you please ask my father to come to train to meet teacher and me I am very sorry that Eva and Bessie are sick I hope I can have a nice party my birthday and I do want Carrie and Ethel and Frank and Helen to come to Alabama to visit me Will Mildred sleep with me when I come home With much love and thousand kisses From your dear little daughter HELEN A KELLER Her visit to Plymouth was in July This letter written three months later shows how well she remembered her first lesson in history TO mister MORRISON HEADY South Boston Mass October first eighteen eighty eight My dear uncle Morrie I think you will be very glad to receive a letter from your dear little friend Helen I am very happy to write to you because I think of you and love you I read pretty stories in the book you sent me about Charles and his boat and Arthur and his dream and Rosa and the sheep I have been in a large boat It was like a ship Mother and teacher and missus Hopkins and mister Anagnos and mister Rodocanachi and many other friends went to Plymouth to see many old things I will tell you a little story about Plymouth Many years ago there lived in England many good people but the king and his friends were not kind and gentle and patient with good people because the king did not like to have the people disobey him People did not like to go to church with the king but they did like to build very nice little churches for themselves The king was very angry with the people and they were sorry and they said we will go away to a strange country to live and leave very dear home and friends and naughty king So they put all their things into big boxes and said Good bye I am sorry for them because they cried much When they went to Holland they did not know anyone and they could not know what the people were talking about because they did not know Dutch But soon they learned some Dutch words but they loved their own language and they did not want little boys and girls to forget it and learn to talk funny Dutch So they said We must go to a new country far away and build schools and houses and churches and make new cities So they put all their things in boxes and said Good bye to their new friends and sailed away in a large boat to find a new country Poor people were not happy for their hearts were full of sad thoughts because they did not know much about America I think little children must have been afraid of a great ocean for it is very strong and it makes a large boat rock and then the little children would fall down and hurt their heads After they had been many weeks on the deep ocean where they could not see trees or flowers or grass but just water and the beautiful sky for ships could not sail quickly then because men did not know about engines and steam One day a dear little baby boy was born His name was Peregrine White I am very sorry that poor little Peregrine is dead now Every day the people went upon deck to look out for land One day there was a great shout on the ship for the people saw the land and they were full of joy because they had reached a new country safely Little girls and boys jumped and clapped their hands They were all glad when they stepped upon a huge rock I did see the rock in Plymouth and a little ship like the Mayflower and the cradle that dear little Peregrine slept in and many old things that came in the Mayflower Would you like to visit Plymouth some time and see many old things Now I am very tired and I will rest With much love and many kisses from your little friend HELEN A KELLER The foreign words in these two letters the first of which was written during a visit to the kindergarten for the blind she had been told months before and had stowed them away in her memory She assimilated words and practised with them sometimes using them intelligently sometimes repeating them in a parrot like fashion Even when she did not fully understand words or ideas she liked to set them down as though she did It was in this way that she learned to use correctly words of sound and vision which express ideas outside of her experience Edith is Edith Thomas TO mister MICHAEL ANAGNOS Roxbury Mass Oct seventeenth eighteen eighty eight Mon cher Monsieur Anagnos I am sitting by the window and the beautiful sun is shining on me Teacher and I came to the kindergarten yesterday There are twenty seven little children here and they are all blind I am sorry because they cannot see much Sometime will they have very well eyes Poor Edith is blind and deaf and dumb Are you very sad for Edith and me Soon I shall go home to see my mother and my father and my dear good and sweet little sister I hope you will come to Alabama to visit me and I will take you to ride in my little cart and I think you will like to see me on my dear little pony s back I shall wear my lovely cap and my new riding dress If the sun shines brightly I will take you to see Leila and Eva and Bessie When I am thirteen years old I am going to travel in many strange and beautiful countries I shall climb very high mountains in Norway and see much ice and snow I hope I will not fall and hurt my head I shall visit little Lord Fauntleroy in England and he will be glad to show me his grand and very ancient castle And we will run with the deer and feed the rabbits and catch the squirrels I shall not be afraid of Fauntleroy s great dog Dougal I hope Fauntleroy take me to see a very kind queen When I go to France I will take French A little French boy will say Parlez vous Francais and I will say Oui Monsieur vous avez un joli chapeau Donnez moi un baiser I hope you will go with me to Athens to see the maid of Athens She was very lovely lady and I will talk Greek to her I will say se agapo and pos echete and I think she will say kalos and then I will say chaere Will you please come to see me soon and take me to the theater When you come I will say Kale emera and when you go home I will say Kale nykta Now I am too tired to write more Je vous aime Au revoir From your darling little friend HELEN A KELLER TO MISS EVELINA H KELLER So Boston Mass October twenty nine eighteen eighty eight My dearest Aunt I am coming home very soon and I think you and every one will be very glad to see my teacher and me I am very happy because I have learned much about many things I am studying French and German and Latin and Greek Se agapo is Greek and it means I love thee J ai une bonne petite soeur is French and it means I have a good little sister Nous avons un bon pere et une bonne mere means we have a good father and a good mother Puer is boy in Latin and Mutter is mother in German I will teach Mildred many languages when I come home HELEN A KELLER TO missus SOPHIA C HOPKINS Tuscumbia Ala Dec eleventh eighteen eighty eight My dear missus Hopkins I have just fed my dear little pigeon My brother Simpson gave it to me last Sunday I named it Annie for my teacher My puppy has had his supper and gone to bed My rabbits are sleeping too and very soon I shall go to bed Teacher is writing letters to her friends Mother and father and their friends have gone to see a huge furnace The furnace is to make iron The iron ore is found in the ground but it cannot be used until it has been brought to the furnace and melted and all the dirt taken out and just the pure iron left Then it is all ready to be manufactured into engines stoves kettles and many other things Coal is found in the ground too Many years ago before people came to live on the earth great trees and tall grasses and huge ferns and all the beautiful flowers cover the earth When the leaves and the trees fell the water and the soil covered them and then more trees grew and fell also and were buried under water and soil After they had all been pressed together for many thousands of years the wood grew very hard like rock and then it was all ready for people to burn Can you see leaves and ferns and bark on the coal Men go down into the ground and dig out the coal and steam cars take it to the large cities and sell it to people to burn to make them warm and happy when it is cold out of doors Are you very lonely and sad now I hope you will come to see me soon and stay a long time With much love from your little friend HELEN A KELLER TO MISS DELLA BENNETT Tuscumbia Ala Jan twenty nine eighteen eighty nine My dear Miss Bennett I am delighted to write to you this morning We have just eaten our breakfast Mildred is running about downstairs I have been reading in my book about astronomers Astronomer comes from the Latin word astra which means stars and astronomers are men who study the stars and tell us about them When we are sleeping quietly in our beds they are watching the beautiful sky through the telescope A telescope is like a very strong eye The stars are so far away that people cannot tell much about them without very excellent instruments Do you like to look out of your window and see little stars Teacher says she can see Venus from our window and it is a large and beautiful star The stars are called the earth s brothers and sisters There are a great many instruments besides those which the astronomers use A knife is an instrument to cut with I think the bell is an instrument too I will tell you what I know about bells Some bells are musical and others are unmusical Some are very tiny and some are very large I saw a very large bell at Wellesley It came from Japan Bells are used for many purposes They tell us when breakfast is ready when to go to school when it is time for church and when there is a fire They tell people when to go to work and when to go home and rest The engine bell tells the passengers that they are coming to a station and it tells the people to keep out of the way Sometimes very terrible accidents happen and many people are burned and drowned and injured The other day I broke my doll s head off but that was not a dreadful accident because dolls do not live and feel like people My little pigeons are well and so is my little bird I would like to have some clay Teacher says it is time for me to study now Good bye With much love and many kisses HELEN A KELLER TO doctor EDWARD EVERETT HALE Tuscumbia Alabama February twenty first eighteen eighty nine My dear mister Hale I am very much afraid that you are thinking in your mind that little Helen has forgotten all about you and her dear cousins But I think you will be delighted to receive this letter because then you will know that I of ten think about you and I love you dearly for you are my dear cousin I have been at home a great many weeks now It made me feel very sad to leave Boston and I missed all of my friends greatly but of course I was glad to get back to my lovely home once more My darling little sister is growing very fast Sometimes she tries to spell very short words on her small fingers but she is too young to remember hard words When she is older I will teach her many things if she is patient and obedient My teacher says if children learn to be patient and gentle while they are little that when they grow to be young ladies and gentlemen they will not forget to be kind and loving and brave I hope I shall be courageous always A little girl in a story was not courageous She thought she saw little elves with tall pointed hats peeping from between the bushes and dancing down the long alleys and the poor little girl was terrified Did you have a pleasant Christmas I had many lovely presents given to me The other day I had a fine party All of my dear little friends came to see me We played games and ate ice cream and cake and fruit Then we had great fun The sun is shining brightly to day and I hope we shall go to ride if the roads are dry In a few days the beautiful spring will be here I am very glad because I love the warm sunshine and the fragrant flowers I think Flowers grow to make people happy and good I have four dolls now Cedric is my little boy he is named for Lord Fauntleroy He has big brown eyes and long golden hair and pretty round cheeks Ida is my baby A lady brought her to me from Paris She can drink milk like a real baby Lucy is a fine young lady She has on a dainty lace dress and satin slippers Poor old Nancy is growing old and very feeble She is almost an invalid I have two tame pigeons and a tiny canary bird Jumbo is very strong and faithful He will not let anything harm us at night I go to school every day I am studying reading writing arithmetic geography and language My Mother and teacher send you and missus Hale their kind greetings and Mildred sends you a kiss With much love and kisses from your Affectionate cousin HELEN A KELLER During the winter Miss Sullivan and her pupil were working at Helen s home in Tuscumbia and to good purpose for by spring Helen had learned to write idiomatic English After May eighteen eighty nine I find almost no inaccuracies except some evident slips of the pencil She uses words precisely and makes easy fluent sentences TO mister MICHAEL ANAGNOS Tuscumbia Ala May eighteen eighteen eighty nine My Dear mister Anagnos You cannot imagine how delighted I was to receive a letter from you last evening I am very sorry that you are going so far away We shall miss you very very much I would love to visit many beautiful cities with you When I was in Huntsville I saw doctor Bryson and he told me that he had been to Rome and Athens and Paris and London He had climbed the high mountains in Switzerland and visited beautiful churches in Italy and France and he saw a great many ancient castles I hope you will please write to me from all the cities you visit When you go to Holland please give my love to the lovely princess Wilhelmina She is a dear little girl and when she is old enough she will be the queen of Holland If you go to Roumania please ask the good queen Elizabeth about her little invalid brother and tell her that I am very sorry that her darling little girl died I should like to send a kiss to Vittorio the little prince of Naples but teacher says she is afraid you will not remember so many messages When I am thirteen years old I shall visit them all myself I thank you very much for the beautiful story about Lord Fauntleroy and so does teacher I am so glad that Eva is coming to stay with me this summer We will have fine times together Give Howard my love and tell him to answer my letter Thursday we had a picnic It was very pleasant out in the shady woods and we all enjoyed the picnic very much Mildred is out in the yard playing and mother is picking the delicious strawberries Father and Uncle Frank are down town Simpson is coming home soon Mildred and I had our pictures taken while we were in Huntsville I will send you one The roses have been beautiful Mother has a great many fine roses The La France and the Lamarque are the most fragrant but the Marechal Neil Solfaterre Jacqueminot Nipheots Etoile de Lyon Papa Gontier Gabrielle Drevet and the Perle des Jardines are all lovely roses Please give the little boys and girls my love I think of them every day and I love them dearly in my heart When you come home from Europe I hope you will be all well and very happy to get home again Do not forget to give my love to Miss Calliope Kehayia and mister Francis Demetrios Kalopothakes Lovingly your little friend HELEN ADAMS KELLER Like a good many of Helen Keller s early letters this to her French teacher is her re phrasing of a story It shows how much the gift of writing is in the early stages of its development the gift of mimicry TO MISS FANNIE S MARRETT Tuscumbia Ala May seventeen eighteen eighty nine My Dear Miss Marrett I am thinking about a dear little girl who wept very hard She wept because her brother teased her very much I will tell you what he did and I think you will feel very sorry for the little child She had a most beautiful doll given her Oh it was a lovely and delicate doll but the little girl s brother a tall lad had taken the doll and set it up in a high tree in the garden and had run away The little girl could not reach the doll and could not help it down and therefore she cried The doll cried too and stretched out its arms from among the green branches and looked distressed Soon the dismal night would come and was the doll to sit up in the tree all night and by herself The little girl could not endure that thought I will stay with you said she to the doll although she was not at all courageous Already she began to see quite plainly the little elves in their tall pointed hats dancing down the dusky alleys and peeping from between the bushes and they seemed to come nearer and nearer and she stretched her hands up towards the tree in which the doll sat and they laughed and pointed their fingers at her How terrified was the little girl but if one has not done anything wrong these strange little elves cannot harm one Have I done anything wrong Ah yes said the little girl I have laughed at the poor duck with the red rag tied round its leg It hobbled and that made me laugh but it is wrong to laugh at the poor animals Is it not a pitiful story I hope the father punished the naughty little boy Shall you be very glad to see my teacher next Thursday She is going home to rest but she will come back to me next autumn Lovingly your little friend HELEN ADAMS KELLER TO MISS MARY E RILEY Tuscumbia Ala May twenty seven eighteen eighty nine My Dear Miss Riley I wish you were here in the warm sunny south today Little sister and I would take you out into the garden and pick the delicious raspberries and a few strawberries for you How would you like that The strawberries are nearly all gone In the evening when it is cool and pleasant we would walk in the yard and catch the grasshoppers and butterflies We would talk about the birds and flowers and grass and Jumbo and Pearl If you liked we would run and jump and hop and dance and be very happy I think you would enjoy hearing the mocking birds sing One sits on the twig of a tree just beneath our window and he fills the air with his glad songs But I am afraid you cannot come to Tuscumbia so I will write to you and send you a sweet kiss and my love How is Dick Daisy is happy but she would be happy ever if she had a little mate My little children are all well except Nancy and she is quite feeble My grandmother and aunt Corinne are here Grandmother is going to make me two new dresses Give my love to all the little girls and tell them that Helen loves them very very much Eva sends love to all With much love and many kisses from your affectionate little friend HELEN ADAMS KELLER During the summer Miss Sullivan was away from Helen for three months and a half the first separation of teacher and pupil Only once afterward in fifteen years was their constant companionship broken for more than a few days at a time TO MISS ANNE MANSFIELD SULLIVAN Tuscumbia Ala August seven eighteen eighty nine Dearest Teacher I am very glad to write to you this evening for I have been thinking much about you all day I am sitting on the piazza and my little white pigeon is perched on the back of my chair watching me write Her little brown mate has flown away with the other birds but Annie is not sad for she likes to stay with me Fauntleroy is asleep upstairs and Nancy is putting Lucy to bed Perhaps the mocking bird is singing them to sleep All the beautiful flowers are in bloom now The air is sweet with the perfume of jasmines heliotropes and roses It is getting warm here now so father is going to take us to the Quarry on the twentieth of August I think we shall have a beautiful time out in the cool pleasant woods I will write and tell you all the pleasant things we do I am so glad that Lester and Henry are good little infants Give them many sweet

out in the bright sunshine with him He will pull the largest roses and chase the gayest butterflies I will take very good care of him and not let him fall and hurt himself Father and some other gentlemen went hunting yesterday Father killed thirty eight birds We had some of them for supper and they were very nice Last Monday Simpson shot a pretty crane The crane is a large and strong bird His wings are as long as my arm and his bill is as long as my foot He eats little fishes and other small animals Father says he can fly nearly all day without stopping Mildred is the dearest and sweetest little maiden in the world She is very roguish too Sometimes when mother does not know it she goes out into the vineyard and gets her apron full of delicious grapes I think she would like to put her two soft arms around your neck and hug you Sunday I went to church I love to go to church because I like to see my friends A gentleman gave me a beautiful card It was a picture of a mill near a beautiful brook There was a boat floating on the water and the fragrant lilies were growing all around the boat Not far from the mill there was an old house with many trees growing close to it There

he published in Over the Teacups Atlantic Monthly May eighteen ninety TO doctor OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES South Boston Mass March one eighteen ninety Dear Kind Poet I have thought of you many times since that bright Sunday when I bade you good bye and I am going to write you a letter because I love you I am sorry that you have no little children to play with you sometimes but I think you are very happy with your books and your many many friends On Washington s birthday a great many people came here to see the blind children and I read for them from your poems and showed them some beautiful shells which came from a little island near Palos I am reading a very sad story called Little Jakey Jakey was the sweetest little fellow you can imagine but he was poor and blind I used to think when I was small and before I could read that everybody was always happy and at first it made me very sad to know about pain and great sorrow but now I know that we could never learn to be brave and patient if there were only joy in the world I am studying about insects in zoology and I have learned many things about butterflies They do not make honey for us like the bees but many of them are as beautiful as the flowers they light upon and they always delight the hearts of little children They live a gay life flitting from flower to flower sipping the drops of honeydew without a thought for the morrow They are just like little boys and girls when they forget books and studies and run away to the woods and the fields to gather wild flowers or wade in the ponds for fragrant lilies happy in the bright sunshine If my little sister comes to Boston next June will you let me bring her to see you She is a lovely baby and I am sure you will love her Now I must tell my gentle poet good bye for I have a letter to write home before I go to bed From your loving little friend HELEN A KELLER TO MISS SARAH FULLER Miss Fuller gave Helen Keller her first lesson in articulation See Chapter IV Speech South Boston Mass April three eighteen ninety My dear Miss Fuller My heart is full of joy this beautiful morning because I have learned to speak many new words and I can make a few sentences Last evening I went out in the yard and spoke to the moon I said O moon come to me Do you think the lovely moon was glad that I could speak to her How glad my mother will be I can hardly wait for June to come I am so eager to speak to her and to my precious little sister Mildred could not understand me when I spelled with my fingers but now she will sit in my lap and I will tell her many things to please her and we shall be so happy together Are you very very happy because you can make so many people happy I think you are very kind and patient and I love you very dearly My teacher told me Tuesday that you wanted to know how I came to wish to talk with my mouth I will tell you all about it for I remember my thoughts perfectly When I was a very little child I used to sit in my mother s lap all the time because I was very timid and did not like to be left by myself And I would keep my little hand on her face all the while because it amused me to feel her face and lips move when she talked with people I did not know then what she was doing for I was quite ignorant of all things Then when I was older I learned to play with my nurse and the little negro children and I noticed that they kept moving their lips just like my mother so I moved mine too but sometimes it made me angry and I would hold my playmates mouths very hard I did not know then that it was very naughty to do so After a long time my dear teacher came to me and taught me to communicate with my fingers and I was satisfied and happy But when I came to school in Boston I met some deaf people who talked with their mouths like all other people and one day a lady who had been to Norway came to see me and told me of a blind and deaf girl Ragnhild Kaata she had seen in that far away land who had been taught to speak and understand others when they spoke to her This good and happy news delighted me exceedingly for then I was sure that I should learn also I tried to make sounds like my little playmates but teacher told me that the voice was very delicate and sensitive and that it would injure it to make incorrect sounds and promised to take me to see a kind and wise lady who would teach me rightly That lady was yourself Now I am as happy as the little birds because I can speak and perhaps I shall sing too All of my friends will be so surprised and glad Your loving little pupil HELEN A KELLER When the Perkins Institution closed for the summer Helen and Miss Sullivan went to Tuscumbia This was the first home going after she had learned to talk with her mouth TO reverend PHILLIPS BROOKS Tuscumbia Alabama July fourteen eighteen ninety My dear mister Brooks I am very glad to write to you this beautiful day because you are my kind friend and I love you and because I wish to know many things I have been at home three weeks and Oh how happy I have been with dear mother and father and precious little sister I was very very sad to part with all of my friends in Boston but I was so eager to see my baby sister I could hardly wait for the train to take me home But I tried very hard to be patient for teacher s sake Mildred has grown much taller and stronger than she was when I went to Boston and she is the sweetest and dearest little child in the world My parents were delighted to hear me speak and I was overjoyed to give them such a happy surprise I think it is so pleasant to make everybody happy Why does the dear Father in heaven think it best for us to have very great sorrow sometimes I am always happy and so was Little Lord Fauntleroy but dear Little Jakey s life was full of sadness God did not put the light in Jakey s eyes and he was blind and his father was not gentle and loving Do you think poor Jakey loved his Father in heaven more because his other father was unkind to him How did God tell people that his home was in heaven When people do very wrong and hurt animals and treat children unkindly God is grieved but what will he do to them to teach them to be pitiful and loving I think he will tell them how dearly He loves them and that He wants them to be good and happy and they will not wish to grieve their father who loves them so much and they will want to please him in everything they do so they will love each other and do good to everyone and be kind to animals Please tell me something that you know about God It makes me happy to know much about my loving Father who is good and wise I hope you will write to your little friend when you have time I should like very much to see you to day Is the sun very hot in Boston now this afternoon if it is cool enough I shall take Mildred for a ride on my donkey mister Wade sent Neddy to me and he is the prettiest donkey you can imagine My great dog Lioness goes with us when we ride to protect us Simpson that is my brother brought me some beautiful pond lilies yesterday he is a very brother to me Teacher sends you her kind remembrances and father and mother also send their regards From your loving little friend HELEN A KELLER doctor BROOKS S REPLY London August three eighteen ninety My Dear Helen I was very glad indeed to get your letter It has followed me across the ocean and found me in this magnificent great city which I should like to tell you all about if I could take time for it and make my letter long enough Some time when you come and see me in my study in Boston I shall be glad to talk to you about it all if you care to hear But now I want to tell you how glad I am that you are so happy and enjoying your home so very much I can almost think I see you with your father and mother and little sister with all the brightness of the beautiful country about you and it makes me very glad to know how glad you are I am glad also to know from the questions which you ask me what you are thinking about I do not see how we can help thinking about God when He is so good to us all the time Let me tell you how it seems to me that we come to know about our heavenly Father It is from the power of love which is in our own hearts Love is at the soul of everything Whatever has not the power of loving must have a very dreary life indeed We like to think that the sunshine and the winds and the trees are able to love in some way of their own for it would make us know that they were happy if we knew that they could love And so God who is the greatest and happiest of all beings is the most loving too All the love that is in our hearts comes from him as all the light which is in the flowers comes from the sun And the more we love the more near we are to God and His Love I told you that I was very happy because of your happiness Indeed I am So are your Father and your Mother and your Teacher and all your friends But do you not think that God is happy too because you are happy I am sure He is And He is happier than any of us because He is greater than any of us and also because He not merely SEES your happiness as we do but He also MADE it He gives it to you as the sun gives light and color to the rose And we are always most glad of what we not merely see our friends enjoy but of what we give them to enjoy Are we not But God does not only want us to be HAPPY He wants us to be good He wants that most of all He knows that we can be really happy only when we are good A great deal of the trouble that is in the world is medicine which is very bad to take but which it is good to take because it makes us better We see how good people may be in great trouble when we think of Jesus who was the greatest sufferer that ever lived and yet was the best Being and so I am sure the happiest Being that the world has ever seen I love to tell you about God But He will tell you Himself by the love which He will put into your heart if you ask Him And Jesus who is His Son but is nearer to Him than all of us His other Children came into the world on purpose to tell us all about our Father s Love If you read His words you will see how full His heart is of the love of God We KNOW that He loves us He says And so He loved men Himself and though they were very cruel to Him and at last killed Him He was willing to die for them because He loved them so And Helen He loves men still and He loves us and He tells us that we may love Him And so love is everything And if anybody asks you or if you ask yourself what God is answer God is Love That is the beautiful answer which the Bible gives All this is what you are to think of and to understand more and more as you grow older Think of it now and let it make every blessing brighter because your dear Father sends it to you You will come back to Boston I hope soon after I do I shall be there by the middle of September I shall want you to tell me all about everything and not forget the Donkey I send my kind remembrance to your father and mother and to your teacher I wish I could see your little sister Good Bye dear Helen Do write to me soon again directing your letter to Boston Your affectionate friend PHILLIPS BROOKS doctor HOLMES S REPLY To a letter which has been lost Beverly Farms Mass August one eighteen ninety My Dear Little Friend Helen I received your welcome letter several days ago but I have so much writing to do that I am apt to make my letters wait a good while before they get answered It gratifies me very much to find that you remember me so kindly Your letter is charming and I am greatly pleased with it I rejoice to know that you are well and happy I am very much delighted to hear of your new acquisition that you talk with your mouth as well as with your fingers What a curious thing SPEECH is The tongue is so serviceable a member taking all sorts of shapes just as is wanted the teeth the lips the roof of the mouth all ready to help and so heap up the sound of the voice into the solid bits which we call consonants and make room for the curiously shaped breathings which we call vowels You have studied all this I don t doubt since you have practised vocal speaking I am surprised at the mastery of language which your letter shows It almost makes me think the world would get along as well without seeing and hearing as with them Perhaps people would be better in a great many ways for they could not fight as they do now Just think of an army of blind people with guns and cannon Think of the poor drummers Of what use would they and their drumsticks be You are spared the pain of many sights and sounds which you are only too happy in escaping Then think how much kindness you are sure of as long as you live Everybody will feel an interest in dear little Helen everybody will want to do something for her and if she becomes an ancient gray haired woman she is still sure of being thoughtfully cared for Your parents and friends must take great satisfaction in your progress It does great credit not only to you but to your instructors who have so broken down the walls that seemed to shut you in that now your outlook seems more bright and cheerful than that of many seeing and hearing children Good bye dear little Helen With every kind wish from your friend OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES This letter was written to some gentlemen in Gardiner Maine who named a lumber vessel after her TO MESSRS BRADSTREET Tuscumbia Ala July fourteen eighteen ninety My Dear Kind Friends I thank you very very much for naming your beautiful new ship for me It makes me very happy to know that I have kind and loving friends in the far away State of Maine I did not imagine when I studied about the forests of Maine that a strong and beautiful ship would go sailing all over the world carrying wood from those rich forests to build pleasant homes and schools and churches in distant countries I hope the great ocean will love the new Helen and let her sail over its blue waves peacefully Please tell the brave sailors who have charge of the HELEN KELLER that little Helen who stays at home will often think of them with loving thoughts I hope I shall see you and my beautiful namesake some time With much love from your little friend HELEN A KELLER To the Messrs Bradstreet Helen and Miss Sullivan returned to the Perkins Institution early in November TO missus KATE ADAMS KELLER South Boston Nov ten eighteen ninety My Dearest Mother My heart has been full of thoughts of you and my beautiful home ever since we parted so sadly on Wednesday night How I wish I could see you this lovely morning and tell you all that has happened since I left home And my darling little sister how I wish I could give her a hundred kisses And my dear father how he would like to hear about our journey But I cannot see you and talk to you so I will write and tell you all that I can think of We did not reach Boston until Saturday morning I am sorry to say that our train was delayed in several places which made us late in reaching New York When we got to Jersey City at six o clock Friday evening we were obliged to cross the Harlem River in a ferry boat We found the boat and the transfer carriage with much less difficulty than teacher expected When we arrived at the station they told us that the train did not leave for Boston until eleven o clock but that we could take the sleeper at nine which we did We went to bed and slept until morning When we awoke we were in Boston I was delighted to get there though I was much disappointed because we did not arrive on mister Anagnos birthday We surprised our dear friends however for they did not expect us Saturday but when the bell rung Miss Marrett guessed who was at the door and missus Hopkins jumped up from the breakfast table and ran to the door to meet us she was indeed much astonished to see us After we had had some breakfast we went up to see mister Anagnos I was overjoyed to see my dearest and kindest friend once more He gave me a beautiful watch I have it pinned to my dress I tell everybody the time when they ask me I have only seen mister Anagnos twice I have many questions to ask him about the countries he has been travelling in But I suppose he is very busy now The hills in Virginia were very lovely Jack Frost had dressed them in gold and crimson The view was most charmingly picturesque Pennsylvania is a very beautiful State The grass was as green as though it was springtime and the golden ears of corn gathered together in heaps in the great fields looked very pretty In Harrisburg we saw a donkey like Neddy How I wish I could see my own donkey and my dear Lioness Do they miss their mistress very much Tell Mildred she must be kind to them for my sake Our room is pleasant and comfortable My typewriter was much injured coming The case was broken and the keys are nearly all out Teacher is going to see if it can be fixed There are many new books in the library What a nice time I shall have reading them I have already read Sara Crewe It is a very pretty story and I will tell it to you some time Now sweet mother your little girl must say good bye With much love to father Mildred you and all the dear friends lovingly your little daughter HELEN A KELLER TO JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER South Boston Dec seventeen eighteen ninety Dear Kind Poet This is your birthday that was the first thought which came into my mind when I awoke this morning and it made me glad to think I could write you a letter and tell you how much your little friends love their sweet poet and his birthday This evening they are going to entertain their friends with readings from your poems and music I hope the swift winged messengers of love will be here to carry some of the sweet melody to you in your little study by the Merrimac At first I was very sorry when I found that the sun had hidden his shining face behind dull clouds but afterwards I thought why he did it and then I was happy The sun knows that you like to see the world covered with beautiful white snow and so he kept back all his brightness and let the little crystals form in the sky When they are ready they will softly fall and tenderly cover every object Then the sun will appear in all his radiance and fill the world with light If I were with you to day I would give you eighty three kisses one for each year you have lived Eighty three years seems very long to me Does it seem long to you I wonder how many years there will be in eternity I am afraid I cannot think about so much time I received the letter which you wrote to me last summer and I thank you for it I am staying in Boston now at the Institution for the Blind but I have not commenced my studies yet because my dearest friend mister Anagnos wants me to rest and play a great deal Teacher is well and sends her kind remembrance to you The happy Christmas time is almost here I can hardly wait for the fun to begin I hope your Christmas Day will be a very happy one and that the New Year will be full of brightness and joy for you and every one From your little friend HELEN A KELLER WHITTIER S REPLY My Dear Young Friend I was very glad to have such a pleasant letter on my birthday I had two or three hundred others and thine was one of the most welcome of all I must tell thee about how the day passed at Oak Knoll Of course the sun did not shine but we had great open wood fires in the rooms which were all very sweet with roses and other flowers which were sent to me from distant friends and fruits of all kinds from California and other places Some relatives and dear old friends were with me through the day I do not wonder thee thinks eighty three years a long time but to me it seems but a very little while since I was a boy no older than thee playing on the old farm at Haverhill I thank thee for all thy good wishes and wish thee as many I am glad thee is at the Institution it is an excellent place Give my best regards to Miss Sullivan and with a great deal of love I am Thy old friend JOHN G WHITTIER Tommy Stringer who appears in several of the following letters became blind and deaf when he was four years old His mother was dead and his father was too poor to take care of him For a while he was kept in the general hospital at Allegheny From here he was to be sent to an almshouse for at that time there was no other place for him in Pennsylvania Helen heard of him through mister J G Brown of Pittsburgh who wrote her that he had failed to secure a tutor for Tommy She wanted him brought to Boston and when she was told that money would be needed to get him a teacher she answered We will raise it She began to solicit contributions from her friends and saved her pennies doctor Alexander Graham Bell advised Tommy s friends to send him to Boston and the trustees of the Perkins Institution agreed to admit him to the kindergarten for the blind Meanwhile opportunity came to Helen to make a considerable contribution to Tommy s education The winter before her dog Lioness had been killed and friends set to work to raise money to buy Helen another dog Helen asked that the contributions which people were sending from all over America and England be devoted to Tommy s education Turned to this new use the fund grew fast and Tommy was provided for He was admitted to the kindergarten on the sixth of April Miss Keller wrote lately I shall never forget the pennies sent by many a poor child who could ill spare them for little Tommy or the swift sympathy with which people from far and near whom I had never seen responded to the dumb cry of a little captive soul for aid TO mister GEORGE R KREHL Institution for the Blind South Boston Mass March twenty eighteen ninety one My Dear Friend mister Krehl I have just heard through mister Wade of your kind offer to buy me a gentle dog and I want to thank you for the kind thought It makes me very happy indeed to know that I have such dear friends in other lands It makes me think that all people are good and loving I have read that the English and Americans are cousins but I am sure it would be much truer to say that we are brothers and sisters My friends have told me about your great and magnificent city and I have read a great deal that wise Englishmen have written I have begun to read Enoch Arden and I know several of the great poet s poems by heart I am eager to cross the ocean for I want to see my English friends and their good and wise queen Once the Earl of Meath came to see me and he told me that the queen was much beloved by her people because of her gentleness and wisdom Some day you will be surprised to see a little strange girl coming into your office but when you know it is the little girl who loves dogs and all other animals you will laugh and I hope you will give her a kiss just as mister Wade does He has another dog for me and he thinks she will be as brave and faithful as my beautiful Lioness And now I want to tell you what the dog lovers in America are going to do They are going to send me some money for a poor little deaf and dumb and blind child His name is Tommy and he is five years old His parents are too poor to pay to have the little fellow sent to school so instead of giving me a dog the gentlemen are going to help make Tommy s life as bright and joyous as mine Is it not a beautiful plan Education will bring light and music into Tommy s soul and then he cannot help being happy From your loving little friend HELEN A KELLER TO doctor OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES South Boston Mass April eighteen ninety one Dear doctor Holmes Your beautiful words about spring have been making music in my heart these bright April days I love every word of Spring and Spring Has Come I think you will be glad to hear that these poems have taught me to enjoy and love the beautiful springtime even though I cannot see the fair frail blossoms which proclaim its approach or hear the joyous warbling of the home coming birds But when I read Spring Has Come lo I am not blind any longer for I see with your eyes and hear with your ears Sweet Mother Nature can have no secrets from me when my poet is near I have chosen this paper because I want the spray of violets in the corner to tell you of my grateful love I want you to see baby Tom the little blind and deaf and dumb child who has just come to our pretty garden He is poor and helpless and lonely now but before another April education will have brought light and gladness into Tommy s life If you do come you will want to ask the kind people of Boston to help brighten Tommy s whole life Your loving friend HELEN KELLER TO SIR JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS Perkins Institution for the Blind South Boston Mass April thirty eighteen ninety one My Dear mister Millais Your little American sister is going to write you a letter because she wants you to know how pleased she was to hear you were interested in our poor little Tommy and had sent some money to help educate him It is very beautiful to think that people far away in England feel sorry for a little helpless child in America I used to think when I read in my books about your great city that when I visited it the people would be strangers to me but now I feel differently It seems to me that all people who have loving pitying hearts are not strangers to each other I can hardly wait patiently for the time to come when I shall see my dear English friends and their beautiful island home My favourite poet has written some lines about England which I love very much I think you will like them too so I will try to write them for you Hugged in the clinging billow s clasp From seaweed fringe to mountain heather The British oak with rooted grasp Her slender handful holds together With cliffs of white and bowers of green And ocean narrowing to caress her And hills and threaded streams between Our little mother isle God bless her You will be glad to hear that Tommy has a kind lady to teach him and that he is a pretty active little fellow He loves to climb much better than to spell but that is because he does not know yet what a wonderful thing language is He cannot imagine how very very happy he will be when he can tell us his thoughts and we can tell him how we have loved him so long Tomorrow April will hide her tears and blushes beneath the flowers of lovely May I wonder if the May days in England are as beautiful as they are here Now I must say good bye Please think of me always as your loving little sister HELEN KELLER TO reverend PHILLIPS BROOKS So Boston May one eighteen ninety one My Dear mister Brooks Helen sends you a loving greeting this bright May day My teacher has just told me that you have been made a bishop and that your friends everywhere are rejoicing because one whom they love has been greatly honored I do not understand very well what a bishop s work is but I am sure it must be good and helpful and I am glad that my dear friend is brave and wise and loving enough to do it It is very beautiful to think that you can tell so many people of the heavenly Father s tender love for all His children even when they are not gentle and noble as He wishes them to be I hope the glad news which you will tell them will make their hearts beat fast with joy and love I hope too that Bishop Brooks whole life will be as rich in happiness as the month of May is full of blossoms and singing birds From your loving little friend HELEN KELLER Before a teacher was found for Tommy and while he was still in the care of Helen and Miss Sullivan a reception was held for him at the kindergarten At Helen s request Bishop Brooks made an address Helen wrote letters to the newspapers which brought many generous replies All of these she answered herself and she made public acknowledgment in letters to the newspapers This letter is to the editor of the Boston Herald enclosing a complete list of the subscribers The contributions amounted to more than sixteen hundred dollars TO mister JOHN H HOLMES South Boston May thirteen eighteen ninety one Editor of the Boston Herald My Dear mister Holmes Will you kindly print in the Herald the enclosed list I think the readers of your paper will be glad to know that so much has been done for dear little Tommy and that they will all wish to share in the pleasure of helping him He is very happy indeed at the kindergarten and is learning something every day He has found out that doors have locks and that little sticks and bits of paper can be got into the key hole quite easily but he does not seem very eager to get them out after they are in He loves to climb the bed posts and unscrew the steam valves much better than to spell but that is because he does not understand that words would help him to make new and interesting discoveries I hope that good people will continue to work for Tommy until his fund is completed and education has brought light and music into his little life From your little friend HELEN KELLER TO doctor OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES South Boston May twenty seven eighteen ninety one Dear Gentle Poet I fear that you will think Helen a very troublesome little girl if she writes to you too often but how is she to help sending you loving and grateful messages when you do so much to make her glad I cannot begin to tell you how delighted I was when mister Anagnos told me that you had sent him some money to help educate Baby Tom Then I knew that you had not forgotten the dear little child for the gift brought with it the thought of tender sympathy I am very sorry to say that Tommy has not learned any words yet He is the same restless little creature he was when you saw him But it is pleasant to think that he is happy and playful in his bright new home and by and by that strange wonderful thing teacher calls MIND will begin to spread its beautiful wings and fly away in search of knowledge land Words are the mind s wings are they not I have been to Andover since I saw you and I was greatly interested in all that my friends told me about Phillips Academy because I knew you had been there and I felt it was a place dear to you I tried to imagine my gentle poet when he was a school boy and I wondered if it was in Andover he learned the songs of the birds and the secrets of the shy little woodland children I am sure his heart was always full of music and in God s beautiful world he must have heard love s sweet replying When I came home teacher read to me The School boy for it is not in our print Did you know that the blind children are going to have their commencement exercises in Tremont Temple next Tuesday afternoon I enclose a ticket hoping that you will come We shall all be proud and happy to welcome our poet friend I shall recite about the beautiful cities of sunny Italy I hope our kind friend doctor Ellis will come too and take Tom in his arms With much love and a kiss from your little friend HELEN A KELLER TO reverend PHILLIPS BROOKS South Boston June eight eighteen ninety one My dear mister Brooks I send you my picture as I promised and I hope when you look at it this summer your thoughts will fly southward to your happy little friend I used to wish that I could see pictures with my hands as I do statues but now I do not often think about it because my dear Father has filled my mind with beautiful pictures even of things I cannot see If the light were not in your eyes dear mister Brooks you would understand better how happy your little Helen was when her teacher explained to her that the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen nor even touched but just felt in the heart Every day I find out something which makes me glad Yesterday I thought for the first time what a beautiful thing motion was and it seemed to me that everything was trying to get near to God does it seem that way to you It is Sunday morning and while I sit here in the library writing this letter you are teaching hundreds of people some of the grand and beautiful things about their heavenly Father Are you not very very happy and when you are a Bishop you will preach to more people and more and more will be made glad Teacher sends her kind remembrances and I send you with my picture my dear love From your little friend HELEN KELLER When the Perkins Institution closed in June Helen and her teacher went south to Tuscumbia where they remained until December There is a hiatus of several months in the letters caused by the depressing effect on Helen and Miss Sullivan of the Frost King episode At the time this trouble seemed very grave and brought them much unhappiness An analysis of the case has been made elsewhere and Miss Keller has written her account of it TO mister ALBERT H MUNSELL Brewster Mar ten eighteen ninety two My dear mister Munsell Surely I need not tell you that your letter was very welcome I enjoyed every word of it and wished that it was longer I laughed when you spoke of old Neptune s wild moods He has in truth behaved very strangely ever since we came to Brewster It is evident that something has displeased his Majesty but I cannot imagine what it can be His expression has been so turbulent that I have feared to give him your kind message Who knows Perhaps the Old Sea God as he lay asleep upon the shore heard the soft music of growing things the stir of life in the earth s bosom and his stormy heart was angry because he knew that his and Winter s reign was almost at an end So together the unhappy monarch s fought most despairingly thinking that gentle Spring would turn and fly at the very sight of the havoc caused by their forces But lo the lovely maiden only smiles more sweetly and breathes upon the icy battlements of her enemies and in a moment they vanish and the glad Earth gives her a royal welcome But I must put away these idle fancies until we meet again Please give your dear mother my love Teacher wishes me to say that she liked the photograph very much and she will see about having some when we return Now dear friend Please accept these few words because of the love that is linked with them Lovingly yours HELEN KELLER This letter was reproduced in facsimile in saint Nicholas June eighteen ninety two It is undated but must have been written two or three months before it was published To saint Nicholas Dear saint Nicholas It gives me very great pleasure to send you my autograph because I want the boys and girls who read saint Nicholas to know how blind children write I suppose some of them wonder how we keep the lines so straight so I will try to tell them how it is done We have a grooved board which we put between the pages when we wish to write The parallel grooves correspond to lines and when we have pressed the paper into them by means of the blunt end of the pencil it is very easy to keep the words even The small letters are all made in the grooves while the long ones extend above and below them We guide the pencil with the right hand and feel carefully with the forefinger of the left hand to see that we shape and space the letters correctly It is very difficult at first to form them plainly but if we keep on trying it gradually becomes easier and after a great deal of practice we can write legible letters to our friends Then we are very very happy Sometime they may visit a school for the blind If they do I am sure they will wish to see the pupils write Very sincerely your little friend HELEN KELLER In May eighteen ninety two Helen gave a tea in aid of the kindergarten for the blind It was quite her own idea and was given in the house of missus Mahlon D Spaulding sister of mister John P Spaulding one of Helen s kindest and most liberal friends The tea brought more than two thousand dollars for the blind children TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY South Boston May nine eighteen ninety two My dear Miss Carrie I was much pleased to receive your kind letter Need I tell you that I was more than delighted to hear that you are really interested in the tea Of course we must not give it up Very soon I am going far away to my own dear home in the sunny south and it would always make me happy to think that the last thing which my dear friends in Boston did for my pleasure was to help make the lives of many little sightless children good and happy I know that kind people cannot help feeling a tender sympathy for the little ones who cannot see the beautiful light or any of the wonderful things which give them pleasure and it seems to me that all loving sympathy must express itself in acts of kindness and when the friends of little helpless blind children understand that we are working for their happiness they will come and make our tea a success and I am sure I shall be the happiest little girl in all the world Please let Bishop Brooks know our plans so that he may arrange to be with us I am glad Miss Eleanor is interested Please give her my love I will see you to morrow and then we can make the rest of our plans Please give your dear aunt teacher s and my love and tell her that we enjoyed our little visit very much indeed Lovingly yours HELEN KELLER TO mister JOHN P SPAULDING South Boston May eleventh eighteen ninety two My dear mister Spaulding I am afraid you will think your little friend Helen very troublesome when you read this letter but I am sure you will not blame me when I tell you that I am very anxious about something You remember teacher and I told you Sunday that I wanted to have a little tea in aid of the kindergarten We thought everything was arranged but we found Monday that missus Elliott would not be willing to let us invite more than fifty people because missus Howe s house is quite small I am sure that a great many people would like to come to the tea and help me do something to brighten the lives of little blind children but some of my friends say that I shall have to give up the idea of having a tea unless we can find another house Teacher said yesterday that perhaps missus Spaulding would be willing to let us have her beautiful house and I thought I would ask you about it Do you think missus Spaulding would help me if I wrote to her I shall be so disappointed if my little plans fail because I have wanted for a long time to do something for the poor little ones who are waiting to enter the kindergarten Please let me know what you think about the house and try to forgive me for troubling you so much Lovingly your little friend HELEN KELLER TO mister EDWARD H CLEMENT South Boston May eighteenth eighteen ninety two My dear mister Clement I am going to write to you this beautiful morning because my heart is brimful of happiness and I want you and all my dear friends in the Transcript office to rejoice with me The preparations for my tea are nearly completed and I am looking forward joyfully to the event I know I shall not fail Kind people will not disappoint me when they know that I plead for helpless little children who live in darkness and ignorance They will come to my tea and buy light the beautiful light of knowledge and love for many little ones who are blind and friendless I remember perfectly when my dear teacher came to me Then I was like the little blind children who are waiting to enter the kindergarten There was no light in my soul This wonderful world with all its sunlight and beauty was hidden from me and I had never dreamed of its loveliness But teacher came to me and taught my little fingers to use the beautiful key that has unlocked the door of my dark prison and set my spirit free It is my earnest wish to share my happiness with others and I ask the kind people of Boston to help me make the lives of little blind children brighter and happier Lovingly your little friend HELEN KELLER At the end of June Miss Sullivan and Helen went home to Tuscumbia TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY Tuscumbia Alabama July ninth eighteen ninety two My dear Carrie You are to look upon it as a most positive proof of my love that I write to you to day For a whole week it has been cold and dark and dreary in Tuscumbia and I must confess the continuous rain and dismalness of the weather fills me with gloomy thoughts and makes the writing of letters or any pleasant employment seem quite impossible Nevertheless I must tell you that we are alive that we reached home safely and that we speak of you daily and enjoy your interesting letters very much I had a beautiful visit at Hulton Everything was fresh and spring like and we stayed out of doors all day We even ate our breakfast out on the piazza Sometimes we sat in the hammock and teacher read to me I rode horseback nearly every evening and once I rode five miles at a fast gallop O it was great fun Do you like to ride I have a very pretty little cart now and if it ever stops raining teacher and I are going to drive every evening And I have another beautiful Mastiff the largest one I ever saw and he will go along to protect us His name is Eumer A queer name is it not I think it is Saxon We expect to go to the mountains next week My little brother Phillips is not well and we think the clear mountain air will benefit him Mildred is a sweet little sister and I am sure you would love her I thank you very much for your photograph I like to have my friends pictures even though I cannot see them I was greatly amused at the idea of your writing the square hand I do not write on a Braille tablet as you suppose but on a grooved board like the piece which I enclose You could not read Braille for it is written in dots not at all like ordinary letters Please give my love to Miss Derby and tell her that I hope she gave my sweetest love to Baby Ruth What was the book you sent me for my birthday I received several and I do not know which was from you I had one gift which especially pleased me It was a lovely cape crocheted for me by an old gentleman seventy five years of age And every stitch he writes represents a kind wish for my health and happiness Tell your little cousins I think they had better get upon the fence with me until after the election for there are so many parties and candidates that I doubt if such youthful politicians would make a wise selection Please give my love to Rosy when you write and believe me Your loving friend HELEN KELLER P S How do you like this type written letter H K TO missus GROVER CLEVELAND My dear missus Cleveland I am going to write you a little letter this beautiful morning because I love you and dear little Ruth very much indeed and also because I wish to thank you for the loving message which you sent me through Miss Derby I am glad very glad that such a kind beautiful lady loves me I have loved you for a long time but I did not think you had ever heard of me until your sweet message came Please kiss your dear little baby for me and tell her I have a little brother nearly sixteen months old His name is Phillips Brooks I named him myself after my dear friend Phillips Brooks I send you with this letter a pretty book which my teacher thinks will interest you and my picture Please accept them with the love and good wishes of your friend HELEN KELLER Tuscumbia Alabama November fourth eighteen ninety two Hitherto the letters have been given in full from this point on passages are omitted and the omissions are indicated TO mister JOHN HITZ Tuscumbia Alabama Dec nineteen eighteen ninety two My Dear mister Hitz I hardly know how to begin a letter to you it has been such a long time since your kind letter reached me and there is so much that I would like to write if I could You must have wondered why your letter has not had an answer and perhaps you have thought Teacher and me very naughty indeed If so you will be very sorry when I tell you something Teacher s eyes have been hurting her so that she could not write to any one and I have been trying to fulfil a promise which I made last summer Before I left Boston I was asked to write a sketch of my life for the Youth s Companion I had intended to write the sketch during my vacation but I was not well and I did not feel able to write even to my friends But when the bright pleasant autumn days came and I felt strong again I began to think about the sketch It was some time before I could plan it to suit me You see it is not very pleasant to write all about one s self At last however I got something bit by bit that Teacher thought would do and I set about putting the scraps together which was not an easy task for although I worked some on it every day I did not finish it until a week ago Saturday I sent the sketch to the Companion as soon as it was finished but I do not know that they will accept it Since then I have not been well and I have been obliged to keep very quiet and rest but to day I am better and to morrow I shall be well again I hope The reports which you have read in the paper about me are not true at all We received the Silent Worker which you sent and I wrote right away to the editor to tell him that it was a mistake Sometimes I am not well but I am not a wreck and there is nothing distressing about my condition I enjoyed your dear letter so much I am always delighted when anyone writes me a beautiful thought which I can treasure in my memory forever It is because my books are full of the riches of which mister Ruskin speaks that I love them so dearly I did not realize until I began to write the sketch for the Companion what precious companions books have been to me and how blessed even my life has been and now I am happier than ever because I do realize the happiness that has come to me I hope you will write to me as often as you can Teacher and I are always delighted to hear from you I want to write to mister Bell and send him my picture I suppose he has been too busy to write to his little friend I often think of the pleasant time we had all together in Boston last spring Now I am going to tell you a secret I think we Teacher and my father and little sister and myself will visit Washington next March Then I shall see you and dear mister Bell and Elsie and Daisy again Would not it be lovely if missus Pratt could meet us there I think I will write to her and tell her the secret too Lovingly your little friend HELEN KELLER P S Teacher says you want to know what kind of a pet I would like to have I love all living things I suppose everyone does but of course I cannot have a menagerie I have a beautiful pony and a large dog And I would like a little dog to hold in my lap or a big pussy there are no fine cats in Tuscumbia or a parrot I would like to feel a parrot talk it would be so much fun but I would be pleased with and love any little creature you send me H K TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY Tuscumbia Alabama February eighteen eighteen ninety three You have often been in my thoughts during these sad days while my heart has been grieving over the loss of my beloved friend Phillips Brooks died January twenty three eighteen ninety three and I have wished many times that I was in Boston with those who knew and loved him as I did he was so much of a friend to me so tender and loving always I do try not to mourn his death too sadly I do try to think that he is still near very near but sometimes the thought that he is not here that I shall not see him when I go to Boston that he is gone rushes over my soul like a great wave of sorrow But at other times when I am happier I do feel his beautiful presence and his loving hand leading me in pleasant ways Do you remember the happy hour we spent with him last June when he held my hand as he always did and talked to us about his friend Tennyson and our own dear poet doctor Holmes and I tried to teach him the manual alphabet and he laughed so gaily over his mistakes and afterward I told him about my tea and he promised to come I can hear him now saying in his cheerful decided way in reply to my wish that my tea might be a success Of course it will Helen Put your whole heart in the good work my child and it cannot fail I am glad the people are going to raise a monument to his memory In March Helen and Miss Sullivan went North and spent the next few months traveling and visiting friends In reading this letter about Niagara one should remember that Miss Keller knows distance and shape and that the size of Niagara is within her experience after she has explored it crossed the bridge and gone down in the elevator Especially important are such details as her feeling the rush of the water by putting her hand on the window doctor Bell gave her a down pillow which she held against her to increase the vibrations TO missus KATE ADAMS KELLER South Boston April thirteen eighteen ninety three Teacher missus Pratt and I very unexpectedly decided to take a journey with dear doctor Bell mister Westervelt a gentleman whom father met in Washington has a school for the deaf in Rochester We went there first mister Westervelt gave us a reception one afternoon A great many people came Some of them asked odd questions A lady seemed surprised that I loved flowers when I could not see their beautiful colors and when I assured her I did love them she said no doubt you feel the colors with your fingers But of course it is not alone for their bright colors that we love the flowers A gentleman asked me what BEAUTY meant to my mind I must confess I was puzzled at first But after a minute I answered that beauty was a form of goodness and he went away When the reception was over we went back to the hotel and teacher slept quite unconscious of the surprise which was in store for her mister Bell and I planned it together and mister Bell made all the arrangements before we told teacher anything about it This was the surprise I was to have the pleasure of taking my dear teacher to see Niagara Falls The hotel was so near the river that I could feel it rushing past by putting my hand on the window The next morning the sun rose bright and warm and we got up quickly for our hearts were full of pleasant expectation You can never imagine how I felt when I stood in the presence of Niagara until you have the same mysterious sensations yourself I could hardly realize that it was water that I felt rushing and plunging with impetuous fury at my feet It seemed as if it were some living thing rushing on to some terrible fate I wish I could describe the cataract as it is its beauty and awful grandeur and the fearful and irresistible plunge of its waters over the brow of the precipice One feels helpless and overwhelmed in the presence of such a vast force I had the same feeling once before when I first stood by the great ocean and felt its waves beating against the shore I suppose you feel so too when you gaze up to the stars in the stillness of the night do you not We went down a hundred and twenty feet in an elevator that we might see the violent eddies and whirlpools in the deep gorge below the Falls Within two miles of the Falls is a wonderful suspension bridge It is thrown across the gorge at a height of two hundred and fifty eight feet above the water and is supported on each bank by towers of solid rock which are eight hundred feet apart When we crossed over to the Canadian side I cried God save the Queen Teacher said I was a little traitor But I do not think so I was only doing as the Canadians do while I was in their country and besides I honor England s good queen You will be pleased dear Mother to hear that a kind lady whose name is Miss Hooker is endeavoring to improve my speech Oh I do so hope and pray that I shall speak well some day mister Munsell spent last Sunday evening with us How you would have enjoyed hearing him tell about Venice His beautiful word pictures made us feel as if we were sitting in the shadow of San Marco dreaming or sailing upon the moonlit canal I hope when I visit Venice as I surely shall some day that mister Munsell will go with me That is my castle in the air You see none of my friends describe things to me so vividly and so beautifully as he does Her visit to the World s Fair she described in a letter to mister John P Spaulding which was published in saint Nicholas and is much like the following letter In a prefatory note which Miss Sullivan wrote for saint Nicholas she says that people frequently said to her Helen sees more with her fingers than we do with our eyes The President of the Exposition gave her this letter TO THE CHIEFS OF THE DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICERS IN CHARGE OF BUILDINGS AND EXHIBITS GENTLEMEN The bearer Miss Helen Keller accompanied by Miss Sullivan is desirous of making a complete inspection of the Exposition in all Departments She is blind and deaf but is able to converse and is introduced to me as one having a wonderful ability to understand the objects she visits and as being possessed of a high order of intelligence and of culture beyond her years Please favour her with every facility to examine the exhibits in the several Departments and extend to her such other courtesies as may be possible Thanking you in advance for the same I am with respect Very truly yours signed H N HIGINBOTHAM President TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY Hulton Penn August seventeen eighteen ninety three Every one at the Fair was very kind to me Nearly all of the exhibitors seemed perfectly willing to let me touch the most delicate things and they were very nice about explaining everything to me A French gentleman whose name I cannot remember showed me the great French bronzes I believe they gave me more pleasure than anything else at the Fair they were so lifelike and wonderful to my touch doctor Bell went with us himself to the electrical building and showed us some of the historical telephones I saw the one through which Emperor Dom Pedro listened to the words To be or not to be at the Centennial doctor Gillett of Illinois took us to the Liberal Arts and Woman s buildings In the former I visited Tiffany s exhibit and held the beautiful Tiffany diamond which is valued at one hundred thousand dollars and touched many other rare and costly things I sat in King Ludwig s armchair and felt like a queen when doctor Gillett remarked that I had many loyal subjects At the Woman s building we met the Princess Maria Schaovskoy of Russia and a beautiful Syrian lady I liked them both very much I went to the Japanese department with Prof Morse who is a well known lecturer I never realized what a wonderful people the Japanese are until I saw their most interesting exhibit Japan must indeed be a paradise for children to judge from the great number of playthings which are manufactured there The queer looking Japanese musical instruments and their beautiful works of art were interesting The Japanese books are very odd There are forty seven letters in their alphabets Prof Morse knows a great deal about Japan and is very kind and wise He invited me to visit his museum in Salem the next time I go to Boston But I think I enjoyed the sails on the tranquil lagoon and the lovely scenes as my friends described them to me more than anything else at the Fair Once while we were out on the water the sun went down over the rim of the earth and threw a soft rosy light over the White City making it look more than ever like Dreamland Of course we visited the Midway Plaisance It was a bewildering and fascinating place I went into the streets of Cairo and rode on the camel That was fine fun We also rode in the Ferris wheel and on the ice railway and had a sail in the Whale back In the spring of eighteen ninety three a club was started in Tuscumbia of which missus Keller was president to establish a public library Miss Keller says I wrote to my friends about the work and enlisted their sympathy Several hundred books including many fine ones were sent to me in a short time as well as money and encouragement This generous assistance encouraged the ladies and they have gone on collecting and buying books ever since until now they have a very respectable public library in the town TO missus CHARLES E INCHES Hulton Penn Oct twenty one eighteen ninety three We spent September at home in Tuscumbia and were all very happy together Our quiet mountain home was especially attractive and restful after the excitement and fatigue of our visit to the World s Fair We enjoyed the beauty and solitude of the hills more than ever And now we are in Hulton Penn again where I am going to study this winter with a tutor assisted by my dear teacher I study Arithmetic Latin and literature I enjoy my lessons very much It is so pleasant to learn about new things Every day I find how little I know but I do not feel discouraged since God has given me an eternity in which to learn more In literature I am studying Longfellow s poetry I know a great deal of it by heart for I loved it long before I knew a metaphor from a synecdoche I used to say I did not like arithmetic very well but now I have changed my mind I see what a good and useful study it is though I must confess my mind wanders from it sometimes for nice and useful as arithmetic is it is not as interesting as a beautiful poem or a lovely story But bless me how time does fly I have only a few moments left in which to answer your questions about the Helen Keller Public Library one I think there are about three thousand people in Tuscumbia Ala and perhaps half of them are colored people two At present there is no library of any sort in the town That is why I thought about starting one My mother and several of my lady friends said they would help me and they formed a club the object of which is to work for the establishment of a free public library in Tuscumbia They have now about one hundred books and about fifty five dollars in money and a kind gentleman has given us land on which to erect a library building But in the meantime the club has rented a little room in a central part of the town and the books which we already have are free to all three Only a few of my kind friends in Boston know anything about the library I did not like to trouble them while I was trying to get money for poor little Tommy for of course it was more important that he should be educated than that my people should have books to read four I do not know what books we have but I think it is a miscellaneous I think that is the word collection P S My teacher thinks it would be more businesslike to say that a list of the contributors toward the building fund will be kept and published in my father s paper the North Alabamian H K TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY Hulton Penn December twenty eight eighteen ninety three Please thank dear Miss Derby for me for the pretty shield which she sent me It is a very interesting souvenir of Columbus and of the Fair White City but I cannot imagine what discoveries I have made I mean new discoveries We are all discoverers in one sense being born quite ignorant of all things but I hardly think that is what she meant Tell her she must explain why I am a discoverer TO doctor EDWARD EVERETT HALE Hulton Pennsylvania January fourteen eighteen ninety four My dear Cousin I had thought to write to you long before this in answer to your kind letter which I was so glad to receive and to thank you for the beautiful little book which you sent me but I have been very busy since the beginning of the New Year The publication of my little story in the Youth s Companion has brought me a large number of letters last week I received sixty one and besides replying to some of these letters I have many lessons to learn among them Arithmetic and Latin and you know Caesar is Caesar still imperious and tyrannical and if a little girl would understand so great a man and the wars and conquests of which he tells in his beautiful Latin language she must study much and think much and study and thought require time I shall prize the little book always not only for its own value but because of its associations with you It is a delight to think of you as the giver of one of your books into which I am sure you have wrought your own thoughts and feelings and I thank you very much for remembering me in such a very beautiful way In February Helen and Miss Sullivan returned to Tuscumbia They spent the rest of the spring reading and studying In the summer they attended the meeting at Chautauqua of the American Association for the Promotion of the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf where Miss Sullivan read a paper on Helen Keller s education In the fall Helen and Miss Sullivan entered the Wright Humason School in New York which makes a special of lip reading and voice culture The singing lessons were to strengthen her voice She had taken a few piano lessons at the Perkins Institution The experiment was interesting but of course came to little TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY The Wright Humason School forty two West seventy sixth saint New York Oct twenty three eighteen ninety four The school is very pleasant and bless you it is quite fashionable I study Arithmetic English Literature and United States History as I did last winter I also keep a diary I enjoy my singing lessons with doctor Humason more than I can say I expect to take piano lessons sometime Last Saturday our kind teachers planned a delightful trip to Bedloe s Island to see Bartholdi s great statue of Liberty enlightening the world The ancient cannon which look seaward wear a very menacing expression but I doubt if there is any unkindness in their rusty old hearts Liberty is a gigantic figure of a woman in Greek draperies holding in her right hand a torch A spiral stairway leads from the base of this pedestal to the torch We climbed up to the head which will hold forty persons and viewed the scene on which Liberty gazes day and night and O how wonderful it was We did not wonder that the great French artist thought the place worthy to be the home of his grand ideal The glorious bay lay calm and beautiful in the October sunshine and the ships came and went like idle dreams those seaward going slowly disappeared like clouds that change from gold to gray those homeward coming sped more quickly like birds that seek their mother s nest TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY The Wright Humason School New York March fifteen eighteen ninety five I think I have improved a little in lip reading though I still find it very difficult to read rapid speech but I am sure I shall succeed some day if I only persevere doctor Humason is still trying to improve my speech Oh Carrie how I should like to speak like other people I should be willing to work night and day if it could only be accomplished Think what a joy it would be to all of my friends to hear me speak naturally I wonder why it is so difficult and perplexing for a deaf child to learn to speak when it is so easy for other people but I am sure I shall speak perfectly some time if I am only patient Although I have been so busy I have found time to read a good deal I have lately read Wilhelm Tell by Schiller and The Lost Vestal Now I am reading Nathan the Wise by Lessing and King Arthur by Miss Mulock You know our kind teachers take us to see everything which they think will interest us and we learn a great deal in that delightful way On George Washington s birthday we all went to the Dog Show and although there was a great crowd in the Madison Square Garden and despite the bewilderment caused by the variety of sounds made by the dog orchestra which was very confusing to those who could hear them we enjoyed the afternoon very much Among the dogs which received the most attention were the bulldogs They permitted themselves startling liberties when any one caressed them crowding themselves almost into one s arms and helping themselves without ceremony to kisses apparently unconscious of the impropriety of their conduct Dear me what unbeautiful little beasts they are But they are so good natured and friendly one cannot help liking them doctor Humason Teacher and I left the others at the Dog Show and went to a reception given by the Metropolitan Club It is sometimes called the Millionaires Club The building is magnificent being built of white marble the rooms are large and splendidly furnished but I must confess so much splendor is rather oppressive to me and I didn t envy the millionaires in the least all the happiness their gorgeous surroundings are supposed to bring them TO missus KATE ADAMS KELLER New York March thirty one eighteen ninety five Teacher and I spent the afternoon at mister Hutton s and had a most delightful time We met mister Clemens and mister Howells there I had known about them for a long time but I had never thought that I should see them and talk to them and I can scarcely realize now that this great pleasure has been mine But much as I wonder that I only a little girl of fourteen should come in contact with so many distinguished people I do realize that I am a very happy child and very grateful for the many beautiful privileges I have enjoyed The two distinguished authors were very gentle and kind and I could not tell which of them I loved best mister Clemens told us many entertaining stories and made us laugh till we cried I only wish you could have seen and heard him He told us that he would go to Europe in a few days to bring his wife and his daughter Jeanne back to America because Jeanne who is studying in Paris has learned so much in three years and a half that if he did not bring her home she would soon know more than he did I think Mark Twain is a very appropriate nom de plume for mister Clemens because it has a funny and quaint sound and goes well with his amusing writings and its nautical significance suggests the deep and beautiful things that he has written I think he is very handsome indeed Teacher said she thought he looked something like Paradeuski If that is the way to spell the name mister Howells told me a little about Venice which is one of his favorite cities and spoke very tenderly of his dear little girl Winnifred who is now with God He has another daughter named Mildred who knows Carrie I might have seen missus Wiggin the sweet author of Birds Christmas Carol but she had a dangerous cough and could not come I was much disappointed not to see her but I hope I shall have that pleasure some other time mister Hutton gave me a lovely little glass shaped like a thistle which belonged to his dear mother as a souvenir of my delightful visit We also met mister Rogers who kindly left his carriage to bring us home When the Wright Humason School closed for the summer Miss Sullivan and Helen went South TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Tuscumbia Alabama July twenty nine eighteen ninety five I am spending my vacation very quietly and pleasantly at my beautiful sunny home with my loving parents my darling little sister and my small brother Phillips My precious teacher is with me too and so of course I am happy I read a little walk a little write a little and play with the children a great deal and the days slip by delightfully My friends are so pleased with the improvement which I made in speech and lip reading last year that it has been decided best for me to continue my studies in New York another year I am delighted at the prospect of spending another year in your great city I used to think that I should never feel at home in New York but since I have made the acquaintance of so many people and can look back to such a bright and successful winter there I find myself looking forward to next year and anticipating still brighter and better times in the Metropolis Please give my kindest love to mister Hutton and missus Riggs and mister Warner too although I have never had the pleasure of knowing him personally As I listen Venicewards I hear mister Hutton s pen dancing over the pages of his new book It is a pleasant sound because it is full of promise How much I shall enjoy reading it Please pardon me my dear missus Hutton for sending you a typewritten letter across the ocean I have tried several times to write with a pencil on my little writing machine since I came home but I have found it very difficult to do so on account of the heat The moisture of my hand soils and blurs the paper so dreadfully that I am compelled to use my typewriter altogether And it is not my Remington either but a naughty little thing that gets out of order on the slightest provocation and cannot be induced to make a period TO missus WILLIAM THAW New York October sixteen eighteen ninety five Here we are once more in the great metropolis We left Hulton Friday night and arrived here Saturday morning Our friends were greatly surprised to see us as they had not expected us before the last of this month I rested Saturday afternoon for I was very tired and Sunday I visited with my schoolmates and now that I feel quite rested I am going to write to you for I know you will want to hear that we reached New York safely We had to change cars at Philadelphia but we did not mind it much After we had had our breakfast Teacher asked one of the train men in the station if the New York train was made up He said no it would not be called for about fifteen minutes so we sat down to wait but in a moment the man came back and asked Teacher if we would like to go to the train at once She said we would and he took us way out on the track and put us on board our train Thus we avoided the rush and had a nice quiet visit before the train started Was that not very kind So it always is Some one is ever ready to scatter little acts of kindness along our pathway making it smooth and pleasant We had a quiet but very pleasant time in Hulton mister Wade is just as dear and good as ever He has lately had several books printed in England for me Old Mortality The Castle of Otranto and King of No land TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY New York December twenty nine eighteen ninety five Teacher and I have been very gay of late We have seen our kind friends missus Dodge mister and missus Hutton missus Riggs and her husband and met many distinguished people among whom were Miss Ellen Terry Sir Henry Irving and mister Stockton Weren t we very fortunate Miss Terry was lovely She kissed Teacher and said I do not know whether I am glad to see you or not for I feel so ashamed of myself when I think of how much you have done for the little girl We also met mister and missus Terry Miss Terry s brother and his wife I thought her beauty angellic and oh what a clear beautiful voice she had We saw Miss Terry again with Sir Henry in King Charles the First a week ago last Friday and after the play they kindly let me feel of them and get an idea of how they looked How noble and kingly the King was especially in his misfortunes And how pretty and faithful the poor Queen was The play seemed so real we almost forgot where we were and believed we were watching the genuine scenes as they were acted so long ago The last act affected us most deeply and we all wept wondering how the executioner could have the heart to tear the King from his loving wife s arms I have just finished reading Ivanhoe It was very exciting but I must say I did not enjoy it very much Sweet Rebecca with her strong brave spirit and her pure generous nature was the only character which thoroughly won my admiration Now I am reading Stories from Scottish History and they are very thrilling and absorbing The next two letters were written just after the death of mister John P Spaulding TO missus GEORGE H BRADFORD New York February four eighteen ninety six What can I say which will make you understand how much Teacher and I appreciate your thoughtful kindness in sending us those little souvenirs of the dear room where we first met the best and kindest of friends Indeed you can never know all the comfort you have given us We have put the dear picture on the mantel piece in our room where we can see it every day and I often go and touch it and somehow I cannot help feeling that our beloved friend is very near to me It was very hard to take up our school work again as if nothing had happened but I am sure it is well that we have duties which must be done and which take our minds away for a time at least from our sorrow TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY New York March second eighteen ninety six We miss dear King John sadly It was so hard to lose him he was the best and kindest of friends and I do not know what we shall do without him We went to a poultry show and the man there kindly permitted us to feel of the birds They were so tame they stood perfectly still when I handled them I saw great big turkeys geese guineas ducks and many others Almost two weeks ago we called at mister Hutton s and had a delightful time We always do We met mister Warner the writer mister Mabie the editor of the Outlook and other pleasant people I am sure you would like to know mister and missus Hutton they are so kind and interesting I can never tell you how much pleasure they have given us mister Warner and mister Burroughs the great lover of nature came to see us a few days after and we had a delightful talk with them They were both very very dear mister Burroughs told me about his home near the Hudson and what a happy place it must be I hope we shall visit it some day Teacher has read me his lively stories about his boyhood and I enjoyed them greatly Have you read the beautiful poem Waiting I know it and it makes me feel so happy it has such sweet thoughts mister Warner showed me a scarf pin with a beetle on it which was made in Egypt fifteen hundred years before Christ and told me that the beetle meant immortality to the Egyptians because it wrapped itself up and went to sleep and came out again in a new form thus renewing itself TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY New York April twenty five eighteen ninety six My studies are the same as they were when I saw you except that I have taken up French with a French teacher who comes three times a week I read her lips almost exclusively she does not know the manual alphabet and we get on quite well I have read Le Medecin Malgre Lui a very good French comedy by Moliere with pleasure and they say I speak French pretty well now and German also Anyway French and German people understand what I am trying to say and that is very encouraging In voice training I have still the same old difficulties to contend against and the fulfilment of my wish to speak well seems O so far away Sometimes I feel sure that I catch a faint glimpse of the goal I am striving for but in another minute a bend in the road hides it from my view and I am again left wandering in the dark But I try hard not to be discouraged Surely we shall all find at last the ideals we are seeking TO mister JOHN HITZ Brewster Mass July fifteen eighteen ninety six As to the book I am sure I shall enjoy it very much when I am admitted by the magic of Teacher s dear fingers into the companionship of the two sisters who went to the Immortal Fountain As I sit by the window writing to you it is so lovely to have the soft cool breezes fan my cheek and to feel that the hard work of last year is over Teacher seems to feel benefitted by the change too for she is already beginning to look like her dear old self We only need you dear mister Hitz to complete our happiness Teacher and missus Hopkins both say you must come as soon as you can We will try to make you comfortable Teacher and I spent nine days at Philadelphia Have you ever been at doctor Crouter s Institution mister Howes has probably given you a full account of our doings We were busy all the time we attended the meetings and talked with hundreds of people among whom were dear doctor Bell mister Banerji of Calcutta Monsieur Magnat of Paris with whom I conversed in French exclusively and many other distinguished persons We had looked forward to seeing you there and so we were greatly disappointed that you did not come We think of you so so often and our hearts go out to you in tenderest sympathy and you know better than this poor letter can tell you how happy we always are to have you with us I made a speech on July eighth telling the members of the Association what an unspeakable blessing speech has been to me and urging them to give every little deaf child an opportunity to learn to speak Every one said I spoke very well and intelligibly After my little speech we attended a reception at which over six hundred people were present I must confess I do not like such large receptions the people crowd so and we have to do so much talking and yet it is at receptions like the one in Philadelphia that we often meet friends whom we learn to love afterwards We left the city last Thursday night and arrived in Brewster Friday afternoon We missed the Cape Cod train Friday morning and so we came down to Provincetown in the steamer Longfellow I am glad we did so for it was lovely and cool on the water and Boston Harbor is always interesting We spent about three weeks in Boston after leaving New York and I need not tell you we had a most delightful time We visited our good friends mister and missus Chamberlin at Wrentham out in the country where they have a lovely home Their house stands near a charming lake where we went boating and canoeing which was great fun We also went in bathing several times mister and missus Chamberlin celebrated the seventeenth of June by giving a picnic to their literary friends There were about forty persons present all of whom were writers and publishers Our friend mister Alden the editor of Harper s was there and of course we enjoyed his society very much TO CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER Brewster Mass September three eighteen ninety six I have been meaning to write to you all summer there were many things I wanted to tell you and I thought perhaps you would like to hear about our vacation by the seaside and our plans for next year but the happy idle days slipped away so quickly and there were so many pleasant things to do every moment that I never found time to clothe my thought in words and send them to you I wonder what becomes of lost opportunities Perhaps our guardian angel gathers them up as we drop them and will give them back to us in the beautiful sometime when we have grown wiser and learned how to use them rightly But however this may be I cannot now write the letter which has lain in my thought for you so long My heart is too full of sadness to dwell upon the happiness the summer has brought me My father is dead He died last Saturday at my home in Tuscumbia and I was not there My own dear loving father Oh dear friend how shall I ever bear it On the first of October Miss Keller entered the Cambridge School for Young Ladies of which mister Arthur Gilman is Principal The examinations mentioned in this letter were merely tests given in the school but as they were old Harvard papers it is evident that in some subjects Miss Keller was already fairly well prepared for Radcliffe TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON thirty seven Concord Avenue Cambridge Mass October eight eighteen ninety six I got up early this morning so that I could write you a few lines I know you want to hear how I like my school I do wish you could come and see for yourself what a beautiful school it is There are about a hundred girls and they are all so bright and happy it is a joy to be with them You will be glad to hear that I passed my examinations successfully I have been examined in English German French and Greek and Roman history They were the entrance examinations for Harvard College so I feel pleased to think I could pass them This year is going to be a very busy one for Teacher and myself I am studying Arithmetic English Literature English History German Latin and advanced geography there is a great deal of preparatory reading required and as few of the books are in raised print poor Teacher has to spell them all out to me and that means hard work You must tell mister Howells when you see him that we are living in his house TO missus WILLIAM THAW thirty seven Concord Avenue Cambridge Mass December two eighteen ninety six It takes me a long time to prepare my lessons because I have to have every word of them spelled out in my hand Not one of the textbooks which I am obliged to use is in raised print so of course my work is harder than it would be if I could read my lessons over by myself But it is harder for Teacher than it is for me because the strain on her poor eyes is so great and I cannot help worrying about them Sometimes it really seems as if the task which we have set ourselves were more than we can accomplish but at other times I enjoy my work more than I can say It is such a delight to be with the other girls and do everything that they do I study Latin German Arithmetic and English History all of which I enjoy except Arithmetic I am afraid I have not a mathematical mind for my figures always manage to get into the wrong places TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Cambridge Mass May three eighteen ninety seven You know I am trying very hard to get through with the reading for the examinations in June and this in addition to my regular schoolwork keeps me awfully busy But Johnson and The Plague and everything else must wait a few minutes this afternoon while I say thank you my dear missus Hutton What a splendid time we had at the Players Club I always thought clubs were dull smoky places where men talked politics and told endless stories all about themselves and their wonderful exploits but now I see I must have been quite wrong TO mister JOHN HITZ Wrentham Mass July nine eighteen ninety seven Teacher and I are going to spend the summer at Wrentham Mass with our friends the Chamberlins I think you remember mister Chamberlin the Listener in the Boston Transcript They are dear kind people But I know you want to hear about my examinations I know that you will be glad to hear that I passed all of them successfully The subjects I offered were elementary and advanced German French Latin English and Greek and Roman History It seems almost too good to be true does it not All the time I was preparing for the great ordeal I could not suppress an inward fear and trembling lest I should fail and now it is an unspeakable relief to know that I have passed the examinations with credit But what I consider my crown of success is the happiness and pleasure that my victory has brought dear Teacher Indeed I feel that the success is hers more than mine for she is my constant inspiration At the end of September Miss Sullivan and Miss Keller returned to the Cambridge School where they remained until early in December Then the interference of mister Gilman resulted in missus Keller s withdrawing Miss Helen and her sister Miss Mildred from the school Miss Sullivan and her pupil went to Wrentham where they worked under mister Merton S Keith an enthusiastic and skilful teacher TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Wrentham February twenty eighteen ninety eight I resumed my studies soon after your departure and in a very little while we were working as merrily as if the dreadful experience of a month ago had been but a dream I cannot tell you how much I enjoy the country It is so fresh and peaceful and free I do think I could work all day long without feeling tired if they would let me There are so many pleasant things to do not always very easy things much of my work in Algebra and Geometry is hard but I love it all especially Greek Just think I shall soon finish my grammar Then comes the Iliad What an inexpressible joy it will be to read about Achilles and Ulysses and Andromache and Athene and the rest of my old friends in their own glorious language I think Greek is the loveliest language that I know anything about If it is true that the violin is the most perfect of musical instruments then Greek is the violin of human thought We have had some splendid toboganning this month Every morning before lesson time we all go out to the steep hill on the northern shore of the lake near the house and coast for an hour or so Some one balances the toboggan on the very crest of the hill while we get on and when we are ready off we dash down the side of the hill in a headlong rush and leaping a projection plunge into a snow drift and go swimming far across the pond at a tremendous rate TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Wrentham April twelve eighteen ninety eight I am glad mister Keith is so well pleased with my progress It is true that Algebra and Geometry are growing easier all the time especially algebra and I have just received books in raised print which will greatly facilitate my work I find I get on faster and do better work with mister Keith than I did in the classes at the Cambridge School and I think it was well that I gave up that kind of work At any rate I have not been idle since I left school I have accomplished more and been happier than I could have been there TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Wrentham May twenty nine eighteen ninety eight My work goes on bravely Each day is filled to the brim with hard study for I am anxious to accomplish as much as possible before I put away my books for the summer vacation You will be pleased to hear that I did three problems in Geometry yesterday without assistance mister Keith and Teacher were quite enthusiastic over the achievement and I must confess I felt somewhat elated myself Now I feel as if I should succeed in doing something in mathematics although I cannot see why it is so very important to know that the lines drawn from the extremities of the base of an isosceles triangle to the middle points of the opposite sides are equal The knowledge doesn t make life any sweeter or happier does it On the other hand when we learn a new word it is the key to untold treasures TO CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER Wrentham Mass June seven eighteen ninety eight I am afraid you will conclude that I am not very anxious for a tandem after all since I have let nearly a week pass without answering your letter in regard to the kind of wheel I should like But really I have been so constantly occupied with my studies since we returned from New York that I have not had time even to think of the fun it would be to have a bicycle You see I am anxious to accomplish as much as possible before the long summer vacation begins I am glad though that it is nearly time to put away my books for the sunshine and flowers and the lovely lake in front of our house are doing their best to tempt me away from my Greek and Mathematics especially from the latter I am sure the daisies and buttercups have as little use for the science of Geometry as I in spite of the fact that they so beautifully illustrate its principles But bless me I mustn t forget the tandem The truth is I know very little about bicycles I have only ridden a sociable which is very different from the ordinary tandem The sociable is safer perhaps than the tandem but it is very heavy and awkward and has a way of taking up the greater part of the road Besides I have been told that sociables cost more than other kinds of bicycles My teacher and other friends think I could ride a Columbia tandem in the country with perfect safety They also think your suggestion about a fixed handlebar a good one I ride with a divided skirt and so does my teacher but it would be easier for her to mount a man s wheel than for me so if it could be arranged to have the ladies seat behind I think it would be better TO MISS CAROLINE DERBY Wrentham September eleven eighteen ninety eight I am out of doors all the time rowing swimming riding and doing a multitude of other pleasant things This morning I rode over twelve miles on my tandem I rode on a rough road and fell off three or four times and am now awfully lame But the weather and the scenery were so beautiful and it was such fun to go scooting over the smoother part of the road I didn t mind the mishaps in the least I have really learned to swim and dive after a fashion I can swim a little under water and do almost anything I like without fear of getting drowned Isn t that fine It is almost no effort for me to row around the lake no matter how heavy the load may be So you can well imagine how strong and brown I am TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON twelve Newbury Street Boston October twenty three eighteen ninety eight This is the first opportunity I have had to write to you since we came here last Monday We have been in such a whirl ever since we decided to come to Boston it seemed as if we should never get settled Poor Teacher has had her hands full attending to movers and express men and all sorts of people I wish it were not such a bother to move especially as we have to do it so often mister Keith comes here at half past three every day except Saturday He says he prefers to come here for the present I am reading the Iliad and the Aeneid and Cicero besides doing a lot in Geometry and Algebra The Iliad is beautiful with all the truth and grace and simplicity of a wonderfully childlike people while the Aeneid is more stately and reserved It is like a beautiful maiden who always lived in a palace surrounded by a magnificent court while the Iliad is like a splendid youth who has had the earth for his playground The weather has been awfully dismal all the week but to day is beautiful and our room floor is flooded with sunlight By and by we shall take a little walk in the Public Gardens I wish the Wrentham woods were round the corner But alas they are not and I shall have to content myself with a stroll in the Gardens Somehow after the great fields and pastures and lofty pine groves of the country they seem shut in and conventional Even the trees seem citified and self conscious Indeed I doubt if they are on speaking terms with their country cousins Do you know I cannot help feeling sorry for these trees with all their fashionable airs They are like the people whom they see every day who prefer the crowded noisy city to the quiet and freedom of the country They do not even suspect how circumscribed their lives are They look down pityingly on the country folk who have never had an opportunity to see the great world Oh my if they only realized their limitations they would flee for their lives to the woods and fields But what nonsense is this You will think I m pining away for my beloved Wrentham which is true in one sense and not in another I do miss Red Farm and the dear ones there dreadfully but I am not unhappy I have Teacher and my books and I have the certainty that something sweet and good will come to me in this great city where human beings struggle so bravely all their lives to wring happiness from cruel circumstances Anyway I am glad to have my share in life whether it be bright or sad TO missus WILLIAM THAW Boston December sixth eighteen ninety eight My teacher and I had a good laugh over the girls frolic How funny they must have looked in their rough rider costumes mounted upon their fiery steeds Slim would describe them if they were anything like the saw horses I have seen What jolly times they must have at I cannot help wishing sometimes that I could have some of the fun that other girls have How quickly I should lock up all these mighty warriors and hoary sages and impossible heroes who are now almost my only companions and dance and sing and frolic like other girls But I must not waste my time wishing idle wishes and after all my ancient friends are very wise and interesting and I usually enjoy their society very much indeed It is only once in a great while that I feel discontented and allow myself to wish for things I cannot hope for in this life But as you know my heart is usually brimful of happiness The thought that my dear Heavenly Father is always near giving me abundantly of all those things which truly enrich life and make it sweet and beautiful makes every deprivation seem of little moment compared with the countless blessings I enjoy TO missus WILLIAM THAW twelve Newbury Street Boston December nineteenth eighteen ninety eight I realize now what a selfish greedy girl I was to ask that my cup of happiness should be filled to overflowing without stopping to think how many other people s cups were quite empty I feel heartily ashamed of my thoughtlessness One of the childish illusions which it has been hardest for me to get rid of is that we have only to make our wishes known in order to have them granted But I am slowly learning that there is not happiness enough in the world for everyone to have all that he wants and it grieves me to think that I should have forgotten even for a moment that I already have more than my share and that like poor little Oliver Twist I should have asked for more TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON twelve Newberry Street Boston December twenty two eighteen ninety eight I suppose mister Keith writes you the work a day news If so you know that I have finished all the geometry and nearly all the Algebra required for the Harvard examinations and after Christmas I shall begin a very careful review of both subjects You will be glad to hear that I enjoy Mathematics now Why I can do long complicated quadratic equations in my head quite easily and it is great fun I think mister Keith is a wonderful teacher and I feel very grateful to him for having made me see the beauty of Mathematics Next to my own dear teacher he has done more than any one else to enrich and broaden my mind TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON twelve Newbury Street Boston January seventeen eighteen ninety nine Have you seen Kipling s Dreaming True or Kitchener s School It is a very strong poem and set me dreaming too Of course you have read about the Gordon Memorial College which the English people are to erect at Khartoum While I was thinking over the blessings that would come to the people of Egypt through this college and eventually to England herself there came into my heart the strong desire that my own dear country should in a similar way convert the terrible loss of her brave sons on the Maine into a like blessing to the people of Cuba Would a college at Havana not be the noblest and most enduring monument that could be raised to the brave men of the Maine as well as a source of infinite good to all concerned Imagine entering the Havana harbor and having the pier where the Maine was anchored on that dreadful night when she was so mysteriously destroyed pointed out to you and being told that the great beautiful building overlooking the spot was the Maine Memorial College erected by the American people and having for its object the education both of Cubans and Spaniards What a glorious triumph such a monument would be of the best and highest instincts of a Christian nation In it there would be no suggestion of hatred or revenge nor a trace of the old time belief that might makes right On the other hand it would be a pledge to the world that we intend to stand by our declaration of war and give Cuba to the Cubans as soon as we have fitted them to assume the duties and responsibilities of a self governing people TO mister JOHN HITZ twelve Newbury Street Boston February three eighteen ninety nine I had an exceedingly interesting experience last Monday A kind friend took me over in the morning to the Boston Art Museum She had previously obtained permission from General Loring Supt of the Museum for me to touch the statues especially those which represented my old friends in the Iliad and Aeneid Was that not lovely While I was there General Loring himself came in and showed me some of the most beautiful statues among which were the Venus of Medici the Minerva of the Parthenon Diana in her hunting costume with her hand on the quiver and a doe by her side and the unfortunate Laocoon and his two little sons struggling in the fearful coils of two huge serpents and stretching their arms to the skies with heart rending cries I also saw Apollo Belvidere He had just slain the Python and was standing by a great pillar of rock extending his graceful hand in triumph over the terrible snake Oh he was simply beautiful Venus entranced me She looked as if she had just risen from the foam of the sea and her loveliness was like a strain of heavenly music I also saw poor Niobe with her youngest child clinging close to her while she implored the cruel goddess not to kill her last darling I almost cried it was all so real and tragic General Loring kindly showed me a copy of one of the wonderful bronze doors of the Baptistry of Florence and I felt of the graceful pillars resting on the backs of fierce lions So you see I had a foretaste of the pleasure which I hope some day to have of visiting Florence My friend said she would sometime show me the copies of the marbles brought away by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon But somehow I should prefer to see the originals in the place where Genius meant them to remain not only as a hymn of praise to the gods but also as a monument of the glory of Greece It really seems wrong to snatch such sacred things away from the sanctuary of the Past where they belong TO mister WILLIAM WADE Boston February nineteenth eighteen ninety nine Why bless you I thought I wrote to you the day after the Eclogues arrived and told you how glad I was to have them Perhaps you never got that letter At any rate I thank you dear friend for taking such a world of trouble for me You will be glad to hear that the books from England are coming now I already have the seventh and eighth books of the Aeneid and one book of the Iliad all of which is most fortunate as I have come almost to the end of my embossed text books It gives me great pleasure to hear how much is being done for the deaf blind The more I learn of them the more kindness I find Why only a little while ago people thought it quite impossible to teach the deaf blind anything but no sooner was it proved possible than hundreds of kind sympathetic hearts were fired with the desire to help them and now we see how many of those poor unfortunate persons are being taught to see the beauty and reality of life Love always finds its way to an imprisoned soul and leads it out into the world of freedom and intelligence As to the two handed alphabet I think it is much easier for those who have sight than the manual alphabet for most of the letters look like the large capitals in books but I think when it comes to teaching a deaf blind person to spell the manual alphabet is much more convenient and less conspicuous TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON twelve Newbury Street Boston March five eighteen ninety nine I am now sure that I shall be ready for my examinations in June There is but one cloud in my sky at present but that is one which casts a dark shadow over my life and makes me very anxious at times My teacher s eyes are no better indeed I think they grow more troublesome though she is very brave and patient and will not give up But it is most distressing to me to feel that she is sacrificing her sight for me I feel as if I ought to give up the idea of going to college altogether for not all the knowledge in the world could make me happy if obtained at such a cost I do wish missus Hutton you would try to persuade Teacher to take a rest and have her eyes treated She will not listen to me I have just had some pictures taken and if they are good I would like to send one to mister Rogers if you think he would like to have it I would like so much to show him in some way how deeply I appreciate all that he is doing for me and I cannot think of anything better to do Every one here is talking about the Sargent pictures It is a wonderful exhibition of portraits they say How I wish I had eyes to see them How I should delight in their beauty and color However I am glad that I am not debarred from all pleasure in the pictures I have at least the satisfaction of seeing them through the eyes of my friends which is a real pleasure I am so thankful that I can rejoice in the beauties which my friends gather and put into my hands We are all so glad and thankful that mister Kipling did not die I have his Jungle Book in raised print and what a splendid refreshing book it is I cannot help feeling as if I knew its gifted author What a real manly lovable nature his must be TO doctor DAVID H GREER twelve Newbury Street Boston May eight eighteen ninety nine Each day brings me all that I can possibly accomplish and each night brings me rest and the sweet thought that I am a little nearer to my goal than ever before My Greek progresses finely I have finished the ninth book of the Iliad and am just beginning the Odyssey I am also reading the Aeneid and the Eclogues Some of my friends tell me that I am very foolish to give so much time to Greek and Latin but I am sure they would not think so if they realized what a wonderful world of experience and thought Homer and Virgil have opened up to me I think I shall enjoy the Odyssey most of all The Iliad tells of almost nothing but war and one sometimes wearies of the clash of spears and the din of battle but the Odyssey tells of nobler courage the courage of a soul sore tried but steadfast to the end I often wonder as I read these splendid poems why at the same time that Homer s songs of war fired the Greeks with valor his songs of manly virtue did not have a stronger influence upon the spiritual life of the people Perhaps the reason is that thoughts truly great are like seeds cast into the human mind and either lie there unnoticed or are tossed about and played with like toys until grown wise through suffering and experience a race discovers and cultivates them Then the world has advanced one step in its heavenward march I am working very hard just now I intend to take my examinations in June and there is a great deal to be done before I shall feel ready to meet the ordeal You will be glad to hear that my mother and little sister and brother are coming north to spend this summer with me We shall all live together in a small cottage on one of the lakes at Wrentham while my dear teacher takes a much needed rest She has not had a vacation for twelve years think of it and all that time she has been the sunshine of my life Now her eyes are troubling her a great deal and we all think she ought to be relieved for a while of every care and responsibility But we shall not be quite separated we shall see each other every day I hope And when July comes you can think of me as rowing my dear ones around the lovely lake in the little boat you gave me the happiest girl in the world TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Boston May twenty eighth eighteen ninety nine We have had a hard day mister Keith was here for three hours this afternoon pouring a torrent of Latin and Greek into my poor bewildered brain I really believe he knows more Latin and Greek Grammar than Cicero or Homer ever dreamed of Cicero is splendid but his orations are very difficult to translate I feel ashamed sometimes when I make that eloquent man say what sounds absurd or insipid but how is a school girl to interpret such genius Why I should have to be a Cicero to talk like a Cicero Linnie Haguewood is a deaf blind girl one of the many whom mister William Wade has helped She is being educated by Miss Dora Donald who at the beginning of her work with her pupil was supplied by mister Hitz Superintendent of the Volta Bureau with copies of all documents relating to Miss Sullivan s work with Miss Keller TO mister WILLIAM WADE Wrentham Mass June five eighteen ninety nine Linnie Haguewood s letter which you sent me some weeks ago interested me very much It seemed to show spontaneity and great sweetness of character I was a good deal amused by what she said about history I am sorry she does not enjoy it but I too feel sometimes how dark and mysterious and even fearful the history of old peoples old religions and old forms of government really is Well I must confess I do not like the sign language and I do not think it would be of much use to the deaf blind I find it very difficult to follow the rapid motions made by the deaf mutes and besides signs seem a great hindrance to them in acquiring the power of using language easily and freely Why I find it hard to understand them sometimes when they spell on their fingers On the whole if they cannot be taught articulation the manual alphabet seems the best and most convenient means of communication At any rate I am sure the deaf blind cannot learn to use signs with any degree of facility The other day I met a deaf Norwegian gentleman who knows Ragnhild Kaata and her teacher very well and we had a very interesting conversation about her He said she was very industrious and happy She spins and does a great deal of fancy work and reads and leads a pleasant useful life Just think she cannot use the manual alphabet She reads the lips well and if she cannot understand a phrase her friends write it in her hand and in this way she converses with strangers I cannot make out anything written in my hand so you see Ragnhild has got ahead of me in some things I do hope I shall see her sometime TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON Wrentham July twenty nine eighteen ninety nine I passed in all the subjects I offered and with credit in advanced Latin But I must confess I had a hard time on the second day of my examinations They would not allow Teacher to read any of the papers to me so the papers were copied for me in braille This arrangement worked very well in the languages but not nearly so well in the Mathematics Consequently I did not do so well as I should have done if Teacher had been allowed to read the Algebra and Geometry to me But you must not think I blame any one Of course they did not realize how difficult and perplexing they were making the examinations for me How could they they can see and hear and I suppose they could not understand matters from my point of view Thus far my summer has been sweeter than anything I can remember My mother and sister and little brother have been here five weeks and our happiness knows no bounds Not only do we enjoy being together but we also find our little home most delightful I do wish you could see the view of the beautiful lake from our piazza the islands looking like little emerald peaks in the golden sunlight and the canoes flitting here and there like autumn leaves in the gentle breeze and breathe in the peculiarly delicious fragrance of the woods which comes like a murmur from an unknown clime I cannot help wondering if it is the same fragrance that greeted the Norsemen long ago when according to tradition they visited our shores an odorous echo of many centuries of silent growth and decay in flower and tree TO missus SAMUEL RICHARD FULLER Wrentham October twenty eighteen ninety nine I suppose it is time for me to tell you something about our plans for the winter You know it has long been my ambition to go to Radcliffe and receive a degree as many other girls have done but Dean Irwin of Radcliffe has persuaded me to take a special course for the present She said I had already shown the world that I could do the college work by passing all my examinations successfully in spite of many obstacles She showed me how very foolish it would be for me to pursue a four years course of study at Radcliffe simply to be like other girls when I might better be cultivating whatever ability I had for writing She said she did not consider a degree of any real value but thought it was much more desirable to do something original than to waste one s energies only for a degree Her arguments seemed so wise and practical that I could not but yield I found it hard very hard to give up the idea of going to college it had been in my mind ever since I was a little girl but there is no use doing a foolish thing because one has wanted to do it a long time is there But while we were discussing plans for the winter a suggestion which doctor Hale had made long ago flashed across Teacher s mind that I might take courses somewhat like those offered at Radcliffe under the instruction of the professors in these courses Miss Irwin seemed to have no objection to this proposal and kindly offered to see the professors and find out if they would give me lessons If they will be so good as to teach me and if we have money enough to do as we have planned my studies this year will be English English Literature of the Elizabethan period Latin and German TO mister JOHN HITZ one hundred thirty eight Brattle saint Cambridge Nov eleven eighteen ninety nine As to the braille question I cannot tell how deeply it distresses me to hear that my statement with regard to the examinations has been doubted Ignorance seems to be at the bottom of all these contradictions Why you yourself seem to think that I taught you American braille when you do not know a single letter in the system I could not help laughing when you said you had been writing to me in American braille and there you were writing your letter in English braille The facts about the braille examinations are as follows How I passed my Entrance Examinations for Radcliffe College On the twenty ninth and thirtieth of June eighteen ninety nine I took my examinations for Radcliffe College The first day I had elementary Greek and advanced Latin and the second day Geometry Algebra and advanced Greek The college authorities would not permit Miss Sullivan to read the examination papers to me so mister Eugene C Vining one of the instructors at the Perkins Institution for the Blind was employed to copy the papers for me in braille mister Vining was a perfect stranger to me and could not communicate with me except by writing in braille The Proctor also was a stranger and did not attempt to communicate with me in any way and as they were both unfamiliar with my speech they could not readily understand what I said to them However the braille worked well enough in the languages but when it came to Geometry and Algebra it was different I was sorely perplexed and felt quite discouraged and wasted much precious time especially in Algebra It is true that I am perfectly familiar with all literary braille English American and New York Point but the method of writing the various signs used in Geometry and Algebra in the three systems is very different and two days before the examinations I knew only the English method I had used it all through my school work and never any other system In Geometry my chief difficulty was that I had always been accustomed to reading the propositions in Line Print or having them spelled into my hand and somehow although the propositions were right before me yet the braille confused me and I could not fix in my mind clearly what I was reading But when I took up Algebra I had a harder time still I was terribly handicapped by my imperfect knowledge of the notation The signs which I had learned the day before and which I thought I knew perfectly confused me Consequently my work was painfully slow and I was obliged to read the examples over and over before I could form a clear idea what I was required to do Indeed I am not sure now that I read all the signs correctly especially as I was much distressed and found it very hard to keep my wits about me Now there is one more fact which I wish to state very plainly in regard to what mister Gilman wrote to you I never received any direct instruction in the Gilman School Miss Sullivan always sat beside me and told me what the teachers said I did teach Miss Hall my teacher in Physics how to write the American braille but she never gave me any instruction by means of it unless a few problems written for practice which made me waste much precious time deciphering them can be called instruction Dear Frau Grote learned the manual alphabet and used to teach me herself but this was in private lessons which were paid for by my friends In the German class Miss Sullivan interpreted to me as well as she could what the teacher said Perhaps if you would send a copy of this to the head of the Cambridge School it might enlighten his mind on a few subjects on which he seems to be in total darkness just now TO MISS MILDRED KELLER one hundred thirty eight Brattle Street Cambridge November twenty six eighteen ninety nine At last we are settled for the winter and our work is going smoothly mister Keith comes every afternoon at four o clock and gives me a friendly lift over the rough stretches of road over which every student must go I am studying English history English literature French and Latin and by and by I shall take up German and English composition let us groan You know I detest grammar as much as you do but I suppose I must go through it if I am to write just as we had to get ducked in the lake hundreds of times before we could swim In French Teacher is reading Columba to me It is a delightful novel full of piquant expressions and thrilling adventures don t dare to blame me for using big words since you do the same and if you ever read it I think you will enjoy it immensely You are studying English history aren t you O but it s exceedingly interesting I m making quite a thorough study of the Elizabethan period of the Reformation and the Acts of Supremacy and Conformity and the maritime discoveries and all the big things which the deuce seems to have invented to plague innocent youngsters like yourself Now we have a swell winter outfit coats hats gowns flannels and all We ve just had four lovely dresses made by a French dressmaker I have two of which one has a black silk skirt with a black lace net over it and a waist of white poplin with turquoise velvet and chiffon and cream lace over a satin yoke The other is woollen and of a very pretty green The waist is trimmed with pink and green brocaded velvet and white lace I think and has double reefers on the front tucked and trimmed with velvet and also a row of tiny white buttons Teacher too has a silk dress The skirt is black while the waist is mostly yellow trimmed with delicate lavender chiffon and black velvet bows and lace Her other dress is purple trimmed with purple velvet and the waist has a collar of cream lace So you may imagine that we look quite like peacocks only we ve no trains A week ago yesterday there was a great football game between Harvard and Yale and there was tremendous excitement here We could hear the yells of the boys and the cheers of the lookers on as plainly in our room as if we had been on the field Colonel Roosevelt was there on Harvard s side but bless you he wore a white sweater and no crimson that we know of There were about twenty five thousand people at the game and when we went out the noise was so terrific we nearly jumped out of our skins thinking it was the din of war and not of a football game that we heard But in spite of all their wild efforts neither side was scored and we all laughed and said Oh well now the pot can t call the kettle black TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON five hundred fifty nine Madison Avenue New York January two nineteen hundred We have been here a week now and are going to stay with Miss Rhoades until Saturday We are enjoying every moment of our visit every one is so good to us We have seen many of our old friends and made some new ones We dined with the Rogers last Friday and oh they were so kind to us The thought of their gentle courtesy and genuine kindness brings a warm glow of joy and gratitude to my heart I have seen doctor Greer too He has such a kind heart I love him more than ever We went to saint Bartholomew s Sunday and I have not felt so much at home in a church since dear Bishop Brooks died doctor Greer read so slowly that my teacher could tell me every word His people must have wondered at his unusual deliberation After the service he asked mister Warren the organist to play for me I stood in the middle of the church where the vibrations from the great organ were strongest and I felt the mighty waves of sound beat against me as the great billows beat against a little ship at sea TO mister JOHN HITZ one hundred thirty eight Brattle Street Cambridge Feb three nineteen hundred My studies are more interesting than ever In Latin I am reading Horace s odes Although I find them difficult to translate yet I think they are the loveliest pieces of Latin poetry I have read or shall ever read In French we have finished Colomba and I am reading Horace by Corneille and La Fontaine s fables both of which are in braille I have not gone far in either but I know I shall enjoy the fables they are so delightfully written and give such good lessons in a simple and yet attractive way I do not think I have told you that my dear teacher is reading The Faery Queen to me I am afraid I find fault with the poem as much as I enjoy it I do not care much for the allegories indeed I often find them tiresome and I cannot help thinking that Spenser s world of knights paynims fairies dragons and all sorts of strange creatures is a somewhat grotesque and amusing world but the poem itself is lovely and as musical as a running brook I am now the proud owner of about fifteen new books which we ordered from Louisville Among them are Henry Esmond Bacon s Essays and extracts from English Literature Perhaps next week I shall have some more books The Tempest A Midsummer Night s Dream and possibly some selections from Green s history of England Am I not very fortunate I am afraid this letter savors too much of books but really they make up my whole life these days and I scarcely see or hear of anything else I do believe I sleep on books every night You know a student s life is of necessity somewhat circumscribed and narrow and crowds out almost everything that is not in books TO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ACADEMIC BOARD OF RADCLIFFE COLLEGE one hundred thirty eight Brattle Street Cambridge Mass May five nineteen hundred Dear Sir As an aid to me in determining my plans for study the coming year I apply to you for information as to the possibility of my taking the regular courses in Radcliffe College Since receiving my certificate of admission to Radcliffe last July I have been studying with a private tutor Horace Aeschylus French German Rhetoric English History English Literature and Criticism and English composition In college I should wish to continue most if not all of these subjects The conditions under which I work require the presence of Miss Sullivan who has been my teacher and companion for thirteen years as an interpreter of oral speech and as a reader of examination papers In college she or possibly in some subjects some one else would of necessity be with me in the lecture room and at recitations I should do all my written work on a typewriter and if a Professor could not understand my speech I could write out my answers to his questions and hand them to him after the recitation Is it possible for the College to accommodate itself to these unprecedented conditions so as to enable me to pursue my studies at Radcliffe I realize that the obstacles in the way of my receiving a college education are very great to others they may seem insurmountable but dear Sir a true soldier does not acknowledge defeat before the battle TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON thirty eight Brattle Street Cambridge June nine nineteen hundred I have not yet heard from the Academic Board in reply to my letter but I sincerely hope they will answer favorably My friends think it very strange that they should hesitate so long especially when I have not asked them to simplify my work in the least but only to modify it so as to meet the existing circumstances Cornell has offered to make arrangements suited to the conditions under which I work if I should decide to go to that college and the University of Chicago has made a similar offer but I am afraid if I went to any other college it would be thought that I did not pass my examinations for Radcliffe satisfactorily In the fall Miss Keller entered Radcliffe College TO mister JOHN HITZ fourteen Coolidge Ave Cambridge Nov twenty six nineteen hundred has already communicated with you in regard to her and my plan of establishing an institution for deaf and blind children At first I was most enthusiastic in its support and I never dreamed that any grave objections could be raised except indeed by those who are hostile to Teacher but now after thinking most SERIOUSLY and consulting my friends I have decided that s plan is by no means feasible In my eagerness to make it possible for deaf and blind children to have the same advantages that I have had I quite forgot that there might be many obstacles in the way of my accomplishing anything like what proposed My friends thought we might have one or two pupils in our own home thereby securing to me the advantage of being helpful to others without any of the disadvantages of a large school They were very kind but I could not help feeling that they spoke more from a business than a humanitarian point of view I am sure they did not quite understand how passionately I desire that all who are afflicted like myself shall receive their rightful inheritance of thought knowledge and love Still I could not shut my eyes to the force and weight of their arguments and I saw plainly that I must abandon s scheme as impracticable They also said that I ought to appoint an advisory committee to control my affairs while I am at Radcliffe I considered this suggestion carefully then I told mister Rhoades that I should be proud and glad to have wise friends to whom I could always turn for advice in all important matters For this committee I chose six my mother Teacher because she is like a mother to me missus Hutton mister Rhoades doctor Greer and mister Rogers because it is they who have supported me all these years and made it possible for me to enter college missus Hutton had already written to mother asking her to telegraph if she was willing for me to have other advisers besides herself and Teacher This morning we received word that mother had given her consent to this arrangement Now it remains for me to write to doctor Greer and mister Rogers We had a long talk with doctor Bell Finally he proposed a plan which delighted us all beyond words He said that it was a gigantic blunder to attempt to found a school for deaf and blind children because then they would lose the most precious opportunities of entering into the fuller richer freer life of seeing and hearing children I had had misgivings on this point but I could not see how we were to help it However mister Bell suggested that and all her friends who are interested in her scheme should organize an association for the promotion of the education of the deaf and blind Teacher and myself being included of course Under his plan they were to appoint Teacher to train others to instruct deaf and blind children in their own homes just as she had taught me Funds were to be raised for the teachers lodgings and also for their salaries At the same time doctor Bell added that I could rest content and fight my way through Radcliffe in competition with seeing and hearing girls while the great desire of my heart was being fulfilled We clapped our hands and shouted went away beaming with pleasure and Teacher and I felt more light of heart than we had for sometime Of course we can do nothing just now but the painful anxiety about my college work and the future welfare of the deaf and blind has been lifted from our minds Do tell me what you think about doctor Bell s suggestion It seems most practical and wise to me but I must know all that there is to be known about it before I speak or act in the matter TO mister JOHN D WRIGHT Cambridge December nine nineteen hundred Do you think me a villain and I can t think of a word bad enough to express your opinion of me unless indeed horse thief will answer the purpose Tell me truly do you think me as bad as that I hope not for I have thought many letters to you which never got on paper and I am delighted to get your good letter yes I really was and I intended to answer it immediately but the days slip by unnoticed when one is busy and I have been VERY busy this fall You must believe that Radcliffe girls are always up to their ears in work If you doubt it you d better come and see for yourself Yes I am taking the regular college course for a degree When I am a B A I suppose you will not dare call me a villain I am studying English Sophomore English if you please though I can t see that it is different from just plain English German French and History I m enjoying my work even more than I expected to which is another way of saying that I m glad I came It is hard very hard at times but it hasn t swamped me yet No I am not studying Mathematics or Greek or Latin either The courses at Radcliffe are elective only certain courses in English are prescribed I passed off my English and advanced French before I entered college and I choose the courses I like best I don t however intend to give up Latin and Greek entirely Perhaps I shall take up these studies later but I ve said goodbye to Mathematics forever and I assure you I was delighted to see the last of those horrid goblins I hope to obtain my degree in four years but I m not very particular about that There s no great hurry and I want to get as much as possible out of my studies Many of my friends would be well pleased if I would take two or even one course a year but I rather object to spending the rest of my life in college TO mister WILLIAM WADE fourteen Coolidge Avenue Cambridge December nine nineteen hundred Since you are so much interested in the deaf and blind I will begin by telling you of several cases I have come across lately Last October I heard of an unusually bright little girl in Texas Her name is Ruby Rice and she is thirteen years old I think She has never been taught but they say she can sew and likes to help others in this sort of work Her sense of smell is wonderful Why when she enters a store she will go straight to the showcases and she can also distinguish her own things Her parents are very anxious indeed to find a teacher for her They have also written to mister Hitz about her I also know a child at the Institution for the Deaf in Mississippi Her name is Maud Scott and she is six years old Miss Watkins the lady who has charge of her wrote me a most interesting letter She said that Maud was born deaf and lost her sight when she was only three months old and that when she went to the Institution a few weeks ago she was quite helpless She could not even walk and had very little use of her hands When they tried to teach her to string beads her little hands fell to her side Evidently her sense of touch has not been developed and as yet she can walk only when she holds some one s hand but she seems to be an exceedingly bright child Miss Watkins adds that she is very pretty I have written to her that when Maud learns to read I shall have many stories to send her The dear sweet little girl it makes my heart ache to think how utterly she is cut off from all that is good and desirable in life But Miss Watkins seems to be just the kind of teacher she needs I was in New York not long ago and I saw Miss Rhoades who told me that she had seen Katie McGirr She said the poor young girl talked and acted exactly like a little child Katie played with Miss Rhoades s rings and took them away saying with a merry laugh You shall not have them again She could only understand Miss Rhoades when she talked about the simplest things The latter wished to send her some books but she could not find anything simple enough for her She said Katie was very sweet indeed but sadly in need of proper instruction I was much surprised to hear all this for I judged from your letters that Katie was a very precocious girl A few days ago I met Tommy Stringer in the railroad station at Wrentham He is a great strong boy now and he will soon need a man to take care of him he is really too big for a lady to manage He goes to the public school I hear and his progress is astonishing they say but it doesn t show as yet in his conversation which is limited to Yes and No TO mister CHARLES T COPELAND December twenty nineteen hundred My dear mister Copeland I venture to write to you because I am afraid that if I do not explain why I have stopped writing themes you will think I have become discouraged or perhaps that to escape criticism I have beat a cowardly retreat from your class Please do not think either of these very unpleasant thoughts I am not discouraged nor am I afraid I am confident that I could go on writing themes like those I have written and I suppose I should get through the course with fairly good marks but this sort of literary patch work has lost all interest for me I have never been satisfied with my work but I never knew what my difficulty was until you pointed it out to me When I came to your class last October I was trying with all my might to be like everybody else to forget as entirely as possible my limitations and peculiar environment Now however I see the folly of attempting to hitch one s wagon to a star with harness that does not belong to it I have always accepted other peoples experiences and observations as a matter of course It never occurred to me that it might be worth while to make my own observations and describe the experiences peculiarly my own Henceforth I am resolved to be myself to live my own life and write my own thoughts when I have any When I have written something that seems to be fresh and spontaneous and worthy of your criticisms I will bring it to you if I may and if you think it good I shall be happy but if your verdict is unfavorable I shall try again and yet again until I have succeeded in pleasing you TO missus LAURENCE HUTTON fourteen Coolidge Avenue Cambridge December twenty seven nineteen hundred So you read about our class luncheon in the papers How in the world do the papers find out everything I wonder I am sure no reporter was present I had a splendid time the toasts and speeches were great fun I only spoke a few words as I did not know I was expected to speak until a few minutes before I was called upon I think I wrote you that I had been elected Vice President of the Freshman Class of Radcliffe Did I tell you in my last letter that I had a new dress a real party dress with low neck and short sleeves and quite a train It is pale blue trimmed with chiffon of the same color I have worn it only once but then I felt that Solomon in all his glory was not to be compared with me Anyway he certainly never had a dress like mine A gentleman in Philadelphia has just written to my teacher about a deaf and blind child in Paris whose parents are Poles The mother is a physician and a brilliant woman he says This little boy could speak two or three languages before he lost his hearing through sickness and he is now only about five years old Poor little fellow I wish I could do something for him but he is so young my teacher thinks it would be too bad to separate him from his mother I have had a letter from missus Thaw with regard to the possibility of doing something for these children doctor Bell thinks the present census will show that there are more than a thousand in the United States alone The number of deaf blind young enough to be benefited by education is not so large as this but the education of this class of defectives has been neglected and missus Thaw thinks if all my friends were to unite their efforts it would be an easy matter to establish at the beginning of this new century a new line upon which mercy might travel and the rescue of these unfortunate children could be accomplished TO mister WILLIAM WADE Cambridge February two nineteen oh one By the way have you any specimens of English braille especially printed for those who have lost their sight late in life or have fingers hardened by long toil so that their touch is less sensitive than that of other blind people I read an account of such a system in one of my English magazines and I am anxious to know more about it If it is as efficient as they say I see no reason why English braille should not be adopted by the blind of all countries Why it is the print that can be most readily adapted to many different languages Even Greek can be embossed in it as you know Then too it will be rendered still more efficient by the interpointing system which will save an immense amount of space and paper There is nothing more absurd I think than to have five or six different prints for the blind This letter was written in response to a tentative offer from the editor of The Great Round World to have the magazine published in raised type for the blind if enough were willing to subscribe It is evident that the blind should have a good magazine not a special magazine for the blind but one of our best monthlies printed in embossed letters The blind alone could not support it but it would not take very much money to make up the additional expense To THE GREAT ROUND WORLD Cambridge Feb sixteen nineteen oh one The Great Round World New York City Gentlemen I have only to day found time to reply to your interesting letter A little bird had already sung the good news in my ear but it was doubly pleasant to have it straight from you It would be splendid to have The Great Round World printed in language that can be felt I doubt if any one who enjoys the wondrous privilege of seeing can have any conception of the boon such a publication as you contemplate would be to the sightless To be able to read for one s self what is being willed thought and done in the world the world in whose joys and sorrows failures and successes one feels the keenest interest that would indeed be a happiness too deep for words I trust that the effort of The Great Round World to bring light to those who sit in darkness will receive the encouragement and support it so richly deserves I doubt however if the number of subscribers to an embossed edition of The Great Round World would ever be large for I am told that the blind as a class are poor But why should not the friends of the blind assist The Great Round World if necessary Surely there are hearts and hands ever ready to make it possible for generous intentions to be wrought into noble deeds Wishing you godspeed in an undertaking that is very dear to my heart I am et cetera TO MISS NINA RHOADES Cambridge Sept twenty five nineteen oh one We remained in Halifax until about the middle of August Day after day the Harbor the warships and the park kept us busy thinking and feeling and enjoying When the Indiana visited Halifax we were invited to go on board and she sent her own launch for us I touched the immense cannon read with my fingers several of the names of the Spanish ships that were captured at Santiago and felt the places where she had been pierced with shells The Indiana was the largest and finest ship in the Harbor and we felt very proud of her After we left Halifax we visited doctor Bell at Cape Breton He has a charming romantic house on a mountain called Beinn Bhreagh which overlooks the Bras d Or Lake doctor Bell told me many interesting things about his work He had just constructed a boat that could be propelled by a kite with the wind in its favor and one day he tried experiments to see if he could steer the kite against the wind I was there and really helped him fly the kites On one of them I noticed that the strings were of wire and having had some experience in bead work I said I thought they would break doctor Bell said No with great confidence and the kite was sent up It began to pull and tug and lo the wires broke and off went the great red dragon and poor doctor Bell stood looking forlornly after it After that he asked me if the strings were all right and changed them at once when I answered in the negative Altogether we had great fun TO doctor EDWARD EVERETT HALE Read by doctor Hale at the celebration of the centenary of doctor Samuel Gridley Howe at Tremont Temple Boston Nov eleven nineteen oh one Cambridge Nov ten nineteen oh one My teacher and I expect to be present at the meeting tomorrow in commemoration of the one hundredth anniversary of doctor Howe s birth but I very much doubt if we shall have an opportunity to speak with you so I am writing now to tell you how delighted I am that you are to speak at the meeting because I feel that you better than any one I know will express the heartfelt gratitude of those who owe their education their opportunities their happiness to him who opened the eyes of the blind and gave the dumb lip language Sitting here in my study surrounded by my books enjoying the sweet and intimate companionship of the great and the wise I am trying to realize what my life might have been if doctor Howe had failed in the great task God gave him to perform If he had not taken upon himself the responsibility of Laura Bridgman s education and led her out of the pit of Acheron back to her human inheritance should I be a sophomore at Radcliffe College to day who can say But it is idle to speculate about what might have been in connection with doctor Howe s great achievement I think only those who have escaped that death in life existence from which Laura Bridgman was rescued can realize how isolated how shrouded in darkness how cramped by its own impotence is a soul without thought or faith or hope Words are powerless to describe the desolation of that prison house or the joy of the soul that is delivered out of its captivity When we compare the needs and helplessness of the blind before doctor Howe began his work with their present usefulness and independence we realize that great things have been done in our midst What if physical conditions have built up high walls about us Thanks to our friend and helper our world lies upward the length and breadth and sweep of the heavens are ours It is pleasant to think that doctor Howe s noble deeds will receive their due tribute of affection and gratitude in the city which was the scene of his great labors and splendid victories for humanity With kind greetings in which my teacher joins me I am Affectionately your friend HELEN KELLER TO THE honorable GEORGE FRISBIE HOAR Cambridge Mass November twenty five nineteen oh one My Dear Senator Hoar I am glad you liked my letter about doctor Howe It was written out of my heart and perhaps that is why it met a sympathetic response in other hearts I will ask doctor Hale to lend me the letter so that I can make a copy of it for you You see I use a typewriter it is my right hand man so to speak Without it I do not see how I could go to college I write all my themes and examinations on it even Greek Indeed it has only one drawback and that probably is regarded as an advantage by the professors it is that one s mistakes may be detected at a glance for there is no chance to hide them in illegible writing I know you will be amused when I tell you that I am deeply interested in politics I like to have the papers read to me and I try to understand the great questions of the day but I am afraid my knowledge is very unstable for I change my opinions with every new book I read I used to think that when I studied Civil Government and Economics all my difficulties and perplexities would blossom into beautiful certainties but alas I find that there are more tares than wheat in these fertile fields of knowledge III A SUPPLEMENTARY ACCOUNT OF HELEN KELLER S LIFE AND EDUCATION CHAPTER I The Writing of the Book It is fitting that Miss Keller s Story of My Life should appear at this time What is remarkable in her career is already accomplished and whatever she may do in the future will be but a relatively slight addition to the success which distinguishes her now That success has just been assured for it is her work at Radcliffe during the last two years which has shown that she can carry her education as far as if she were studying under normal conditions Whatever doubts Miss Keller herself may have had are now at rest Several passages of her autobiography as it appeared in serial form have been made the subject of a grave editorial in a Boston newspaper in which the writer regretted Miss Keller s apparent disillusionment in regard to the value of her college life He quoted the passages in which she explains that college is not the universal Athens she had hoped to find and cited the cases of other remarkable persons whose college life had proved disappointing But it is to be remembered that Miss Keller has written many things in her autobiography for the fun of writing them and the disillusion which the writer of the editorial took seriously is in great part humorous Miss Keller does not suppose her views to be of great importance and when she utters her opinions on important matters she takes it for granted that her reader will receive them as the opinions of a junior in college not of one who writes with the wisdom of maturity For instance it surprised her that some people were annoyed at what she said about the Bible and she was amused that they did not see what was plain enough that she had been obliged to read the whole Bible in a course in English literature not as a religious duty put upon her by her teacher or her parents I ought to apologize to the reader and to Miss Keller for presuming to say what her subject matter is worth but one more explanation is necessary In her account of her early education Miss Keller is not giving a scientifically accurate record of her life nor even of the important events She cannot know in detail how she was taught and her memory of her childhood is in some cases an idealized memory of what she has learned later from her teacher and others She is less able to recall events of fifteen years ago than most of us are to recollect our childhood That is why her teacher s records may be found to differ in some particulars from Miss Keller s account The way in which Miss Keller wrote her story shows as nothing else can show the difficulties she had to overcome When we write we can go back over our work shuffle the pages interline rearrange see how the paragraphs look in proof and so construct the whole work before the eye as an architect constructs his plans When Miss Keller puts her work in typewritten form she cannot refer to it again unless some one reads it to her by means of the manual alphabet This difficulty is in part obviated by the use of her braille machine which makes a manuscript that she can read but as her work must be put ultimately in typewritten form and as a braille machine is somewhat cumbersome she has got into the habit of writing directly on her typewriter She depends so little on her braille manuscript that when she began to write her story more than a year ago and had put in braille a hundred pages of material and notes she made the mistake of destroying these notes before she had finished her manuscript Thus she composed much of her story on the typewriter and in constructing it as a whole depended on her memory to guide her in putting together the detached episodes which Miss Sullivan read over to her Last July when she had finished under great pressure of work her final chapter she set to work to rewrite the whole story Her good friend mister William Wade had a complete braille copy made for her from the magazine proofs Then for the first time she had her whole manuscript under her finger at once She saw imperfections in the arrangement of paragraphs and the repetition of phrases She saw too that her story properly fell into short chapters and redivided it Partly from temperament partly from the conditions of her work she has written rather a series of brilliant passages than a unified narrative in point of fact several paragraphs of her story are short themes written in her English courses and the small unit sometimes shows its original limits In rewriting the story Miss Keller made corrections on separate pages on her braille machine Long corrections she wrote out on her typewriter with catch words to indicate where they belonged Then she read from her braille copy the entire story making corrections as she read which were taken down on the manuscript that went to the printer During this revision she discussed questions of subject matter and phrasing She sat running her finger over the braille manuscript stopping now and then to refer to the braille notes on which she had indicated her corrections all the time reading aloud to verify the manuscript She listened to criticism just as any author listens to his friends or his editor Miss Sullivan who is an excellent critic made suggestions at many points in the course of composition and revision One newspaper suggested that Miss Keller had been led into writing the book and had been influenced to put certain things into it by zealous friends As a matter of fact most of the advice she has received and heeded has led to excisions rather than to additions The book is Miss Keller s and is final proof of her independent power CHAPTER II PERSONALITY Mark Twain has said that the two most interesting characters of the nineteenth century are Napoleon and Helen Keller The admiration with which the world has regarded her is more than justified by what she has done No one can tell any great truth about her which has not already been written and all that I can do is to give a few more facts about Miss Keller s work and add a little to what is known of her personality Miss Keller is tall and strongly built and has always had good health She seems to be more nervous than she really is because she expresses more with her hands than do most English speaking people One reason for this habit of gesture is that her hands have been so long her instruments of communication that they have taken to themselves the quick shiftings of the eye and express some of the things that we say in a glance All deaf people naturally gesticulate Indeed at one time it was believed that the best way for them to communicate was through systematized gestures the sign language invented by the Abbe de l Epee When Miss Keller speaks her face is animated and expresses all the modes of her thought the expressions that make the features eloquent and give speech half its meaning On the other hand she does not know another s expression When she is talking with an intimate friend however her hand goes quickly to her friend s face to see as she says the twist of the mouth In this way she is able to get the meaning of those half sentences which we complete unconsciously from the tone of the voice or the twinkle of the eye Her memory of people is remarkable She remembers the grasp of fingers she has held before all the characteristic tightening of the muscles that makes one person s handshake different from that of another The trait most characteristic perhaps of Miss Keller and also of Miss Sullivan is humour Skill in the use of words and her habit of playing with them make her ready with mots and epigrams Some one asked her if she liked to study Yes she replied but I like to play also and I feel sometimes as if I were a music box with all the play shut up inside me When she met doctor Furness the Shakespearean scholar he warned her not to let the college professors tell her too many assumed facts about the life of Shakespeare all we know he said is that Shakespeare was baptized married and died Well she replied he seems to have done all the essential things Once a friend who was learning the manual alphabet kept making g which is like the hand of a sign post for h which is made with two fingers extended Finally Miss Keller told him to fire both barrels mister Joseph Jefferson was once explaining to Miss Keller what the bumps on her head meant That he said is your prize fighting bump I never fight she replied except against difficulties Miss Keller s humour is that deeper kind of humour which is courage Thirteen years ago she made up her mind to learn to speak and she gave her teacher no rest until she was allowed to take lessons although wise people even Miss Sullivan the wisest of them all regarded it as an experiment unlikely to succeed and almost sure to make her unhappy It was this same perseverance that made her go to college After she had passed her examinations and received her certificate of admission she was advised by the Dean of Radcliffe and others not to go on She accordingly delayed a year But she was not satisfied until she had carried out her purpose and entered college Her life has been a series of attempts to do whatever other people do and to do it as well Her success has been complete for in trying to be like other people she has come most fully to be herself Her unwillingness to be beaten has developed her courage Where another can go she can go Her respect for physical bravery is like Stevenson s the boy s contempt for the fellow who cries with a touch of young bravado in it She takes tramps in the woods plunging through the underbrush where she is scratched and bruised yet you could not get her to admit that she is hurt and you certainly could not persuade her to stay at home next time So when people try experiments with her she displays a sportsmanlike determination to win in any test however unreasonable that one may wish to put her to If she does not know the answer to a question she guesses with mischievous assurance Ask her the colour of your coat no blind person can tell colour she will feel it and say black If it happens to be blue and you tell her so triumphantly she is likely to answer Thank you I am glad you know Why did you ask me Her whimsical and adventuresome spirit puts her so much on her mettle that she makes rather a poor subject for the psychological experimenter Moreover Miss Sullivan does not see why Miss Keller should be subjected to the investigation of the scientist and has not herself made many experiments When a psychologist asked her if Miss Keller spelled on her fingers in her sleep Miss Sullivan replied that she did not think it worth while to sit up and watch such matters were of so little consequence Miss Keller likes to be part of the company If any one whom she is touching laughs at a joke she laughs too just as if she had heard it If others are aglow with music a responding glow caught sympathetically shines in her face Indeed she feels the movements of Miss Sullivan so minutely that she responds to her moods and so she seems to know what is going on even though the conversation has not been spelled to her for some time In the same way her response to music is in part sympathetic although she enjoys it for its own sake Music probably can mean little to her but beat and pulsation She cannot sing and she cannot play the piano although as some early experiments show she could learn mechanically to beat out a tune on the keys Her enjoyment of music however is very genuine for she has a tactile recognition of sound when the waves of air beat against her Part of her experience of the rhythm of music comes no doubt from the vibration of solid objects which she is touching the floor or what is more evident the case of the piano on which her hand rests But she seems to feel the pulsation of the air itself When the organ was played for her in saint Bartholomew s the whole building shook with the great pedal notes but that does not altogether account for what she felt and enjoyed The vibration of the air as the organ notes swelled made her sway in answer Sometimes she puts her hand on a singer s throat to feel the muscular thrill and contraction and from this she gets genuine pleasure No one knows however just what her sensations are It is amusing to read in one of the magazines of eighteen ninety five that Miss Keller has a just and intelligent appreciation of different composers from having literally felt their music Schumann being her favourite If she knows the difference between Schumann and Beethoven it is because she has read it and if she has read it she remembers it and can tell any one who asks her Miss Keller s effort to reach out and meet other people on their own intellectual ground has kept her informed of daily affairs When her education became more systematic and she was busy with books it would have been very easy for Miss Sullivan to let her draw into herself if she had been so inclined But every one who has met her has given his best ideas to her and she has taken them If in the course of a conversation the friend next to her has ceased for some moments to spell into her hand the question comes inevitably What are you talking about Thus she picks up the fragments of the daily intercourse of normal people so that her detailed information is singularly full and accurate She is a good talker on the little occasional affairs of life Much of her knowledge comes to her directly When she is out walking she often stops suddenly attracted by the odour of a bit of shrubbery She reaches out and touches the leaves and the world of growing things is hers as truly as it is ours to enjoy while she holds the leaves in her fingers and smells the blossoms and to remember when the walk is done When she is in a new place especially an interesting place like Niagara whoever accompanies her usually of course Miss Sullivan is kept busy giving her an idea of visible details Miss Sullivan who knows her pupil s mind selects from the passing landscape essential elements which give a certain clearness to Miss Keller s imagined view of an outer world that to our eyes is confused and overloaded with particulars If her companion does not give her enough details Miss Keller asks questions until she has completed the view to her satisfaction She does not see with her eyes but through the inner faculty to serve which eyes were given to us When she returns from a walk and tells some one about it her descriptions are accurate and vivid A comparative experience drawn from written descriptions and from her teacher s words has kept her free from errors in her use of terms of sound and vision True her view of life is highly coloured and full of poetic exaggeration the universe as she sees it is no doubt a little better than it really is But her knowledge of it is not so incomplete as one might suppose Occasionally she astonishes you by ignorance of some fact which no one happens to have told her for instance she did not know until her first plunge into the sea that it is salt Many of the detached incidents and facts of our daily life pass around and over her unobserved but she has enough detailed acquaintance with the world to keep her view of it from being essentially defective Most that she knows at first hand comes from her sense of touch This sense is not however so finely developed as in some other blind people Laura Bridgman could tell minute shades of difference in the size of thread and made beautiful lace Miss Keller used to knit and crochet but she has had better things to do With her varied powers and accomplishments her sense of touch has not been used enough to develop it very far beyond normal acuteness A friend tried Miss Keller one day with several coins She was slower than he expected her to be in identifying them by their relative weight and size But it should be said she almost never handles money one of the many sordid and petty details of life by the way which she has been spared She recognizes the subject and general intention of a statuette six inches high Anything shallower than a half inch bas relief is a blank to her so far as it expresses an idea of beauty Large statues of which she can feel the sweep of line with her whole hand she knows in their higher esthetic value She suggests herself that she can know them better than we do because she can get the true dimensions and appreciate more immediately the solid nature of a sculptured figure When she was at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston she stood on a step ladder and let both hands play over the statues When she felt a bas relief of dancing girls she asked Where are the singers When she found them she said One is silent The lips of the singer were closed It is however in her daily life that one can best measure the delicacy of her senses and her manual skill She seems to have very little sense of direction She gropes her way without much certainty in rooms where she is quite familiar Most blind people are aided by the sense of sound so that a fair comparison is hard to make except with other deaf blind persons Her dexterity is not notable either in comparison with the normal person whose movements are guided by the eye or I am told with other blind people She has practised no single constructive craft which would call for the use of her hands When she was twelve her friend mister Albert H Munsell the artist let her experiment with a wax tablet and a stylus He says that she did pretty well and managed to make after models some conventional designs of the outlines of leaves and rosettes The only thing she does which requires skill with the hands is her work on the typewriter Although she has used the typewriter since she was eleven years old she is rather careful than rapid She writes with fair speed and absolute sureness Her manuscripts seldom contain typographical errors when she hands them to Miss Sullivan to read Her typewriter has no special attachments She keeps the relative position of the keys by an occasional touch of the little finger on the outer edge of the board Miss Keller s reading of the manual alphabet by her sense of touch seems to cause some perplexity Even people who know her fairly well have written in the magazines about Miss Sullivan s mysterious telegraphic communications with her pupil The manual alphabet is that in use among all educated deaf people Most dictionaries contain an engraving of the manual letters The deaf person with sight looks at the fingers of his companion but it is also possible to feel them Miss Keller puts her fingers lightly over the hand of one who is talking to her and gets the words as rapidly as they can be spelled As she explains she is not conscious of the single letters or of separate words Miss Sullivan and others who live constantly with the deaf can spell very rapidly fast enough to get a slow lecture not fast enough to get every word of a rapid speaker Anybody can learn the manual letters in a few minutes use them slowly in a day and in thirty days of constant use talk to Miss Keller or any other deaf person without realizing what his fingers are doing If more people knew this and the friends and relatives of deaf children learned the manual alphabet at once the deaf all over the world would be happier and better educated Miss Keller reads by means of embossed print or the various kinds of braille The ordinary embossed book is made with roman letters both small letters and capitals These letters are of simple square angular design The small letters are about three sixteenths of an inch high and are raised from the page the thickness of the thumbnail The books are large about the size of a volume of an encyclopedia Green s Short History of the English People is in six large volumes The books are not heavy because the leaves with the raised type do not lie close The time that one of Miss Keller s friends realizes most strongly that she is blind is when he comes on her suddenly in the dark and hears the rustle of her fingers across the page The most convenient print for the blind is braille which has several variations too many indeed English American New York Point Miss Keller reads them all Most educated blind people know several but it would save trouble if as Miss Keller suggests English braille were universally adopted The facsimile on page xv omitted from etext gives an idea of how the raised dots look Each character either a letter or a special braille contraction is a combination made by varying in place and number points in six possible positions Miss Keller has a braille writer on which she keeps notes and writes letters to her blind friends There are six keys and by pressing different combinations at a stroke as one plays a chord on the piano the operator makes a character at a time in a sheet of thick paper and can write about half as rapidly as on a typewriter Braille is especially useful in making single manuscript copies of books Books for the blind are very limited in number They cost a great deal to publish and they have not a large enough sale to make them profitable to the publisher but there are several institutions with special funds to pay for embossed books Miss Keller is more fortunate than most blind people in the kindness of her friends who have books made especially for her and in the willingness of gentlemen like mister E E Allen of the Pennsylvania Institute for the Instruction of the Blind to print as he has on several occasions editions of books that she has needed Miss Keller does not as a rule read very fast but she reads deliberately not so much because she feels the words less quickly than we see then as because it is one of her habits of mind to do things thoroughly and well When a passage interests her or she needs to remember it for some future use she flutters it off swiftly on the fingers of her right hand Sometimes this finger play is unconscious Miss Keller talks to herself absent mindedly in the manual alphabet When she is walking up or down the hall or along the veranda her hands go flying along beside her like a confusion of birds wings There is I am told tactile memory as well as visual and aural memory Miss Sullivan says that both she and Miss Keller remember in their fingers what they have said For Miss Keller to spell a sentence in the manual alphabet impresses it on her mind just as we learn a thing from having heard it many times and can call back the memory of its sound Like every deaf or blind person Miss Keller depends on her sense of smell to an unusual degree When she was a little girl she smelled everything and knew where she was what neighbour s house she was passing by the distinctive odours As her intellect grew she became less dependent on this sense To what extent she now identifies objects by their odour is hard to determine The sense of smell has fallen into disrepute and a deaf person is reluctant to speak of it Miss Keller s acute sense of smell may account however in some part for that recognition of persons and things which it has been customary to attribute to a special sense or to an unusual development of the power that we all seem to have of telling when some one is near The question of a special sixth sense such as people have ascribed to Miss Keller is a delicate one This much is certain she cannot have any sense that other people may not have and the existence of a special sense is not evident to her or to any one who knows her Miss Keller is distinctly not a singular proof of occult and mysterious theories and any attempt to explain her in that way fails to reckon with her normality She is no more mysterious and complex than any other person All that she is all that she has done can be explained directly except such things in every human being as never can be explained She does not it would seem prove the existence of spirit without matter or of innate ideas or of immortality or anything else that any other human being does not prove Philosophers have tried to find out what was her conception of abstract ideas before she learned language If she had any conception there is no way of discovering it now for she cannot remember and obviously there was no record at the time She had no conception of God before she heard the word God as her comments very clearly show Her sense of time is excellent but whether it would have developed as a special faculty cannot be known for she has had a watch since she was seven years old Miss Keller has two watches which have been given her They are I think the only ones of their kind in America The watch has on the back cover a flat gold indicator which can be pushed freely around from left to right until by means of a pin inside the case it locks with the hour hand and takes a corresponding position The point of this gold indicator bends over the edge of the case round which are set eleven raised points the stem forms the twelfth Thus the watch an ordinary watch with a white dial for the person who sees becomes for a blind person by this special attachment in effect one with a single raised hour hand and raised figures Though there is less than half an inch between the points a space which represents sixty minutes Miss Keller tells the time almost exactly It should be said that any double case watch with the crystal removed serves well enough for a blind person whose touch is sufficiently delicate to feel the position of the hands and not disturb or injure them The finer traits of Miss Keller s character are so well known that one needs not say much about them Good sense good humour and imagination keep her scheme of things sane and beautiful No attempt is made by those around her either to preserve or to break her illusions When she was a little girl a good many unwise and tactless things that were said for her benefit were not repeated to her thanks to the wise watchfulness of Miss Sullivan Now that she has grown up nobody thinks of being less frank with her than with any other intelligent young woman What her good friend Charles Dudley Warner wrote about her in Harper s Magazine in eighteen ninety six was true then and it remains true now I believe she is the purest minded human ever in existence The world to her is what her own mind is She has not even learned that exhibition on which so many pride themselves of righteous indignation Some time ago when a policeman shot dead her dog a dearly loved daily companion she found in her forgiving heart no condemnation for the man she only said If he had only known what a good dog she was he wouldn t have shot her It was said of old time Lord forgive them they know not what they do Of course the question will arise whether if Helen Keller had not been guarded from the knowledge of evil she would have been what she is to day Her mind has neither been made effeminate by the weak and silly literature nor has it been vitiated by that which is suggestive of baseness In consequence her mind is not only vigorous but it is pure She is in love with noble things with noble thoughts and with the characters of noble men and women She still has a childlike aversion to tragedies Her imagination is so vital that she falls completely under the illusion of a story and lives in its world Miss Sullivan writes in a letter of eighteen ninety one Yesterday I read to her the story of Macbeth as told by Charles and Mary Lamb She was very greatly excited by it and said It is terrible It makes me tremble After thinking a little while she added I think Shakespeare made it very terrible so that people would see how fearful it is to do wrong Of the real world she knows more of the good and less of the evil than most people seem to know Her teacher does not harass her with the little unhappy things but of the important difficulties they have been through Miss Keller was fully informed took her share of the suffering and put her mind to the problems She is logical and tolerant most trustful of a world that has treated her kindly Once when some one asked her to define love she replied Why bless you that is easy it is what everybody feels for everybody else Toleration she said once when she was visiting her friend missus Laurence Hutton is the greatest gift of the mind it requires the same effort of the brain that it takes to balance oneself on a bicycle She has a large generous sympathy and absolute fairness of temper So far as she is noticeably different from other people she is less bound by convention She has the courage of her metaphors and lets them take her skyward when we poor self conscious folk would think them rather too bookish for ordinary conversation She always says exactly what she thinks without fear of the plain truth yet no one is more tactful and adroit than she in turning an unpleasant truth so that it will do the least possible hurt to the feelings of others Not all the attention that has been paid her since she was a child has made her take herself too seriously Sometimes she gets started on a very solemn preachment Then her teacher calls her an incorrigible little sermonizer and she laughs at herself Often however her sober ideas are not to be laughed at for her earnestness carries her listeners with her There is never the least false sententiousness in what she says She means everything so thoroughly that her very quotations her echoes from what she has read are in truth original Her logic and her sympathy are in excellent balance Her sympathy is of the swift and ministering sort which fortunately she has found so often in other people And her sympathies go further and shape her opinions on political and national movements She was intensely pro Boer and wrote a strong argument in favour of Boer independence When she was told of the surrender of the brave little people her face clouded and she was silent a few minutes Then she asked clear penetrating questions about the terms of the surrender and began to discuss them Both mister Gilman and mister Keith the teachers who prepared her for college were struck by her power of constructive reasoning and she was excellent in pure mathematics though she seems never to have enjoyed it much Some of the best of her writing apart from her fanciful and imaginative work is her exposition in examinations and technical themes and in some letters which she found it necessary to write to clear up misunderstandings and which are models of close thinking enforced with sweet vehemence She is an optimist and an idealist I hope she writes in a letter that L isn t too practical for if she is I m afraid she ll miss a great deal of pleasure In the diary that she kept at the Wright Humason School in New York she wrote on October eighteen eighteen ninety four I find that I have four things to learn in my school life here and indeed in life to think clearly without hurry or confusion to love everybody sincerely to act in everything with the highest motives and to trust in dear God unhesitatingly CHAPTER III EDUCATION It is now sixty five years since doctor Samuel Gridley Howe knew that he had made his way through Laura Bridgman s fingers to her intelligence The names of Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller will always be linked together and it is necessary to understand what doctor Howe did for his pupil before one comes to an account of Miss Sullivan s work For doctor Howe is the great pioneer on whose work that of Miss Sullivan and other teachers of the deaf blind immediately depends doctor Samuel Gridley Howe was born in Boston November ten eighteen oh one and died in Boston January nine eighteen seventy six He was a great philanthropist interested especially in the education of all defectives the feeble minded the blind and the deaf Far in advance of his time he advocated many public measures for the relief of the poor and the diseased for which he was laughed at then but which have since been put into practice As head of the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston he heard of Laura Bridgman and had her brought to the Institution on October four eighteen thirty seven Laura Bridgman was born at Hanover New Hampshire December twenty one eighteen twenty nine so she was almost eight years old when doctor Howe began his experiments with her At the age of twenty six months scarlet fever left her without sight or hearing She also lost her sense of smell and taste doctor Howe was an experimental scientist and had in him the spirit of New England transcendentalism with its large faith and large charities Science and faith together led him to try to make his way into the soul which he believed was born in Laura Bridgman as in every other human being His plan was to teach Laura by means of raised types He pasted raised labels on objects and made her fit the labels to the objects and the objects to the labels When she had learned in this way to associate raised words with things in much the same manner he says as a dog learns tricks he began to resolve the words into their letter elements and to teach her to put together k e y c a p His success convinced him that language can be conveyed through type to the mind of the blind deaf child who before education is in the state of the baby who has not learned to prattle indeed is in a much worse state for the brain has grown in years without natural nourishment After Laura s education had progressed for two months with the use only of raised letters doctor Howe sent one of his teachers to learn the manual alphabet from a deaf mute She taught it to Laura and from that time on the manual alphabet was the means of communicating with her After the first year or two doctor Howe did not teach Laura Bridgman himself but gave her over to other teachers who under his direction carried on the work of teaching her language Too much cannot be said in praise of doctor Howe s work As an investigator he kept always the scientist s attitude He never forgot to keep his records of Laura Bridgman in the fashion of one who works in a laboratory The result is his records of her are systematic and careful From a scientific standpoint it is unfortunate that it was impossible to keep such a complete record of Helen Keller s development This in itself is a great comment on the difference between Laura Bridgman and Helen Keller Laura always remained an object of curious study Helen Keller became so rapidly a distinctive personality that she kept her teacher in a breathless race to meet the needs of her pupil with no time or strength to make a scientific study In some ways this is unfortunate Miss Sullivan knew at the beginning that Helen Keller would be more interesting and successful than Laura Bridgman and she expresses in one of her letters the need of keeping notes But neither temperament nor training allowed her to make her pupil the object of any experiment or observation which did not help in the child s development As soon as a thing was done a definite goal passed the teacher did not always look back and describe the way she had come The explanation of the fact was unimportant compared to the fact itself and the need of hurrying on There are two other reasons why Miss Sullivan s records are incomplete It has always been a severe tax on her eyes to write and she was early discouraged from publishing data by the inaccurate use made of what she at first supplied When she first wrote from Tuscumbia to mister Michael Anagnos doctor Howes son in law and his successor as Director of the Perkins Institution about her work with her pupil the Boston papers began at once to publish exaggerated accounts of Helen Keller Miss Sullivan protested In a letter dated April ten eighteen eighty seven only five weeks after she went to Helen Keller she wrote to a friend sent me a Boston Herald containing a stupid article about Helen How perfectly absurd to say that Helen is already talking fluently Why one might just as well say that a two year old child converses fluently when he says apple give or baby walk go I suppose if you included his screaming crowing whimpering grunting squalling with occasional kicks in his conversation it might be regarded as fluent even eloquent Then it is amusing to read of the elaborate preparation I underwent to fit me for the great task my friends entrusted to me I am sorry that preparation didn t include spelling it would have saved me such a lot of trouble On March four eighteen eighty eight she writes in a letter Indeed I am heartily glad that I don t know all that is being said and written about Helen and myself I assure you I know quite enough Nearly every mail brings some absurd statement printed or written The truth is not wonderful enough to suit the newspapers so they enlarge upon it and invent ridiculous embellishments One paper has Helen demonstrating problems in geometry by means of her playing blocks I expect to hear next that she has written a treatise on the origin and future of the planets In December eighteen eighty seven appeared the first report of the Director of the Perkins Institution which deals with Helen Keller For this report Miss Sullivan prepared in reluctant compliance with the request of mister Anagnos an account of her work This with the extracts from her letters scattered through the report is the first valid source of information about Helen Keller Of this report Miss Sullivan wrote in a letter dated October thirty eighteen eighty seven Have you seen the paper I wrote for the report mister Anagnos was delighted with it He says Helen s progress has been a triumphal march from the beginning and he has many flattering things to say about her teacher I think he is inclined to exaggerate at all events his language is too glowing and simple facts are set forth in such a manner that they bewilder one Doubtless the work of the past few months does seem like a triumphal march to him but then people seldom see the halting and painful steps by which the most insignificant success is achieved As mister Anagnos was the head of a great institution what he said had much more effect than the facts in Miss Sullivan s account on which he based his statements The newspapers caught mister Anagnos s spirit and exaggerated a hundred fold In a year after she first went to Helen Keller Miss Sullivan found herself and her pupil the centre of a stupendous fiction Then the educators all over the world said their say and for the most part did not help matters There grew up a mass of controversial matter which it is amusing to read now Teachers of the deaf proved a priori that what Miss Sullivan had done could not be and some discredit was reflected on her statements because they were surrounded by the vague eloquence of mister Anagnos Thus the story of Helen Keller incredible when told with moderation had the misfortune to be heralded by exaggerated announcements and naturally met either an ignorant credulity or an incredulous hostility In November eighteen eighty eight another report of the Perkins Institution appeared with a second paper by Miss Sullivan and then nothing official was published until November eighteen ninety one when mister Anagnos issued the last Perkins Institution report containing anything about Helen Keller For this report Miss Sullivan wrote the fullest and largest account she has ever written and in this report appeared the Frost King which is discussed fully in a later chapter Then the controversy waxed fiercer than ever Finding that other people seemed to know so much more about Helen Keller than she did Miss Sullivan kept silent and has been silent for ten years except for her paper in the first volta Bureau Souvenir of Helen Keller and the paper which at doctor Bell s request she prepared in eighteen ninety four for the meeting at Chautauqua of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf When doctor Bell and others tell her what is certainly true from an impersonal point of view that she owes it to the cause of education to write what she knows she answers very properly that she owes all her time and all her energies to her pupil Although Miss Sullivan is still rather amused than distressed when some one even one of her friends makes mistakes in published articles about her and Miss Keller still she sees that Miss Keller s book should include all the information that the teacher could at present furnish So she consented to the publication of extracts from letters which she wrote during the first year of her work with her pupil These letters were written to missus Sophia C Hopkins the only person to whom Miss Sullivan ever wrote freely missus Hopkins has been a matron at the Perkins Institution for twenty years and during the time that Miss Sullivan was a pupil there she was like a mother to her In these letters we have an almost weekly record of Miss Sullivan s work Some of the details she had forgotten as she grew more and more to generalize Many people have thought that any attempt to find the principles in her method would be nothing but a later theory superimposed on Miss Sullivan s work But it is evident that in these letters she was making a clear analysis of what she was doing She was her own critic and in spite of her later declaration made with her modest carelessness that she followed no particular method she was very clearly learning from her task and phrasing at the time principles of education of unique value not only in the teaching of the deaf but in the teaching of all children The extracts from her letters and reports form an important contribution to pedagogy and more than justify the opinion of doctor Daniel C Gilman who wrote in eighteen ninety three when he was President of Johns Hopkins University I have just read your most interesting account of the various steps you have taken in the education of your wonderful pupil and I hope you will allow me to express my admiration for the wisdom that has guided your methods and the affection which has inspired your labours Miss Anne Mansfield Sullivan was born at Springfield Massachusetts Very early in her life she became almost totally blind and she entered the Perkins Institution October seven eighteen eighty when she was fourteen years old Later her sight was partially restored mister Anagnos says in his report of eighteen eighty seven She was obliged to begin her education at the lowest and most elementary point but she showed from the very start that she had in herself the force and capacity which insure success She has finally reached the goal for which she strove so bravely The golden words that doctor Howe uttered and the example that he left passed into her thoughts and heart and helped her on the road to usefulness and now she stands by his side as his worthy successor in one of the most cherished branches of his work Miss Sullivan s talents are of the highest order In eighteen eighty six she graduated from the Perkins Institution When Captain Keller applied to the director for a teacher mister Anagnos recommended her The only time she had to prepare herself for the work with her pupil was from August eighteen eighty six when Captain Keller wrote to February eighteen eighty seven During this time she read doctor Howe s reports She was further aided by the fact that during the six years of her school life she had lived in the house with Laura Bridgman It was doctor Howe who by his work with Laura Bridgman made Miss Sullivan s work possible but it was Miss Sullivan who discovered the way to teach language to the deaf blind It must be remembered that Miss Sullivan had to solve her problems unaided by previous experience or the assistance of any other teacher During the first year of her work with Helen Keller in which she taught her pupil language they were in Tuscumbia and when they came North and visited the Perkins Institution Helen Keller was never a regular student there or subject to the discipline of the Institution The impression that Miss Sullivan educated Helen Keller under the direction of mister Anagnos is erroneous In the three years during which at various times Miss Keller and Miss Sullivan were guests of the Perkins Institution the teachers there did not help Miss Sullivan and mister Anagnos did not even use the manual alphabet with facility as a means of communication mister Anagnos wrote in the report of the Perkins Institution dated November twenty seven eighteen eighty eight At my urgent request Helen accompanied by her mother and her teacher came to the North in the last week of May and spent several months with us as our guests We gladly allowed her to use freely our library of embossed books our collection of stuffed animals sea shells models of flowers and plants and the rest of our apparatus for instructing the blind through the sense of touch I do not doubt that she derived from them much pleasure and not a little profit But whether Helen stays at home or makes visits in other parts of the country her education is always under the immediate direction and exclusive control of her teacher No one interferes with Miss Sullivan s plans or shares in her tasks She has been allowed entire freedom in the choice of means and methods for carrying on her great work and as we can judge by the results she has made a most judicious and discreet use of this privilege What the little pupil has thus far accomplished is widely known and her wonderful attainments command general admiration but only those who are familiar with the particulars of the grand achievement know that the credit is largely due to the intelligence wisdom sagacity unremitting perseverance and unbending will of the instructress who rescued the child from the depths of everlasting night and stillness and watched over the different phases of her mental and moral development with maternal solicitude and enthusiastic devotion Here follow in order Miss Sullivan s letters and the most important passages from the reports I have omitted from each succeeding report what has already been explained and does not need to be repeated For the ease of the reader I have with Miss Sullivan s consent made the extracts run together continuously and supplied words of connection and the resulting necessary changes in syntax and Miss Sullivan has made slight changes in the phrasing of her reports and also of her letters which were carelessly written I have also italicized a few important passages Some of her opinions Miss Sullivan would like to enlarge and revise That remains for her to do at another time At present we have here the fullest record that has been published The first letter is dated March six eighteen eighty seven three days after her arrival in Tuscumbia It was six point thirty when I reached Tuscumbia I found missus Keller and mister James Keller waiting for me They said somebody had met every train for two days The drive from the station to the house a distance of one mile was very lovely and restful I was surprised to find missus Keller a very young looking woman not much older than myself I should think Captain Keller met us in the yard and gave me a cheery welcome and a hearty handshake My first question was Where is Helen I tried with all my might to control the eagerness that made me tremble so that I could hardly walk As we approached the house I saw a child standing in the doorway and Captain Keller said There she is She has known all day that some one was expected and she has been wild ever since her mother went to the station for you I had scarcely put my foot on the steps when she rushed toward me with such force that she would have thrown me backward if Captain Keller had not been behind me She felt my face and dress and my bag which she took out of my hand and tried to open It did not open easily and she felt carefully to see if there was a keyhole Finding that there was she turned to me making the sign of turning a key and pointing to the bag Her mother interfered at this point and showed Helen by signs that she must not touch the bag Her face flushed and when her mother attempted to take the bag from her she grew very angry I attracted her attention by showing her my watch and letting her hold it in her hand Instantly the tempest subsided and we went upstairs together Here I opened the bag and she went through it eagerly probably expecting to find something to eat Friends had probably brought her candy in their bags and she expected to find some in mine I made her understand by pointing to a trunk in the hall and to myself and nodding my head that I had a trunk and then made the sign that she had used for eating and nodded again She understood in a flash and ran downstairs to tell her mother by means of emphatic signs that there was some candy in a trunk for her She returned in a few minutes and helped me put away my things It was too comical to see her put on my bonnet and cock her head first on one side then on the other and look in the mirror just as if she could see Somehow I had expected to see a pale delicate child I suppose I got the idea from doctor Howe s description of Laura Bridgman when she came to the Institution But there s nothing pale or delicate about Helen She is large strong and ruddy and as unrestrained in her movements as a young colt She has none of those nervous habits that are so noticeable and so distressing in blind children Her body is well formed and vigorous and missus Keller says she has not been ill a day since the illness that deprived her of her sight and hearing She has a fine head and it is set on her shoulders just right Her face is hard to describe It is intelligent but lacks mobility or soul or something Her mouth is large and finely shaped You see at a glance that she is blind One eye is larger than the other and protrudes noticeably She rarely smiles indeed I have seen her smile only once or twice since I came She is unresponsive and even impatient of caresses from any one except her mother She is very quick tempered and wilful and nobody except her brother James has attempted to control her The greatest problem I shall have to solve is how to discipline and control her without breaking her spirit I shall go rather slowly at first and try to win her love I shall not attempt to conquer her by force alone but I shall insist on reasonable obedience from the start One thing that impresses everybody is Helen s tireless activity She is never still a moment She is here there and everywhere Her hands are in everything but nothing holds her attention for long Dear child her restless spirit gropes in the dark Her untaught unsatisfied hands destroy whatever they touch because they do not know what else to do with things She helped me unpack my trunk when it came and was delighted when she found the doll the little girls sent her I thought it a good opportunity to teach her her first word I spelled d o l l slowly in her hand and pointed to the doll and nodded my head which seems to be her sign for possession Whenever anybody gives her anything she points to it then to herself and nods her head She looked puzzled and felt my hand and I repeated the letters She imitated them very well and pointed to the doll Then I took the doll meaning to give it back to her when she had made the letters but she thought I meant to take it from her and in an instant she was in a temper and tried to seize the doll I shook my head and tried to form the letters with her fingers but she got more and more angry I forced her into a chair and held her there until I was nearly exhausted Then it occurred to me that it was useless to continue the struggle I must do something to turn the current of her thoughts I let her go but refused to give up the doll I went downstairs and got some cake she is very fond of sweets I showed Helen the cake and spelled c a k e in her hand holding the cake toward her Of course she wanted it and tried to take it but I spelled the word again and patted her hand She made the letters rapidly and I gave her the cake which she ate in a great hurry thinking I suppose that I might take it from her Then I showed her the doll and spelled the word again holding the doll toward her as I held the cake She made the letters d o l and I made the other l and gave her the doll She ran downstairs with it and could not be induced to return to my room all day Yesterday I gave her a sewing card to do I made the first row of vertical lines and let her feel it and notice that there were several rows of little holes She began to work delightedly and finished the card in a few minutes and did it very neatly indeed I thought I would try another word so I spelled c a r d She made the c a then stopped and thought and making the sign for eating and pointing downward she pushed me toward the door meaning that I must go downstairs for some cake The two letters c a you see had reminded her of Fridays lesson not that she had any idea that cake was the name of the thing but it was simply a matter of association I suppose I finished the word c a k e and obeyed her command She was delighted Then I spelled d o l l and began to hunt for it She follows with her hands every motion you make and she knew that I was looking for the doll She pointed down meaning that the doll was downstairs I made the signs that she had used when she wished me to go for the cake and pushed her toward the door She started forward then hesitated a moment evidently debating within herself whether she would go or not She decided to send me instead I shook my head and spelled d o l l more emphatically and opened the door for her but she obstinately refused to obey She had not finished the cake she was eating and I took it away indicating that if she brought the doll I would give her back the cake She stood perfectly still for one long moment her face crimson then her desire for the cake triumphed and she ran downstairs and brought the doll and of course I gave her the cake but could not persuade her to enter the room again She was very troublesome when I began to write this morning She kept coming up behind me and putting her hand on the paper and into the ink bottle These blots are her handiwork Finally I remembered the kindergarten beads and set her to work stringing them First I put on two wooden beads and one glass bead then made her feel of the string and the two boxes of beads She nodded and began at once to fill the string with wooden beads I shook my head and took them all off and made her feel of the two wooden beads and the one glass bead She examined them thoughtfully and began again This time she put on the glass bead first and the two wooden ones next I took them off and showed her that the two wooden ones must go on first then the glass bead She had no further trouble and filled the string quickly too quickly in fact She tied the ends together when she had finished the string and put the beads round her neck I did not make the knot large enough in the next string and the beads came off as fast as she put them on but she solved the difficulty herself by putting the string through a bead and tying it I thought this very clever She amused herself with the beads until dinner time bringing the strings to me now and then for my approval My eyes are very much inflamed I know this letter is very carelessly written I had a lot to say and couldn t stop to think how to express things neatly Please do not show my letter to any one If you want to you may read it to my friends Monday P M I had a battle royal with Helen this morning Although I try very hard not to force issues I find it very difficult to avoid them Helen s table manners are appalling She puts her hands in our plates and helps herself and when the dishes are passed she grabs them and takes out whatever she wants This morning I would not let her put her hand in my plate She persisted and a contest of wills followed Naturally the family was much disturbed and left the room I locked the dining room door and proceeded to eat my breakfast though the food almost choked me Helen was lying on the floor kicking and screaming and trying to pull my chair from under me She kept this up for half an hour then she got up to see what I was doing I let her see that I was eating but did not let her put her hand in the plate She pinched me and I slapped her every time she did it Then she went all round the table to see who was there and finding no one but me she seemed bewildered After a few minutes she came back to her place and began to eat her breakfast with her fingers I gave her a spoon which she threw on the floor I forced her out of the chair and made her pick it up Finally I succeeded in getting her back in her chair again and held the spoon in her hand compelling her to take up the food with it and put it in her mouth In a few minutes she yielded and finished her breakfast peaceably Then we had another tussle over folding her napkin When she had finished she threw it on the floor and ran toward the door Finding it locked she began to kick and scream all over again It was another hour before I succeeded in getting her napkin folded Then I let her out into the warm sunshine and went up to my room and threw myself on the bed exhausted I had a good cry and felt better I suppose I shall have many such battles with the little woman before she learns the only two essential things I can teach her obedience and love Good by dear Don t worry I ll do my best and leave the rest to whatever power manages that which we cannot I like missus Keller very much Tuscumbia Alabama March eleven eighteen eighty seven Since I wrote you Helen and I have gone to live all by ourselves in a little garden house about a quarter of a mile from her home only a short distance from Ivy Green the Keller homestead I very soon made up my mind that I could do nothing with Helen in the midst of the family who have always allowed her to do exactly as she pleased She has tyrannized over everybody her mother her father the servants the little darkies who play with her and nobody had ever seriously disputed her will except occasionally her brother James until I came and like all tyrants she holds tenaciously to her divine right to do as she pleases If she ever failed to get what she wanted it was because of her inability to make the vassals of her household understand what it was Every thwarted desire was the signal for a passionate outburst and as she grew older and stronger these tempests became more violent As I began to teach her I was beset by many difficulties She wouldn t yield a point without contesting it to the bitter end I couldn t coax her or compromise with her To get her to do the simplest thing such as combing her hair or washing her hands or buttoning her boots it was necessary to use force and of course a distressing scene followed The family naturally felt inclined to interfere especially her father who cannot bear to see her cry So they were all willing to give in for the sake of peace Besides her past experiences and associations were all against me I saw clearly that it was useless to try to teach her language or anything else until she learned to obey me I have thought about it a great deal and the more I think the more certain I am that obedience is the gateway through which knowledge yes and love too enter the mind of the child As I wrote you I meant to go slowly at first I had an idea that I could win the love and confidence of my little pupil by the same means that I should use if she could see and hear But I soon found that I was cut off from all the usual approaches to the child s heart She accepted everything I did for her as a matter of course and refused to be caressed and there was no way of appealing to her affection or sympathy or childish love of approbation She would or she wouldn t and there was an end of it Thus it is we study plan and prepare ourselves for a task and when the hour for action arrives we find that the system we have followed with such labour and pride does not fit the occasion and then there s nothing for us to do but rely on something within us some innate capacity for knowing and doing which we did not know we possessed until the hour of our great need brought it to light I had a good frank talk with missus Keller and explained to her how difficult it was going to be to do anything with Helen under the existing circumstances I told her that in my opinion the child ought to be separated from the family for a few weeks at least that she must learn to depend on and obey me before I could make any headway After a long time missus Keller said that she would think the matter over and see what Captain Keller thought of sending Helen away with me Captain Keller fell in with the scheme most readily and suggested that the little garden house at the old place be got ready for us He said that Helen might recognize the place as she had often been there but she would have no idea of her surroundings and they could come every day to see that all was going well with the understanding of course that she was to know nothing of their visits I hurried the preparations for our departure as much as possible and here we are The little house is a genuine bit of paradise It consists of one large square room with a great fireplace a spacious bay window and a small room where our servant a little negro boy sleeps There is a piazza in front covered with vines that grow so luxuriantly that you have to part them to see the garden beyond Our meals are brought from the house and we usually eat on the piazza The little negro boy takes care of the fire when we need one so I can give my whole attention to Helen She was greatly excited at first and kicked and screamed herself into a sort of stupor but when supper was brought she ate heartily and seemed brighter although she refused to let me touch her She devoted herself to her dolls the first evening and when it was bedtime she undressed very quietly but when she felt me get into bed with her she jumped out on the other side and nothing that I could do would induce her to get in again But I was afraid she would take cold and I insisted that she must go to bed We had a terrific tussle I can tell you The struggle lasted for nearly two hours I never saw such strength and endurance in a child But fortunately for us both I am a little stronger and quite as obstinate when I set out I finally succeeded in getting her on the bed and covered her up and she lay curled up as near the edge of the bed as possible The next morning she was very docile but evidently homesick She kept going to the door as if she expected some one and every now and then she would touch her cheek which is her sign for her mother and shake her head sadly She played with her dolls more than usual and would have nothing to do with me It is amusing and pathetic to see Helen with her dolls I don t think she has any special tenderness for them I have never seen her caress them but she dresses and undresses them many times during the day and handles them exactly as she has seen her mother and the nurse handle her baby sister This morning Nancy her favourite doll seemed to have some difficulty about swallowing the milk that was being administered to her in large spoonfuls for Helen suddenly put down the cup and began to slap her on the back and turn her over on her knees trotting her gently and patting her softly all the time This lasted for several minutes then this mood passed and Nancy was thrown ruthlessly on the floor and pushed to one side while a large pink cheeked fuzzy haired member of the family received the little mother s undivided attention Helen knows several words now but has no idea how to use them or that everything has a name I think however she will learn quickly enough by and by As I have said before she is wonderfully bright and active and as quick as lightning in her movements March thirteen eighteen eighty seven You will be glad to hear that my experiment is working out finely I have not had any trouble at all with Helen either yesterday or to day She has learned three new words and when I give her the objects the names of which she has learned she spells them unhesitatingly but she seems glad when the lesson is over We had a good frolic this morning out in the garden Helen evidently knew where she was as soon as she touched the boxwood hedges and made many signs which I did not understand No doubt they were signs for the different members of the family at Ivy Green I have just heard something that surprised me very much It seems that mister Anagnos had heard of Helen before he received Captain Keller s letter last summer mister Wilson a teacher at Florence and a friend of the Kellers studied at Harvard the summer before and went to the Perkins Institution to learn if anything could be done for his friend s child He saw a gentleman whom he presumed to be the director and told him about Helen He says the gentleman was not particularly interested but said he would see if anything could be done Doesn t it seem strange that mister Anagnos never referred to this interview March twenty eighteen eighty seven My heart is singing for joy this morning A miracle has happened The light of understanding has shone upon my little pupil s mind and behold all things are changed The wild little creature of two weeks ago has been transformed into a gentle child She is sitting by me as I write her face serene and happy crocheting a long red chain of Scotch wool She learned the stitch this week and is very proud of the achievement When she succeeded in making a chain that would reach across the room she patted herself on the arm and put the first work of her hands lovingly against her cheek She lets me kiss her now and when she is in a particularly gentle mood she will sit in my lap for a minute or two but she does not return my caresses The great step the step that counts has been taken The little savage has learned her first lesson in obedience and finds the yoke easy It now remains my pleasant task to direct and mould the beautiful intelligence that is beginning to stir in the child soul Already people remark the change in Helen Her father looks in at us morning and evening as he goes to and from his office and sees her contentedly stringing her beads or making horizontal lines on her sewing card and exclaims How quiet she is When I came her movements were so insistent that one always felt there was something unnatural and almost weird about her I have noticed also that she eats much less a fact which troubles her father so much that he is anxious to get her home He says she is homesick I don t agree with him but I suppose we shall have to leave our little bower very soon Helen has learned several nouns this week M u g and m i l k have given her more trouble than other words When she spells milk she points to the mug and when she spells mug she makes the sign for pouring or drinking which shows that she has confused the words She has no idea yet that everything has a name Yesterday I had the little negro boy come in when Helen was having her lesson and learn the letters too This pleased her very much and stimulated her ambition to excel Percy She was delighted if he made a mistake and made him form the letter over several times When he succeeded in forming it to suit her she patted him on his woolly head so vigorously that I thought some of his slips were intentional One day this week Captain Keller brought Belle a setter of which he is very proud to see us He wondered if Helen would recognize her old playmate Helen was giving Nancy a bath and didn t notice the dog at first She usually feels the softest step and throws out her arms to ascertain if any one is near her Belle didn t seem very anxious to attract her attention I imagine she has been rather roughly handled sometimes by her little mistress The dog hadn t been in the room more than half a minute however before Helen began to sniff and dumped the doll into the wash bowl and felt about the room She stumbled upon Belle who was crouching near the window where Captain Keller was standing It was evident that she recognized the dog for she put her arms round her neck and squeezed her Then Helen sat down by her and began to manipulate her claws We couldn t think for a second what she was doing but when we saw her make the letters d o l l on her own fingers we knew that she was trying to teach Belle to spell March twenty eight eighteen eighty seven Helen and I came home yesterday I am sorry they wouldn t let us stay another week but I think I have made the most I could of the opportunities that were mine the past two weeks and I don t expect that I shall have any serious trouble with Helen in the future The back of the greatest obstacle in the path of progress is broken I think no and yes conveyed by a shake or a nod of my head have become facts as apparent to her as hot and cold or as the difference between pain and pleasure And I don t intend that the lesson she has learned at the cost of so much pain and trouble shall be unlearned I shall stand between her and the over indulgence of her parents I have told Captain and missus Keller that they must not interfere with me in any way I have done my best to make them see the terrible injustice to Helen of allowing her to have her way in everything and I have pointed out that the processes of teaching the child that everything cannot be as he wills it are apt to be painful both to him and to his teacher They have promised to let me have a free hand and help me as much as possible The improvement they cannot help seeing in their child has given them more confidence in me Of course it is hard for them I realize that it hurts to see their afflicted little child punished and made to do things against her will Only a few hours after my talk with Captain and missus Keller and they had agreed to everything Helen took a notion that she wouldn t use her napkin at table I think she wanted to see what would happen I attempted several times to put the napkin round her neck but each time she tore it off and threw it on the floor and finally began to kick the table I took her plate away and started to take her out of the room Her father objected and said that no child of his should be deprived of his food on any account Helen didn t come up to my room after supper and I didn t see her again until breakfast time She was at her place when I came down She had put the napkin under her chin instead of pinning it at the back as was her custom She called my attention to the new arrangement and when I did not object she seemed pleased and patted herself When she left the dining room she took my hand and patted it I wondered if she was trying to make up I thought I would try the effect of a little belated discipline I went back to the dining room and got a napkin When Helen came upstairs for her lesson I arranged the objects on the table as usual except that the cake which I always give her in bits as a reward when she spells a word quickly and correctly was not there She noticed this at once and made the sign for it I showed her the napkin and pinned it round her neck then tore it off and threw it on the floor and shook my head I repeated this performance several times I think she understood perfectly well for she slapped her hand two or three times and shook her head We began the lesson as usual I gave her an object and she spelled the name she knows twelve now After spelling half the words she stopped suddenly as if a thought had flashed into her mind and felt for the napkin She pinned it round her neck and made the sign for cake it didn t occur to her to spell the word you see I took this for a promise that if I gave her some cake she would be a good girl I gave her a larger piece than usual and she chuckled and patted herself April three eighteen eighty seven We almost live in the garden where everything is growing and blooming and glowing After breakfast we go out and watch the men at work Helen loves to dig and play in the dirt like any other child This morning she planted her doll and showed me that she expected her to grow as tall as I You must see that she is very bright but you have no idea how cunning she is At ten we come in and string beads for a few minutes She can make a great many combinations now and often invents new ones herself Then I let her decide whether she will sew or knit or crochet She learned to knit very quickly and is making a wash cloth for her mother Last week she made her doll an apron and it was done as well as any child of her age could do it But I am always glad when this work is over for the day Sewing and crocheting are inventions of the devil I think I d rather break stones on the king s highway than hem a handkerchief At eleven we have gymnastics She knows all the free hand movements and the Anvil Chorus with the dumb bells Her father says he is going to fit up a gymnasium for her in the pump house but we both like a good romp better than set exercises The hour from twelve to one is devoted to the learning of new words BUT YOU MUSTN T THINK THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I SPELL TO HELEN FOR I SPELL IN HER HAND EVERYTHING WE DO ALL DAY LONG ALTHOUGH SHE HAS NO IDEA AS YET WHAT THE SPELLING MEANS After dinner I rest for an hour and Helen plays with her dolls or frolics in the yard with the little darkies who were her constant companions before I came Later I join them and we make the rounds of the outhouses We visit the horses and mules in their stalls and hunt for eggs and feed the turkeys Often when the weather is fine we drive from four to six or go to see her aunt at Ivy Green or her cousins in the town Helen s instincts are decidedly social she likes to have people about her and to visit her friends partly I think because they always have things she likes to eat After supper we go to my room and do all sorts of things until eight when I undress the little woman and put her to bed She sleeps with me now missus Keller wanted to get a nurse for her but I concluded I d rather be her nurse than look after a stupid lazy negress Besides I like to have Helen depend on me for everything AND I FIND IT MUCH EASIER TO TEACH HER THINGS AT ODD MOMENTS THAN AT SET TIMES On March thirty first I found that Helen knew eighteen nouns and three verbs Here is a list of the words Those with a cross after them are words she asked for herself DOLL MUG PIN KEY DOG HAT CUP BOX WATER MILK CANDY EYE X FINGER X TOE X HEAD X CAKE BABY MOTHER SIT STAND WALK On April first she learned the nouns KNIFE FORK SPOON SAUCER TEA PAPA BED and the verb RUN April five eighteen eighty seven I must write you a line this morning because something very important has happened Helen has taken the second great step in her education She has learned that EVERYTHING HAS A NAME AND THAT THE MANUAL ALPHABET IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING SHE WANTS TO KNOW In a previous letter I think I wrote you that mug and milk had given Helen more trouble than all the rest She confused the nouns with the verb drink She didn t know the word for drink but went through the pantomime of drinking whenever she spelled mug or milk This morning while she was washing she wanted to know the name for water When she wants to know the name of anything she points to it and pats my hand I spelled w a t e r and thought no more about it until after breakfast Then it occurred to me that with the help of this new word I might succeed in straightening out the mug milk difficulty We went out to the pump house and I made Helen hold her mug under the spout while I pumped As the cold water gushed forth filling the mug I spelled w a t e r in Helen s free hand The word coming so close upon the sensation of cold water rushing over her hand seemed to startle her She dropped the mug and stood as one transfixed A new light came into her face She spelled water several times Then she dropped on the ground and asked for its name and pointed to the pump and the trellis and suddenly turning round she asked for my name I spelled Teacher Just then the nurse brought Helen s little sister into the pump house and Helen spelled baby and pointed to the nurse All the way back to the house she was highly excited and learned the name of every object she touched so that in a few hours she had adDED THIRTY NEW WORDS TO HER VOCABULARY HERE ARE SOME OF THEM DOOR OPEN SHUT GIVE GO COME and a great many more P S I didn t finish my letter in time to get it posted last night so I shall add a line Helen got up this morning like a radiant fairy She has flitted from object to object asking the name of everything and kissing me for very gladness Last night when I got in bed she stole into my arms of her own accord and kissed me for the first time and I thought my heart would burst so full was it of joy April ten eighteen eighty seven I see an improvement in Helen day to day almost from hour to hour Everything must have a name now Wherever we go she asks eagerly for the names of things she has not learned at home She is anxious for her friends to spell and eager to teach the letters to every one she meets She drops the signs and pantomime she used before as soon as she has words to supply their place and the acquirement of a new word affords her the liveliest pleasure And we notice that her face grows more expressive each day I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO TRY TO HAVE REGULAR LESSONS FOR THE PRESENT I AM GOING TO TREAT HELEN EXACTLY LIKE A TWO YEAR OLD CHILD IT OCCURRED TO ME THE OTHER DAY THAT IT IS ABSURD TO REQUIRE A CHILD TO COME TO A CERTAIN PLACE AT A CERTAIN TIME AND RECITE CERTAIN LESSONS WHEN HE HAS NOT YET ACQUIRED A WORKING VOCABULARY I sent Helen away and sat down to think I asked myself How does a normal child learn language The answer was simple By imitation The child comes into the world with the ability to learn and he learns of himself provided he is supplied with sufficient outward stimulus He sees people do things and he tries to do them He hears others speak and he tried to speak BUT LONG BEFORE HE UTTERS HIS FIRST WORD HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS SAID TO HIM I have been observing Helen s little cousin lately She is about fifteen months old and already understands a great deal In response to questions she points out prettily her nose mouth eye chin cheek ear If I say Where is baby s other ear she points it out correctly If I hand her a flower and say Give it to mamma she takes it to her mother If I say Where is the little rogue she hides behind her mother s chair or covers her face with her hands and peeps out at me with an expression of genuine roguishness She obeys many commands like these Come Kiss Go to papa Shut the door Give me the biscuit But I have not heard her try to say any of these words although they have been repeated hundreds of times in her hearing and it is perfectly evident that she understands them These observations have given me a clue to the method to be followed in teaching Helen language I SHALL TALK INTO HER HAND AS WE TALK INTO THE BABY S EARS I shall assume that she has the normal child s capacity of assimilation and imitation I SHALL USE COMPLETE SENTENCES IN TALKING TO HER and fill out the meaning with gestures and her descriptive signs when necessity requires it but I shall not try to keep her mind fixed on any one thing I shall do all I can to interest and stimulate it and wait for results April twenty four eighteen eighty seven The new scheme works splendidly Helen knows the meaning of more than a hundred words now and learns new ones daily without the slightest suspicion that she is performing a most difficult feat She learns because she can t help it just as the bird learns to fly But don t imagine that she talks fluently Like her baby cousin she expresses whole sentences by single words Milk with a gesture means Give me more milk Mother accompanied by an inquiring look means Were is mother Go means I want to go out But when I spell into her hand Give me some bread she hands me the bread or if I say Get your hat and we will go to walk she obeys instantly The two words hat and walk would have the same effect BUT THE WHOLE SENTENCE REPEATED MANY TIMES DURING THE DAY MUST IN TIME IMPRESS ITSELF UPON THE BRAIN AND BY AND BY SHE WILL USE IT HERSELF We play a little game which I find most useful in developing the intellect and which incidentally answers the purpose of a language lesson It is an adaptation of hide the thimble I hide something a ball or a spool and we hunt for it When we first played this game two or three days ago she showed no ingenuity at all in finding the object She looked in places where it would have been impossible to put the ball or the spool For instance when I hid the ball she looked under her writing board Again when I hid the spool she looked for it in a little box not more than an inch long and she very soon gave up the search Now I can keep up her interest in the game for an hour or longer and she shows much more intelligence and often great ingenuity in the search This morning I hid a cracker She looked everywhere she could think of without success and was evidently in despair when suddenly a thought struck her and she came running to me and made me open my mouth very wide while she gave it a thorough investigation Finding no trace of the cracker there she pointed to my stomach and spelled eat meaning Did you eat it Friday we went down town and met a gentleman who gave Helen some candy which she ate except one small piece which she put in her apron pocket When we reached home she found her mother and of her own accord said Give baby candy missus Keller spelled No baby eat no Helen went to the cradle and felt of Mildred s mouth and pointed to her own teeth missus Keller spelled teeth Helen shook her head and spelled Baby teeth no baby eat no meaning of course Baby cannot eat because she has no teeth May eight eighteen eighty seven No I don t want any more kindergarten materials I used my little stock of beads cards and straws at first because I didn t know what else to do but the need for them is past for the present at any rate I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education They seem to me to be built up on the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think Whereas if the child is left to himself he will think more and better if less showily Let him go and come freely let him touch real things and combine his impressions for himself instead of sitting indoors at a little round table while a sweet voiced teacher suggests that he build a stone wall with his wooden blocks or make a rainbow out of strips of coloured paper or plant straw trees in bead flower pots Such teaching fills the mind with artificial associations that must be got rid of before the child can develop independent ideas out of actual experiences Helen is learning adjectives and adverbs as easily as she learned nouns The idea always precedes the word She had signs for SMALL and LARGE long before I came to her If she wanted a small object and was given a large one she would shake her head and take up a tiny bit of the skin of one hand between the thumb and finger of the other If she wanted to indicate something large she spread the fingers of both hands as wide as she could and brought them together as if to clasp a big ball The other day I substituted the words SMALL and LARGE for these signs and she at once adopted the words and discarded the signs I can now tell her to bring me a large book or a small plate to go upstairs slowly to run fast and to walk quickly This morning she used the conjunction AND for the first time I told her to shut the door and she added and lock She came tearing upstairs a few minutes ago in a state of great excitement I couldn t make out at first what it was all about She kept spelling dog baby and pointing to her five fingers one after another and sucking them My first thought was one of the dogs has hurt Mildred but Helen s beaming face set my fears at rest Nothing would do but I must go somewhere with her to see something She led the way to the pump house and there in the corner was one of the setters with five dear little pups I taught her the word puppy and drew her hand over them all while they sucked and spelled puppies She was much interested in the feeding process and spelled mother dog and baby several times Helen noticed that the puppies eyes were closed and she said Eyes shut Sleep no meaning The eyes are shut but the puppies are not asleep She screamed with glee when the little things squealed and squirmed in their efforts to get back to their mother and spelled Baby eat large I suppose her idea was Baby eats much She pointed to each puppy one after another and to her five fingers and I taught her the word FIVE Then she held up one finger and said baby I knew she was thinking of Mildred and I spelled One baby and five puppies After she had played with them a little while the thought occurred to her that the puppies must have special names like people and she asked for the name of each pup I told her to ask her father and she said No mother She evidently thought mothers were more likely to know about babies of all sorts She noticed that one of the puppies was much smaller than the others and she spelled small making the sign at the same time and I said very small She evidently understood that VERY was the name of the new thing that had come into her head for all the way back to the house she used the word VERY correctly One stone was small another was very small When she touched her little sister she said Baby small Puppy very small Soon after she began to vary her steps from large to small and little mincing steps were very small She is going through the house now applying the new words to all kinds of objects Since I have abandoned the idea of regular lessons I find that Helen learns much faster I am convinced that the time spent by the teacher in digging out of the child what she has put into him for the sake of satisfying herself that it has taken root is so much time thrown away IT S MUCH BETTER I THINK TO ASSUME THAT THE CHILD IS DOING HIS PART AND THAT THE SEED YOU HAVE SOWN WILL BEAR FRUIT IN DUE TIME It s only fair to the child anyhow and it saves you much unnecessary trouble May sixteen eighteen eighty seven We have begun to take long walks every morning immediately after breakfast The weather is fine and the air is full of the scent of strawberries Our objective point is Keller s Landing on the Tennessee about two miles distant We never know how we get there or where we are at a given moment but that only adds to our enjoyment especially when everything is new and strange Indeed I feel as if I had never seen anything until now Helen finds so much to ask about along the way We chase butterflies and sometimes catch one Then we sit down under a tree or in the shade of a bush and talk about it Afterwards if it has survived the lesson we let it go but usually its life and beauty are sacrificed on the altar of learning though in another sense it lives forever for has it not been transformed into living thoughts It is wonderful how words generate ideas Every new word Helen learns seems to carry with it necessity for many more Her mind grows through its ceaseless activity Keller s Landing was used during the war to land troops but has long since gone to pieces and is overgrown with moss and weeds The solitude of the place sets one dreaming Near the landing there is a beautiful little spring which Helen calls squirrel cup because I told her the squirrels came there to drink She has felt dead squirrels and rabbits and other wild animals and is anxious to see a walk squirrel which interpreted means I think a live squirrel We go home about dinner time usually and Helen is eager to tell her mother everything she has seen THIS DESIRE TO REPEAT WHAT HAS BEEN TOLD HER SHOWS A MARKED ADVANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER INTELLECT AND IS AN INVALUABLE STIMULUS TO THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGE I ASK ALL HER FRIENDS TO ENCOURAGE HER TO TELL THEM OF HER DOINGS AND TO MANIFEST AS MUCH CURIOSITY AND PLEASURE IN HER LITTLE ADVENTURES AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN This gratifies the child s love of approbation and keeps up her interest in things This is the basis of real intercourse She makes many mistakes of course twists words and phrases puts the cart before the horse and gets herself into hopeless tangles of nouns and verbs but so does the hearing child I am sure these difficulties will take care of themselves The impulse to tell is the important thing I supply a word here and there sometimes a sentence and suggest something which she has omitted or forgotten Thus her vocabulary grows apace and the new words germinate and bring forth new ideas and they are the stuff out of which heaven and earth are made May twenty two eighteen eighty seven My work grows more absorbing and interesting every day Helen is a wonderful child so spontaneous and eager to learn She knows about three hundred words now and A GREAT MANY COMMON IDIOMS and it is not three months yet since she learned her first word It is a rare privilege to watch the birth growth and first feeble struggles of a living mind this privilege is mine and moreover it is given me to rouse and guide this bright intelligence If only I were better fitted for the great task I feel every day more and more inadequate My mind is full of ideas but I cannot get them into working shape You see my mind is undisciplined full of skips and jumps and here and there a lot of things huddled together in dark corners How I long to put it in order Oh if only there were some one to help me I need a teacher quite as much as Helen I know that the education of this child will be the distinguishing event of my life if I have the brains and perseverance to accomplish it I have made up my mind about one thing Helen must learn to use books indeed we must both learn to use them and that reminds me will you please ask mister Anagnos to get me Perez s and Sully s Psychologies I think I shall find them helpful We have reading lessons every day Usually we take one of the little Readers up in a big tree near the house and spend an hour or two finding the words Helen already knows WE MAKE A SORT OF GAME OF IT and try to see who can find the words most quickly Helen with her fingers or I with my eyes and she learns as many new words as I can explain with the help of those she knows When her fingers light upon words she knows she fairly screams with pleasure and hugs and kisses me for joy especially if she thinks she has me beaten It would astonish you to see how many words she learns in an hour in this pleasant manner Afterward I put the new words into little sentences in the frame and sometimes it is possible to tell a little story about a bee or a cat or a little boy in this way I can now tell her to go upstairs or down out of doors or into the house lock or unlock a door take or bring objects sit stand walk run lie creep roll or climb She is delighted with action words so it is no trouble at all to teach her verbs She is always ready for a lesson and the eagerness with which she absorbs ideas is very delightful She is as triumphant over the conquest of a sentence as a general who has captured the enemy s stronghold One of Helen s old habits that is strongest and hardest to correct is a tendency to break things If she finds anything in her way she flings it on the floor no matter what it is a glass a pitcher or even a lamp She has a great many dolls and every one of them has been broken in a fit of temper or ennui The other day a friend brought her a new doll from Memphis and I thought I would see if I could make Helen understand that she must not break it I made her go through the motion of knocking the doll s head on the table and spelled to her No no Helen is naughty Teacher is sad and let her feel the grieved expression on my face Then I made her caress the doll and kiss the hurt spot and hold it gently in her arms and I spelled to her Good Helen teacher is happy and let her feel the smile on my face She went through these motions several times mimicking every movement then she stood very still for a moment with a troubled look on her face which suddenly cleared and she spelled Good Helen and wreathed her face in a very large artificial smile Then she carried the doll upstairs and put it on the top shelf of the wardrobe and she has not touched it since Please give my kind regards to mister Anagnos and let him see my letter if you think best I hear there is a deaf and blind child being educated at the Baltimore Institution June two eighteen eighty seven The weather is scorching We need rain badly We are all troubled about Helen She is very nervous and excitable She is restless at night and has no appetite It is hard to know what to do with her The doctor says her mind is too active but how are we to keep her from thinking She begins to spell the minute she wakes up in the morning and continues all day long If I refuse to talk to her she spells into her own hand and apparently carries on the liveliest conversation with herself I gave her my braille slate to play with thinking that the mechanical pricking of holes in the paper would amuse her and rest her mind But what was my astonishment when I found that the little witch was writing letters I had no idea she knew what a letter was She has often gone with me to the post office to mail letters and I suppose I have repeated to her things I wrote to you She knew too that I sometimes write letters to blind girls on the slate but I didn t suppose that she had any clear idea what a letter was One day she brought me a sheet that she had punched full of holes and wanted to put it in an envelope and take it to the post office She said Frank letter I asked her what she had written to Frank She replied Much words Puppy motherdog five Baby cry Hot Helen walk no Sunfire bad Frank come Helen kiss Frank Strawberries very good Helen is almost as eager to read as she is to talk I find she grasps the import of whole sentences catching from the context the meaning of words she doesn t know and her eager questions indicate the outward reaching of her mind and its unusual powers The other night when I went to bed I found Helen sound asleep with a big book clasped tightly in her arms She had evidently been reading and fallen asleep When I asked her about it in the morning she said Book cry and completed her meaning by shaking and other signs of fear I taught her the word AFRAID and she said Helen is not afraid Book is afraid Book will sleep with girl I told her that the book wasn t afraid and must sleep in its case and that girl mustn t read in bed She looked very roguish and apparently understood that I saw through her ruse I am glad mister Anagnos thinks so highly of me as a teacher But genius and originality are words we should not use lightly If indeed they apply to me even remotely I do not see that I deserve any laudation on that account And right here I want to say something which is for your ears alone Something within me tells me that I shall succeed beyond my dreams Were it not for some circumstances that make such an idea highly improbable even absurd I should think Helen s education would surpass in interest and wonder doctor Howe s achievement I know that she has remarkable powers and I believe that I shall be able to develop and mould them I cannot tell how I know these things I had no idea a short time ago how to go to work I was feeling about in the dark but somehow I know now and I know that I know I cannot explain it but when difficulties arise I am not perplexed or doubtful I know how to meet them I seem to divine Helen s peculiar needs It is wonderful Already people are taking a deep interest in Helen No one can see her without being impressed She is no ordinary child and people s interest in her education will be no ordinary interest Therefore let us be exceedingly careful what we say and write about her I shall write freely to you and tell you everything on one condition It is this you must promise never to show my letters to any one My beautiful Helen shall not be transformed into a prodigy if I can help it June five eighteen eighty seven The heat makes Helen languid and quiet Indeed the Tophetic weather has reduced us all to a semi liquid state Yesterday Helen took off her clothes and sat in her skin all the afternoon When the sun got round to the window where she was sitting with her book she got up impatiently and shut the window But when the sun came in just the same she came over to me with a grieved look and spelled emphatically Sun is bad boy Sun must go to bed She is the dearest cutest little thing now and so loving One day when I wanted her to bring me some water she said Legs very tired Legs cry much She is much interested in some little chickens that are pecking their way into the world this morning I let her hold a shell in her hand and feel the chicken chip chip Her astonishment when she felt the tiny creature inside cannot be put in a letter The hen was very gentle and made no objection to our investigations Besides the chickens we have several other additions to the family two calves a colt and a penful of funny little pigs You would be amused to see me hold a squealing pig in my arms while Helen feels it all over and asks countless questions questions not easy to answer either After seeing the chicken come out of the egg she asked Did baby pig grow in egg Where are many shells Helen s head measures twenty and one half inches and mine measures twenty one and one half inches You see I m only one inch ahead June twelve eighteen eighty seven The weather continues hot Helen is about the same pale and thin but you mustn t think she is really ill I am sure the heat and not the natural beautiful activity of her mind is responsible for her condition Of course I shall not overtax her brain We are bothered a good deal by people who assume the responsibility of the world when God is neglectful They tell us that Helen is overdoing that her mind is too active these very people thought she had no mind at all a few months ago and suggest many absurd and impossible remedies But so far nobody seems to have thought of chloroforming her which is I think the only effective way of stopping the natural exercise of her faculties It s queer how ready people always are with advice in any real or imaginary emergency and no matter how many times experience has shown them to be wrong they continue to set forth their opinions as if they had received them from the Almighty I am teaching Helen the square hand letters as a sort of diversion It gives her something to do and keeps her quiet which I think is desirable while this enervating weather lasts She has a perfect mania for counting She has counted everything in the house and is now busy counting the words in her primer I hope it will not occur to her to count the hairs of her head If she could see and hear I suppose she would get rid of her superfluous energy in ways which would not perhaps tax her brain so much although I suspect that the ordinary child takes his play pretty seriously The little fellow who whirls his New York Flyer round the nursery making horseshoe curves undreamed of by less imaginative engineers is concentrating his whole soul on his toy locomotive She just came to say with a worried expression Girl not count very large many words I said No go and play with Nancy This suggestion didn t please her however for she replied No Nancy is very sick I asked what was the matter and she said Much many teeth do make Nancy sick Mildred is teething I happened to tell her the other day that the vine on the fence was a creeper She was greatly amused and began at once to find analogies between her movements and those of the plants They run creep hop and skip bend fall climb and swing but she tells me roguishly that she is walk plant Helen held some worsted for me last night while I wound it Afterward she began to swing round and round spelling to herself all the time Wind fast wind slow and apparently enjoying her conceit very much June fifteen eighteen eighty seven We had a glorious thunder tempest last night and it s much cooler to day We all feel refreshed as if we d had a shower bath Helen s as lively as a cricket She wanted to know if men were shooting in the sky when she felt the thunder and if the trees and flowers drank all the rain June nineteen eighteen eighty seven My little pupil continues to manifest the same eagerness to learn as at first Her every waking moment is spent in the endeavour to satisfy her innate desire for knowledge and her mind works so incessantly that we have feared for her health But her appetite which left her a few weeks ago has returned and her sleep seems more quiet and natural She will be seven years old the twenty seventh of this month Her height is four feet one inch and her head measures twenty and one half inches in circumference the line being drawn round the head so as to pass over the prominences of the parietal and frontal bones Above this line the head rises one and one fourth inches During our walks she keeps up a continual spelling and delights to accompany it with actions such as skipping hopping jumping running walking fast walking slow and the like When she drops stitches she says Helen wrong teacher will cry If she wants water she says Give Helen drink water She knows four hundred words besides numerous proper nouns In one lesson I taught her these words BEDSTEAD MATTRESS SHEET BLANKET COMFORTER SPREAD PILLOW The next day I found that she remembered all but spread The same day she had learned at different times the words hOUSE WEED DUST SWING MOLASSES FAST SLOW MAPLE SUGAR and COUNTER and she had not forgotten one of these last This will give you an idea of the retentive memory she possesses She can count to thirty very quickly and can write seven of the square hand letters and the words which can be made with them She seems to understand about writing letters and is impatient to write Frank letter She enjoys punching holes in paper with the stiletto and I supposed it was because she could examine the result of her work but we watched her one day and I was much surprised to find that she imagined she was writing a letter She would spell Eva a cousin of whom she is very fond with one hand then make believe to write it then spell sick in bed and write that She kept this up for nearly an hour She was or imagined she was putting on paper the things which had interested her When she had finished the letter she carried it to her mother and spelled Frank letter and gave it to her brother to take to the post office She had been with me to take letters to the post office She recognizes instantly a person whom she has once met and spells the name Unlike Laura Bridgman she is fond of gentlemen and we notice that she makes friends with a gentleman sooner than with a lady She is always ready to share whatever she has with those about her often keeping but very little for herself She is very fond of dress and of all kinds of finery and is very unhappy when she finds a hole in anything she is wearing She will insist on having her hair put in curl papers when she is so sleepy she can scarcely stand She discovered a hole in her boot the other morning and after breakfast she went to her father and spelled Helen new boot Simpson her brother buggy store man One can easily see her meaning July three eighteen eighty seven There was a great rumpus downstairs this morning I heard Helen screaming and ran down to see what was the matter I found her in a terrible passion I had hoped this would never happen again She has been so gentle and obedient the past two months I thought love had subdued the lion but it seems he was only sleeping At all events there she was tearing and scratching and biting Viney like some wild thing It seems Viney had attempted to take a glass which Helen was filling with stones fearing that she would break it Helen resisted and Viney tried to force it out of her hand and I suspect that she slapped the child or did something which caused this unusual outburst of temper When I took her hand she was trembling violently and began to cry I asked what was the matter and she spelled Viney bad and began to slap and kick her with renewed violence I held her hands firmly until she became more calm Later Helen came to my room looking very sad and wanted to kiss me I said I cannot kiss naughty girl She spelled Helen is good Viney is bad I said You struck Viney and kicked her and hurt her You were very naughty and I cannot kiss naughty girl She stood very still for a moment and it was evident from her face which was flushed and troubled that a struggle was going on in her mind Then she said Helen did does not love teacher Helen do love mother Mother will whip Viney I told her that she had better not talk about it any more but think She knew that I was much troubled and would have liked to stay near me but I thought it best for her to sit by herself At the dinner table she was greatly disturbed because I didn t eat and suggested that Cook make tea for teacher But I told her that my heart was sad and I didn t feel like eating She began to cry and sob and clung to me She was very much excited when we went upstairs so I tried to interest her in a curious insect called a stick bug It s the queerest thing I ever saw a little bundle of fagots fastened together in the middle I wouldn t believe it was alive until I saw it move Even then it looked more like a mechanical toy than a living creature But the poor little girl couldn t fix her attention Her heart was full of trouble and she wanted to talk about it She said Can bug know about naughty girl Is bug very happy Then putting her arms round my neck she said I am will be good to morrow Helen is will be good all days I said Will you tell Viney you are very sorry you scratched and kicked her She smiled and answered Viney can not spell words I will tell Viney you are very sorry I said Will you go with me and find Viney She was very willing to go and let Viney kiss her though she didn t return the caress She has been unusually affectionate since and it seems to me there is a sweetness a soul beauty in her face which I have not seen before July thirty one eighteen eighty seven Helen s pencil writing is excellent as you will see from the enclosed letter which she wrote for her own amusement I am teaching her the braille alphabet and she is delighted to be able to make words herself that she can feel She has now reached the question stage of her development It is what why when especially why all day long and as her intelligence grows her inquiries become more insistent I remember how unbearable I used to find the inquisitiveness of my friends children but I know now that these questions indicate the child s growing interest in the cause of things The why is the DOOR THROUGH WHICH HE ENTERS THE WORLD OF REASON AND REFLECTION How does carpenter know to build house Who put chickens in eggs Why is Viney black Flies bite why Can flies know not to bite Why did father kill sheep Of course she asks many questions that are not as intelligent as these Her mind isn t more logical than the minds of ordinary children On the whole her questions are analogous to those that a bright three year old child asks but her desire for knowledge is so earnest the questions are never tedious though they draw heavily upon my meager store of information and tax my ingenuity to the utmost I had a letter from Laura Bridgman last Sunday Please give her my love and tell her Helen sends her a kiss I read the letter at the supper table and missus Keller exclaimed My Miss Annie Helen writes almost as well as that now It is true August twenty one eighteen eighty seven We had a beautiful time in Huntsville Everybody there was delighted with Helen and showered her with gifts and kisses The first evening she learned the names of all the people in the hotel about twenty I think The next morning we were astonished to find that she remembered all of them and recognized every one she had met the night before She taught the young people the alphabet and several of them learned to talk with her One of the girls taught her to dance the polka and a little boy showed her his rabbits and spelled their names for her She was delighted and showed her pleasure by hugging and kissing the little fellow which embarrassed him very much We had Helen s picture taken with a fuzzy red eyed little poodle who got himself into my lady s good graces by tricks and cunning devices known only to dogs with an instinct for getting what they want She has talked incessantly since her return about what she did in Huntsville and we notice a very decided improvement in her ability to use language Curiously enough a drive we took to the top of Monte Sano a beautiful mountain not far from Huntsville seems to have impressed her more than anything else except the wonderful poodle She remembers all that I told her about it and in telling her mother REPEATED THE VERY WORDS AND PHRASES I HAD USED IN DESCRIBING IT TO HER In conclusion she asked her mother if she should like to see very high mountain and beautiful cloudcaps I hadn t used this expression I said The clouds touch the mountain softly like beautiful flowers You see I had to use words and images with which she was familiar through the sense of touch But it hardly seems possible that any mere words should convey to one who has never seen a mountain the faintest idea of its grandeur and I don t see how any one is ever to know what impression she did receive or the cause of her pleasure in what was told her about it All that we do know certainly is that she has a good memory and imagination and the faculty of association August twenty eight eighteen eighty seven I do wish things would stop being born New puppies new calves and new babies keep Helen s interest in the why and wherefore of things at white heat The arrival of a new baby at Ivy Green the other day was the occasion of a fresh outburst of questions about the origin of babies and live things in general Where did Leila get new baby How did doctor know where to find baby Did Leila tell doctor to get very small new baby Where did doctor find Guy and Prince puppies Why is Elizabeth Evelyn s sister et cetera et cetera These questions were sometimes asked under circumstances which rendered them embarrassing and I made up my mind that something must be done If it was natural for Helen to ask such questions it was my duty to answer them It s a great mistake I think to put children off with falsehoods and nonsense when their growing powers of observation and discrimination excite in them a desire to know about things From the beginning I HAVE MADE IT A PRACTICE TO ANSWER ALL HELEN S QUESTIONS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY IN A WAY INTELLIGIBLE TO HER and at the same time truthfully Why should I treat these questions differently I asked myself I decided that there was no reason except my deplorable ignorance of the great facts that underlie our physical existence It was no doubt because of this ignorance that I rushed in where more experienced angels fear to tread There isn t a living soul in this part of the world to whom I can go for advice in this or indeed in any other educational difficulty The only thing for me to do in a perplexity is to go ahead and learn by making mistakes But in this case I don t think I made a mistake I took Helen and my Botany How Plants Grow up in the tree where we often go to read and study and I told her in simple words the story of plantlife I reminded her of the corn beans and watermelon seed she had planted in the spring and told her that the tall corn in the garden and the beans and watermelon vines had grown from those seeds I explained how the earth keeps the seeds warm and moist until the little leaves are strong enough to push themselves out into the light and air where they can breathe and grow and bloom and make more seeds from which other baby plants shall grow I drew an analogy between plant and animal life and told her that seeds are eggs as truly as hens eggs and birds eggs that the mother hen keeps her eggs warm and dry until the little chicks come out I made her understand that all life comes from an egg The mother bird lays her eggs in a nest and keeps them warm until the birdlings are hatched The mother fish lays her eggs where she knows they will be moist and safe until it is time for the little fish to come out I told her that she could call the egg the cradle of life Then I told her that other animals like the dog and cow and human beings do not lay their eggs but nourish their young in their own bodies I had no difficulty in making it clear to her that if plants and animals didn t produce offspring after their kind they would cease to exist and everything in the world would soon die But the function of sex I passed over as lightly as possible I did however try to give her the idea that love is the great continuer of life The subject was difficult and my knowledge inadequate but I am glad I didn t shirk my responsibility for stumbling hesitating and incomplete as my explanation was it touched deep responsive chords in the soul of my little pupil and the readiness with which she comprehended the great facts of physical life confirmed me in the opinion that the child has dormant within him when he comes into the world all the experiences of the race These experiences are like photographic negatives until language develops them and brings out the memory images September four eighteen eighty seven Helen had a letter this morning from her uncle Doctor Keller He invited her to come to see him at Hot Springs The name Hot Springs interested her and she asked many questions about it She knows about cold springs There are several near Tuscumbia one very large one from which the town got its name Tuscumbia is the Indian for Great Spring But she was surprised that hot water should come out of the ground She wanted to know who made fire under the ground and if it was like the fire in stoves and if it burned the roots of plants and trees She was much pleased with the letter and after she had asked all the questions she could think of she took it to her mother who was sewing in the hall and read it to her It was amusing to see her hold it before her eyes and spell the sentences out on her fingers just as I had done Afterward she tried to read it to Belle the dog and Mildred missus Keller and I watched the nursery comedy from the door Belle was sleepy and Mildred inattentive Helen looked very serious and once or twice when Mildred tried to take the letter she put her hand away impatiently Finally Belle got up shook herself and was about to walk away when Helen caught her by the neck and forced her to lie down again In the meantime Mildred had got the letter and crept away with it Helen felt on the floor for it but not finding it there she evidently suspected Mildred for she made the little sound which is her baby call Then she got up and stood very still as if listening with her feet for Mildred s thump thump When she had located the sound she went quickly toward the little culprit and found her chewing the precious letter This was too much for Helen She snatched the letter and slapped the little hands soundly missus Keller took the baby in her arms and when we had succeeded in pacifying her I asked Helen What did you do to baby She looked troubled and hesitated a moment before answering Then she said Wrong girl did eat letter Helen did slap very wrong girl I told her that Mildred was very small and didn t know that it was wrong to put the letter in her mouth I did tell baby no no much many times was Helen s reply I said Mildred doesn t understand your fingers and we must be very gentle with her She shook her head Baby not think Helen will give baby pretty letter and with that she ran upstairs and brought down a neatly folded sheet of braille on which she had written some words and gave it to Mildred saying Baby can eat all words September eighteen eighteen eighty seven I do not wonder you were surprised to hear that I was going to write something for the report I do not know myself how it happened except that I got tired of saying no and Captain Keller urged me to do it He agreed with mister Anagnos that it was my duty to give others the benefit of my experience Besides they said Helen s wonderful deliverance might be a boon to other afflicted children When I sit down to write my thoughts freeze and when I get them on paper they look like wooden soldiers all in a row and if a live one happens along I put him in a strait jacket It s easy enough however to say Helen is wonderful because she really is I kept a record of everything she said last week and I found that she knows six hundred words This does not mean however that she always uses them correctly Sometimes her sentences are like Chinese puzzles but they are the kind of puzzles children make when they try to express their half formed ideas by means of arbitrary language She has the true language impulse and shows great fertility of resource in making the words at her command convey her meaning Lately she has been much interested in colour She found the word brown in her primer and wanted to know its meaning I told her that her hair was brown and she asked Is brown very pretty After we had been all over the house and I had told her the colour of everything she touched she suggested that we go to the hen houses and barns but I told her she must wait until another day because I was very tired We sat in the hammock but there was no rest for the weary there Helen was eager to know more colour I wonder if she has any vague idea of colour any reminiscent impression of light and sound It seems as if a child who could see and hear until her nineteenth month must retain some of her first impressions though ever so faintly Helen talks a great deal about things that she cannot know of through the sense of touch She asks many questions about the sky day and night the ocean and mountains She likes to have me tell her what I see in pictures But I seem to have lost the thread of my discourse What colour is think was one of the restful questions she asked as we swung to and fro in the hammock I told her that when we are happy our thoughts are bright and when we are naughty they are sad Quick as a flash she said My think is white Viney s think is black You see she had an idea that the colour of our thoughts matched that of our skin I couldn t help laughing for at that very moment Viney was shouting at the top of her voice I long to sit on dem jasper walls And see dem sinners stumble and fall October three eighteen eighty seven My account for the report is finished and sent off I have two copies and will send you one but you mustn t show it to anybody It s mister Anagnos s property until it is published I suppose the little girls enjoyed Helen s letter She wrote it out of her own head as the children say She talks a great deal about what she will do when she goes to Boston She asked the other day Who made all things and Boston She says Mildred will not go there because Baby does cry all days October twenty five eighteen eighty seven Helen wrote another letter to the little girls yesterday and her father sent it to mister Anagnos Ask him to let you see it She has begun to use the pronouns of her own accord This morning I happened to say Helen will go upstairs She laughed and said Teacher is wrong You will go upstairs This is another great forward step Thus it always is Yesterday s perplexities are strangely simple to day and to day s difficulties become to morrow s pastime The rapid development of Helen s mind is beautiful to watch I doubt if any teacher ever had a work of such absorbing interest There must have been one lucky star in the heavens at my birth and I am just beginning to feel its beneficent influence I had two letters from mister Anagnos last week He is more grateful for my report than the English idiom will express Now he wants a picture of darling Helen and her illustrious teacher to grace the pages of the forthcoming annual report October eighteen eighty seven You have probably read ere this Helen s second letter to the little girls I am aware that the progress which she has made between the writing of the two letters must seem incredible Only those who are with her daily can realize the rapid advancement which she is making in the acquisition of language You will see from her letter that she uses many pronouns correctly She rarely misuses or omits one in conversation Her passion for writing letters and putting her thoughts upon paper grows more intense She now tells stories in which the imagination plays an important part She is also beginning to realize that she is not like other children The other day she asked What do my eyes do I told her that I could see things with my eyes and that she could see them with her fingers After thinking a moment she said My eyes are bad then she changed it into My eyes are sick Miss Sullivan s first report which was published in the official report of the Perkins Institution for the year eighteen eighty seven is a short summary of what is fully recorded in the letters Here follows the last part beginning with the great day April fifth when Helen learned water In her reports Miss Sullivan speaks of lessons as if they came in regular order This is the effect of putting it all in a summary Lesson is too formal for the continuous daily work One day I took her to the cistern As the water gushed from the pump I spelled w a t e r Instantly she tapped my hand for a repetition and then made the word herself with a radiant face Just then the nurse came into the cistern house bringing her little sister I put Helen s hand on the baby and formed the letters b a b y which she repeated without help and with the light of a new intelligence in her face On our way back to the house everything she touched had to be named for her and repetition was seldom necessary Neither the length of the word nor the combination of letters seems to make any difference to the child Indeed she remembers HELIOTROPE and CHRYSANTHEMUM more readily than she does shorter names At the end of August she knew six hundred twenty five words This lesson was followed by one on words indicative of place relations Her dress was put IN a trunk and then ON it and these prepositions were spelled for her Very soon she learned the difference between ON and IN though it was some time before she could use these words in sentences of her own Whenever it was possible she was made the actor in the lesson and was delighted to stand ON the chair and to be put INTO the wardrobe In connection with this lesson she learned the names of the members of the family and the word IS Helen is in wardrobe Mildred is in crib Box is on table Papa is on bed are specimens of sentences constructed by her during the latter part of April Next came a lesson on words expressive of positive quality For the first lesson I had two balls one made of worsted large and soft the other a bullet She perceived the difference in size at once Taking the bullet she made her habitual sign for SMALL that is by pinching a little bit of the skin of one hand Then she took the other ball and made her sign for LARGE by spreading both hands over it I substituted the adjectives LARGE and SMALL for those signs Then her attention was called to the hardness of the one ball and the softness of the other and she learned SOFT and HARD A few minutes afterward she felt of her little sister s head and said to her mother Mildred s head is small and hard Next I tried to teach her the meaning of FAST and SLOW She helped me wind some worsted one day first rapidly and afterward slowly I then said to her with the finger alphabet wind fast or wind slow holding her hands and showing her how to do as I wished The next day while exercising she spelled to me Helen wind fast and began to walk rapidly Then she said Helen wind slow again suiting the action to the words I now thought it time to teach her to read printed words A slip on which was printed in raised letters the word BOX was placed on the object and the same experiment was tried with a great many articles but she did not immediately comprehend that the label name represented the thing Then I took an alphabet sheet and put her finger on the letter A at the same time making A with my fingers She moved her finger from one printed character to another as I formed each letter on my fingers She learned all the letters both capital and small in one day Next I turned to the first page of the primer and made her touch the word CAT spelling it on my fingers at the same time Instantly she caught the idea and asked me to find DOG and many other words Indeed she was much displeased because I could not find her name in the book Just then I had no sentences in raised letters which she could understand but she would sit for hours feeling each word in her book When she touched one with which she was familiar a peculiarly sweet expression lighted her face and we saw her countenance growing sweeter and more earnest every day About this time I sent a list of the words she knew to mister Anagnos and he very kindly had them printed for her Her mother and I cut up several sheets of printed words so that she could arrange them into sentences This delighted her more than anything she had yet done and the practice thus obtained prepared the way for the writing lessons There was no difficulty in making her understand how to write the same sentences with pencil and paper which she made every day with the slips and she very soon perceived that she need not confine herself to phrases already learned but could communicate any thought that was passing through her mind I put one of the writing boards used by the blind between the folds of the paper on the table and allowed her to examine an alphabet of the square letters such as she was to make I then guided her hand to form the sentence Cat does drink milk When she finished it she was overjoyed She carried it to her mother who spelled it to her Day after day she moved her pencil in the same tracks along the grooved paper never for a moment expressing the least impatience or sense of fatigue As she had now learned to express her ideas on paper I next taught her the braille system She learned it gladly when she discovered that she could herself read what she had written and this still affords her constant pleasure For a whole evening she will sit at the table writing whatever comes into her busy brain and I seldom find any difficulty in reading what she has written Her progress in arithmetic has been equally remarkable She can add and subtract with great rapidity up to the sum of one hundred and she knows the multiplication tables as far as the FIVES She was working recently with the number forty when I said to her Make twos She replied immediately Twenty twos make forty Later I said Make fifteen threes and count I wished her to make the groups of threes and supposed she would then have to count them in order to know what number fifteen threes would make But instantly she spelled the answer Fifteen threes make forty five On being told that she was white and that one of the servants was black she concluded that all who occupied a similar menial position were of the same hue and whenever I asked her the colour of a servant she would say black When asked the colour of some one whose occupation she did not know she seemed bewildered and finally said blue She has never been told anything about death or the burial of the body and yet on entering the cemetery for the first time in her life with her mother and me to look at some flowers she laid her hand on our eyes and repeatedly spelled cry cry Her eyes actually filled with tears The flowers did not seem to give her pleasure and she was very quiet while we stayed there On another occasion while walking with me she seemed conscious of the presence of her brother although we were distant from him She spelled his name repeatedly and started in the direction in which he was coming When walking or riding she often gives the names of the people we meet almost as soon as we recognize them The letters take up the account again November thirteen eighteen eighty seven We took Helen to the circus and had the time of our lives The circus people were much interested in Helen and did everything they could to make her first circus a memorable event They let her feel the animals whenever it was safe She fed the elephants and was allowed to climb up on the back of the largest and sit in the lap of the Oriental Princess while the elephant marched majestically around the ring She felt some young lions They were as gentle as kittens but I told her they would get wild and fierce as they grew older She said to the keeper I will take the baby lions home and teach them to be mild The keeper of the bears made one big black fellow stand on his hind legs and hold out his great paw to us which Helen shook politely She was greatly delighted with the monkeys and kept her hand on the star performer while he went through his tricks and laughed heartily when he took off his hat to the audience One cute little fellow stole her hair ribbon and another tried to snatch the flowers out of her hat I don t know who had the best time the monkeys Helen or the spectators One of the leopards licked her hands and the man in charge of the giraffes lifted her up in his arms so that she could feel their ears and see how tall they were She also felt a Greek chariot and the charioteer would have liked to take her round the ring but she was afraid of many swift horses The riders and clowns and rope walkers were all glad to let the little blind girl feel their costumes and follow their motions whenever it was possible and she kissed them all to show her gratitude Some of them cried and the wild man of Borneo shrank from her sweet little face in terror She has talked about nothing but the circus ever since In order to answer her questions I have been obliged to read a great deal about animals At present I feel like a jungle on wheels December twelve eighteen eighty seven I find it hard to realize that Christmas is almost here in spite of the fact that Helen talks about nothing else Do you remember what a happy time we had last Christmas Helen has learned to tell the time at last and her father is going to give her a watch for Christmas Helen is as eager to have stories told her as any hearing child I ever knew She has made me repeat the story of little Red Riding Hood so often that I believe I could say it backward She likes stories that make her cry I think we all do it s so nice to feel sad when you ve nothing particular to be sad about I am teaching her little rhymes and verses too They fix beautiful thoughts in her memory I think too that they quicken all the child s faculties because they stimulate the imagination Of course I don t try to explain everything If I did there would be no opportunity for the play of fancy TOO MUCH EXPLANATION DIRECTS THE CHILD S ATTENTION TO WORDS AND SENTENCES SO THAT HE FAILS TO GET THE THOUGHT AS A WHOLE I do not think anyone can read or talk for that matter until he forgets words and sentences in the technical sense January one eighteen eighty eight It is a great thing to feel that you are of some use in the world that you are necessary to somebody Helen s dependence on me for almost everything makes me strong and glad Christmas week was a very busy one here too Helen is invited to all the children s entertainments and I take her to as many as I can I want her to know children and to be with them as much as possible Several little girls have learned to spell on their fingers and are very proud of the accomplishment One little chap about seven was persuaded to learn the letters and he spelled his name for Helen She was delighted and showed her joy by hugging and kissing him much to his embarrassment Saturday the school children had their tree and I took Helen It was the first Christmas tree she had ever seen and she was puzzled and asked many questions Who made tree grow in house Why Who put many things on tree She objected to its miscellaneous fruits and began to remove them evidently thinking they were all meant for her It was not difficult however to make her understand that there was a present for each child and to her great delight she was permitted to hand the gifts to the children There were several presents for herself She placed them in a chair resisting all temptation to look at them until every child had received his gifts One little girl had fewer presents than the rest and Helen insisted on sharing her gifts with her It was very sweet to see the children s eager interest in Helen and their readiness to give her pleasure The exercises began at nine and it was one o clock before we could leave My fingers and head ached but Helen was as fresh and full of spirit as when we left home After dinner it began to snow and we had a good frolic and an interesting lesson about the snow Sunday morning the ground was covered and Helen and the cook s children and I played snowball By noon the snow was all gone It was the first snow I had seen here and it made me a little homesick The Christmas season has furnished many lessons and added scores of new words to Helen s vocabulary For weeks we did nothing but talk and read and tell each other stories about Christmas Of course I do not try to explain all the new words nor does Helen fully understand the little stories I tell her but constant repetition fixes the words and phrases in the mind and little by little the meaning will come to her I SEE NO SENSE IN FAKING CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF TEACHING LANGUAGE IT S STUPID AND DEADENING TO PUPIL AND TEACHER TALK SHOULD BE NATURAL AND HAVE FOR ITS OBJECT AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS If there is nothing in the child s mind to communicate it hardly seems worth while to require him to write on the blackboard or spell on his fingers cut and dried sentences about the cat the bird a dog I HAVE TRIED FROM THE BEGINNING TO TALK NATURALLY TO HELEN AND TO TEACH HER TO TELL ME ONLY THINGS THAT INTEREST HER AND ASK QUESTIONS ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHAT SHE WANTS TO KNOW When I see that she is eager to tell me something but is hampered because she does not know the words I supply them and the necessary idioms and we get along finely The child s eagerness and interest carry her over many obstacles that would be our undoing if we stopped to define and explain everything What would happen do you think if some one should try to measure our intelligence by our ability to define the commonest words we use I fear me if I were put to such a test I should be consigned to the primary class in a school for the feeble minded It was touching and beautiful to see Helen enjoy her first Christmas Of course she hung her stocking two of them lest Santa Claus should forget one and she lay awake for a long time and got up two or three times to see if anything had happened When I told her that Santa Claus would not come until she was asleep she shut her eyes and said He will think girl is asleep She was awake the first thing in the morning and ran to the fireplace for her stocking and when she found that Santa Claus had filled both stockings she danced about for a minute then grew very quiet and came to ask me if I thought Santa Claus had made a mistake and thought there were two little girls and would come back for the gifts when he discovered his mistake The ring you sent her was in the toe of the stocking and when I told her you gave it to Santa Claus for her she said I do love missus Hopkins She had a trunk and clothes for Nancy and her comment was Now Nancy will go to party When she saw the braille slate and paper she said I will write many letters and I will thank Santa Claus very much It was evident that every one especially Captain and missus Keller was deeply moved at the thought of the difference between this bright Christmas and the last when their little girl had no conscious part in the Christmas festivities As we came downstairs missus Keller said to me with tears in her eyes Miss Annie I thank God every day of my life for sending you to us but I never realized until this morning what a blessing you have been to us Captain Keller took my hand but could not speak But his silence was more eloquent than words My heart too was full of gratitude and solemn joy The other day Helen came across the word grandfather in a little story and asked her mother Where is grandfather meaning her grandfather missus Keller replied He is dead Did father shoot him Helen asked and added I will eat grandfather for dinner So far her only knowledge of death is in connection with things to eat She knows that her father shoots partridges and deer and other game This morning she asked me the meaning of carpenter and the question furnished the text for the day s lesson After talking about the various things that carpenters make she asked me Did carpenter make me and before I could answer she spelled quickly No no photographer made me in Sheffield One of the greatest iron furnaces has been started in Sheffield and we went over the other evening to see them make a run Helen felt the heat and asked Did the sun fall January nine eighteen eighty eight The report came last night I appreciate the kind things mister Anagnos has said about Helen and me but his extravagant way of saying them rubs me the wrong way The simple facts would be so much more convincing Why for instance does he take the trouble to ascribe motives to me that I never dreamed of You know and he knows and I know that my motive in coming here was not in any sense philanthropic How ridiculous it is to say I had drunk so copiously of the noble spirit of doctor Howe that I was fired with the desire to rescue from darkness and obscurity the little Alabamian I came here simply because circumstances made it necessary for me to earn my living and I seized upon the first opportunity that offered itself although I did not suspect nor did he that I had any special fitness for the work January twenty six eighteen eighty eight I suppose you got Helen s letter The little rascal has taken it into her head not to write with a pencil I wanted her to write to her Uncle Frank this morning but she objected She said Pencil is very tired in head I will write Uncle Frank braille letter I said But Uncle Frank cannot read braille I will teach him she said I explained that Uncle Frank was old and couldn t learn braille easily In a flash she answered I think Uncle Frank is much too old to read very small letters Finally I persuaded her to write a few lines but she broke her pencil six times before she finished it I said to her You are a naughty girl No she replied pencil is very weak I think her objection to pencil writing is readily accounted for by the fact that she has been asked to write so many specimens for friends and strangers You know how the children at the Institution detest it It is irksome because the process is so slow and they cannot read what they have written or correct their mistakes Helen is more and more interested in colour When I told her that Mildred s eyes were blue she asked Are they like wee skies A little while after I had told her that a carnation that had been given her was red she puckered up her mouth and said Lips are like one pink I told her they were tulips but of course she didn t understand the word play I can t believe that the colour impressions she received during the year and a half she could see and hear are entirely lost Everything we have seen and heard is in the mind somewhere It may be too vague and confused to be recognizable but it is there all the same like the landscape we lose in the deepening twilight February ten eighteen eighty eight We got home last night We had a splendid time in Memphis but I didn t rest much It was nothing but excitement from first to last drives luncheons receptions and all that they involve when you have an eager tireless child like Helen on your hands She talked incessantly I don t know what I should have done had some of the young people not learned to talk with her They relieved me as much as possible But even then I can never have a quiet half hour to myself It is always Oh Miss Sullivan please come and tell us what Helen means or Miss Sullivan won t you please explain this to Helen We can t make her understand I believe half the white population of Memphis called on us Helen was petted and caressed enough to spoil an angel but I do not think it is possible to spoil her she is too unconscious of herself and too loving The stores in Memphis are very good and I managed to spend all the money that I had with me One day Helen said I must buy Nancy a very pretty hat I said Very well we will go shopping this afternoon She had a silver dollar and a dime When we reached the shop I asked her how much she would pay for Nancy s hat She answered promptly I will pay ten cents What will you do with the dollar I asked I will buy some good candy to take to Tuscumbia was her reply We visited the Stock Exchange and a steamboat Helen was greatly interested in the boat and insisted on being shown every inch of it from the engine to the flag on the flagstaff I was gratified to read what the Nation had to say about Helen last week Captain Keller has had two interesting letters since the publication of the Report one from doctor Alexander Graham Bell and the other from doctor Edward Everett Hale doctor Hale claims kinship with Helen and seems very proud of his little cousin doctor Bell writes that Helen s progress is without a parallel in the education of the deaf or something like that and he says many nice things about her teacher March five eighteen eighty eight I did not have a chance to finish my letter yesterday Miss Ev came up to help me make a list of words Helen has learned We have got as far as P and there are nine hundred words to her credit I had Helen begin a journal March first Most of this journal was lost Fortunately however Helen Keller wrote so many letters and exercises that there is no lack of records of that sort I don t know how long she will keep it up It s rather stupid business I think Just now she finds it great fun She seems to like to tell all she knows This is what Helen wrote Sunday I got up washed my face and hands combed my hair picked three dew violets for Teacher and ate my breakfast After breakfast I played with dolls short Nancy was cross Cross is cry and kick I read in my book about large fierce animals Fierce is much cross and strong and very hungry I do not love fierce animals I wrote letter to Uncle James He lives in Hotsprings He is doctor Doctor makes sick girl well I do not like sick Then I ate my dinner I like much icecream very much After dinner father went to Birmingham on train far away I had letter from Robert He loves me He said Dear Helen Robert was glad to get a letter from dear sweet little Helen I will come to see you when the sun shines missus Newsum is Robert s wife Robert is her husband Robert and I will run and jump and hop and dance and swing and talk about birds and flowers and trees and grass and Jumbo and Pearl will go with us Teacher will say We are silly She is funny Funny makes us laugh Natalie is a good girl and does not cry Mildred does cry She will be a nice girl in many days and run and play with me missus Graves is making short dresses for Natalie mister Mayo went to Duckhill and brought home many sweet flowers mister Mayo and mister Farris and mister Graves love me and Teacher I am going to Memphis to see them soon and they will hug and kiss me Thornton goes to school and gets his face dirty Boy must be very careful After supper I played romp with Teacher in bed She buried me under the pillows and then I grew very slow like tree out of ground Now I will go to bed HELEN KELLER April sixteen eighteen eighty eight We are just back from church Captain Keller said at breakfast this morning that he wished I would take Helen to church The Presbytery would be there in a body and he wanted the ministers to see Helen The Sunday school was in session when we arrived and I wish you could have seen the sensation Helen s entrance caused The children were so pleased to see her at Sunday school they paid no attention to their teachers but rushed out of their seats and surrounded us She kissed them all boys and girls willing or unwilling She seemed to think at first that the children all belonged to the visiting ministers but soon she recognized some little friends among them and I told her the ministers didn t bring their children with them She looked disappointed and said I ll send them many kisses One of the ministers wished me to ask Helen What do ministers do She said They read and talk loud to people to be good He put her answer down in his note book When it was time for the church service to begin she was in such a state of excitement that I thought it best to take her away but Captain Keller said No she will be all right So there was nothing to do but stay It was impossible to keep Helen quiet She hugged and kissed me and the quiet looking divine who sat on the other side of her He gave her his watch to play with but that didn t keep her still She wanted to show it to the little boy in the seat behind us When the communion service began she smelt the wine and sniffed so loud that every one in the church could hear When the wine was passed to our neighbour he was obliged to stand up to prevent her taking it away from him I never was so glad to get out of a place as I was to leave that church I tried to hurry Helen out of doors but she kept her arm extended and every coat tail she touched must needs turn round and give an account of the children he left at home and receive kisses according to their number Everybody laughed at her antics and you would have thought they were leaving a place of amusement rather than a church Captain Keller invited some of the ministers to dinner Helen was irrepressible She described in the most animated pantomime supplemented by spelling what she was going to do in Brewster Finally she got up from the table and went through the motion of picking seaweed and shells and splashing in the water holding up her skirts higher than was proper under the circumstances Then she threw herself on the floor and began to swim so energetically that some of us thought we should be kicked out of our chairs Her motions are often more expressive than any words and she is as graceful as a nymph I wonder if the days seem as interminable to you as they do to me We talk and plan and dream about nothing but Boston Boston Boston I think missus Keller has definitely decided to go with us but she will not stay all summer May fifteen eighteen eighty eight Do you realize that this is the last letter I shall write to you for a long long time The next word that you receive from me will be in a yellow envelope and it will tell you when we shall reach Boston I am too happy to write letters but I must tell you about our visit to Cincinnati We spent a delightful week with the doctors doctor Keller met us in Memphis Almost every one on the train was a physician and doctor Keller seemed to know them all When we reached Cincinnati we found the place full of doctors There were several prominent Boston physicians among them We stayed at the Burnet House Everybody was delighted with Helen All the learned men marveled at her intelligence and gaiety There is something about her that attracts people I think it is her joyous interest in everything and everybody Wherever she went she was the centre of interest She was delighted with the orchestra at the hotel and whenever the music began she danced round the room hugging and kissing every one she happened to touch Her happiness impressed all nobody seemed to pity her One gentleman said to doctor Keller I have lived long and seen many happy faces but I have never seen such a radiant face as this child s before to night Another said Damn me but I d give everything I own in the world to have that little girl always near me But I haven t time to write all the pleasant things people said they would make a very large book and the kind things they did for us would fill another volume doctor Keller distributed the extracts from the report that mister Anagnos sent me and he could have disposed of a thousand if he had had them Do you remember doctor Garcelon who was Governor of Maine several years ago He took us to drive one afternoon and wanted to give Helen a doll but she said I do not like too many children Nancy is sick and Adeline is cross and Ida is very bad We laughed until we cried she was so serious about it What would you like then asked the Doctor Some beautiful gloves to talk with she answered The Doctor was puzzled He had never heard of talking gloves but I explained that she had seen a glove on which the alphabet was printed and evidently thought they could be bought I told him he could buy some gloves if he wished and that I would have the alphabet stamped on them We lunched with mister Thayer your former pastor and his wife He asked me how I had taught Helen adjectives and the names of abstract ideas like goodness and happiness These same questions had been asked me a hundred times by the learned doctors It seems strange that people should marvel at what is really so simple Why it is as easy to teach the name of an idea if it is clearly formulated in the child s mind as to teach the name of an object It would indeed be a herculean task to teach the words if the ideas did not already exist in the child s mind If his experiences and observations hadn t led him to the concepts SMALL LARGE GOOD BAD SWEET SOUR he would have nothing to attach the word tags to I little ignorant I found myself explaining to the wise men of the East and the West such simple things as these If you give a child something sweet and he wags his tongue and smacks his lips and looks pleased he has a very definite sensation and if every time he has this experience he hears the word SWEET or has it spelled into his hand he will quickly adopt this arbitrary sign for his sensation Likewise if you put a bit of lemon on his tongue he puckers up his lips and tries to spit it out and after he has had this experience a few times if you offer him a lemon he shuts his mouth and makes faces clearly indicating that he remembers the unpleasant sensation You label it SOUR and he adopts your symbol If you had called these sensations respectively BLACK and WHITE he would have adopted them as readily but he would mean by BLACK and WHITE the same things that he means by SWEET and SOUR In the same way the child learns from many experiences to differentiate his feelings and we name them for him GOOD BAD GENTLE ROUGH HAPPY SAD It is not the word but the capacity to experience the sensation that counts in his education This extract from one of Miss Sullivan s letters is added because it contains interesting casual opinions stimulated by observing the methods of others We visited a little school for the deaf We were very kindly received and Helen enjoyed meeting the children Two of the teachers knew the manual alphabet and talked to her without an interpreter They were astonished at her command of language Not a child in the school they said had anything like Helen s facility of expression and some of them had been under instruction for two or three years I was incredulous at first but after I had watched the children at work for a couple of hours I knew that what I had been told was true and I wasn t surprised In one room some little tots were standing before the blackboard painfully constructing simple sentences A little girl had written I have a new dress It is a pretty dress My mamma made my pretty new dress I love mamma A curly headed little boy was writing I have a large ball I like to kick my large ball When we entered the room the children s attention was riveted on Helen One of them pulled me by the sleeve and said Girl is blind The teacher was writing on the blackboard The girl s name is Helen She is deaf She cannot see We are very sorry I said Why do you write those sentences on the board Wouldn t the children understand if you talked to them about Helen The teacher said something about getting the correct construction and continued to construct an exercise out of Helen I asked her if the little girl who had written about the new dress was particularly pleased with her dress No she replied I think not but children learn better if they write about things that concern them personally It seemed all so mechanical and difficult my heart ached for the poor little children Nobody thinks of making a hearing child say I have a pretty new dress at the beginning These children were older in years it is true than the baby who lisps Papa kiss baby pretty and fills out her meaning by pointing to her new dress but their ability to understand and use language was no greater There was the same difficulty throughout the school In every classroom I saw sentences on the blackboard which evidently had been written to illustrate some grammatical rule or for the purpose of using words that had previously been taught in the same or in some other connection This sort of thing may be necessary in some stages of education but it isn t the way to acquire language NOTHING I THINK CRUSHES THE CHILD S IMPULSE TO TALK NATURALLY MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN THESE BLACKBOARD EXERCISES The schoolroom is not the place to teach any young child language least of all the deaf child He must be kept as unconscious as the hearing child of the fact that he is learning words AND HE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PRATTLE ON HIS FINGERS OR WITH HIS PENCIL IN MONOSYLLABLES IF HE CHOOSES UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS GROWING INTELLIGENCE DEMANDS THE SENTENCE Language should not be associated in his mind with endless hours in school with puzzling questions in grammar or with anything that is an enemy to joy But I must not get into the habit of criticizing other people s methods too severely I may be as far from the straight road as they Miss Sullivan s second report brings the account down to October first eighteen eighty eight During the past year Helen has enjoyed excellent health Her eyes and ears have been examined by specialists and it is their opinion that she cannot have the slightest perception of either light or sound It is impossible to tell exactly to what extent the senses of smell and taste aid her in gaining information respecting physical qualities but according to eminent authority these senses do exert a great influence on the mental and moral development Dugald Stewart says Some of the most significant words relating to the human mind are borrowed from the sense of smell and the conspicuous place which its sensations occupy in the poetical language of all nations shows how easily and naturally they ally themselves with the refined operations of the fancy and the moral emotions of the heart Helen certainly derives great pleasure from the exercise of these senses On entering a greenhouse her countenance becomes radiant and she will tell the names of the flowers with which she is familiar by the sense of smell alone Her recollections of the sensations of smell are very vivid She enjoys in anticipation the scent of a rose or a violet and if she is promised a bouquet of these flowers a peculiarly happy expression lights her face indicating that in imagination she perceives their fragrance and that it is pleasant to her It frequently happens that the perfume of a flower or the flavour of a fruit recalls to her mind some happy event in home life or a delightful birthday party Her sense of touch has sensibly increased during the year and has gained in acuteness and delicacy Indeed her whole body is so finely organized that she seems to use it as a medium for bringing herself into closer relations with her fellow creatures She is able not only to distinguish with great accuracy the different undulations of the air and the vibrations of the floor made by various sounds and motions and to recognize her friends and acquaintances the instant she touches their hands or clothing but she also perceives the state of mind of those around her It is impossible for any one with whom Helen is conversing to be particularly happy or sad and withhold the knowledge of this fact from her She observes the slightest emphasis placed upon a word in conversation and she discovers meaning in every change of position and in the varied play of the muscles of the hand She responds quickly to the gentle pressure of affection the pat of approval the jerk of impatience the firm motion of command and to the many other variations of the almost infinite language of the feelings and she has become so expert in interpreting this unconscious language of the emotions that she is often able to divine our very thoughts In my account of Helen last year I mentioned several instances where she seemed to have called into use an inexplicable mental faculty but it now seems to me after carefully considering the matter that this power may be explained by her perfect familiarity with the muscular variations of those with whom she comes into contact caused by their emotions She has been forced to depend largely upon this muscular sense as a means of ascertaining the mental condition of those about her She has learned to connect certain movements of the body with anger others with joy and others still with sorrow One day while she was out walking with her mother and mister Anagnos a boy threw a torpedo which startled missus Keller Helen felt the change in her mother s movements instantly and asked What are we afraid of On one occasion while walking on the Common with her I saw a police officer taking a man to the station house The agitation which I felt evidently produced a perceptible physical change for Helen asked excitedly What do you see A striking illustration of this strange power was recently shown while her ears were being examined by the aurists in Cincinnati Several experiments were tried to determine positively whether or not she had any perception of sound All present were astonished when she appeared not only to hear a whistle but also an ordinary tone of voice She would turn her head smile and act as though she had heard what was said I was then standing beside her holding her hand Thinking that she was receiving impressions from me I put her hands upon the table and withdrew to the opposite side of the room The aurists then tried their experiments with quite different results Helen remained motionless through them all not once showing the least sign that she realized what was going on At my suggestion one of the gentlemen took her hand and the tests were repeated This time her countenance changed whenever she was spoken to but there was not such a decided lighting up of the features as when I had held her hand In the account of Helen last year it was stated that she knew nothing about death or the burial of the body yet on entering a cemetery for the first time in her life she showed signs of emotion her eyes actually filling with tears A circumstance equally remarkable occurred last summer but before relating it I will mention what she now knows with regard to death Even before I knew her she had handled a dead chicken or bird or some other small animal Some time after the visit to the cemetery before referred to Helen became interested in a horse that had met with an accident by which one of his legs had been badly injured and she went daily with me to visit him The wounded leg soon became so much worse that the horse was suspended from a beam The animal groaned with pain and Helen perceiving his groans was filled with pity At last it became necessary to kill him and when Helen next asked to go and see him I told her that he was DEAD This was the first time that she had heard the word I then explained that he had been shot to relieve him from suffering and that he was now BURIED put into the ground I am inclined to believe that the idea of his having been intentionally shot did not make much impression upon her but I think she did realize the fact that life was extinct in the horse as in the dead birds she had touched and also that he had been put into the ground Since this occurrence I have used the word DEAD whenever occasion required but with no further explanation of its meaning While making a visit at Brewster Massachusetts she one day accompanied my friend and me through the graveyard She examined one stone after another and seemed pleased when she could decipher a name She smelt of the flowers but showed no desire to pluck them and when I gathered a few for her she refused to have them pinned on her dress When her attention was drawn to a marble slab inscribed with the name FLORENCE in relief she dropped upon the ground as though looking for something then turned to me with a face full of trouble and asked Were is poor little Florence I evaded the question but she persisted Turning to my friend she asked Did you cry loud for poor little Florence Then she added I think she is very dead Who put her in big hole As she continued to ask these distressing questions we left the cemetery Florence was the daughter of my friend and was a young lady at the time of her death but Helen had been told nothing about her nor did she even know that my friend had had a daughter Helen had been given a bed and carriage for her dolls which she had received and used like any other gift On her return to the house after her visit to the cemetery she ran to the closet where these toys were kept and carried them to my friend saying They are poor little Florence s This was true although we were at a loss to understand how she guessed it A letter written to her mother in the course of the following week gave an account of her impression in her own words I put my little babies to sleep in Florence s little bed and I take them to ride in her carriage Poor little Florence is dead She was very sick and died missus H did cry loud for her dear little child She got in the ground and she is very dirty and she is cold Florence was very lovely like Sadie and missus H kissed her and hugged her much Florence is very sad in big hole Doctor gave her medicine to make her well but poor Florence did not get well When she was very sick she tossed and moaned in bed missus H will go to see her soon Notwithstanding the activity of Helen s mind she is a very natural child She is fond of fun and frolic and loves dearly to be with other children She is never fretful or irritable and I have never seen her impatient with her playmates because they failed to understand her She will play for hours together with children who cannot understand a single word she spells and it is pathetic to watch the eager gestures and excited pantomime through which her ideas and emotions find expression Occasionally some little boy or girl will try to learn the manual alphabet Then it is beautiful to observe with what patience sweetness and perseverance Helen endeavours to bring the unruly fingers of her little friend into proper position One day while Helen was wearing a little jacket of which she was very proud her mother said There is a poor little girl who has no cloak to keep her warm Will you give her yours Helen began to pull off the jacket saying I must give it to a poor little strange girl She is very fond of children younger than herself and a baby invariably calls forth all the motherly instincts of her nature She will handle the baby as tenderly as the most careful nurse could desire It is pleasant too to note her thoughtfulness for little children and her readiness to yield to their whims She has a very sociable disposition and delights in the companionship of those who can follow the rapid motions of her fingers but if left alone she will amuse herself for hours at a time with her knitting or sewing She reads a great deal She bends over her book with a look of intense interest and as the forefinger of her left hand runs along the line she spells out the words with the other hand but often her motions are so rapid as to be unintelligible even to those accustomed to reading the swift and varied movements of her fingers Every shade of feeling finds expression through her mobile features Her behaviour is easy and natural and it is charming because of its frankness and evident sincerity Her heart is too full of unselfishness and affection to allow a dream of fear or unkindness She does not realize that one can be anything but kind hearted and tender She is not conscious of any reason why she should be awkward consequently her movements are free and graceful She is very fond of all the living things at home and she will not have them unkindly treated When she is riding in the carriage she will not allow the driver to use the whip because she says poor horses will cry One morning she was greatly distressed by finding that one of the dogs had a block fastened to her collar We explained that it was done to keep Pearl from running away Helen expressed a great deal of sympathy and at every opportunity during the day she would find Pearl and carry the burden from place to place Her father wrote to her last summer that the birds and bees were eating all his grapes At first she was very indignant and said the little creatures were very wrong but she seemed pleased when I explained to her that the birds and bees were hungry and did not know that it was selfish to eat all the fruit In a letter written soon afterward she says I am very sorry that bumblebees and hornets and birds and large flies and worms are eating all of my father s delicious grapes They like juicy fruit to eat as well as people and they are hungry They are not very wrong to eat too many grapes because they do not know much She continues to make rapid progress in the acquisition of language as her experiences increase While these were few and elementary her vocabulary was necessarily limited but as she learns more of the world about her her judgment grows more accurate her reasoning powers grow stronger more active and subtle and the language by which she expresses this intellectual activity gains in fluency and logic When traveling she drinks in thought and language Sitting beside her in the car I describe what I see from the window hills and valleys and the rivers cotton fields and gardens in which strawberries peaches pears melons and vegetables are growing herds of cows and horses feeding in broad meadows and flocks of sheep on the hillside the cities with their churches and schools hotels and warehouses and the occupations of the busy people While I am communicating these things Helen manifests intense interest and in default of words she indicates by gestures and pantomime her desire to learn more of her surroundings and of the great forces which are operating everywhere In this way she learns countless new expressions without any apparent effort From the day when Helen first grasped the idea that all objects have names and that these can be communicated by certain movements of the fingers I have talked to her exactly as I should have done had she been able to hear with only this exception that I have addressed the words to her fingers instead of to her ears Naturally there was at first a strong tendency on her part to use only the important words in a sentence She would say Helen milk I got the milk to show her that she had used the correct word but I did not let her drink it until she had with my assistance made a complete sentence as Give Helen some milk to drink In these early lessons I encouraged her in the use of different forms of expression for conveying the same idea If she was eating some candy I said Will Helen please give teacher some candy or Teacher would like to eat some of Helen s candy emphasizing the s She very soon perceived that the same idea could be expressed in a great many ways In two or three months after I began to teach her she would say Helen wants to go to bed or Helen is sleepy and Helen will go to bed I am constantly asked the question How did you teach her the meaning of words expressive of intellectual and moral qualities I believe it was more through association and repetition than through any explanation of mine This is especially true of her earlier lessons when her knowledge of language was so slight as to make explanation impossible I always made it a practice to use the words descriptive of emotions of intellectual or moral qualities and actions in connection with the circumstance which required these words Soon after I became her teacher Helen broke her new doll of which she was very fond She began to cry I said to her Teacher is SORRY After a few repetitions she came to associate the word with the feeling The word HAPPY she learned in the same way ALSO RIGHT WRONG GOOD BAD and other adjectives The word LOVE she learned as other children do by its association with caresses One day I asked her a simple question in a combination of numbers which I was sure she knew She answered at random I checked her and she stood still the expression of her face plainly showing that she was trying to think I touched her forehead and spelled t h i n k The word thus connected with the act seemed to impress itself on her mind much as if I had placed her hand upon an object and then spelled its name Since that time she has always used the word THINK At a later period I began to use such words as PERHAPS SUPPOSE EXPECT FORGET REMEMBER If Helen asked Where is mother now I replied I do not know PERHAPS she is with Leila She is always anxious to learn the names of people we meet in the horse cars or elsewhere and to know where they are going and what they will do Conversations of this kind are frequent HELEN What is little boy s name TEACHER I do not know for he is a little stranger but PERHAPS his name is Jack HELEN Where is he going TEACHER He MAY BE going to the Common to have fun with other boys HELEN What will he play TEACHER I SUPPOSE he will play ball HELEN What are boys doing now TEACHER PERHAPS they are expecting Jack and are waiting for him After the words have become familiar to her she uses them in composition September twenty six eighteen eighty eight This morning teacher and I sat by the window and we saw a little boy walking on the sidewalk It was raining very hard and he had a very large umbrella to keep off the rain drops I do not know how old he was but THINK he MAY HAVE BEEN six years old PERHAPS his name was Joe I do not know where he was going because he was a little strange boy But PERHAPS his mother sent him to a store to buy something for dinner He had a bag in one hand I SUPPOSE he was going to take it to his mother In teaching her the use of language I have not confined myself to any particular theory or system I have observed the spontaneous movements of my pupil s mind and have tried to follow the suggestions thus given to me Owing to the nervousness of Helen s temperament every precaution has been taken to avoid unduly exciting her already very active brain The greater part of the year has been spent in travel and in visits to different places and her lessons have been those suggested by the various scenes and experiences through which she has passed She continues to manifest the same eagerness to learn as at first It is never necessary to urge her to study Indeed I am often obliged to coax her to leave an example or a composition While not confining myself to any special system of instruction I have tried to add to her general information and intelligence to enlarge her acquaintance with things around her and to bring her into easy and natural relations with people I have encouraged her to keep a diary from which the following selection has been made March twenty second eighteen eighty eight mister Anagnos came to see me Thursday I was glad to hug and kiss him He takes care of sixty little blind girls and seventy little blind boys I do love them Little blind girls sent me a pretty work basket I found scissors and thread and needle book with many needles in it and crochet hook and emery and thimble and box and yard measure and buttons and pin cushion I will write little blind girls a letter to thank them I will make pretty clothes for Nancy and Adeline and Allie I will go to Cincinnati in May and buy another child Then I will have four children New baby s name is Harry mister Wilson and mister Mitchell came to see us Sunday mister Anagnos went to Louisville Monday to see little blind children Mother went to Huntsville I slept with father and Mildred slept with teacher I did learn about calm It does mean quiet and happy Uncle Morrie sent me pretty stories I read about birds The quail lays fifteen or twenty eggs and they are white She makes her nest on the ground The blue bird makes her nest in a hollow tree and her eggs are blue The robin s eggs are green I learned a song about spring March April May are spring Now melts the snow The warm winds blow The waters flow And robin dear Is come to show That Spring is here James killed snipes for breakfast Little chickens did get very cold and die I am sorry Teacher and I went to ride on Tennessee River in a boat I saw mister Wilson and James row with oars Boat did glide swiftly and I put hand in water and felt it flowing I caught fish with hook and line and pole We climbed high hill and teacher fell and hurt her head I ate very small fish for supper I did read about cow and calf The cow loves to eat grass as well as girl does bread and butter and milk Little calf does run and leap in field She likes to skip and play for she is happy when the sun is bright and warm Little boy did love his calf And he did say I will kiss you little calf and he put his arms around calf s neck and kissed her The calf licked good boy s face with long rough tongue Calf must not open mouth much to kiss I am tired and teacher does not want me to write more In the autumn she went to a circus While we were standing before his cage the lion roared and Helen felt the vibration of the air so distinctly that she was able to reproduce the noise quite accurately I tried to describe to her the appearance of a camel but as we were not allowed to touch the animal I feared that she did not get a correct idea of its shape A few days afterward however hearing a commotion in the schoolroom I went in and found Helen on all fours with a pillow so strapped upon her back as to leave a hollow in the middle thus making a hump on either side Between these humps she had placed her doll which she was giving a ride around the room I watched her for some time as she moved about trying to take long strides in order to carry out the idea I had given her of a camel s gait When I asked her what she was doing she replied I am a very funny camel During the next two years neither mister Anagnos who was in Europe for a year nor Miss Sullivan wrote anything about Helen Keller for publication In eighteen ninety two appeared the Perkins Institution report for eighteen ninety one containing a full account of Helen Keller including many of her letters exercises and compositions As some of the letters and the story of the Frost King are published here there is no need of printing any more samples of Helen Keller s writing during the third fourth and fifth years of her education It was the first two years that counted From Miss Sullivan s part of this report I give her most important comments and such biographical matter as does not appear elsewhere in the present volume These extracts mister Anagnos took from Miss Sullivan s notes and memoranda One day while her pony and her donkey were standing side by side Helen went from one to the other examining them closely At last she paused with her hand upon Neddy s head and addressed him thus Yes dear Neddy it is true that you are not as beautiful as Black Beauty Your body is not so handsomely formed and there is no proud look in your face and your neck does not arch Besides your long ears make you look a little funny Of course you cannot help it and I love you just as well as if you were the most beautiful creature in the world Helen has been greatly interested in the story of Black Beauty To show how quickly she perceives and associates ideas I will give an instance which all who have read the book will be able to appreciate I was reading the following paragraph to her The horse was an old worn out chestnut with an ill kept coat and bones that showed plainly through it the knees knuckled over and the forelegs were very unsteady I had been eating some hay and the wind rolled a little lock of it that way and the poor creature put out her long thin neck and picked it up and then turned round and looked about for more There was a hopeless look in the dull eye that I could not help noticing and then as I was thinking where I had seen that horse before she looked full at me and said Black Beauty is that you At this point Helen pressed my hand to stop me She was sobbing convulsively It was poor Ginger was all she could say at first Later when she was able to talk about it she said Poor Ginger The words made a distinct picture in my mind I could see the way Ginger looked all her beauty gone her beautiful arched neck drooping all the spirit gone out of her flashing eyes all the playfulness gone out of her manner Oh how terrible it was I never knew before that there could be such a change in anything There were very few spots of sunshine in poor Ginger s life and the sadnesses were so many After a moment she added mournfully I fear some people s lives are just like Ginger s This morning Helen was reading for the first time Bryant s poem Oh mother of a mighty race I said to her Tell me when you have read the poem through who you think the mother is When she came to the line There s freedom at thy gates and rest she exclaimed It means America The gate I suppose is New York City and Freedom is the great statue of Liberty After she had read The Battlefield by the same author I asked her which verse she thought was the most beautiful She replied I like this verse best Truth crushed to earth shall rise again The eternal years of God are hers But Error wounded writhes with pain And dies among his worshipers She is at once transported into the midst of the events of a story She rejoices when justice wins she is sad when virtue lies low and her face glows with admiration and reverence when heroic deeds are described She even enters into the spirit of battle she says I think it is right for men to fight against wrongs and tyrants Here begins Miss Sullivan s connected account in the report of eighteen ninety one During the past three years Helen has continued to make rapid progress in the acquisition of language She has one advantage over ordinary children that nothing from without distracts her attention from her studies But this advantage involves a corresponding disadvantage the danger of unduly severe mental application Her mind is so constituted that she is in a state of feverish unrest while conscious that there is something that she does not comprehend I have never known her to be willing to leave a lesson when she felt that there was anything in it which she did not understand If I suggest her leaving a problem in arithmetic until the next day she answers I think it will make my mind stronger to do it now A few evenings ago we were discussing the tariff Helen wanted me to tell her about it I said No You cannot understand it yet She was quiet for a moment and then asked with spirit How do you know that I cannot understand I have a good mind You must remember dear teacher that Greek parents were very particular with their children and they used to let them listen to wise words and I think they understood some of them I have found it best not to tell her that she cannot understand because she is almost certain to become excited Not long ago I tried to show her how to build a tower with her blocks As the design was somewhat complicated the slightest jar made the structure fall After a time I became discouraged and told her I was afraid she could not make it stand but that I would build it for her but she did not approve of this plan She was determined to build the tower herself and for nearly three hours she worked away patiently gathering up the blocks whenever they fell and beginning over again until at last her perseverance was crowned with success The tower stood complete in every part Until October eighteen eighty nine I had not deemed it best to confine Helen to any regular and systematic course of study For the first two years of her intellectual life she was like a child in a strange country where everything was new and perplexing and until she gained a knowledge of language it was not possible to give her a definite course of instruction Moreover Helen s inquisitiveness was so great during these years that it would have interfered with her progress in the acquisition of language if a consideration of the questions which were constantly occurring to her had been deferred until the completion of a lesson In all probability she would have forgotten the question and a good opportunity to explain something of real interest to her would have been lost Therefore it has always seemed best to me to teach anything whenever my pupil needed to know it whether it had any bearing on the projected lesson or not her inquiries have often led us far away from the subject under immediate consideration Since October eighteen eighty nine her work has been more regular and has included arithmetic geography zoology botany and reading She has made considerable progress in the study of arithmetic She readily explains the processes of multiplication addition subtraction and division and seems to understand the operations She has nearly finished Colburn s mental arithmetic her last work being in improper fractions She has also done some good work in written arithmetic Her mind works so rapidly that it often happens that when I give her an example she will give me the correct answer before I have time to write out the question She pays little attention to the language used in stating a problem and seldom stops to ask the meaning of unknown words or phrases until she is ready to explain her work Once when a question puzzled her very much I suggested that we take a walk and then perhaps she would understand it She shook her head decidedly and said My enemies would think I was running away I must stay and conquer them now and she did The intellectual improvement which Helen has made in the past two years is shown more clearly in her greater command of language and in her ability to recognize nicer shades of meaning in the use of words than in any other branch of her education Not a day passes that she does not learn many new words nor are these merely the names of tangible and sensible objects For instance she one day wished to know the meaning of the following words PHENOMENON COMPRISE ENERGY REPRODUCTION EXTRAORDINARY PERPETUAL and MYSTERY Some of these words have successive steps of meaning beginning with what is simple and leading on to what is abstract It would have been a hopeless task to make Helen comprehend the more abstruse meanings of the word MYSTERY but she understood readily that it signified something hidden or concealed and when she makes greater progress she will grasp its more abstruse meaning as easily as she now does the simpler signification In investigating any subject there must occur at the beginning words and phrases which cannot be adequately understood until the pupil has made considerable advancement yet I have thought it best to go on giving my pupil simple definitions thinking that although these may be somewhat vague and provisional they will come to one another s assistance and that what is obscure to day will be plain to morrow I regard my pupil as a free and active being whose own spontaneous impulses must be my surest guide I have always talked to Helen exactly as I would talk to a seeing and hearing child and I have insisted that other people should do the same Whenever any one asks me if she will understand this or that word I always reply Never mind whether she understands each separate word of a sentence or not She will guess the meanings of the new words from their connection with others which are already intelligible to her In selecting books for Helen to read I have never chosen them with reference to her deafness and blindness She always reads such books as seeing and hearing children of her age read and enjoy Of course in the beginning it was necessary that the things described should be familiar and interesting and the English pure and simple I remember distinctly when she first attempted to read a little story She had learned the printed letters and for some time had amused herself by making simple sentences using slips on which the words were printed in raised letters but these sentences had no special relation to one another One morning we caught a mouse and it occurred to me with a live mouse and a live cat to stimulate her interest that I might arrange some sentences in such a way as to form a little story and thus give her a new conception of the use of language So I put the following sentences in the frame and gave it to Helen The cat is on the box A mouse is in the box The cat can see the mouse The cat would like to eat the mouse Do not let the cat get the mouse The cat can have some milk and the mouse can have some cake The word THE she did not know and of course she wished it explained At that stage of her advancement it would have been impossible to explain its use and so I did not try but moved her finger on to the next word which she recognized with a bright smile Then as I put her hand upon puss sitting on the box she made a little exclamation of surprise and the rest of the sentence became perfectly clear to her When she had read the words of the second sentence I showed her that there really was a mouse in the box She then moved her finger to the next line with an expression of eager interest The cat can see the mouse Here I made the cat look at the mouse and let Helen feel the cat The expression of the little girl s countenance showed that she was perplexed I called her attention to the following line and although she knew only the three words CAT EAT and MOUSE she caught the idea She pulled the cat away and put her on the floor at the same time covering the box with the frame When she read Do not let the cat get the mouse she recognized the negation in the sentence and seemed to know that the cat must not get the mouse GET and LET were new words She was familiar with the words of the last sentence and was delighted when allowed to act them out By signs she made me understand that she wished another story and I gave her a book containing very short stories written in the most elementary style She ran her fingers along the lines finding the words she knew and guessing at the meaning of others in a way that would convince the most conservative of educators that a little deaf child if given the opportunity will learn to read as easily and naturally as ordinary children I am convinced that Helen s use of English is due largely to her familiarity with books She often reads for two or three hours in succession and then lays aside her book reluctantly One day as we left the library I noticed that she appeared more serious than usual and I asked the cause I am thinking how much wiser we always are when we leave here than we are when we come was her reply When asked why she loved books so much she once replied Because they tell me so much that is interesting about things I cannot see and they are never tired or troubled like people They tell me over and over what I want to know While reading from Dickens s Child s History of England we came to the sentence Still the spirit of the Britons was not broken I asked what she thought that meant She replied I think it means that the brave Britons were not discouraged because the Romans had won so many battles and they wished all the more to drive them away It would not have been possible for her to define the words in this sentence and yet she had caught the author s meaning and was able to give it in her own words The next lines are still more idiomatic When Suetonius left the country they fell upon his troops and retook the island of Anglesea Here is her interpretation of the sentence It means that when the Roman general had gone away the Britons began to fight again and because the Roman soldiers had no general to tell them what to do they were overcome by the Britons and lost the island they had captured She prefers intellectual to manual occupations and is not so fond of fancy work as many of the blind children are yet she is eager to join them in whatever they are doing She has learned to use the Caligraph typewriter and writes very correctly but not rapidly as yet having had less than a month s practice More than two years ago a cousin taught her the telegraph alphabet by making the dots and dashes on the back of her hand with his finger Whenever she meets any one who is familiar with this system she is delighted to use it in conversation I have found it a convenient medium of communicating with Helen when she is at some distance from me for it enables me to talk with her by tapping upon the floor with my foot She feels the vibrations and understands what is said to her It was hoped that one so peculiarly endowed by nature as Helen would if left entirely to her own resources throw some light upon such psychological questions as were not exhaustively investigated by doctor Howe but their hopes were not to be realized In the case of Helen as in that of Laura Bridgman disappointment was inevitable It is impossible to isolate a child in the midst of society so that he shall not be influenced by the beliefs of those with whom he associates In Helen s case such an end could not have been attained without depriving her of that intercourse with others which is essential to her nature It must have been evident to those who watched the rapid unfolding of Helen s faculties that it would not be possible to keep her inquisitive spirit for any length of time from reaching out toward the unfathomable mysteries of life But great care has been taken not to lead her thoughts prematurely to the consideration of subjects which perplex and confuse all minds Children ask profound questions but they often receive shallow answers or to speak more correctly they are quieted by such answers Were did I come from and Where shall I go when I die were questions Helen asked when she was eight years old But the explanations which she was able to understand at that time did not satisfy although they forced her to remain silent until her mind should begin to put forth its higher powers and generalize from innumerable impressions and ideas which streamed in upon it from books and from her daily experiences Her mind sought for the cause of things As her observation of phenomena became more extensive and her vocabulary richer and more subtle enabling her to express her own conceptions and ideas clearly and also to comprehend the thoughts and experiences of others she became acquainted with the limit of human creative power and perceived that some power not human must have created the earth the sun and the thousand natural objects with which she was perfectly familiar Finally she one day demanded a name for the power the existence of which she had already conceived in her own mind Through Charles Kingsley s Greek Heroes she had become familiar with the beautiful stories of the Greek gods and goddesses and she must have met with the words GOD HEAVEN SOUL and a great many similar expressions in books She never asked the meaning of such words nor made any comment when they occurred and until February eighteen eighty nine no one had ever spoken to her of God At that time a dear relative who was also an earnest Christian tried to tell her about God but as this lady did not use words suited to the comprehension of the child they made little impression upon Helen s mind When I subsequently talked with her she said I have something very funny to tell you A says God made me and every one out of sand but it must be a joke I am made of flesh and blood and bone am I not Here she examined her arm with evident satisfaction laughing heartily to herself After a moment she went on A says God is everywhere and that He is all love but I do not think a person can be made out of love Love is only something in our hearts Then A said another very comical thing She says He meaning God is my dear father It made me laugh quite hard for I know my father is Arthur Keller I explained to her that she was not yet able to understand what had been told her and so easily led her to see that it would be better not to talk about such things until she was wiser She had met with the expression Mother Nature in the course of her reading and for a long time she was in the habit of ascribing to Mother Nature whatever she felt to be beyond the power of man to accomplish She would say when speaking of the growth of a plant Mother Nature sends the sunshine and the rain to make the trees and the grass and the flowers grow The following extract from my notes will show what were her ideas at this time Helen seemed a little serious after supper and missus H asked her of what she was thinking I am thinking how very busy dear Mother Nature is in the springtime she replied When asked why she answered Because she has so many children to take care of She is the mother of everything the flowers and trees and winds How does Mother Nature take care of the flowers I asked She sends the sunshine and rain to make them grow Helen replied and after a moment she added I think the sunshine is Nature s warm smile and the raindrops are her tears Later she said I do not know if Mother Nature made me I think my mother got me from heaven but I do not know where that place is I know that daisies and pansies come from seeds which have been put in the ground but children do not grow out of the ground I am sure I have never seen a plant child But I cannot imagine who made Mother Nature can you I love the beautiful spring because the budding trees and the blossoming flowers and the tender green leaves fill my heart with joy I must go now to see my garden The daisies and the pansies will think I have forgotten them After May eighteen ninety it was evident to me that she had reached a point where it was impossible to keep from her the religious beliefs held by those with whom she was in daily contact She almost overwhelmed me with inquiries which were the natural outgrowth of her quickened intelligence Early in May she wrote on her tablet the following list of questions I wish to write about things I do not understand Who made the earth and the seas and everything What makes the sun hot Where was I before I came to mother I know that plants grow from seeds which are in the ground but I am sure people do not grow that way I never saw a child plant Little birds and chickens come out of eggs I have seen them What was the egg before it was an egg Why does not the earth fall it is so very large and heavy Tell me something that Father Nature does May I read the book called the Bible Please tell your little pupil many things when you have much time Can any one doubt after reading these questions that the child who was capable of asking them was also capable of understanding at least their elementary answers She could not of course have grasped such abstractions as a complete answer to her questions would involve but one s whole life is nothing more than a continual advance in the comprehension of the meaning and scope of such ideas Throughout Helen s education I have invariably assumed that she can understand whatever it is desirable for her to know Unless there had been in Helen s mind some such intellectual process as the questions indicate any explanation of them would have been unintelligible to her Without that degree of mental development and activity which perceives the necessity of superhuman creative power no explanation of natural phenomena is possible After she had succeeded in formulating the ideas which had been slowly growing in her mind they seemed suddenly to absorb all her thoughts and she became impatient to have everything explained As we were passing a large globe a short time after she had written the questions she stopped before it and asked Who made the REAL world I replied No one knows how the earth the sun and all the worlds which we call stars came to be but I will tell you how wise men have tried to account for their origin and to interpret the great and mysterious forces of nature She knew that the Greeks had many gods to whom they ascribed various powers because they believed that the sun the lightning and a hundred other natural forces were independent and superhuman powers But after a great deal of thought and study I told her men came to believe that all forces were manifestations of one power and to that power they gave the name GOD She was very still for a few minutes evidently thinking earnestly She then asked Who made God I was compelled to evade her question for I could not explain to her the mystery of a self existent being Indeed many of her eager questions would have puzzled a far wiser person than I am Here are some of them What did God make the new worlds out of Where did He get the soil and the water and the seeds and the first animals Where is God Did you ever see God I told her that God was everywhere and that she must not think of Him as a person but as the life the mind the soul of everything She interrupted me Everything does not have life The rocks have not life and they cannot think It is often necessary to remind her that there are infinitely many things that the wisest people in the world cannot explain No creed or dogma has been taught to Helen nor has any effort been made to force religious beliefs upon her attention Being fully aware of my own incompetence to give her any adequate explanations of the mysteries which underlie the names of God soul and immortality I have always felt obliged by a sense of duty to my pupil to say as little as possible about spiritual matters The Rt reverend Phillips Brooks has explained to her in a beautiful way the fatherhood of God She has not as yet been allowed to read the Bible because I do not see how she can do so at present without getting a very erroneous conception of the attributes of God I have already told her in simple language of the beautiful and helpful life of Jesus and of His cruel death The narrative affected her greatly when first she listened to it When she referred to our conversation again it was to ask Why did not Jesus go away so that His enemies could not find Him She thought the miracles of Jesus very strange When told that Jesus walked on the sea to meet His disciples she said decidedly It does not mean WALKED it means SWAM When told of the instance in which Jesus raised the dead she was much perplexed saying I did not know life could come back into the dead body One day she said sadly I am blind and deaf That is why I cannot see God I taught her the word INVISIBLE and told her we could not see God with our eyes because He was a spirit but that when our hearts were full of goodness and gentleness then we saw Him because then we were more like Him At another time she asked What is a soul No one knows what the soul is like I replied but we know that it is not the body and it is that part of us which thinks and loves and hopes and which Christian people believe will live on after the body is dead I then asked her Can you think of your soul as separate from your body Oh yes she replied because last hour I was thinking very hard of mister Anagnos and then my mind then changing the word my soul was in Athens but my body was here in the study At this moment another thought seemed to flash through her mind and she added But mister Anagnos did not speak to my soul I explained to her that the soul too is invisible or in other words that it is without apparent form But if I write what my soul thinks she said then it will be visible and the words will be its body A long time ago Helen said to me I would like to live sixteen hundred years When asked if she would not like to live ALWAYS in a beautiful country called heaven her first question was Where is heaven I was obliged to confess that I did not know but suggested that it might be on one of the stars A moment after she said Will you please go first and tell me all about it and then she added Tuscumbia is a very beautiful little town It was more than a year before she alluded to the subject again and when she did return to it her questions were numerous and persistent She asked Where is heaven and what is it like Why cannot we know as much about heaven as we do about foreign countries I told her in very simple language that there may be many places called heaven but that essentially it was a condition the fulfilment of the heart s desire the satisfaction of its wants and that heaven existed wherever RIGHT was acknowledged believed in and loved She shrinks from the thought of death with evident dismay Recently on being shown a deer which had been killed by her brother she was greatly distressed and asked sorrowfully Why must everything die even the fleet footed deer At another time she asked Do you not think we would be very much happier always if we did not have to die I said No because if there were no death our world would soon be so crowded with living creatures that it would be impossible for any of them to live comfortably But said Helen quickly I think God could make some more worlds as well as He made this one When friends have told her of the great happiness which awaits her in another life she instantly asked How do you know if you have not been dead The literal sense in which she sometimes takes common words and idioms shows how necessary it is that we should make sure that she receives their correct meaning When told recently that Hungarians were born musicians she asked in surprise Do they sing when they are born When her friend added that some of the pupils he had seen in Budapest had more than one hundred tunes in their heads she said laughing I think their heads must be very noisy She sees the ridiculous quickly and instead of being seriously troubled by metaphorical language she is often amused at her own too literal conception of its meaning Having been told that the soul was without form she was much perplexed at David s words He leadeth my soul Has it feet Can it walk Is it blind she asked for in her mind the idea of being led was associated with blindness Of all the subjects which perplex and trouble Helen none distresses her so much as the knowledge of the existence of evil and of the suffering which results from it For a long time it was possible to keep this knowledge from her and it will always be comparatively easy to prevent her from coming in personal contact with vice and wickedness The fact that sin exists and that great misery results from it dawned gradually upon her mind as she understood more and more clearly the lives and experiences of those around her The necessity of laws and penalties had to be explained to her She found it very hard to reconcile the presence of evil in the world with the idea of God which had been presented to her mind One day she asked Does God take care of us all the time She was answered in the affirmative Then why did He let little sister fall this morning and hurt her head so badly Another time she was asking about the power and goodness of God She had been told of a terrible storm at sea in which several lives were lost and she asked Why did not God save the people if He can do all things Surrounded by loving friends and the gentlest influences as Helen had always been she has from the earliest stage of her intellectual enlightenment willingly done right She knows with unerring instinct what is right and does it joyously She does not think of one wrong act as harmless of another as of no consequence and of another as not intended To her pure soul all evil is equally unlovely These passages from the paper Miss Sullivan prepared for the meeting at Chautauqua in July eighteen ninety four of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf contain her latest written account of her methods You must not imagine that as soon as Helen grasped the idea that everything had a name she at once became mistress of the treasury of the English language or that her mental faculties emerged full armed from their then living tomb as Pallas Athene from the head of Zeus as one of her enthusiastic admirers would have us believe At first the words phrases and sentences which she used in expressing her thoughts were all reproductions of what we had used in conversation with her and which her memory had unconsciously retained And indeed this is true of the language of all children Their language is the memory of the language they hear spoken in their homes Countless repetition of the conversation of daily life has impressed certain words and phrases upon their memories and when they come to talk themselves memory supplies the words they lisp Likewise the language of educated people is the memory of the language of books Language grows out of life out of its needs and experiences At first my little pupil s mind was all but vacant She had been living in a world she could not realize LANGUAGE and KNOWLEDGE are indissolubly connected they are interdependent Good work in language presupposes and depends on a real knowledge of things As soon as Helen grasped the idea that everything had a name and that by means of the manual alphabet these names could be transmitted from one to another I proceeded to awaken her further interest in the OBJECTS whose names she learned to spell with such evident joy I NEVER TAUGHT LANGUAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF TEACHING IT but invariably used language as a medium for the communication of THOUGHT thus the learning of language was COINCIDENT with the acquisition of knowledge In order to use language intelligently one must have something to talk ABOUT and having something to talk about is the result of having had experiences no amount of language training will enable our little children to use language with ease and fluency unless they have something clearly in their minds which they wish to communicate or unless we succeed in awakening in them a desire to know what is in the minds of others At first I did not attempt to confine my pupil to any system I always tried to find out what interested her most and made that the starting point for the new lesson whether it had any bearing on the lesson I had planned to teach or not During the first two years of her intellectual life I required Helen to write very little In order to write one must have something to write about and having something to write about requires some mental preparation The memory must be stored with ideas and the mind must be enriched with knowledge before writing becomes a natural and pleasurable effort Too often I think children are required to write before they have anything to say Teach them to think and read and talk without self repression and they will write because they cannot help it Helen acquired language by practice and habit rather than by study of rules and definitions Grammar with its puzzling array of classifications nomenclatures and paradigms was wholly discarded in her education She learned language by being brought in contact with the LIVING language itself she was made to deal with it in everyday conversation and in her books and to turn it over in a variety of ways until she was able to use it correctly No doubt I talked much more with my fingers and more constantly than I should have done with my mouth for had she possessed the use of sight and hearing she would have been less dependent on me for entertainment and instruction I believe every child has hidden away somewhere in his being noble capacities which may be quickened and developed if we go about it in the right way but we shall never properly develop the higher natures of our little ones while we continue to fill their minds with the so called rudiments Mathematics will never make them loving nor will the accurate knowledge of the size and shape of the world help them to appreciate its beauties Let us lead them during the first years to find their greatest pleasure in Nature Let them run in the fields learn about animals and observe real things Children will educate themselves under right conditions They require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction I think much of the fluency with which Helen uses language is due to the fact that nearly every impression which she receives comes through the medium of language But after due allowance has been made for Helen s natural aptitude for acquiring language and for the advantage resulting from her peculiar environment I think that we shall still find that the constant companionship of good books has been of supreme importance in her education It may be true as some maintain that language cannot express to us much beyond what we have lived and experienced but I have always observed that children manifest the greatest delight in the lofty poetic language which we are too ready to think beyond their comprehension This is all you will understand said a teacher to a class of little children closing the book which she had been reading to them Oh please read us the rest even if we won t understand it they pleaded delighted with the rhythm and the beauty which they felt even though they could not have explained it It is not necessary that a child should understand every word in a book before he can read with pleasure and profit Indeed only such explanations should be given as are really essential Helen drank in language which she at first could not understand and it remained in her mind until needed when it fitted itself naturally and easily into her conversation and compositions Indeed it is maintained by some that she reads too much that a great deal of originative force is dissipated in the enjoyment of books that when she might see and say things for herself she sees them only through the eyes of others and says them in their language but I am convinced that original composition without the preparation of much reading is an impossibility Helen has had the best and purest models in language constantly presented to her and her conversation and her writing are unconscious reproductions of what she has read Reading I think should be kept independent of the regular school exercises Children should be encouraged to read for the pure delight of it The attitude of the child toward his books should be that of unconscious receptivity The great works of the imagination ought to become a part of his life as they were once of the very substance of the men who wrote them It is true the more sensitive and imaginative the mind is that receives the thought pictures and images of literature the more nicely the finest lines are reproduced Helen has the vitality of feeling the freshness and eagerness of interest and the spiritual insight of the artistic temperament and naturally she has a more active and intense joy in life simply as life and in nature books and people than less gifted mortals Her mind is so filled with the beautiful thoughts and ideals of the great poets that nothing seems commonplace to her for her imagination colours all life with its own rich hues There has been much discussion of such of Miss Sullivan s statements and explanations as have been published before Too much has been written by people who do not know the problems of the deaf at first hand and I do not care to add much to it Miss Keller s education however is so fundamentally a question of language teaching that it rather includes the problems of the deaf than limits itself to the deaf alone Teachers can draw their own conclusions For the majority of readers who will not approach Miss Keller s life from the educator s point of view I will summarize a few principal things in Miss Sullivan s methods Miss Sullivan has begun where doctor Howe left off He invented the instrument the physical means of working but the teaching of language is quite another thing from the mechanical means by which language may be taught By experiment by studying other children Miss Sullivan came upon the practical way of teaching language by the natural method It was for this natural method that doctor Howe was groping but he never got to this idea that a deaf child should not be taught each word separately by definition but should be given language by endless repetition of language which it does not understand And this is Miss Sullivan s great discovery All day long in their play time and work time Miss Sullivan kept spelling into her pupil s hand and by that Helen Keller absorbed words just as the child in the cradle absorbs words by hearing thousands of them before he uses one and by associating the words with the occasion of their utterance Thus he learns that words name things and actions and feelings Now that is the first principle in Miss Sullivan s method one that had practical results and one which so far as I can discover had never been put in practice in the education of a deaf child not to say a deaf blind child until Miss Sullivan tried it with Helen Keller And the principle had never been formulated clearly until Miss Sullivan wrote her letters The second principle in her method the numerical order is of course arbitrary is never to talk to the child about things distasteful or wearisome to him In the first deaf school Miss Sullivan ever visited the teacher was busy at the blackboard telling the children by written words something they did not want to know while they were crowding round their visitor with wide awake curiosity showing there were a thousand things they did want to know Why not says Miss Sullivan make a language lesson out of what they were interested in Akin to this idea of talking to the child about what interests him is the principle never to silence a child who asks questions but to answer the questions as truly as possible for says Miss Sullivan the question is the door to the child s mind Miss Sullivan never needlessly belittled her ideas or expressions to suit the supposed state of the child s intelligence She urged every one to speak to Helen naturally to give her full sentences and intelligent ideas never minding whether Helen understood or not Thus Miss Sullivan knew what so many people do not understand that after the first rudimentary definitions of HAT CUP GO SIT the unit of language as the child learns it is the sentence which is also the unit of language in our adult experience We do not take in a sentence word by word but as a whole It is the proposition something predicated about something that conveys an idea True single words do suggest and express ideas the child may say simply mamma when he means Where is mamma but he learns the expression of the ideas that relate to mamma he learns language by hearing complete sentences And though Miss Sullivan did not force grammatical completeness upon the first finger lispings of her pupil yet when she herself repeated Helen s sentence mamma milk she filled out the construction completed the child s ellipsis and said Mamma will bring Helen some milk Thus Miss Sullivan was working out a natural method which is so simple so lacking in artificial system that her method seems rather to be a destruction of method It is doubtful if we should have heard of Helen Keller if Miss Sullivan had not been where there were other children By watching them she learned to treat her pupil as nearly as possible like an ordinary child The manual alphabet was not the only means of presenting words to Helen Keller s fingers Books supplemented perhaps equaled in importance the manual alphabet as a means of teaching language Helen sat poring over them before she could read not at first for the story but to find words she knew and the definition of new words which is implied in their context in their position with reference to words known added to Helen s vocabulary Books are the storehouse of language and any child whether deaf or not if he has his attention attracted in any way to printed pages must learn He learns not by reading what he understands but by reading and remembering words he does not understand And though perhaps few children will have as much precocious interest in books as did Helen Keller yet the natural curiosity of every healthy child may be turned to printed pages especially if the teacher is clever and plays a word game as Miss Sullivan did Helen Keller is supposed to have a special aptitude for languages It is true rather that she has a special aptitude for thinking and her leaning toward language is due to the fact that language to her meant life It was not a special subject like geography or arithmetic but her way to outward things When at the age of fourteen she had had but a few lessons in German she read over the words of Wilhelm Tell and managed to get the story Of grammar she knew nothing and she cared nothing for it She got the language from the language itself and this is next to hearing the language spoken the way for any one to get a foreign tongue more vital and in the end easier than our schoolroom method of beginning with the grammar In the same way she played with Latin learning not only from the lessons her first Latin teacher gave her but from going over and over the words of a text a game she played by herself mister John D Wright one of her teachers at the Wright Humason School says in a letter to me Often I found her when she had a little leisure sitting in her favourite corner in a chair whose arms supported the big volume prepared for the blind and passing her finger slowly over the lines of Moliere s Le Medecin Malgre Lui chuckling to herself at the comical situations and humorous lines At that time her actual working vocabulary in French was very small but by using her judgment as we laughingly called the mental process she could guess at the meanings of the words and put the sense together much as a child puzzles out a sliced object The result was that in a few weeks she and I spent a most hilarious hour one evening while she poured out to me the whole story dwelling with great gusto on its humour and sparkling wit It was not a lesson but only one of her recreations So Helen Keller s aptitude for language is her whole mental aptitude turned to language because of its extraordinary value to her There have been many discussions of the question whether Helen Keller s achievements are due to her natural ability or to the method by which she was taught It is true that a teacher with ten times Miss Sullivan s genius could not have made a pupil so remarkable as Helen Keller out of a child born dull and mentally deficient But it is also true that with ten times her native genius Helen Keller could not have grown to what she is if she had not been excellently taught from the very start and especially at the start And the fact remains that she was taught by a method of teaching language to the deaf the essential principles of which are clearly expressed in Miss Sullivan s letters written while she was discovering the method and putting it successfully into practice And it can be applied by any teacher to any healthy deaf child and in the broadest interpretation of the principles can be applied to the teaching of language of all kinds to all children In the many discussions of this question writers seem to throw us from one horn to another of a dilemma either a born genius in Helen Keller or a perfect method in the teacher Both things may be true at once and there is another truth which makes the dilemma imperfect Miss Sullivan is a person of extraordinary power Her method might not succeed so completely in the hands of any one else Miss Sullivan s vigorous original mind has lent much of its vitality to her pupil If Miss Keller is fond of language and not interested especially in mathematics it is not surprising to find Miss Sullivan s interests very similar And this does not mean that Miss Keller is unduly dependent on her teacher It is told of her that as a child of eight when some one tried to interfere with her she sat sober a few moments and when asked what was the trouble answered I am preparing to assert my independence Such an aggressive personality cannot grow up in mere dependence even under the guidance of a will like Miss Sullivan s But Miss Sullivan by her natural aptitude has done for her pupil much that is not capable of analysis and reduction to principle she has given the inspiration which is in all close friendship and which rather develops than limits the powers of either person Moreover if Miss Keller is a marvel of sweetness and goodness if she has a love of all things good and beautiful this implies something about the teacher who has lived with her for sixteen years There is then a good deal that Miss Sullivan has done for Miss Keller which no other teacher can do in just the same way for any one else To have another Helen Keller there must be another Miss Sullivan To have another well educated deaf and blind child there need only be another teacher living under favourable conditions among plenty of external interests unseparated from her pupil allowed to have a free hand and using as many as she needs of the principles which Miss Sullivan has saved her the trouble of finding out for herself modifying and adding as she finds it necessary and there must be a pupil in good health of good native powers young enough not to have grown beyond recovery in ignorance Any deaf child or deaf and blind child in good health can be taught And the one to do it is the parent or the special teacher not the school I know that this idea will be vigorously combated by those who conduct schools for the deaf To be sure the deaf school is the only thing possible for children educated by the State But it is evident that precisely what the deaf child needs to be taught is what other children learn before they go to school at all When Miss Sullivan went out in the barnyard and picked up a little chicken and talked to Helen about it she was giving a kind of instruction impossible inside four walls and impossible with more than one pupil at a time Surely doctor Howe is wrong when he says A teacher cannot be a child That is just what the teacher of the deaf child must be a child ready to play and romp and interested in all childish things The temptation to discuss solely in the light of Helen Keller the whole matter of educating the deaf is a dangerous one and one which I have not taken particular care to avoid because my opinions are of no authority and I have merely tried to suggest problems and reinforce some of the main ideas expressed by Miss Sullivan who is an authority It is a question whether Helen Keller s success has not led teachers to expect too much of other children and I know of deaf blind children who are dragged along by their teachers and friends and become the subjects of glowing reports which are pathetically untrue because one sees behind the reports how the children are tugged at to bring them somewhere near the exaggerated things that are said about them Let me sum up a few of the elements that made Helen Keller what she is In the first place she had nineteen months experience of sight and sound This meant some mental development She had inherited vigour of body and mind She expressed ideas in signs before she learned language missus Keller writes me that before her illness Helen made signs for everything and her mother thought this habit the cause of her slowness in learning to speak After the illness when they were dependent on signs Helen s tendency to gesture developed How far she could receive communications is hard to determine but she knew much that was going on around her She recognized that others used their lips she saw her father reading a paper and when he laid it down she sat in his chair and held the paper before her face Her early rages were an unhappy expression of the natural force of character which instruction was to turn into trained and organized power It was then to a good subject that Miss Sullivan brought her devotion and intelligence and fearless willingness to experiment Miss Sullivan s methods were so good that even without the practical result any one would recognize the truth of the teacher s ideas Miss Sullivan has in addition a vigorous personality And finally all the conditions were good for that first nature school in which the teacher and pupil played together exploring together and educating themselves pupil and teacher inseparable Miss Keller s later education is easy to understand and needs no further explanation than she has given Those interested may get on application to the Volta Bureau Washington D C the reports of the teachers who prepared her for college mister Arthur Gilman of the Cambridge School for Young Ladies and mister Merton S Keith CHAPTER IV SPEECH The two persons who have written authoritatively about Miss Keller s speech and the way she learned it are Miss Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School for the Deaf in Boston Massachusetts who gave her the first lessons and Miss Sullivan who by her unremitting discipline carried on the success of these first lessons Before I quote from Miss Sullivan s account let me try to give some impression of what Miss Keller s speech and voice qualities are at present Her voice is low and pleasant to listen to Her speech lacks variety and modulation it runs in a sing song when she is reading aloud and when she speaks with fair degree of loudness it hovers about two or three middle tones Her voice has an aspirate quality there seems always to be too much breath for the amount of tone Some of her notes are musical and charming When she is telling a child s story or one with pathos in it her voice runs into pretty slurs from one tone to another This is like the effect of the slow dwelling on long words not quite well managed that one notices in a child who is telling a solemn story The principal thing that is lacking is sentence accent and variety in the inflection of phrases Miss Keller pronounces each word as a foreigner does when he is still labouring with the elements of a sentence or as children sometimes read in school when they have to pick out each word She speaks French and German Her friend mister John Hitz whose native tongue is German says that her pronunciation is excellent Another friend who is as familiar with French as with English finds her French much more intelligible than her English When she speaks English she distributes her emphasis as in French and so does not put sufficient stress on accented syllables She says for example pro vo ca tion in di vi du al with ever so little difference between the value of syllables and a good deal of inconsistency in the pronunciation of the same word one day and the next It would I think be hard to make her feel just how to pronounce DICTIONARY without her erring either toward DICTIONAYRY or DICTION RY and of course the word is neither one nor the other For no system of marks in a lexicon can tell one how to pronounce a word The only way is to hear it especially in a language like English which is so full of unspellable suppressed vowels and quasi vowels Miss Keller s vowels are not firm Her AWFUL is nearly AWFIL The wavering is caused by the absence of accent on FUL for she pronounces FULL correctly She sometimes mispronounces as she reads aloud and comes on a word which she happens never to have uttered though she may have written it many times This difficulty and some others may be corrected when she and Miss Sullivan have more time Since eighteen ninety four they have been so much in their books that they have neglected everything that was not necessary to the immediate task of passing the school years successfully Miss Keller will never be able I believe to speak loud without destroying the pleasant quality and the distinctness of her words but she can do much to make her speech clearer When she was at the Wright Humason School in New York doctor Humason tried to improve her voice not only her word pronunciation but the voice itself and gave her lessons in tone and vocal exercises It is hard to say whether or not Miss Keller s speech is easy to understand Some understand her readily others do not Her friends grow accustomed to her speech and forget that it is different from that of any one else Children seldom have any difficulty in understanding her which suggests that her deliberate measured speech is like theirs before they come to the adult trick of running all the words of a phrase into one movement of the breath I am told that Miss Keller speaks better than most other deaf people Miss Keller has told how she learned to speak Miss Sullivan s account in her address at Chautauqua in July eighteen ninety four at the meeting of The American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf is substantially like Miss Keller s in points of fact MISS SULLIVAN S ACCOUNT OF MISS KELLER S SPEECH It was three years from the time when Helen began to communicate by means of the manual alphabet that she received her first lesson in the more natural and universal medium of human intercourse oral language She had become very proficient in the use of the manual alphabet which was her only means of communication with the outside world through it she had acquired a vocabulary which enabled her to converse freely read intelligently and write with comparative ease and correctness Nevertheless the impulse to utter audible sounds was strong within her and the constant efforts which I made to repress this instinctive tendency which I feared in time would become unpleasant were of no avail I made no effort to teach her to speak because I regarded her inability to watch the lips of others as an insurmountable obstacle But she gradually became conscious that her way of communicating was different from that used by those around her and one day her thoughts found expression How do the blind girls know what to say with their mouths Why do you not teach me to talk like them Do deaf children ever learn to speak I explained to her that some deaf children were taught to speak but that they could see their teachers mouths and that that was a very great assistance to them But she interrupted me to say she was very sure she could feel my mouth very well Soon after this conversation a lady came to see her and told her about the deaf and blind Norwegian child Ragnhild Kaata who had been taught to speak and understand what her teacher said to her by touching his lips with her fingers She at once resolved to learn to speak and from that day to this she has never wavered in that resolution She began immediately to make sounds which she called speaking and I saw the necessity of correct instruction since her heart was set upon learning to talk and feeling my own incompetence to teach her never having given the subject of articulation serious study I went with my pupil for advice and assistance to Miss Sarah Fuller Miss Fuller was delighted with Helen s earnestness and enthusiasm and at once began to teach her In a few lessons she learned nearly all of the English sounds and in less than a month she was able to articulate a great many words distinctly From the first she was not content to be drilled in single sounds but was impatient to pronounce words and sentences The length of the word or the difficulty of the arrangement of the elements never seemed to discourage her But with all her eagerness and intelligence learning to speak taxed her powers to the utmost But there was satisfaction in seeing from day to day the evidence of growing mastery and the possibility of final success And Helen s success has been more complete and inspiring than any of her friends expected and the child s delight in being able to utter her thoughts in living and distinct speech is shared by all who witness her pleasure when strangers tell her that they understand her I have been asked a great many times whether I think Helen will ever speak naturally that is as other people speak I am hardly prepared to decide that question or even give an opinion regarding it I believe that I have hardly begun yet to know what is possible Teachers of the deaf often express surprise that Helen s speech is so good when she has not received any regular instruction in speech since the first few lessons given her by Miss Fuller I can only say in reply This is due to habitual imitation and practice practice practice Nature has determined how the child shall learn to speak and all we can do is to aid him in the simplest easiest way possible by encouraging him to observe and imitate the vibrations in the voice Some further details appear in an earlier more detailed account which Miss Sullivan wrote for the Perkins Institution Report of eighteen ninety one I knew that Laura Bridgman had shown the same intuitive desire to produce sounds and had even learned to pronounce a few simple words which she took great delight in using and I did not doubt that Helen could accomplish as much as this I thought however that the advantage she would derive would not repay her for the time and labour that such an experiment would cost Moreover the absence of hearing renders the voice monotonous and often very disagreeable and such speech is generally unintelligible except to those familiar with the speaker The acquiring of speech by untaught deaf children is always slow and often painful Too much stress it seems to me is often laid upon the importance of teaching a deaf child to articulate a process which may be detrimental to the pupil s intellectual development In the very nature of things articulation is an unsatisfactory means of education while the use of the manual alphabet quickens and invigorates mental activity since through it the deaf child is brought into close contact with the English language and the highest and most abstract ideas may be conveyed to the mind readily and accurately Helen s case proved it to be also an invaluable aid in acquiring articulation She was already perfectly familiar with words and the construction of sentences and had only mechanical difficulties to overcome Moreover she knew what a pleasure speech would be to her and this definite knowledge of what she was striving for gave her the delight of anticipation which made drudgery easy The untaught deaf child who is made to articulate does not know what the goal is and his lessons in speech are for a long time tedious and meaningless Before describing the process of teaching Helen to speak it may be well to state briefly to what extent she had used the vocal organs before she began to receive regular instruction in articulation When she was stricken down with the illness which resulted in her loss of sight and hearing at the age of nineteen months she was learning to talk The unmeaning babblings of the infant were becoming day by day conscious and voluntary signs of what she felt and thought But the disease checked her progress in the acquisition of oral language and when her physical strength returned it was found that she had ceased to speak intelligibly because she could no longer hear a sound She continued to exercise her vocal organs mechanically as ordinary children do Her cries and laughter and the tones of her voice as she pronounced many word elements were perfectly natural but the child evidently attached no significance to them and with one exception they were produced not with any intention of communicating with those around her but from the sheer necessity of exercising her innate organic and hereditary faculty of expression She always attached a meaning to the word water which was one of the first sounds her baby lips learned to form and it was the only word which she continued to articulate after she lost her hearing Her pronunciation of this gradually became indistinct and when I first knew her it was nothing more than a peculiar noise Nevertheless it was the only sign she ever made for water and not until she had learned to spell the word with her fingers did she forget the spoken symbol The word water and the gesture which corresponds to the word good by seem to have been all that the child remembered of the natural and acquired signs with which she had been familiar before her illness As she became acquainted with her surroundings through the sense of feeling I use the word in the broadest sense as including all tactile impressions she felt more and more the pressing necessity of communicating with those around her Her little hands felt every object and observed every movement of the persons about her and she was quick to imitate these movements She was thus able to express her more imperative needs and many of her thoughts At the time when I became her teacher she had made for herself upward of sixty signs all of which were imitative and were readily understood by those who knew her The only signs which I think she may have invented were her signs for SMALL and LARGE Whenever she wished for anything very much she would gesticulate in a very expressive manner Failing to make herself understood she would become violent In the years of her mental imprisonment she depended entirely upon signs and she did not work out for herself any sort of articulate language capable of expressing ideas It seems however that while she was still suffering from severe pain she noticed the movements of her mother s lips When she was not occupied she wandered restlessly about the house making strange though rarely unpleasant sounds I have seen her rock her doll making a continuous monotonous sound keeping one hand on her throat while the fingers of the other hand noted the movements of her lips This was in imitation of her mother s crooning to the baby Occasionally she broke out into a merry laugh and then she would reach out and touch the mouth of any one who happened to be near her to see if he were laughing also If she detected no smile she gesticulated excitedly trying to convey her thought but if she failed to make her companion laugh she sat still for a few moments with a troubled and disappointed expression She was pleased with anything which made a noise She liked to feel the cat purr and if by chance she felt a dog in the act of barking she showed great pleasure She always liked to stand by the piano when some one was playing and singing She kept one hand on the singer s mouth while the other rested on the piano and she stood in this position as long as any one would sing to her and afterward she would make a continuous sound which she called singing The only words she had learned to pronounce with any degree of distinctness previous to March eighteen ninety were PAPA MAMMA BABY SISTER These words she had caught without instruction from the lips of friends It will be seen that they contain three vowel and six consonant elements and these formed the foundation for her first real lesson in speaking At the end of the first lesson she was able to pronounce distinctly the following sounds a a a e i o c soft like s and hard like k g hard b l n m t p s u k f and d Hard consonants were and indeed still are very difficult for her to pronounce in connection with one another in the same word she often suppresses the one and changes the other and sometimes she replaces both by an analogous sound with soft aspiration The confusion between l and r was very noticeable in her speech at first She would repeatedly use one for the other The great difficulty in the pronunciation of the r made it one of the last elements which she mastered The ch sh and soft g also gave her much trouble and she does not yet enunciate them clearly The difficulties which Miss Sullivan found in eighteen ninety one are in a measure the difficulties which show in Miss Keller s speech today When she had been talking for less than a week she met her friend mister Rodocanachi and immediately began to struggle with the pronunciation of his name nor would she give it up until she was able to articulate the word distinctly Her interest never diminished for a moment and in her eagerness to overcome the difficulties which beset her on all sides she taxed her powers to the utmost and learned in eleven lessons all of the separate elements of speech Enough appears in the accounts by Miss Keller s teacher to show the process by which she reads the lips with her fingers the process by which she was taught to speak and by which of course she can listen to conversation now In reading the lips she is not so quick or so accurate as some reports declare It is a clumsy and unsatisfactory way of receiving communication useless when Miss Sullivan or some one else who knows the manual alphabet is present to give Miss Keller the spoken words of others Indeed when some friend is trying to speak to Miss Keller and the attempt is not proving successful Miss Sullivan usually helps by spelling the lost words into Miss Keller s hand President Roosevelt had little difficulty last spring in making Miss Keller understand him and especially requested Miss Sullivan not to spell into her hand She got every word for the President s speech is notably distinct Other people say they have no success in making Miss Keller hear them A few friends to whom she is accustomed like missus A C Pratt and mister J E Chamberlin can pass a whole day with her and tell her everything without the manual alphabet The ability to read the lips helps Miss Keller in getting corrections of her pronunciation from Miss Sullivan and others just as it was the means of her learning to speak at all but it is rather an accomplishment than a necessity It must be remembered that speech contributed in no way to her fundamental education though without the ability to speak she could hardly have gone to higher schools and to college But she knows better than any one else what value speech has had for her The following is her address at the fifth meeting of the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf at Mt Airy Philadelphia Pennsylvania July eight eighteen ninety six ADDRESS OF HELEN KELLER AT MT AIRY If you knew all the joy I feel in being able to speak to you to day I think you would have some idea of the value of speech to the deaf and you would understand why I want every little deaf child in all this great world to have an opportunity to learn to speak I know that much has been said and written on this subject and that there is a wide difference of opinion among teachers of the deaf in regard to oral instruction It seems very strange to me that there should be this difference of opinion I cannot understand how any one interested in our education can fail to appreciate the satisfaction we feel in being able to express our thoughts in living words Why I use speech constantly and I cannot begin to tell you how much pleasure it gives me to do so Of course I know that it is not always easy for strangers to understand me but it will be by and by and in the meantime I have the unspeakable happiness of knowing that my family and friends rejoice in my ability to speak My little sister and baby brother love to have me tell them stories in the long summer evenings when I am at home and my mother and teacher often ask me to read to them from my favourite books I also discuss the political situation with my dear father and we decide the most perplexing questions quite as satisfactorily to ourselves as if I could see and hear So you see what a blessing speech is to me It brings me into closer and tenderer relationship with those I love and makes it possible for me to enjoy the sweet companionship of a great many persons from whom I should be entirely cut off if I could not talk I can remember the time before I learned to speak and how I used to struggle to express my thoughts by means of the manual alphabet how my thoughts used to beat against my finger tips like little birds striving to gain their freedom until one day Miss Fuller opened wide the prison door and let them escape I wonder if she remembers how eagerly and gladly they spread their wings and flew away Of course it was not easy at first to fly The speech wings were weak and broken and had lost all the grace and beauty that had once been theirs indeed nothing was left save the impulse to fly but that was something One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar But nevertheless it seemed to me sometimes that I could never use my speech wings as God intended I should use them there were so many difficulties in the way so many discouragements but I kept on trying knowing that patience and perseverance would win in the end And while I worked I built the most beautiful air castles and dreamed dreams the pleasantest of which was of the time when I should talk like other people and the thought of the pleasure it would give my mother to hear my voice once more sweetened every effort and made every failure an incentive to try harder next time So I want to say to those who are trying to learn to speak and those who are teaching them Be of good cheer Do not think of to days failures but of the success that may come to morrow You have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles a delight in climbing rugged paths which you would perhaps never know if you did not sometime slip backward if the road was always smooth and pleasant Remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost Sometime somewhere somehow we shall find that which we seek We shall speak yes and sing too as God intended we should speak and sing CHAPTER V LITERARY STYLE No one can have read Miss Keller s autobiography without feeling that she writes unusually fine English Any teacher of composition knows that he can bring his pupils to the point of writing without errors in syntax or in the choice of words It is just this accuracy which Miss Keller s early education fixes as the point to which any healthy child can be brought and which the analysis of that education accounts for Those who try to make her an exception not to be explained by any such analysis of her early education fortify their position by an appeal to the remarkable excellence of her use of language even when she was a child This appeal is to a certain degree valid for indeed those additional harmonies of language and beauties of thought which make style are the gifts of the gods No teacher could have made Helen Keller sensitive to the beauties of language and to the finer interplay of thought which demands expression in melodious word groupings At the same time the inborn gift of style can be starved or stimulated No innate genius can invent fine language The stuff of which good style is made must be given to the mind from without and given skilfully A child of the muses cannot write fine English unless fine English has been its nourishment In this as in all other things Miss Sullivan has been the wise teacher If she had not had taste and an enthusiasm for good English Helen Keller might have been brought up on the Juvenile Literature which belittles the language under pretense of being simply phrased for children as if a child s book could not like Treasure Island or Robinson Crusoe or the Jungle Book be in good style If Miss Sullivan wrote fine English the beauty of Helen Keller s style would in part be explicable at once But the extracts from Miss Sullivan s letters and from her reports although they are clear and accurate have not the beauty which distinguishes Miss Keller s English Her service as a teacher of English is not to be measured by her own skill in composition The reason why she read to her pupil so many good books is due in some measure to the fact that she had so recently recovered her eyesight When she became Helen Keller s teacher she was just awakening to the good things that are in books from which she had been shut out during her years of blindness In Captain Keller s library she found excellent books Lamb s Tales from Shakespeare and better still Montaigne After the first year or so of elementary work she met her pupil on equal terms and they read and enjoyed good books together Besides the selection of good books there is one other cause for Miss Keller s excellence in writing for which Miss Sullivan deserves unlimited credit That is her tireless and unrelenting discipline which is evident in all her work She never allowed her pupil to send off letters which contained offenses against taste but made her write them over until they were not only correct but charming and well phrased Any one who has tried to write knows what Miss Keller owes to the endless practice which Miss Sullivan demanded of her Let a teacher with a liking for good style insist on a child s writing a paragraph over and over again until it is more than correct and he will be training even beyond his own power of expression the power of expression in the child How far Miss Sullivan carried this process of refinement and selection is evident from the humorous comment of doctor Bell that she made her pupil a little old woman too widely different from ordinary children in her maturity of thought When doctor Bell said this he was arguing his own case For it was doctor Bell who first saw the principles that underlie Miss Sullivan s method and explained the process by which Helen Keller absorbed language from books There is moreover a reason why Helen Keller writes good English which lies in the very absence of sight and hearing The disadvantages of being deaf and blind were overcome and the advantages remained She excels other deaf people because she was taught as if she were normal On the other hand the peculiar value to her of language which ordinary people take for granted as a necessary part of them like their right hand made her think about language and love it Language was her liberator and from the first she cherished it The proof of Miss Keller s early skill in the use of English and the final comment on the excellence of this whole method of teaching is contained in an incident which although at the time it seemed unfortunate can no longer be regretted I refer to the Frost King episode which I shall explain in detail Miss Keller has given her account of it and the whole matter was discussed in the first Volta Bureau Souvenir from which I quote at length MISS SULLIVAN S ACCOUNT OF THE FROST KING honorable JOHN HITZ Superintendent of the Volta Bureau Washington D C Dear Sir Since my paper was prepared for the second edition of the Souvenir Helen Keller some facts have been brought to my notice which are of interest in connection with the subject of the acquisition of language by my pupil and if it is not already too late for publication in this issue of the Souvenir I shall be glad if I may have opportunity to explain them in detail Perhaps it will be remembered that in my paper where allusion is made to Helen s remarkable memory it is noted that she appears to retain in her mind many forms of expression which at the time they are received she probably does not understand but when further information is acquired the language retained in her memory finds full or partial expression in her conversation or writing according as it proves of greater or less value to her in the fitness of its application to the new experience Doubtless this is true in the case of every intelligent child and should not perhaps be considered worthy of especial mention in Helen s case but for the fact that a child who is deprived of the senses of sight and hearing might not be expected to be as gifted mentally as this little girl proves to be hence it is quite possible we may be inclined to class as marvelous many things we discover in the development of her mind which do not merit such an explanation In this paper Miss Sullivan says During this winter eighteen ninety one ninety two I went with her into the yard while a light snow was falling and let her feel the falling flakes She appeared to enjoy it very much indeed As we went in she repeated these words Out of the cloud folds of his garments Winter shakes the snow I inquired of her where she had read this she did not remember having read it did not seem to know that she had learned it As I had never heard it I inquired of several of my friends if they recalled the words no one seemed to remember it The teachers at the Institution expressed the opinion that the description did not appear in any book in raised print in that library but one lady Miss Marrett took upon herself the task of examining books of poems in ordinary type and was rewarded by finding the following lines in one of Longfellow s minor poems entitled Snowflakes Out of the bosom of the air Out of the cloud folds of her garments shaken Over the woodlands brown and bare Over the harvest fields forsaken Silent and soft and slow Descends the snow It would seem that Helen had learned and treasured the memory of this expression of the poet and this morning in the snow storm had found its application In the hope that I may be pardoned if I appear to overestimate the remarkable mental capacity and power of comprehension and discrimination which my pupil possesses I wish to add that while I have always known that Helen made great use of such descriptions and comparisons as appeal to her imagination and fine poetic nature yet recent developments in her writings convince me of the fact that I have not in the past been fully aware to what extent she absorbs the language of her favourite authors In the early part of her education I had full knowledge of all the books she read and of nearly all the stories which were read to her and could without difficulty trace the source of any adaptations noted in her writing or conversation and I have always been much pleased to observe how appropriately she applies the expressions of a favourite author in her own compositions The following extracts from a few of her published letters give evidence of how valuable this power of retaining the memory of beautiful language has been to her One warm sunny day in early spring when we were at the North the balmy atmosphere appears to have brought to her mind the sentiment expressed by Longfellow in Hiawatha and she almost sings with the poet The ground was all aquiver with the stir of new life My heart sang for very joy I thought of my own dear home I knew that in that sunny land spring had come in all its splendour All its birds and all its blossoms all its flowers and all its grasses About the same time in a letter to a friend in which she makes mention of her Southern home she gives so close a reproduction from a poem by one of her favourite authors that I will give extracts from Helen s letter and from the poem itself EXTRACTS FROM HELEN S LETTER The entire letter is published on pp two hundred forty five and two hundred forty six of the Report of the Perkins Institution for eighteen ninety one The blue bird with his azure plumes the thrush clad all in brown the robin jerking his spasmodic throat the oriole drifting like a flake of fire the jolly bobolink and his happy mate the mocking bird imitating the notes of all the red bird with his one sweet trill and the busy little wren are all making the trees in our front yard ring with their glad song FROM THE POEM ENTITLED SPRING BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES The bluebird breathing from his azure plumes The fragrance borrowed from the myrtle blooms The thrush poor wanderer dropping meekly down Clad in his remnant of autumnal brown The oriole drifting like a flake of fire Rent by a whirlwind from a blazing spire The robin jerking his spasmodic throat Repeats imperious his staccato note The crack brained bobolink courts his crazy mate Poised on a bullrush tipsy with his weight Nay in his cage the lone canary sings Feels the soft air and spreads his idle wings On the last day of April she uses another expression from the same poem which is more an adaptation than a reproduction To morrow April will hide her tears and blushes beneath the flowers of lovely May In a letter to a friend at the Perkins Institution dated May seventeen eighteen eighty nine she gives a reproduction from one of Hans Christian Andersen s stories which I had read to her not long before This letter is published in the Perkins Institution Report eighteen ninety one p two hundred four The original story was read to her from a copy of Andersen s Stories published by Leavitt Allen Bros and may be found on p ninety seven of Part I in that volume Her admiration for the impressive explanations which Bishop Brooks has given her of the Fatherhood of God is well known In one of his letters speaking of how God in every way tells us of His love he says I think he writes it even upon the walls of the great house of nature which we live in that he is our Father The next year at Andover she said It seems to me the world is full of goodness beauty and love and how grateful we must be to our heavenly Father who has given us so much to enjoy His love and care are written all over the walls of nature In these later years since Helen has come in contact with so many persons who are able to converse freely with her she has made the acquaintance of some literature with which I am not familiar she has also found in books printed in raised letters in the reading of which I have been unable to follow her much material for the cultivation of the taste she possesses for poetical imagery The pages of the book she reads become to her like paintings to which her imaginative powers give life and colour She is at once transported into the midst of the events portrayed in the story she reads or is told and the characters and descriptions become real to her she rejoices when justice wins and is sad when virtue goes unrewarded The pictures the language paints on her memory appear to make an indelible impression and many times when an experience comes to her similar in character the language starts forth with wonderful accuracy like the reflection from a mirror Helen s mind is so gifted by nature that she seems able to understand with only the faintest touch of explanation every possible variety of external relations One day in Alabama as we were gathering wild flowers near the springs on the hillsides she seemed to understand for the first time that the springs were surrounded by mountains and she exclaimed The mountains are crowding around the springs to look at their own beautiful reflections I do not know where she obtained this language yet it is evident that it must have come to her from without as it would hardly be possible for a person deprived of the visual sense to originate such an idea In mentioning a visit to Lexington Mass she writes As we rode along we could see the forest monarchs bend their proud forms to listen to the little children of the woodlands whispering their secrets The anemone the wild violet the hepatica and the funny little curled up ferns all peeped out at us from beneath the brown leaves She closes this letter with I must go to bed for Morpheus has touched my eyelids with his golden wand Here again I am unable to state where she acquired these expressions She has always seemed to prefer stories which exercise the imagination and catches and retains the poetic spirit in all such literature but not until this winter have I been conscious that her memory absorbed the exact language to such an extent that she is herself unable to trace the source This is shown in a little story she wrote in October last at the home of her parents in Tuscumbia which she called Autumn Leaves She was at work upon it about two weeks writing a little each day at her own pleasure When it was finished and we read it in the family it occasioned much comment on account of the beautiful imagery and we could not understand how Helen could describe such pictures without the aid of sight As we had never seen or heard of any such story as this before we inquired of her where she read it she replied I did not read it it is my story for mister Anagnos s birthday While I was surprised that she could write like this I was not more astonished than I had been many times before at the unexpected achievements of my little pupil especially as we had exchanged many beautiful thoughts on the subject of the glory of the ripening foliage during the autumn of this year Before Helen made her final copy of the story it was suggested to her to change its title to The Frost King as more appropriate to the subject of which the story treated to this she willingly assented The story was written by Helen in braille as usual and copied by her in the same manner I then interlined the manuscript for the greater convenience of those who desired to read it Helen wrote a little letter and enclosing the manuscript forwarded both by mail to mister Anagnos for his birthday The story was printed in the January number of the Mentor and from a review of it in the Goodson Gazette I was startled to find that a very similar story had been published in eighteen seventy three seven years before Helen was born This story Frost Fairies appeared in a book written by Miss Margaret T Canby entitled Birdie and his Fairy Friends The passages quoted from the two stories were so much alike in thought and expression as to convince me that Miss Canby s story must at some time have been read to Helen As I had never read this story or even heard of the book I inquired of Helen if she knew anything about the matter and found she did not She was utterly unable to recall either the name of the story or the book Careful examination was made of the books in raised print in the library of the Perkins Institution to learn if any extracts from this volume could be found there but nothing was discovered I then concluded that the story must have been read to her a long time ago as her memory usually retains with great distinctness facts and impressions which have been committed to its keeping After making careful inquiry I succeeded in obtaining the information that our friend missus S C Hopkins had a copy of this book in eighteen eighty eight which was presented to her little daughter in eighteen seventy three or eighteen seventy four Helen and I spent the summer of eighteen eighty eight with missus Hopkins at her home in Brewster Mass where she kindly relieved me a part of the time of the care of Helen She amused and entertained Helen by reading to her from a collection of juvenile publications among which was the copy of Birdie and his Fairy Friends and while missus Hopkins does not remember this story of Frost Fairies she is confident that she read to Helen extracts if not entire stories from this volume But as she was not able to find her copy and applications for the volume at bookstores in Boston New York Philadelphia Albany and other places resulted only in failure search was instituted for the author herself This became a difficult task as her publishers in Philadelphia had retired from business many years ago however it was eventually discovered that her residence is at Wilmington Delaware and copies of the second edition of the book eighteen eighty nine were obtained from her She has since secured and forwarded to me a copy of the first edition The most generous and gratifying letters have been received from Miss Canby by Helen s friends a few extracts from which are given Under date of February twenty four eighteen ninety two after mentioning the order of the publication of the stories in the magazine she writes All the stories were revised before publishing them in book form additions were made to the number as first published I think and some of the titles may have been changed In the same letter she writes I hope that you will be able to make her understand that I am glad she enjoyed my story and that I hope the new book will give her pleasure by renewing her friendship with the Fairies I shall write to her in a short time I am so much impressed with what I have learned of her that I have written a little poem entitled A Silent Singer which I may send to her mother after a while Can you tell me in what paper the article appeared accusing Helen of plagiarism and giving passages from both stories I should like much to see it and to obtain a few copies if possible Under date of March nine eighteen ninety two Miss Canby writes I find traces in the Report which you so kindly sent me of little Helen having heard other stories than that of Frost Fairies On page one hundred thirty two in a letter there is a passage which must have been suggested by my story called The Rose Fairies see pp thirteen sixteen of Birdie and on pages ninety three and ninety four of the Report the description of a thunderstorm is very much like Birdie s idea of the same in the Dew Fairies on page fifty nine and sixty of my book What a wonderfully active and retentive mind that gifted child must have If she had remembered and written down accurately a short story and that soon after hearing it it would have been a marvel but to have heard the story once three years ago and in such a way that neither her parents nor teacher could ever allude to it or refresh her memory about it and then to have been able to reproduce it so vividly even adding some touches of her own in perfect keeping with the rest which really improve the original is something that very few girls of riper age and with every advantage of sight hearing and even great talents for composition could have done as well if at all Under the circumstances I do not see how any one can be so unkind as to call it a plagiarism it is a wonderful feat of memory and stands ALONE as doubtless much of her work will in future if her mental powers grow and develop with her years as greatly as in the few years past I have known many children well have been surrounded by them all my life and love nothing better than to talk with them amuse them and quietly notice their traits of mind and character but I do not recollect more than one girl of Helen s age who had the love and thirst for knowledge and the store of literary and general information and the skill in composition which Helen possesses She is indeed a Wonder Child Thank you very much for the Report Gazette and Helen s Journal The last made me realize the great disappointment to the dear child more than before Please give her my warm love and tell her not to feel troubled about it any more No one shall be allowed to think it was anything wrong and some day she will write a great beautiful story or poem that will make many people happy Tell her there are a few bitter drops in every one s cup and the only way is to take the bitter patiently and the sweet thankfully I shall love to hear of her reception of the book and how she likes the stories which are new to her I have now March eighteen ninety two read to Helen The Frost Fairies The Rose Fairies and a portion of The Dew Fairies but she is unable to throw any light on the matter She recognized them at once as her own stories with variations and was much puzzled to know how they could have been published before she was born She thinks it is wonderful that two people should write stories so much alike but she still considers her own as original I give below a portion of Miss Canby s story The Rose Fairies and also Helen s letter to mister Anagnos containing her dream so that the likenesses and differences may be studied by those interested in the subject THE ROSE FAIRIES From Birdie and his Fairy Friends by Margaret T Canby One pleasant morning little Birdie might have been seen sitting quietly on the grass plat at the side of his mother s house looking very earnestly at the rose bushes It was quite early great mister Sun who is such an early riser in summer time had not been up very long the birds were just beginning to chirp their good mornings to each other and as for the flowers they were still asleep But Birdie was so busy all day trotting about the house and garden that he was always ready for HIS nest at night before the birds and flowers had thought of seeking THEIRS and so it came to pass that when mister Sun raised his head above the green woods and smiled lovingly upon the earth Birdie was often the first to see him and to smile back at him all the while rubbing his eyes with his dimpled fists until between smiling and rubbing he was wide awake And what do you think he did next Why the little rogue rolled into his mamma s bed and kissed her eyelids her cheeks and her mouth until she began to dream that it was raining kisses and at last she opened her eyes to see what it all meant and found that it was Birdie trying to kiss her awake as he said She loved her little boy very dearly and liked to make him happy and when he said Please dress me dear mamma and let me go out to play in the garden she cheerfully consented and soon after Birdie went downstairs in his morning dress of cool linen and with his round face bright and rosy from its bath and ran out on the gravel path to play until breakfast was ready He stood still a moment to look about him and think what he should do first The fresh morning air blew softly in his face as if to welcome him and be his merry playmate and the bright eye of mister Sun looked at him with a warm and glowing smile but Birdie soon walked on to find something to play with As he came in sight of the rose bushes that grew near the side of the house he suddenly clapped his hands and with a little shout of joy stopped to look at them they were all covered with lovely rosebuds Some were red some white and others pale pink and they were just peeping out of the green leaves as rosy faced children peep out from their warm beds in wintertime before they are quite willing to get up A few days before Birdie s papa had told him that the green balls on the rose bushes had beautiful flowers shut up within them but the little boy found it hard to believe for he was so young that he did not remember how pretty the roses had been the summer before Now he found out that his father s words were true for a few days of warm weather had turned the green balls into rosebuds and they were SO beautiful that it was enough to make Birdie stand still before them his blue eyes dancing with delight and his little hands clasped tightly together After awhile he went nearer and looking closely at the buds found that they were folded up leaf over leaf as eyelids are folded over sleeping eyes so that Birdie thought they must be asleep Lazy roses wake up said he giving the branches a gentle shake but only the dew fell off in bright drops and the flowers were still shut up At last Birdie remembered how he had awakened his mother with kisses and thought he would try the same plan with the roses so he drew up his red lips until THEY looked like a rosebud too and bending down a branch with a lovely pink bud upon it he kissed it softly two or three times Here the similarity in the language of the story to that in the letter ceases HELEN S LETTER TO mister ANAGNOS Written February two and three eighteen ninety This letter was enclosed in another written in French dated Le one fevrier eighteen ninety My Dear mister Anagnos You will laugh when you open your little friend s letter and see all the queer mistakes she has made in French but I think you will be pleased to know that I can write even a short letter in French It makes me very happy to please you and my dear teacher I wish I could see your little niece Amelia I am sure we should love each other I hope you will bring some of Virginia Evanghelides poems home with you and translate them for me Teacher and I have just returned from our walk It is a beautiful day We met a sweet little child She was playing on the pier with a wee brother She gave me a kiss and then ran away because she was a shy little girl I wonder if you would like to have me tell you a pretty dream which I had a long time ago when I was a very little child Teacher says it was a day dream and she thinks you would be delighted to hear it One pleasant morning in the beautiful springtime I thought I was sitting on the soft grass under my dear mother s window looking very earnestly at the rose bushes which were growing all around me It was quite early the sun had not been up very long the birds were just beginning to sing joyously The flowers were still asleep They would not awake until the sun had smiled lovingly upon them I was a very happy little child with rosy cheeks and large blue eyes and the most beautiful golden ringlets you can imagine The fresh morning air blew gently in my face as if to welcome me and be my merry playmate and the sun looked at me with a warm and tender smile I clapped my chubby hands for joy when I saw that the rose bushes were covered with lovely buds Some were red some white and others were delicate pink and they were peeping out from between the green leaves like beautiful little fairies I had never seen anything so lovely before for I was very young and I could not remember how pretty the roses had been the summer before My little heart was filled with a sweet joy and I danced around the rosebushes to show my delight After a while I went very near to a beautiful white rose bush which was completely covered with buds and sparkling with dewdrops I bent down one of the branches with a lovely pure white bud upon it and kissed it softly many times just then I felt two loving arms steal gently around me and loving lips kissing my eyelids my cheeks and my mouth until I began to think it was raining kisses and at last I opened my eyes to see what it all meant and found it was my precious mother who was bending over me trying to kiss me awake Do you like my day dream If you do perhaps I will dream again for you some time Teacher and all of your friends send you their love I shall be so glad when you come home for I greatly miss you Please give my love to your good Greek friends and tell them that I shall come to Athens some day Lovingly your little friend and playmate HELEN A KELLER The Frost Fairies and The Frost Kings are given in full as the differences are as important as the resemblances The Frost Fairies From Birdie and his Fairy Friends by Margaret T Canby King Frost or Jack Frost as he is sometimes called lives in a cold country far to the North but every year he takes a journey over the world in a car of golden clouds drawn by a strong and rapid steed called North Wind Wherever he goes he does many wonderful things he builds bridges over every stream clear as glass in appearance but often strong as iron he puts the flowers and plants to sleep by one touch of his hand and they all bow down and sink into the warm earth until spring returns then lest we should grieve for the flowers he places at our windows lovely wreaths and sprays of his white northern flowers or delicate little forests of fairy pine trees pure white and very beautiful But his most wonderful work is the painting of the trees which look after his task is done as if they were covered with the brightest layers of gold and rubies and are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer I will tell you how King Frost first thought of this kind work for it is a strange story You must know that this King like all other kings has great treasures of gold and precious stones in his palace but being a good hearted old fellow he does not keep his riches locked up all the time but tries to do good and make others happy with them He has two neighbours who live still farther north one is King Winter a cross and churlish old monarch who is hard and cruel and delights in making the poor suffer and weep but the other neighbour is Santa Claus a fine good natured jolly old soul who loves to do good and who brings presents to the poor and to nice little children at Christmas Well one day King Frost was trying to think of some good that he could do with his treasure and suddenly he concluded to send some of it to his kind neighbour Santa Claus to buy presents of food and clothing for the poor that they might not suffer so much when King Winter went near their homes So he called together his merry little fairies and showing them a number of jars and vases filled with gold and precious stones told them to carry those carefully to the palace of Santa Claus and give them to him with the compliments of King Frost He will know how to make good use of the treasure added Jack Frost then he told the fairies not to loiter by the way but to do his bidding quickly The fairies promised obedience and soon started on their journey dragging the great glass jars and vases along as well as they could and now and then grumbling a little at having such hard work to do for they were idle fairies and liked play better than work At last they reached a great forest and being quite tired they decided to rest awhile and look for nuts before going any further But lest the treasure should be stolen from them they hid the jars among the thick leaves of the forest trees placing some high up near the top and others in different parts of the various trees until they thought no one could find them Then they began to wander about and hunt for nuts and climb the trees to shake them down and worked much harder for their own pleasure than they had done for their master s bidding for it is a strange truth that fairies and children never complain of the toil and trouble they take in search of amusement although they often grumble when asked to work for the good of others The frost fairies were so busy and so merry over their nutting frolic that they soon forgot their errand and their king s command to go quickly but as they played and loitered in the forest until noon they found the reason why they were told to hasten for although they had as they thought hidden the treasure so carefully they had not secured it from the power of mister Sun who was an enemy of Jack Frost and delighted to undo his work and weaken him whenever he could His bright eyes found out the jars of treasure among the trees and as the idle fairies left them there until noon at which time mister Sun is the strongest the delicate glass began to melt and break and before long every jar and vase was cracked or broken and the precious treasures they contained were melting too and dripping slowly in streams of gold and crimson over the trees and bushes of the forest Still for awhile the frost fairies did not notice this strange occurrence for they were down on the grass so far below the tree tops that the wonderful shower of treasure was a long time in reaching them but at last one of them said Hark I believe it is raining I certainly hear the falling drops The others laughed and told him that it seldom rained when the sun was shining but as they listened they plainly heard the tinkling of many drops falling through the forest and sliding from leaf to leaf until they reached the bramble bushes beside them when to their great dismay they found that the RAIN DROPS were MELTED RUBIES which hardened on the leaves and turned them to bright crimson in a moment Then looking more closely at the trees around they saw that the treasure was all melting away and that much of it was already spread over the leaves of the oak trees and maples which were shining with their gorgeous dress of gold and bronze crimson and emerald It was very beautiful but the idle fairies were too much frightened at the mischief their disobedience had caused to admire the beauty of the forest and at once tried to hide themselves among the bushes lest King Frost should come and punish them Their fears were well founded for their long absence had alarmed the king and he had started out to look for his tardy servants and just as they were all hidden he came along slowly looking on all sides for the fairies Of course he soon noticed the brightness of the leaves and discovered the cause too when he caught sight of the broken jars and vases from which the melted treasure was still dropping And when he came to the nut trees and saw the shells left by the idle fairies and all the traces of their frolic he knew exactly how they had acted and that they had disobeyed him by playing and loitering on their way through the woods King Frost frowned and looked very angry at first and his fairies trembled for fear and cowered still lower in their hiding places but just then two little children came dancing through the wood and though they did not see King Frost or the fairies they saw the beautiful colour of the leaves and laughed with delight and began picking great bunches to take to their mother The leaves are as pretty as flowers said they and they called the golden leaves buttercups and the red ones roses and were very happy as they went singing through the wood Their pleasure charmed away King Frost s anger and he too began to admire the painted trees and at last he said to himself My treasures are not wasted if they make little children happy I will not be offended at my idle thoughtless fairies for they have taught me a new way of doing good When the frost fairies heard these words they crept one by one from their corners and kneeling down before their master confessed their fault and asked his pardon He frowned upon them for awhile and scolded them too but he soon relented and said he would forgive them this time and would only punish them by making them carry more treasure to the forest and hide it in the trees until all the leaves with mister Sun s help were covered with gold and ruby coats Then the fairies thanked him for his forgiveness and promised to work very hard to please him and the good natured king took them all up in his arms and carried them safely home to his palace From that time I suppose it has been part of Jack Frost s work to paint the trees with the glowing colours we see in the autumn and if they are NOT covered with gold and precious stones I do not know how he makes them so bright DO YOU The Frost King by Helen A Keller King Frost lives in a beautiful palace far to the North in the land of perpetual snow The palace which is magnificent beyond description was built centuries ago in the reign of King Glacier At a little distance from the palace we might easily mistake it for a mountain whose peaks were mounting heavenward to receive the last kiss of the departing day But on nearer approach we should discover our error What we had supposed to be peaks were in reality a thousand glittering spires Nothing could be more beautiful than the architecture of this ice palace The walls are curiously constructed of massive blocks of ice which terminate in cliff like towers The entrance to the palace is at the end of an arched recess and it is guarded night and day by twelve soldierly looking white Bears But children you must make King Frost a visit the very first opportunity you have and see for yourselves this wonderful palace The old King will welcome you kindly for he loves children and it is his chief delight to give them pleasure You must know that King Frost like all other kings has great treasures of gold and precious stones but as he is a generous old monarch he endeavours to make a right use of his riches So wherever he goes he does many wonderful works he builds bridges over every stream as transparent as glass but often as strong as iron he shakes the forest trees until the ripe nuts fall into the laps of laughing children he puts the flowers to sleep with one touch of his hand then lest we should mourn for the bright faces of the flowers he paints the leaves with gold and crimson and emerald and when his task is done the trees are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer I will tell you how King Frost happened to think of painting the leaves for it is a strange story One day while King Frost was surveying his vast wealth and thinking what good he could do with it he suddenly bethought him of his jolly old neighbour Santa Claus I will send my treasures to Santa Claus said the King to himself He is the very man to dispose of them satisfactorily for he knows where the poor and the unhappy live and his kind old heart is always full of benevolent plans for their relief So he called together the merry little fairies of his household and showing them the jars and vases containing his treasures he bade them carry them to the palace of Santa Claus as quickly as they could The fairies promised obedience and were off in a twinkling dragging the heavy jars and vases along after them as well as they could now and then grumbling a little at having such a hard task for they were idle fairies and loved to play better than to work After awhile they came to a great forest and being tired and hungry they thought they would rest a little and look for nuts before continuing their journey But thinking their treasure might be stolen from them they hid the jars among the thick green leaves of the various trees until they were sure that no one could find them Then they began to wander merrily about searching for nuts climbing trees peeping curiously into the empty birds nests and playing hide and seek from behind the trees Now these naughty fairies were so busy and so merry over their frolic that they forgot all about their errand and their master s command to go quickly but soon they found to their dismay why they had been bidden to hasten for although they had as they supposed hidden the treasure carefully yet the bright eyes of King Sun had spied out the jars among the leaves and as he and King Frost could never agree as to what was the best way of benefiting the world he was very glad of a good opportunity of playing a joke upon his rather sharp rival King Sun laughed softly to himself when the delicate jars began to melt and break At length every jar and vase was cracked or broken and the precious stones they contained were melting too and running in little streams over the trees and bushes of the forest Still the idle fairies did not notice what was happening for they were down on the grass and the wonderful shower of treasure was a long time in reaching them but at last they plainly heard the tinkling of many drops falling like rain through the forest and sliding from leaf to leaf until they reached the little bushes by their side when to their astonishment they discovered that the rain drops were melted rubies which hardened on the leaves and turned them to crimson and gold in a moment Then looking around more closely they saw that much of the treasure was already melted for the oaks and maples were arrayed in gorgeous dresses of gold and crimson and emerald It was very beautiful but the disobedient fairies were too frightened to notice the beauty of the trees They were afraid that King Frost would come and punish them So they hid themselves among the bushes and waited silently for something to happen Their fears were well founded for their long absence had alarmed the King and he mounted North Wind and went out in search of his tardy couriers Of course he had not gone far when he noticed the brightness of the leaves and he quickly guessed the cause when he saw the broken jars from which the treasure was still dropping At first King Frost was very angry and the fairies trembled and crouched lower in their hiding places and I do not know what might have happened to them if just then a party of boys and girls had not entered the wood When the children saw the trees all aglow with brilliant colors they clapped their hands and shouted for joy and immediately began to pick great bunches to take home The leaves are as lovely as the flowers cried they in their delight Their pleasure banished the anger from King Frost s heart and the frown from his brow and he too began to admire the painted trees He said to himself My treasures are not wasted if they make little children happy My idle fairies and my fiery enemy have taught me a new way of doing good When the fairies heard this they were greatly relieved and came forth from their hiding places confessed their fault and asked their master s forgiveness Ever since that time it has been King Frost s great delight to paint the leaves with the glowing colors we see in the autumn and if they are not covered with gold and precious stones I cannot imagine what makes them so bright can you If the story of The Frost Fairies was read to Helen in the summer of eighteen eighty eight she could not have understood very much of it at that time for she had only been under instruction since March eighteen eighty seven Can it be that the language of the story had remained dormant in her mind until my description of the beauty of the autumn scenery in eighteen ninety one brought it vividly before her mental vision I have made careful investigation among Helen s friends in Alabama and in Boston and its vicinity but thus far have been unable to ascertain any later date when it could have been read to her Another fact is of great significance in this connection The Rose Fairies was published in the same volume with The Frost Fairies and therefore was probably read to Helen at or about the same time Now Helen in her letter of February eighteen ninety quoted above alludes to this story of Miss Canby s as a dream WHICH I HAD A LONG TIME AGO WHEN I WAS A VERY LITTLE CHILD Surely a year and a half would appear a long time ago to a little girl like Helen we therefore have reason to believe that the stories must have been read to her at least as early as the summer of eighteen eighty eight HELEN KELLER S OWN STATEMENT The following entry made by Helen in her diary speaks for itself eighteen ninety two January thirty This morning I took a bath and when teacher came upstairs to comb my hair she told me some very sad news which made me unhappy all day Some one wrote to mister Anagnos that the story which I sent him as a birthday gift and which I wrote myself was not my story at all but that a lady had written it a long time ago The person said her story was called Frost Fairies I am sure I never heard it It made us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and wicked My heart was full of tears for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart and mind It troubles me greatly now I do not know what I shall do I never thought that people could make such mistakes I am perfectly sure I wrote the story myself mister Anagnos is much troubled It grieves me to think that I have been the cause of his unhappiness but of course I did not mean to do it I thought about my story in the autumn because teacher told me about the autumn leaves while we walked in the woods at Fern Quarry I thought fairies must have painted them because they are so wonderful and I thought too that King Frost must have jars and vases containing precious treasures because I knew that other kings long ago had and because teacher told me that the leaves were painted ruby emerald gold crimson and brown so that I thought the paint must be melted stones I knew that they must make children happy because they are so lovely and it made me very happy to think that the leaves were so beautiful and that the trees glowed so although I could not see them I thought everybody had the same thought about the leaves but I do not know now I thought very much about the sad news when teacher went to the doctor s she was not here at dinner and I missed her I do not feel that I can add anything more that will be of interest My own heart is too full of tears when I remember how my dear little pupil suffered when she knew that people thought we had been untrue and wicked for I know that she does indeed love the beautiful truth with her whole heart and mind Yours truly ANNIE M SULLIVAN So much appears in the Volta Bureau Souvenir The following letter from mister Anagnos is reprinted from the American Annals of the Deaf April eighteen ninety two PERKINS INSTITUTION AND MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND SO BOSTON March eleven eighteen ninety two TO THE EDITOR OF THE ANNALS Sir In compliance with your wishes I make the following statement concerning Helen Keller s story of King Frost It was sent to me as a birthday gift on November seventh from Tuscumbia Alabama Knowing as well as I do Helen s extraordinary abilities I did not hesitate to accept it as her own work nor do I doubt to day that she is fully capable of writing such a composition Soon after its appearance in print I was pained to learn through the Goodson Gazette that a portion of the story eight or nine passages is either a reproduction or adaptation of Miss Margaret Canby s Frost Fairies I immediately instituted an inquiry to ascertain the facts in the case None of our teachers or officers who are accustomed to converse with Helen ever knew or heard about Miss Canby s book nor did the child s parents and relatives at home have any knowledge of it Her father Captain Keller wrote to me as follows on the subject I hasten to assure you that Helen could not have received any idea of the story from any of her relations or friends here none of whom can communicate with her readily enough to impress her with the details of a story of that character At my request one of the teachers in the girls department examined Helen in regard to the construction of the story Her testimony is as follows I first tried to ascertain what had suggested to Helen s mind the particular fancies which made her story seem like a reproduction of one written by Miss Margaret Canby Helen told me that for a long time she had thought of Jack Frost as a king because of the many treasures which he possessed Such rich treasures must be kept in a safe place and so she had imagined them stored in jars and vases in one part of the royal palace She said that one autumn day her teacher told her as they were walking together in the woods about the many beautiful colours of the leaves and she had thought that such beauty must make people very happy and very grateful to King Frost I asked Helen what stories she had read about Jack Frost In answer to my question she recited a part of the poem called Freaks of the Frost and she referred to a little piece about winter in one of the school readers She could not remember that any one had ever read to her any stories about King Frost but said she had talked with her teacher about Jack Frost and the wonderful things he did The only person that we supposed might possibly have read the story to Helen was her friend missus Hopkins whom she was visiting at the time in Brewster I asked Miss Sullivan to go at once to see missus Hopkins and ascertain the facts in the matter The result of her investigation is embodied in the printed note herewith enclosed This note is a statement of the bare facts and an apology which mister Anagnos inserted in his report of the Perkins Institute I have scarcely any doubt that Miss Canby s little book was read to Helen by missus Hopkins in the summer of eighteen eighty eight But the child has no recollection whatever of this fact On Miss Sullivan s return to Brewster she read to Helen the story of Little Lord Fauntleroy which she had purchased in Boston for the purpose The child was at once fascinated and absorbed with the charming story which evidently made a deeper impression upon her mind than any previously read to her as was shown in the frequent reference to it both in her conversation and letters for many months afterward Her intense interest in Fauntleroy must have buried all remembrance of Frost Fairies and when more than three years later she had acquired a fuller knowledge and use of language and was told of Jack Frost and his work the seed so long buried sprang up into new thoughts and fancies This may explain the reason why Helen claims persistently that The Frost King is her own story She seems to have some idea of the difference between original composition and reproduction She did not know the meaning of the word plagiarism until quite recently when it was explained to her She is absolutely truthful Veracity is the strongest element of her character She was very much surprised and grieved when she was told that her composition was an adaptation of Miss Canby s story of Frost Fairies She could not keep back her tears and the chief cause of her pain seemed to be the fear lest people should doubt her truthfulness She said with great intensity of feeling I love the beautiful truth A most rigid examination of the child of about two hours duration at which eight persons were present and asked all sorts of questions with perfect freedom failed to elicit in the least any testimony convicting either her teacher or any one else of the intention or attempt to practice deception In view of these facts I cannot but think that Helen while writing The Frost King was entirely unconscious of ever having had the story of Frost Fairies read to her and that her memory has been accompanied by such a loss of associations that she herself honestly believed her composition to be original This theory is shared by many persons who are perfectly well acquainted with the child and who are able to rise above the clouds of a narrow prejudice Very sincerely yours M ANAGNOS Director of the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts School for the Blind The episode had a deadening effect on Helen Keller and on Miss Sullivan who feared that she had allowed the habit of imitation which has in truth made Miss Keller a writer to go too far Even to day when Miss Keller strikes off a fine phrase Miss Sullivan says in humorous despair I wonder where she got that But she knows now since she has studied with her pupil in college the problems of composition under the wise advice of mister Charles T Copeland that the style of every writer and indeed of every human being illiterate or cultivated is a composite reminiscence of all that he has read and heard Of the sources of his vocabulary he is for the most part as unaware as he is of the moment when he ate the food which makes a bit of his thumbnail With most of us the contributions from different sources are blended crossed and confused A child with but few sources may keep distinct what he draws from each In this case Helen Keller held almost intact in her mind unmixed with other ideas the words of a story which at the time it was read to her she did not fully understand The importance of this cannot be overestimated It shows how the child mind gathers into itself words it has heard and how they lurk there ready to come out when the key that releases the spring is touched The reason that we do not observe this process in ordinary children is because we seldom observe them at all and because they are fed from so many sources that the memories are confused and mutually destructive The story of The Frost King did not however come from Helen Keller s mind intact but had taken to itself the mould of the child s temperament and had drawn on a vocabulary that to some extent had been supplied in other ways The style of her version is in some respects even better than the style of Miss Canby s story It has the imaginative credulity of a primitive folktale whereas Miss Canby s story is evidently told for children by an older person who adopts the manner of a fairy tale and cannot conceal the mature mood which allows such didactic phrases as Jack Frost as he is sometimes called Noon at which time mister Sun is strongest Most people will feel the superior imaginative quality of Helen Keller s opening paragraph Surely the writer must become as a little child to see things like that Twelve soldierly looking white bears is a stroke of genius and there is beauty of rhythm throughout the child s narrative It is original in the same way that a poet s version of an old story is original This little story calls into life all the questions of language and the philosophy of style Some conclusions may be briefly suggested All use of language is imitative and one s style is made up of all other styles that one has met The way to write good English is to read it and hear it Thus it is that any child may be taught to use correct English by not being allowed to read or hear any other kind In a child the selection of the better from the worse is not conscious he is the servant of his word experience The ordinary man will never be rid of the fallacy that words obey thought that one thinks first and phrases afterward There must first it is true be the intention the desire to utter something but the idea does not often become specific does not take shape until it is phrased certainly an idea is a different thing by virtue of being phrased Words often make the thought and the master of words will say things greater than are in him A remarkable example is a paragraph from Miss Keller s sketch in the Youth s Companion Writing of the moment when she learned that everything has a name she says We met the nurse carrying my little cousin and teacher spelled baby AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I was impressed with the smallness and helplessness of a little baby and mingled with the thought there was another one of myself and I was glad I was myself and not a baby It was a word that created these thoughts in her mind So the master of words is master of thoughts which the words create and says things greater than he could otherwise know Helen Keller writing The Frost King was building better than she knew and saying more than she meant Whoever makes a sentence of words utters not his wisdom but the wisdom of the race whose life is in the words though they have never been so grouped before The man who can write stories thinks of stories to write The medium calls forth the thing it conveys and the greater the medium the deeper the thoughts The educated man is the man whose expression is educated The substance of thought is language and language is the one thing to teach the deaf child and every other child Let him get language and he gets the very stuff that language is made of the thought and the experience of his race The language must be one used by a nation not an artificial thing Volapuk is a paradox unless one has French or English or German or some other language that has grown up in a nation The deaf child who has only the sign language of De l Epee is an intellectual Philip Nolan an alien from all races and his thoughts are not the thoughts of an Englishman or a Frenchman or a Spaniard The Lord s prayer in signs is not the Lord s prayer in English In his essay on style De Quincey says that the best English is to be found in the letters of the cultivated gentlewoman because she has read only a few good books and has not been corrupted by the style of newspapers and the jargon of street market place and assembly hall Precisely these outward circumstances account for Helen Keller s use of English In the early years of her education she had only good things to read some were indeed trivial and not excellent in style but not one was positively bad in manner or substance This happy condition has obtained throughout her life She has been nurtured on imaginative literature and she has gathered from it into her vigorous and tenacious memory the style of great writers A new word opens its heart to me she writes in a letter and when she uses the word its heart is still open When she was twelve years old she was asked what book she would take on a long railroad journey Paradise Lost she answered and she read it on the train Until the last year or two she has not been master of her style rather has her style been master of her It is only since she has made composition a more conscious study that she has ceased to be the victim of the phrase the lucky victim fortunately of the good phrase When in eighteen ninety two she was encouraged to write a sketch of her life for the Youth s Companion in the hope that it would reassure her and help her to recover from the effect of The Frost King she produced a piece of composition which is much more remarkable and in itself more entertaining at some points than the corresponding part of her story in this book When she came to retell the story in a fuller form the echo was still in her mind of the phrases she had written nine years before Yet she had not seen her sketch in the Youth s Companion since she wrote it except two passages which Miss Sullivan read to her to remind her of things she should say in this autobiography and to show her when her phrasing troubled her how much better she did as a little girl From the early sketch I take a few passages which seem to me without making very much allowance for difference in time almost as good as anything she has written since I discovered the true way to walk when I was a year old and during the radiant summer days that followed I was never still a minute Then when my father came in the evening I would run to the gate to meet him and he would take me up in his strong arms and put back the tangled curls from my face and kiss me many times saying What has my Little Woman been doing to day But the brightest summer has winter behind it In the cold dreary month of February when I was nineteen months old I had a serious illness I still have confused memories of that illness My mother sat beside my little bed and tried to soothe my feverish moans while in her troubled heart she prayed Father in Heaven spare my baby s life But the fever grew and flamed in my eyes and for several days my kind physician thought I would die But early one morning the fever left me as mysteriously and unexpectedly as it had come and I fell into a quiet sleep Then my parents knew I would live and they were very happy They did not know for some time after my recovery that the cruel fever had taken my sight and hearing taken all the light and music and gladness out of my little life But I was too young to realize what had happened When I awoke and found that all was dark and still I suppose I thought it was night and I must have wondered why day was so long coming Gradually however I got used to the silence and darkness that surrounded me and forgot that it had ever been day I forgot everything that had been except my mother s tender love Soon even my childish voice was stilled because I had ceased to hear any sound But all was not lost After all sight and hearing are but two of the beautiful blessings which God had given me The most precious the most wonderful of His gifts was still mine My mind remained clear and active though fled fore er the light As soon as my strength returned I began to take an interest in what the people around me were doing I would cling to my mother s dress as she went about her household duties and my little hands felt every object and observed every motion and in this way I learned a great many things When I was a little older I felt the need of some means of communication with those around me and I began to make simple signs which my parents and friends readily understood but it often happened that I was unable to express my thoughts intelligibly and at such times I would give way to my angry feelings utterly Teacher had been with me nearly two weeks and I had learned eighteen or twenty words before that thought flashed into my mind as the sun breaks upon the sleeping world and in that moment of illumination the secret of language was revealed to me and I caught a glimpse of the beautiful country I was about to explore Teacher had been trying all the morning to make me understand that the mug and the milk in the mug had different names but I was very dull and kept spelling MILK for mug and mug for milk until teacher must have lost all hope of making me see my mistake At last she got up gave me the mug and led me out of the door to the pump house Some one was pumping water and as the cool fresh stream burst forth teacher made me put my mug under the spout and spelled w a t e r Water That word startled my soul and it awoke full of the spirit of the morning full of joyous exultant song Until that day my mind had been like a darkened chamber waiting for words to enter and light the lamp which is thought I learned a great many words that day I do not remember what they all were but I do know that MOTHER FATHER SISTER and TEACHER were among them It would have been difficult to find a happier little child than I was that night as I lay in my crib and thought over the joy the day had brought me and for the first time longed for a new day to come The next morning I awoke with joy in my heart Everything I touched seemed to quiver with life It was because I saw everything with the new strange beautiful sight which had been given me I was never angry after that because I understood what my friends said to me and I was very busy learning many wonderful things I was never still during the first glad days of my freedom I was continually spelling and acting out the words as I spelled them I would run skip jump and swing no matter where I happened to be Everything was budding and blossoming The honeysuckle hung in long garlands deliciously fragrant and the roses had never been so beautiful before Teacher and I lived out of doors from morning until night and I rejoiced greatly in the forgotten light and sunshine found again The morning after our arrival I awoke bright and early A beautiful summer day had dawned the day on which I was to make the acquaintance of a somber and mysterious friend I got up and dressed quickly and ran downstairs I met Teacher in the hall and begged to be taken to the sea at once Not yet she responded laughing We must have breakfast first As soon as breakfast was over we hurried off to the shore Our pathway led through low sandy hills and as we hastened on I often caught my feet in the long coarse grass and tumbled laughing in the warm shining sand The beautiful warm air was peculiarly fragrant and I noticed it got cooler and fresher as we went on Suddenly we stopped and I knew without being told the Sea was at my feet I knew too it was immense awful and for a moment some of the sunshine seemed to have gone out of the day But I do not think I was afraid for later when I had put on my bathing suit and the little waves ran up on the beach and kissed my feet I shouted for joy and plunged fearlessly into the surf But unfortunately I struck my foot on a rock and fell forward into the cold water Then a strange fearful sense of danger terrified me The salt water filled my eyes and took away my breath and a great wave threw me up on the beach as easily as if I had been a little pebble For several days after that I was very timid and could hardly be persuaded to go in the water at all but by degrees my courage returned and almost before the summer was over I thought it the greatest fun to be tossed about by the sea waves I do not know whether the difference or the similarity in phrasing between the child s version and the woman s is the more remarkable The early story is simpler and shows less deliberate artifice though even then Miss Keller was prematurely conscious of style but the art of the later narrative as in the passage about the sea or the passage on the medallion of Homer is surely a fulfilment of the promise of the early story It was in these early days that doctor Holmes wrote to her I am delighted with the style of your letters There is no affectation about them and as they come straight from your heart so they go straight to mine In the years when she was growing out of childhood her style lost its early simplicity and became stiff and as she says periwigged In these years the fear came many times to Miss Sullivan lest the success of the child was to cease with childhood At times Miss Keller seemed to lack flexibility her thoughts ran in set phrases which she seemed to have no power to revise or turn over in new ways Then came the work in college original theme writing with new ideals of composition or at least new methods of suggesting those ideals Miss Keller began to get the better of her old friendly taskmaster the phrase This book her first mature experiment in writing settles the question of her ability to write The style of the Bible is everywhere in Miss Keller s work just as it is in the style of most great English writers Stevenson whom Miss Sullivan likes and used to read to her pupil is another marked influence In her autobiography are many quotations chiefly from the Bible and Stevenson distinct from the context or interwoven with it the whole a fabric quite of her own design Her vocabulary has all the phrases that other people use and the explanation of it and the reasonableness of it ought to be evident by this time There is no reason why she should strike from her vocabulary all words of sound and vision Writing for other people she should in many cases be true to outer fact rather than to her own experience So long as she uses words correctly she should be granted the privilege of using them freely and not be expected to confine herself to a vocabulary true to her lack of sight and hearing In her style as in what she writes about we must concede to the artist what we deny to the autobiographer It should be explained too that LOOK and SEE are used by the blind and HEAR by the deaf for PERCEIVE they are simple and more convenient words Only a literal person could think of holding the blind to PERCEPTION or APPERCEPTION when SEEING and LOOKING are so much easier and have moreover in the speech of all men the meaning of intellectual recognition as well as recognition through the sense of sight When Miss Keller examines a statue she says in her natural idiom as her fingers run over the marble It looks like a head of Flora It is true on the other hand that in her descriptions she is best from the point of view of art when she is faithful to her own sensations and this is precisely true of all artists Her recent training has taught her to drop a good deal of her conventionality and to write about experiences in her life which are peculiar to her and which like the storm in the wild cherry tree mean most and call for the truest phrasing She has learned more and more to give up the style she borrowed from books and tried to use because she wanted to write like other people she has learned that she is at her best when she feels the lilies sway lets the roses press into her hands and speaks of the heat which to her means light Miss Keller s autobiography contains almost everything that she ever intended to publish It seems worth while however to quote from some of her chance bits of writing which are neither so informal as her letters nor so carefully composed as her story of her life These extracts are from her exercises in her course in composition where she showed herself at the beginning of her college life quite without rival among her classmates mister Charles T Copeland who has been for many years instructor in English and Lecturer on English Literature at Harvard and Radcliffe said to me In some of her work she has shown that she can write better than any pupil I ever had man or woman She has an excellent ear for the flow of sentences The extracts follow A few verses of Omar Khayyam s poetry have just been read to me and I feel as if I had spent the last half hour in a magnificent sepulcher Yes it is a tomb in which hope joy and the power of acting nobly lie buried Every beautiful description every deep thought glides insensibly into the same mournful chant of the brevity of life of the slow decay and dissolution of all earthly things The poet s bright fond memories of love youth and beauty are but the funeral torches shedding their light on this tomb or to modify the image a little they are the flowers that bloom on it watered with tears and fed by a bleeding heart Beside the tomb sits a weary soul rejoicing neither in the joys of the past nor in the possibilities of the future but seeking consolation in forgetfulness In vain the inspiring sea shouts to this languid soul in vain the heavens strive with its weakness it still persists in regretting and seeks a refuge in oblivion from the pangs of present woe At times it catches some faint echo from the living joyous real world a gleam of the perfection that is to be and thrilled out of its despondency feels capable of working out a grand ideal even in the poor miserable hampered actual wherein it is placed but in a moment the inspiration the vision is gone and this great much suffering soul is again enveloped in the darkness of uncertainty and despair It is wonderful how much time good people spend fighting the devil If they would only expend the same amount of energy loving their fellow men the devil would die in his own tracks of ennui I often think that beautiful ideas embarrass most people as much as the company of great men They are regarded generally as far more appropriate in books and in public discourses than in the parlor or at the table Of course I do not refer to beautiful sentiments but to the higher truths relating to everyday life Few people that I know seem ever to pause in their daily intercourse to wonder at the beautiful bits of truth they have gathered during their years of study Often when I speak enthusiastically of something in history or in poetry I receive no response and I feel that I must change the subject and return to the commonest topics such as the weather dressmaking sports sickness blues and worries To be sure I take the keenest interest in everything that concerns those who surround me it is this very interest which makes it so difficult for me to carry on a conversation with some people who will not talk or say what they think but I should not be sorry to find more friends ready to talk with me now and then about the wonderful things I read We need not be like Les Femmes Savantes but we ought to have something to say about what we learn as well as about what we MUST do and what our professors say or how they mark our themes To day I took luncheon with the Freshman Class of Radcliffe This was my first real experience in college life and a delightful experience it was For the first time since my entrance into Radcliffe I had the opportunity to make friends with all my classmates and the pleasure of knowing that they regarded me as one of themselves instead of thinking of me as living apart and taking no interest in the everyday nothings of their life as I had sometimes feared they did I have often been surprised to hear this opinion expressed or rather implied by girls of my own age and even by people advanced in years Once some one wrote to me that in his mind I was always sweet and earnest thinking only of what is wise good and interesting as if he thought I was one of those wearisome saints of whom there are only too many in the world I always laugh at these foolish notions and assure my friends that it is much better to have a few faults and be cheerful and responsive in spite of all deprivations than to retire into one s shell pet one s affliction clothe it with sanctity and then set one s self up as a monument of patience virtue goodness and all in all but even while I laugh I feel a twinge of pain in my heart because it seems rather hard to me that any one should imagine that I do not feel the tender bonds which draw me to my young sisters the sympathies springing from what we have in common youth hope a half eager half timid attitude towards the life before us and above all the royalty of maidenhood Sainte Beuve says Il vient un age peut etre quand on n ecrit plus This is the only allusion I have read to the possibility that the sources of literature varied and infinite as they seem now may sometime be exhausted It surprises me to find that such an idea has crossed the mind of any one especially of a highly gifted critic The very fact that the nineteenth century has not produced many authors whom the world may count among the greatest of all time does not in my opinion justify the remark There may come a time when people cease to write In the first place the fountains of literature are fed by two vast worlds one of action one of thought by a succession of creations in the one and of changes in the other New experiences and events call forth new ideas and stir men to ask questions unthought of before and seek a definite answer in the depths of human knowledge In the second place if it is true that as many centuries must pass before the world becomes perfect as passed before it became what it is to day literature will surely be enriched incalculably by the tremendous changes acquisitions and improvements that cannot fail to take place in the distant future If genius has been silent for a century it has not been idle On the contrary it has been collecting fresh materials not only from the remote past but also from the age of progress and development and perhaps in the new century there will be outbursts of splendor in all the various branches of literature At present the world is undergoing a complete revolution and in the midst of falling systems and empires conflicting theories and creeds discoveries and inventions it is a marvel how one can produce any great literary works at all This is an age of workers not of thinkers The song to day is Let the dead past bury its dead Act act in the living present Heart within and God overhead A little later when the rush and heat of achievement relax we can begin to expect the appearance of grand men to celebrate in glorious poetry and prose the deeds and triumphs of the last few centuries It is very interesting to watch a plant grow it is like taking part in creation When all outside is cold and white when the little children of the woodland are gone to their nurseries in the warm earth and the empty nests on the bare trees fill with snow my window garden glows and smiles making summer within while it is winter without It is wonderful to see flowers bloom in the midst of a snow storm I have felt a bud shyly doff her green hood and blossom with a silken burst of sound while the icy fingers of the snow beat against the window panes What secret power I wonder caused this blossoming miracle What mysterious force guided the seedling from the dark earth up to the light through leaf and stem and bud to glorious fulfilment in the perfect flower Who could have dreamed that such beauty lurked in the dark earth was latent in the tiny seed we planted Beautiful flower you have taught me to see a little way into the hidden heart of things Now I understand that the darkness everywhere may hold possibilities better even than my hopes A FREE TRANSLATION FROM HORACE BOOK II eighteen I am not one of those on whom fortune deigns to smile My house is not resplendent with ivory and gold nor is it adorned with marble arches resting on graceful columns brought from the quarries of distant Africa For me no thrifty spinners weave purple garments I have not unexpectedly fallen heir to princely estates titles or power but I have something more to be desired than all the world s treasures the love of my friends and honorable fame won by my own industry and talents Despite my poverty it is my privilege to be the companion of the rich and mighty I am too grateful for all these blessings to wish for more from princes or from the gods My little Sabine farm is dear to me for here I spend my happiest days far from the noise and strife of the world O ye who live in the midst of luxury who seek beautiful marbles for new villas that shall surpass the old in splendor you never dream that the shadow of death is hanging over your halls Forgetful of the tomb you lay the foundation of your palaces In your mad pursuit of pleasure you rob the sea of its beach and desecrate hallowed ground More even than this in your wickedness you destroy the peaceful homes of your clients Without a touch of remorse you drive the father from his land clasping to his bosom his household gods and his half naked children You forget that death comes to the rich and the poor alike and comes once for all but remember Acheron could not be bribed by gold to ferry the crafty Prometheus back to the sunlit world Tantalus too great as he was above all mortals went down to the kingdom of the dead never to return Remember too that although death is inexorable yet he is just for he brings retribution to the rich for their wickedness and gives the poor eternal rest from their toil and sorrow Ah the pranks that the nixies of Dreamland play on us while we sleep Methinks they are jesters at the Court of Heaven They frequently take the shape of daily themes to mock me they strut about on the stage of Sleep like foolish virgins only they carry well trimmed note books in their hands instead of empty lamps At other times they examine and cross examine me in all the studies I have ever had and invariably ask me questions as easy to answer as this What was the name of the first mouse that worried Hippopotamus satrap of Cambridge under Astyagas grandfather of Cyrus the Great I wake terror stricken with the words ringing in my ears An answer or your life Such are the distorted fancies that flit through the mind of one who is at college and lives as I do in an atmosphere of ideas conceptions and half thoughts half feelings which tumble and jostle each other until one is almost crazy I rarely have dreams that are not in keeping with what I really think and feel but one night my very nature seemed to change and I stood in the eye of the world a mighty man and a terrible Naturally I love peace and hate war and all that pertains to war I see nothing admirable in the ruthless career of Napoleon save its finish Nevertheless in that dream the spirit of that pitiless slayer of men entered me I shall never forget how the fury of battle throbbed in my veins it seemed as if the tumultuous beating of my heart would stop my breath I rode a fiery hunter I can feel the impatient toss of his head now and the quiver that ran through him at the first roar of the cannon From the top of the hill where I stood I saw my army surging over a sunlit plain like angry breakers and as they moved I saw the green of fields like the cool hollows between billows Trumpet answered trumpet above the steady beat of drums and the rhythm of marching feet I spurred my panting steed and waving my sword on high and shouting I come Behold me warriors Europe I plunged into the oncoming billows as a strong swimmer dives into breakers and struck alas tis true the bedpost Now I rarely sleep without dreaming but before Miss Sullivan came to me my dreams were few and far between devoid of thought or coherency except those of a purely physical nature In my dreams something was always falling suddenly and heavily and at times my nurse seemed to punish me for my unkind treatment of her in the daytime and return at an usurer s rate of interest my kickings and pinchings I would wake with a start or struggle frantically to escape from my tormentor I was very fond of bananas and one night I dreamed that I found a long string of them in the dining room near the cupboard all peeled and deliciously ripe and all I had to do was to stand under the string and eat as long as I could eat After Miss Sullivan came to me the more I learned the oftener I dreamed but with the waking of my mind there came many dreary fancies and vague terrors which troubled my sleep for a long time I dreaded the darkness and loved the woodfire Its warm touch seemed so like a human caress I really thought it was a sentient being capable of loving and protecting me One cold winter night I was alone in my room Miss Sullivan had put out the light and gone away thinking I was sound asleep Suddenly I felt my bed shake and a wolf seemed to spring on me and snarl in my face It was only a dream but I thought it real and my heart sank within me I dared not scream and I dared not stay in bed Perhaps this was a confused recollection of the story I had heard not long before about Red Riding Hood At all events I slipped down from the bed and nestled close to the fire which had not flickered out The instant I felt its warmth I was reassured and I sat a long time watching it climb higher and higher in shining waves At last sleep surprised me and when Miss Sullivan returned she found me wrapped in a blanket by the hearth Often when I dream thoughts pass through my mind like cowled shadows silent and remote and disappear Perhaps they are the ghosts of thoughts that once inhabited the mind of an ancestor At other times the things I have learned and the things I have been taught drop away as the lizard sheds its skin and I see my soul as God sees it There are also rare and beautiful moments when I see and hear in Dreamland What if in my waking hours a sound should ring through the silent halls of hearing What if a ray of light should flash through the darkened chambers of my soul What would happen I ask many and many a time Would the bow and string tension of life snap Would the heart overweighted with sudden joy stop beating for very excess of happiness THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Story of My Life by Helen
